Men At Arms manages to be all these things and more . . .The misfit Night Watch we met in Guards, Guards! Is in danger of becoming almost respectable. Carrot and Sgt. Colon have new recruits of all shapes and sizes. Captain Vimes is retiring to become a respectable gentleman as Sybil Ramkin's husband. What could go wrong . . .Well, this IS Ankh-Morpork, a city so corrupt that if the gods took vengeance on it, no one would notice. Things get complicated when an exploding swamp dragon, a mysterious invention, warring guilds, and an assasin who is NOT killing for pay send the city into more turmoil than usual. Who can save the day? It's up to the flattest of flatfoots in the Night Watch, and their new recruits to set the city right, or at least not so wrong.There is the usual Pratchett wordplay and humor, as well as the thoughtful emotional interplays he has developed over the years. There's also an interesting mystery at the center of the whole piece, and some of his most interesting characters trying to deal with it. There are also some scenes of real poignance and heart that will make you think, and make you feel.If you haven't read Discworld, read Guards, Guards!, and then this novel. You'll be glad you did!"},{"Title":"Men At Arms (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Discworld Novels)","review":"Terry Pratchett has done it again! &quot;Men At Arms&quot; offers a laughable look at some of the biggest problems facing our world today. Prejudice, crime, anarchy, and segregation are all addressed in his unique, farcical style. This is what parody is all about! Join Corporal Carrot and the rest of the Night Watch as they encounter Trolls, Dwarves, a talking dog and gargoyles in a search for a murderer and a &quot;gonne.&quot; You'll never look at the world the same way again"},{"Title":"Men At Arms (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Discworld Novels)","review":"I was very disappointed to find the footnotes missing from this edition.

Prachett is always entertaining!"},{"Title":"Men At Arms (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Discworld Novels)","review":"Captain Sam Vimes of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch is retiring and getting married in a few days. But an explosion at the Assassins' Guild attracts his interest, and soon a trail of bodies is forming. The Guilds don't want his help, the Patrician has ordered him to lay off and his fellow Watch members seem more concerned about the new intake of ethnic minorities (Lance-Corporal Cuddy of the dwarfs and Lance-Corporal Detritus of the trolls) than the mystery. But somewhere in Ankh-Morpork a killer is on the loose with a very powerful new weapon...Men at Arms is the second Discworld novel to focus on the City Watch, introduced in the classic Guards! Guards! As told in that volume, the City Watch saved the city from a marauding dragon and at the end of the book the Watch gained fresh resources from a grateful city government. However, it is still regarded as a joke, as Men at Arms makes clear.Pratchett once again uses the cliches and ideas of police procedurals to generate humour and satire, although this volume is much more of a hard-bitten (in some cases, literally) mystery novel. Sam Vimes is portrayed as the cynical, weathered old cop doggedly pursuing his case in the face of all opposition, whilst Corporal Carrot is his enthusiastic young sidekick. Of course, that would be a bit too cheesy, so Pratchett subverts this idea earlier on and takes the story in a more interesting and original direction.The city of Ankh-Morpork comes to life in this book more successfully than in any prior volume, to the extent that Pratchett's playwright and friend Stephen Briggs was able to use information in this book (and the prior ones) to map the city so everything tracked and made sense (the results can be found in the spin-off product, The Streets of Ankh-Morpork). The city's ethnic make-up, the political structure of the guilds and the office of the Patrician are all portrayed convincingly. In addition, Pratchett aims high with his characterisation, with the most affecting death of a Discworld character to date and some brilliant development for Carrot and Vimes. There is even a reasonably well-portrayed romance and some (tastefully off-screen) sex, a first for the series. Men at Arms is Discworld aimed at a slightly maturer level than arguably any of the previous books bar Small Gods.Which isn't to say that Pratchett doesn't bring the funny. The Colon/Nobbs double-act is excellent, the return of Gaspode the Wonder Dog (from Moving Pictures, but much better-utilised here) is genuinely funny and there is some fantastic material to be mined from the Cuddy/Detritus relationship.Men at Arms (*****) is Pratchett yet again firing on all cylinders, delivering a novel that is by turns brilliantly funny, genuinely thought-provoking and consistently entertaining. The novel is available now in the UK and USA."},{"Title":"Men At Arms (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Discworld Novels)","review":"There's something to be said for reading a series in chronological order, but it seems somehow more in the spirit of Discworld to just read them however they come to hand. This one features the Night Watch (my favorite sub-series) on the cusp of becoming the reorganized and expanded City Watch. Carrot is presently a corporal and trolls and dwarfs are just being added to the roster in the spirit of affirmative action. Captain Sam Vimes is facing both imminent retirement and imminent marriage to Lady Sybil Ramkin, both of which have put him into a strange state of mind. And on top of all that, there has been a mysterious series of murders of guild members, committed with an unknown weapon. Carrot, a six-foot-tall adopted dwarf, gets a lot of play this time, with special attention to his special talent: Everyone likes Carrot because he truly thinks everyone is basically decent underneath it all. As always, Pratchett, a master of stealth philosophy, combines off-the-wall humor and bent puns with thoughtful and humane digressions on the nature of right and good vs. wrong and evil, and what makes a good copper."},{"Title":"Men At Arms (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Discworld Novels)","review":"The discworld series is by far one of the most hilarious series I have ever had the privlege to experience. I have read pretty much all of the books in this series, and I love them all to death. If your new to the series, you dont have to read the books in order, but it does help in order to fully experience some of the character ties, growths, and extremely bizzare happenings.Men at Arms is the second book featuring the Watch, the first being Guards!

I can say it in one word: Carrot! He is one of my favorite heroes on the Discworld (only Rincewind and Nanny Ogg compare with Death a close third). As usual, Carrot comes through with flying colors. There are just so many interesting things in this book: the plot about the \\"gonne,\\" Leonard de Quirm (and the way he acts with the Patrician), Cuddy the dwarf and Detritus the troll, the silly guildsand their ridiculous presidents, Carrot and Angua, I could just go on.Especially good was the troll-dwarf issue, the way they had to work together to interview the guilds without making complete fools of themselves and just basically get along. Also, it is funny how intelligent trolls get in low temperatures.The plot alos makes for a nice mystery story. Pratchett really worked on this one. We start out with a 4-man watch and end up with one over 60 people! The Watch really grows up and will add many laughs to future stories. One of the best: a must read."},{"Title":"Men At Arms (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Discworld Novels)","review":"This book is the best! It is one of my favorite Discworld books.

As a quick synopsis, the Ankh-Morpork City Guard (Night Watch) are having to deal with a very new and very, very nasty weapon. And this is a Bad Thing (TM) because the Night Watch in its entirety consists of a human who was raised as a dwarf, a dwarf with a nasty temper, a werewolf who holds long conversations with dogs, a really fat idiot, a recovering drunk, a troll who knocks himself unconscious whenever he tries to salute, and a.. well, we haven't quite worked out *what* Nobby is yet.This isn't exactly a *mystery*, per se, not in the same way that, say, The Fifth Elephant or Feet of Clay are, because we have a fair idea pretty early on of what the weapon we're facing actually is, even if the Night Watch don't. My personal favorite scene is the one starting in the sewers where Vimes gets the.. um.. probably shouldn't say it here.. anyway. I also like the bits with Leonard, especially when Vetinari's talking to him about the Watch and starts comparing people to clockwork (&quot;And sometimes you have to wind the spring as tight as it will go, and pray it doesn't break.&quot;) That was actually a bit creepy, really.."},{"Title":"Men At Arms (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Discworld Novels)","review":"I have read every Terry Pratchett book in the Disc book series.

Men at Arms, though, surpasses even that.First of all, the ranks of the City Watch are expanded, with Detritus -DON'T SALUTE, the Troll, Cuddy, the Dwarf, and Angua, a woman who's not all she appears to be. Dwarves and Trolls don't get along, which provides the meat to some very funny scenes between Detritus and Cuddy, including a great scene where Cuddy is teaching Detritus how to count. There are even more jokes in this one then there were in Guards Guards (or at least, I laughed at more of them).Captain Vimes is retiring in a few days, which doesn't give the watch much time to figure out who's responsible for all the strange murders happening. Never fear, though, Corporal Carrot is here! The character development in this book makes this so much more than just a funny fantasy. Vimes is really starting to second guess his life. Carrot is maturing greatly, even if he still is plain, simple Carrot. Even Nobbs and Colon grow as characters.In Vimes, you see a character agonizing over who he is and what he is becoming. He's not sure he wants to live the life that's staring him in the face. Yet he's still the take-charge guy he became in the first book. He's the emotional centre of the book and while he's not always involved, his presence is always being felt.All of this sounds dreadfully serious, but it's wrapped in a plot that goes from one hilarious event to another. There were three or four straight pages where I couldn't stop laughing as I read, and every other page had a treat (I just managed to stifle the laughter in order to not disturb my wife's sleep). The mix of comedy and character development is made perfectly. If you have no interest in serious stuff, you can ignore that aspect of the book and just revel in the jokes.I'm moving on to Feet of Clay now, and I'm optimistic. Pratchett hasn't missed with me so far. Do yourself a favour and try this series."},{"Title":"Men At Arms (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Discworld Novels)","review":"A well-crafted, sharp-witted tale that will be especially appealing to anyone who has ever read Tolkien and his ilk.

So what ? &quot;Men At Arms&quot; sees Pratchett back with a vengeance, &quot;extracting the urine&quot; again with the style and wit he's gotten us used to. Shrewd as ever, he manages yet again to make the reader think twice ( or thrice, for that matter ) about the pool of cliches we wallow in, as well as to make us laugh like we did with Reaper Man or Witches Abroad. Pratchett also tears to shreds that silly notion that guns are something to be desired - hey, even the Guild of Assassins hate them ! - and, as always, pulls off a funny/teary eyed ending he's known for.

Not only is there a continuation of characters, but new ones are added, and further developed. Terry Pratchett shows he is a REAL writer by his ability to interweave a funny, uplifting book, with true drama, a plot, and a mystery type story, of whodunnit? If you like &quot;buddy flicks&quot; and enjoy excellent humor, this is a must read. Even though it is a continuation from a previous book, the reader does not need to read Guards Guards! to fully understand the characters, for Pratchett's writing style allows the new reader to become comfortable with the characters within a few pages. The only warning i give to the reader is, not all books are completely happy go lucky, for drama is truly woven in with surprising occurences. Enjoy this book!

In this book, Pratchett does a multi-cultural transformation of the Watch, transitions Vimes from a Captain to a Mr., and, one way or another, brings Carrot into his own.

Even more, I just loved Carrot (that combination of innocence and strength gets me every time!). Have also read Guards!

Apparently they live in some fantasy world where either paper is free, or duplicating bytes is expensive."},{"Title":"Men At Arms (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Discworld Novels)","review":"Now, I know a lot of people like Carrot, but the fact is, I've never liked typcial hero characters, they always come off too flat for me, and Carrot is a generic hero character. The worst thing is, he was a pretty good character in &quot;Guards Guards!&quot;, but he loses the innocent touch that made him endearing in GG!, and turns into a generic hero here. This shouldn't be a problem, due to the prescence of Vimes and the return of Gaspode (who is even funnier here than he was in Moving Pictures, his first appearance), and a slew of new characters, and other characters getting new dimensions to their character (like Detritus), and Nobby, but most of the book focuses on Carrot and Carrot only, and I can't say I liked that.It's a shame, because otherwise, this is a really good book. Someone gets his hands on a strange new weapon and is killing people with it. the Night Watch follows the case, with new members Cuddy, Angua, and Detritus, in addition to the older members, Carrot, Colon, Nobby, and Captain Vimes. Vimes, however, is going to be married to Lady Ramkin, Carrot follows the case. The other members tag along for good measure (although there are some good sequences with Cuddy and Detritus). Gaspode the Wonderdog shows up to help.The plot runs along smoothly for the most part, except when Carrot gets seriously involved, and the whole clown thing was kind of contrived. This is a mystery story, which is good. I like mysteries.Overall, if you can get over the prescence of Carrot (or better ye, if you end up liking Carrot, which many people did), you'll enjoy this book a lot.

This one is my favourite Discworld novel.I loved the way the whole thing got something of amystery novel, (naturally in this point Feet of Clay is more rewarding). I don't know why, but only Terry Pratchett seems to be able to managethis kind of fantasy. The few other examples of funny fantasy I tried weren't hardly very funny at all.Other authors just steal from Tolkien, or (directly or via Tolkien) from some mythology.Well, Pratchett also does, the world being carried on the back of a turtle isn't his very own idea, but his way of using other sources is far more elegant than those of any other author I've ever read (except Tolkien perhaps, but you hardly can really compare other authors with Tolkien).Other authors steal, Pratchett hints.And within all the books there's a vast amount of moral, sometimes more, sometimes less, that would be boring with any other author, but with Pratchett it's just more fun.If the man's been able to write about 20 novels in the last years, that are that good, I'm quite confident, that he'll manage this some more years, and I'm always eagerly awaiting the next one.Yes, naturally, close up to Men at Arms there isGuards!

But, this book doesn't crackle and fizz with the subversive humor, satire, and insight into the human condition of his other books. This book is kind of, well, dull in parts.I have to confess that much of that might be my fault... this is a cop's story, a mystery, beyond all else. And, try as I might, I just can't care about mystery stories.However, Carrot and Vimes, two of the Night Watch's finest, are certainly engaging characters and Pratchett does manage to bring his wild humor into a rather mundane mystery story. He is still a sharp-eyed philosopher with a keen understanding of human nature. But I just can't help thinking that this could have been a better book.

Four stars."},{"Title":"Men At Arms (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Discworld Novels)","review":"This is my second Pratchett read, and I'm convinced that it will be unlikely to find one of his books that I won't enjoy. This one follows the City Watch, which is basically the police, as they try to unravel the mysterious murders that are suddenly happening in Ankh-Morpork. They are an organization in decline, without much real work to do or skills to practice, until now. Many colorful characters are enountered, and there are a surprising number of relevant and keen observations about the life of law enforcement personnel in general. One particular character, Carrot, is a fine example of that rare person who attracts and inspires people, without seeming to try. The book is witty, fun, and funny. There are a lot of different types of characters, including dwarfs, trolls, dogs, werewolves, thieves and assassins, and it makes for a story that is never slow or dull. One minor distraction for me was the often-encountered passages where I could not readily identify the character who was speaking. It required a little sorting out at times. But there is a lot to enjoy and recommend, in this very non-traditional humorous fantasy."},{"Title":"Men At Arms (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Discworld Novels)","review":"to funny to be real. i don't ask for much more in a discworld novel."},{"Title":"Men At Arms (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Discworld Novels)","review":"Terry Pratchett has really carved his own little niche in the fantasy genre. I am often reminded of Douglas Adams' Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy series when I read a Discworld novel. Excellent prose, and the dry, witty, British humor you can't get enough of.Men at Arms is the second Discworld novel featuring the Night Watch (the first was Guards! Guards!)The Watch features the crew from the previous book (Vimes, Carrot, Colon and Nobby) and some new recruits. Someone is murdered in a most mysterious way, and it's up to the Watch to get to the bottom of it.What I love about Pratchett is he doesn't settle to just write a witty satire. It's actually a great mystery/fantasy story with great characters who have excellent believable relationships.Men at Arms even has some scenes that I found emotionally stirring. I loved Guards!

She has just joined the Night Watch under the Equal Species Act, along with Detritus the Troll and Cuddy the Dwarf.No wonder Sam, who is a bit of a male chauvinist speciesist is going to retire.Not since Stephen King's \\"It\\" have clowns gotten such bad press as in \\"Men at Arms.\\" They seem to be the saddest creatures on Discworld. One of them, Beano is murdered and ends up playing 'Knock Knock - Who's There?' with Death, who is trying to develop a sense of humor.Humor will never be the strong suite of a hooded, seven-foot skeleton with glowing blue eyes, but Death does get in one inadvertently funny line. He tells Beano to think of his newly deceased state as being 'DIMENSIONALLY DISADVANTAGED.'Meanwhile back in the world of the living and undead, Captain Sam Vimes and his command investigate the circumstances of Beano's death. Sam is also under orders from his wife-to-be to find a missing swamp dragon, which is likely to explode if it comes under stress.When a large hole is blown in the headquarters of the Assassin's Guild, Sam has a pretty good notion of what caused the explosion. What he really wants to know is whether this latest calamity has something to do the Beano's death. After all, the Assassins are right next door to the Guild of Fools and Clowns.What he does not yet know is that mad genius, Leonard of Quirm's deadliest invention has fallen into the hands of a rabid monarchist who will do everything in his power to restore Ankh-Morpork's rightful king---and that king is a member of his own Night Watch.\\"Men at Arms\\" (1993) is another great slapstick-with-a-message adventure in the Sam Vimes/Night Watch Discworld novels.

The fellow doing the reading (Nigel Planer?) is a riot. Plus, if you listen in your car on the way to work, you can keep your job and your spouse."},{"Title":"Men At Arms (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Discworld Novels)","review":"Of all Pratchett's brilliantly drawn characters, Samuel Vimes stands unique in providing a realistic role model for the rest of us. He's honest, forthright, deeply suspicious of aristocracy, and best of all, despises the idea of kings. The last is important here, for someone wishes the return of the Ankh-Morpork monarchy. And Sam Vimes' remote ancestor, Old Stoneface, executed the last one.Edward d'Eath [how does PTerry come up with these names?!], an impoverished aristocrat, seeks fulfillment of his destiny by restoring the monarchy. Recruiting fellow lords to his cause proves difficult. It's been a long time since the last king, and the Patrician runs the city with commendable, if frightening, efficiency. So Edward embarks on a solitary campaign.Pratchett's inventive mind takes us from the &quot;fantasy&quot; genre into the murder mystery domain. Murder isn't a common event on the Discworld, and its occurrence here creates an intensity of feeling rarely evoked by Pratchett's works. Vimes is particularly irritated by such abhorrent events as murder. Assassination is bad enough, although carefully regulated by its Guild. For Vimes, murder is too arbitrary. It reflects the one aspect of society he resents the most, the exercise of absolute power. He's affronted both as a copper and a man.Partly inspired by Corporal Carrot, Vimes is no longer content having the Watch &quot;let things lie anymore&quot;. Forces that used to push a drunken Vimes into the gutter are forces he now resists, even struggles to overcome. It's an inspiring read watching Pratchett give Vimes a new sense of dedication. Vimes has always sought justice, and his recent rise in society and the Watch has given him fresh impetus, and clout, to gain it. However, first he must survive. He's up against a new force. A force of absolute power, without soul or pity - the Gonne.There are other aspects in this book beyond the new Old Stoneface trying to catch a murderer. Pratchett pays homage to the struggle for women's and immigrants' rights in Britain [and elsewhere]. The Watch has been compelled to recruit dwarves, trolls and, um, a woman. Sergeant Colon's attempts to reconcile size, attitudes and anatomy with a traditional human, male, role must bring tears to the eyes of all recruiting sergeants reading it. Pratchett's sympathetic view of Angua pays homage to the efforts of women striving to enter men's realms. But for a novel view of the world we all inhabit, there's few that can out-express Gaspode, one of Pratchett's finest creations.Pratchett possesses a superior ability to create timeless works. Nestled in this library since its publication, this book is taken up as an old friend for repeated enjoyment. There's nothing lost in re-reading Men At Arms - the issues remain timely, the characters worth noting - sometimes emulating, and the wit undiminished. If you're new to Pratchett, this is a fine place to start. If you're coming along in the Discworld sequence, be prepared for an item of exceptional value, something beyond the humorous fantasy of wizards, witches and Mort's employer."},{"Title":"Men At Arms (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Discworld Novels)","review":"I've decided he's too good and too prolific for me to write a brand new review every single time I read one of his books. Discworld currently has 34 titles and every one of them will probably knock your socks off. His mind bubbles and flashes like a boiling pot of electric eels, and I simply can't get enough of his writing.A reviewer has compared him to Geoffrey Chaucer. He reminds me more of Douglas Adams, or perhaps S Morgenstern. Great company, isn't it? He's an extremely skillful and imaginative writer, damn funny, clever and observant to boot. He's also very easy to read. A master of characterization, and if there's anything else you like about reading that I didn't mention here, assume I simply forgot. He's awesome.Another reviewer mentioned Jonathan Swift and PG Wodehouse. Why such hallowed company? Because Pratchett belongs there! Truly, I'm enjoying my quest to read every book in the series. You should do the same, and begin your quest at the library because he's got to be there. He's awesome!Yet another reviewer said Jerome K Jerome meets Lord of the Rings. Yeah, that works too.Why do we, as reviewers, compare authors to other authors? Because it's easier than thinking. In the case of Terry Pratchett, it's probably because we'd otherwise wind up quoting the guy. He's so unique that we just don't know how else to cope with his greatness. Even this paragraph sounds like foamy drool raving, doesn't it? That's how all readers react to Pratchett. Reviewers simply don't have the good sense to keep it to themselves.I could call his writing fantasy, but I could likewise call what Douglas Adams wrote science fiction. In both cases, I wouldn't be wrong, but I'd be neglecting so much and just totally missing the point. A rare few authors transcend a genre to such a degree that you know they're shouting out, loud and proud, a big fat \\"Bite me!\\"I love Terry Pratchett's writing, and I completely understand why some folks refer to him as their favorite author. Or favourite, I should say, since we're being British. He's one of those authors that makes you want to grab whoever's in hearing range and start reading passages aloud. I'm simply thrilled that there's such an extremely talented and prolific author who's been working for years without me being aware of him.

When a strange explosion occurs in the Assassins Guild, it really isn't his business--especially when Vetinari, the Patrician, specifically orders him to stay clear. Vimes's common sense wars with his self-defined duty and duty wins--at least until Vetinari calls him in for a second appointment (nobody wants a second appointment with the city's strange and nearly omnicient leader). For Vimes, the bottle is the way out. But Corporal Carrot isn't about to let a little thing like Vetinari's orders keep him from donig the right thing (Carrot always does the right thing) and pushes on in Vimes's absence.MEN AT ARMS tells the story of the fundamental reshaping of the City Watch under the combined influence of Vetinari, Vimes, and Carrot. The Watch is expanded from all-human to include dwarves, trolls, and a beautiful werewolf. Vetinari's policy of constructive anarchy may allow the city to work after a fashion, but a watch made up of misfits from all walks of life can certainly help. The novel is a near-continuation of the very fine GUARDS! GUARDS!Author Terry Pratchett combines puns, outrageous and over-the-top action, and real insights into humanity in ways that keep the reader laughing and thinking at the same time. Both Vetinari and Carrot are admirable, but both are also beyond most of our reach. Vimes, in contrast, is every-man. His dilemmas are those that all of us must face. That Vimes can rise (and sometimes fall) to the occasion brings some hope that any of us could do so too. Pratchett's work is at its best when it uses Discworld as a backdrop for the actions and decisions of its all-too-human sapients, and MEN AT ARMS is a fine example of exactly this."},{"Title":"Men At Arms (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Discworld Novels)","review":"Captain Samuel Vimes of the Ankh-Morpork City Guard is about to be married to Lady Sybil Ramkin, an incredibly rich woman who is totally into Dragons. Because Lady Ramkin finds the current job of her fianc&eacute; too dangerous -clearly forgetting that being blown to smithereens by a sick dragon is not commonly known as a \`safe' job opportunity- Captain Vimes decides to retire and dedicate his life to Dragons and other so-called \`nobilities'. Subsequently, a new league of City Guards has to be found and trained. In these modern times it is fashionable to be ethnically correct and in the true spirit of this trend: Lance-constable Detrius (a troll who hits himself unconscious if he salutes), Lance-constable Cuddy (a \`short'-tempered dwarf) and Lance-constable Angua (most of the time a woman) become the new recruits. When a series of murders leads to a strange theft of an even weirder weapon, their first ordeal is about to start. To make matters worse, the culprit seems to be a troll and... not everyone is happy about this.Men at Arms is the second Discworld novel to feature the Night Watch (Vimes, Colon, Carrot and Nobby); the first one is Guards! Guards! These two books certainly belong to the highlights of the Discworld series. Their characters are so colourfully rich and funny, that actually they do not need a strong plot to entertain the reader. Nevertheless Terry Pratchett has delivered with Men at Arms one of his strongest story-lines. It reads like a good suspense novel where you can actually try to find out actually who did it - you won't succeed, of course, but that's part of the fun, isn't it. It's not without reason that Captain Vines sometimes sounds like Inspector Columbo. A lot of funny sidekicks make their appearance: Death tries to become a more \`complete' person, Leonard de Quirm has problems naming his numerous inventions, the speaking dog Gaspode finds a girlfriend, Captain Quirke of the Day Watch shows what the word stupid really means and many, many others.

Although its reputation may have raised very slightly, having rescused the City from a large and angry dragon, it's still not the fine and noble profession it once was.Sam is the Captain of the Night Watch, though he is on the verge of retiring and will soon marry Lady Ramkin, the noted dragon-fancier. It isn't entirely clear, however, whether or not he's entirely happy about either the retirement or his impending life of marital bliss. It's fair to say he's not your typical hero : he hates the Undead (some of my best friends are werewolves), Assassins (a perfectly respectable profession) and - in keeping with an old family tradition - Kings (not an ideal musketeer then). Sam's also trying to quit drinking and has taken up smoking cigars to soften the blow.The Night Watch has had a couple of new recruits since \\"Guards! Guards!\\" - largely at the insistence if the Patrician, the city's ruler. The recruits - Lance-Constables Cuddy (a dwarf), Detritus (a troll) and Angua (a woman, for most of the month) - have been selected to reflect Ankh-Morpork's \`ethnic makeup'. Although Sergeant Colon and Corporal Nobbs are Sam's most experienced officers, the most capable is Carrot. Although born human, Carrot was raised as a dwarf and is an incredibly innocent character - he still hasn't figured out what seamstresses do for a living. He has, however, figured out how Ankh-Morpork works and has stopped trying to arrest the President of the Thieves Guild. The trouble begins when Edward d'Eath suspects that Carrot may be the rightful king of Ankh-Morpork.Edward is the latest Lord d'Eath, albeit a very poor one, following the recent death of his father. He was educated at the Guild of Assassins, where he became the first student to gain full marks at postgraduate level. His suspicions about Carrot are a little worrying, given that he wants to restore the monarchy. This will, of course, see the Patrician \`removed' from office - something that should be easier now that he has acquired a weapon that shouldn't exist.Pratchett's books are always very funny and this one is no exception. Despite being the second book to focus on the Night Watch, there's no real requirement to have read the first - the newcomer won't feel \`left out'. (However, I would recommend reading it, all the same !). Another big plus is Gaspode, Ankh-Morporks finest talking dog. Like Carrot, he's also devoted to Angua - though he's a lot less innocent ! Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"Men At Arms (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Discworld Novels)","review":"Men at Arms reunites us with the stalwart defenders of our beloved Ankh-Morpork: the Night Watch. Along the way we also meet up with some of the Discworld's most distinctive secondary characters (including Foul Ole Ron and Big Fido), get a glimpse of affirmative action Ankh-Morpork-style, discover the identity of the rightful king (if Ankh-Morpork still had a king, which it doesn't, which isn't the fault of the shady characters in this book trying to replace the Patrician with the aforementioned heir to the throne, who doesn't want the job anyway), converse once more with Gaspode the talking dog, and - if that's not enough - make ready for the wedding of the year between Captain Samuel Vimes of the Night Watch and Lady Sybil Ramkin, proprietor of the Sunshine Sanctuary for Sick Dragons and the richest woman in Ankh-Morpork. Captain Vimes is in fact retiring from the Watch, but his retirement involves much more than the traditional gift watch presentation from his men. A washed-up aristocrat named Edward D'eath takes it upon himself to restore the long-lost monarchy, a circumstance that can only come about over the Patrician's dead body. Even clowns aren't safe from this deadly conspiracy.The trouble begins with an explosion and robbery at the Guild of Assassins. Someone has stolen nothing less than the only \\"gonne\\" on Discworld, and a series of murders shock the town. OK, nothing's really going to shock the people of Ankh-Morpork, but the fact that people keep turning up full of holes where guts should be definitely stirs up the Watchmen. The Patrician is also less than happy about things, so he makes sure the Watch gets to the bottom of things by forbidding Captain Vimes to investigate. The Watch itself is growing; thanks to some new laws pushed through by the Silicon Anti-Defamation League, it has ethnically balanced itself with the addition of a dwarf, a troll, and a woman to the force. The woman, Angua, also happens to be a werewolf, and I don't have to tell you that dwarfs and trolls are natural enemies. Luckily, Constable Carrot, the 6'6\\" dwarf (he was adopted, you know) who is just so doggoned nice that people will actually listen to him and do as he requests, is there to keep the Watch united and performing its duty the way Carrot (alone) thinks it should be done. After a dwarf is killed and a troll arrested by the Day Watch (on the basis that any troll is surely guilty of something), there's an ever-present danger that the city's trolls and dwarfs will have a go at each other (and it won't be like last time, when both groups somehow managed to ambush one another at the same time).Constable Detritus really steals the show here. Watching a troll think is always entertaining, but Detritus really comes into his own as this story progresses. At first, he can't salute without knocking himself out, but by the end he's recruiting and training fellow trolls (in his own endearing way) and warming up quite well to his dwarf partner. He also manages to show us that, in the right conditions (such as the kind of very cold temperature you find in a pork futures market), trolls can be brilliant thinkers.People always die in Discworld novels, but there was one death in Men at Arms that really took me by surprise. A bit sad, it was. Don't be sad about Captain Vimes leaving the Night Watch, though. Furthermore, don't worry about the future of the City Guard, as it does not fall into the hands of Sergeant Colon or Corporal Nobbs (who, as we all know, has already been disqualified from the human race for shoving). I'm sure the men and women and dwarfs and trolls and werewolf of the Night Watch will be as ready as ever for the next threat that rears its ugly head in Ankh-Morpork; after all, Carrot's still on the job."},{"Title":"Men At Arms (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Discworld Novels)","review":"I've listened to \\"Lords and Ladies\\" in the abridged and unabridged versions and can only recommend the unabridged.The person who did the abridging seems to have gone about it by discarding every other chapter from the unabridged book.

Tony Robinson's reading only added to the confusion, his store of \\"voices\\" consisted of \\"regular voice\\", \\"low volume hissed voice\\", \\"loud voice\\". LVHV was used for the Elf Queen and several other characters and was so hard to hear that I often had to back up the track, set the iPod's volume to max and repeat so I could figure out what the dialog was.Then I got the unabridged version that Nigel Planer reads and realized that \\"Lords and Ladies\\" is another triumph for Pratchett! Nigel Planer is a wonder! The witches have voices that sound elderly, female and distinctly individual. Dwarfs have deep gravelly voices and Trolls sound dimwitted and slow. Wizards, the Librarian, every character has his own voice. Planer's only flaw is that young women always sound adenoidal, but it's not jarring and I soon got used to it. Best of all, Planer's reading is always clearly audible.So, avoid the unabridged versions! I can't imagine what Terry Pratchett was thinking when he greenlighted these travesties.

All of Pratchett's latter books deal with some major social issue that exist in historical or modern time. He deal with them in a highly intellectual manner using extremely complex humourous satirical technique.All of the latter books are very funny, and intellectually charllenging. To the reader with some historical knowledge of the jokes and anecdote provided by Pratchett, his book is intriging. I would advise anyone with interest in the real world as well as those looking for a great piece of literature to read Pratchett.This is a great book about a young copdude who would be king, little dragons, and a world where science, magic, fantasy, and who know what else is mixed.

In Men at Arms we get the next instalment of Corporal Carrot and the retirement of Sam Vimes. Of course there is a threat to Ankh Morpork and Discworld as a whole but it's not the overblown rip of fabric of reality into the dungeon dimension (or similar) of previous books. Much more subtle and interesting. Great little plot (with a very unexpected villain), and the characters just keep getting more interesting and complex as the series progresses."},{"Title":"Men At Arms (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Discworld Novels)","review":"I just finished re-reading this novel, which remains high in my esteem. My review will contain some spoilers, so avoid it id you don't like those. Its main theme is the final success of integrating city minorities, starting with a dwarf, a troll and a woman, into the all-male Watch. Dwarfs and trolls are ancient enemies from the mountains, now moving in droves into Discworld's biggest city, Ankh-Morpork. Putting two of them together as a police team seems insoluble, and would be but for Corporal Carrot. The new watchwoman is also a werewolf (actually werewolfhound), and her kind of minority is shunned by just about everyone--except Carrot--but Angua no longer bites people and is trying to be a vegetarian! There are numerous subplots, skilfully woven into the main story--the insanity of extreme royalist snobbery; the growing affection between Sam Vimes and Sibyl Ramkin, his temporary backslide into alcoholism, Sibyl's steadfastness and (at the end of the book) a happy beginning; the reluctantly heroic talking mutt, Gaspode, who reminds me of Huckleberry Finn (he refused to be &#34;sivilized&#34;). Most relevant to our own problems is the &#34;gonne&#34; (the earliest English spelling of &#34;gun&#34;) invented by Leonard of Quirm. Supposedly it was destroyed, but instead was put away in a private museum and stolen. Like our own guns, it has a murderous personality of its own that infects its users, but Discworld is luckier than our world. At the story's end the gonne is destroyed by Carrot--and there are no others in existence."},{"Title":"Men At Arms (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Discworld Novels)","review":"Terry Pratchett is a fantastic author.

That was one of the main reasons I bought it.To me a thriller indicates suspense, tightening tension, and anunusual, exciting climax/ending to the story. This novel has none of those ingredients.At 413 pages, this draggy book about a negative lesbian love affair, is very repetitive. The storyline is rather thin, involving two women, Alix, a seemingly heterosexual woman who is happy with her male lover(s), but then becomes romantically and sexually involved with Tansie, and turns her back on heterosexuality with no particular explanation; and Tansie, a lesbian woman whose erratic behavior is never explained beyond saying she had an abusive childhood--which is also never examined.As another reader here noted, and I couldn't agree more, the writer does not give us any depth with these characters and does telling, but not showing.The words \\"internalized homophobia\\" are never used, but in my opinion both Alix and Tansie have that problem, Tansie to a greater degree than Alix. In fact, that is the main problem in their relationship.The reader is even cheated sexually because there are no sex scenes per se in the book although the characters spend an inordinate amount of time making love."},{"Title":"Tansie","review":"I do alot of reading of Lesbian ficton and this is my favorite and everyone who I have given it to!

I could appreciate the comedy of this book before I went to Nam, so it seemed strange to me that the selective service would send a person with such an inappropriate emotional response, my love of ghosts, to Vietnam. By 1968, times were so desparate that they, my local draft board, thought it ought to be their choice more than mine, and I didn't have anything to bet on the outcome but my life.

C'mon, what kind of pleasure do you expect from a 500 pages book with very small fonts?I would like to review on pages 183-189 regarding case at Kanthal. It said that according to ABC calculation, Kanthal has found that customer #199 records loss, unfortunately customer #199 is in the top three in terms of sales volume. If ABC is really a good tool, then Kanthal should fire customer #199. But Kanthal didn't do that. They don't believe in ABC?Customer #199 implemented JIT and they've got substantial improvement in productivity and efficiency. With JIT concept they place order to Kanthal in small quantity and frequent orders. According to ABC, this makes the cost for Order-to-cash activities at Kanthal is quite high, so that it eats the margin.The funny thing, the book said JIT is appropriate in Japan, not in Sweden. Don't they look at automotive industry around the world that successfully implement JIT?So what's the solution described in the book? The solution is to cut the cost of order-to-cash activities by using electronic B2B concept. And it claims that customer #199 turns to be profitable for Kanthal after that. So simple and...so wrong!Maybe ABC calculation shows that result is good at Customer #199 level. But still, the company bottom line remains the same. Do they cut sales persons' salary? No. Do they fire a sales person who handle customer #199? No. Do they reduce transportation cost? No.Probably by using B2B, there's small fraction of cost saving on order processing activities, but it won't be significant enough to increase the net profit for the company.If B2B does reduce the cost of order processing cost significantly, why they don't use it for all customers?"},{"Title":"Cost & Effect: Using Integrated Cost Systems to Drive Profitability and Performance","review":"I would like to have it in German and French languages in order to recommend it to my colleagues."},{"Title":"Cost & Effect: Using Integrated Cost Systems to Drive Profitability and Performance","review":"Cost &amp; Effect will most appeal to those who have had extended experience with Activity-Based Costing (ABC) or operate in manufacturing industries.If you are interested in learning more about Activity-Based Costing, this book is not the best choice for you. Professor Kaplan has co-authored books that explore this subject in much greater detail.Most people set as their initial priority the need to have accurate financial reporting for the entire enterprise. Falling below that level of effectiveness is Stage I in the terms of this book. Once you have that financial reporting done accurately, you are at Stage II. But you know almost nothing about how to manage your costs better. In order to do that, you will need to establish ad hoc financial reporting processes designed to help your organization learn from its experience and identify opportunities for improvement, built around Activity-Based Costing (ABC). ABC is simply a way of more accurately applying overhead costs back to activities and then processes that permits accurately understanding more about which combinations of products and services and customers are profitable and which are not. Then, within each activity, you can also see the inefficiencies in what you are doing that present opportunities for improvement. The book also has a nice discussion of Kaizen costing that is widely used in Japanese companies looking for on-going cost improvements, based on Professor Cooper's research. There are a few case histories to illustrate the principles, but most will find these insufficient to guide them through the process. In other books, Professor Kaplan has pointed out that there is a lot of acquired art in the subject and you probably need help to get it right. I concur. Once you have ABC operating in stand-alone systems, you are at Stage III.At this point, you will have a financial reporting system that is separate from the ABC system. How do you put them together? That the subject of chapter 14, which is the key value-added part of this book. You will see what the systems architecture and process flow needs to be in order to combine ABC with Enterprise-Wide Systems (EWS) of the sort that many large companies have invested in during recent years. Putting the two together will greatly improve planning, budgeting, design of new products and services, and operational improvements. Chapter 15 expands into the area of how to apply the combined system to budgeting and transfer pricing. Combing ABC and EWS puts you at Stage IV, a level rarely reached today.The book's main message is that it's a mistake to try to go from Stage II directly to Stage IV. There's a lot of experimentation and mistakes that you can benefit from in an extended Stage III. I agree again, based on my experience with ABC.The one caution you should have about ABC in this context is that if you are going to radically change your business model every 2-5 years as many companies are, Stage IV is probably unattainable and undesirable. You can't hold back business model innovation for better cost systems. The next business model innovation will probably give you better costs than tweaking the current business model with ABC will.Seek out the fastest route to progress, and do more of it!"},{"Title":"Cost & Effect: Using Integrated Cost Systems to Drive Profitability and Performance","review":"I have read this book cover to cover and have re-read chapters. Kaplan ensures that you grasp the fundamental concepts by keeping things simple. He illustrates the concepts with easy to understand examples.

It shows the 4 stages of financial reporting and ABC strategies. Companies have to switch their strategy of using traditional financial reporting to understand business performance and make it the other way around. Business Management Reporting should drive the Financial Reporting and the accountants should handle Financial Reporting for external needs in a locked room. This issue is analyzed from the ABC eyes. It is a must read book, innovative and out of the box thinking."},{"Title":"Cost & Effect: Using Integrated Cost Systems to Drive Profitability and Performance","review":"Kaplan and Cooper have put together an outstanding guidebook for managers to follow in order to reap the most significant benefits from activity based costing and other cost management techniques. The great merit of this book is that it does not preach to the reader the latest management fad, but rather goes through a thorough analysis of budgeting processes, highlighting benefits and drawbacks of each. They do not claim ABC is the best approach, and even praise some simpler methods that are more adequate for certain companies. Instead, they point to the circumstances in which ABC can provide outstanding results to companies.The book structured first with an analysis of the most often used systems of managerial cost accounting. It highlights the shortcomings of these, proceeding then to present certain productivity improvements that could contribute to performance. These are mostly related to the quality movements (TQM, 6 Sigma, etc), which are presented in a very understandable way. These are complements to the existing usual cost management systems. These improvements can be made even without implementing ABC systems.Then the authors proceed to describe activity based costing and its benefits in terms of choosing customers, suppliers, and product breadth. They present many examples that would be very relevant to any practitioner, in industry or service. There is a specific section focusing on services, which makes the appropriate adaptations to the systems for the peculiarities of it.Overall, an outstanding work, to help anyone involved in cost management, whether they are interested in activity based costing or more traditional standard costing methods."},{"Title":"Cost & Effect: Using Integrated Cost Systems to Drive Profitability and Performance","review":"An excellent reference text on the subject.

I didnt know anything about Activity Based Costing at the time and so the book was a little difficult since it was not meant to be an introduction to the subject. After I did some research and became more familiar with the material, I realised how great this book is. I have read it twice. The book is well structured and the authors use plenty of real life case studies. The reason I gave it only 4 stars is that I would have rather seen a large section at the end of the book with more detailed information about the case studies. I read some Harvard case studies that were mentioned in the text and it was really helpful because they put things in perspective. I think the authors should have included two or three case studies with their analysis at the end of the book. Other than that, I dont think that there is a better book about the subject out there."},{"Title":"Cost & Effect: Using Integrated Cost Systems to Drive Profitability and Performance","review":"Robert S. Kaplan and Robin Cooper's work on activity-based costing has achieved the status of a minor classic in managerial accounting literature. First published in 1997, it explained why activity-based costing has advantages not only for accounting, but also for management and strategy. Moreover, it linked the advantages of activity-based costing to what, at the time, seemed to be novel ideas about economic value added and enterprise systems. Nearly 10 years after its initial publication, the book seems surprisingly fresh and relevant (notwithstanding the authors' enthusiasm for the \\"information age\\" and the potential of enterprise systems). The authors present the case for activity-based costing in a clear and straightforward manner. The book is well-organized and surprisingly free of jargon. We recommend it as a good introduction to managers who are new to the subject.

For example, the lead character, an adult woman, is treated as if she were a child who needs guidance from adult males, racially demeaning attitudes are expressed toward those of Mexican descent, mothers try to control and mettle significantly more in their adult daughters lives then occurs in today's stories, etc..Although the number of characters in this novel is relatively small, the protagonist is a woman, and the story deals primarily with family matters, this is a psychological noir rather than a cozy mystery. The story starts, gently and interestingly, and holds your attention throughout. The mystery unfolds in a satisfactory straight line manner with few \\"red herrings\\". However, those who enjoy happy endings may be somewhat disappointed.The physical structure of the story makes this a particularly enjoyable read. The book is divided into three main sections: 'The Graveyard', 'The City', and 'The Stranger'. Within these sections chapters are short, providing a sense of rapid progress through the story and making it easy to pause at a close breakpoint at almost anytime.If you find a cast of characters helpful as you read a novel, you may want to print the following:-Daisy Fielding Harker - The main character and the lady with the dream-Jim Harker - Daisy's husband-Stella - The Harker's maid-Ada Fielding - Daisy's divorced mother-Stan Fielding - Daisy's divorced but now remarried father-Murial Fielding - Stan Fielding's current wife-Steve Pinata - Bail bondsman and private investigator who Daisy hires-Adam Burnett - A lawyer and old friend of Jim Harker-Charles Alston - Neighbor Clinic Director-Carlos Theodore Camilla - Name about which more is sought-Juanita \\"Nita\\" Garcia Donelli - A waitress at the Velada Cafe and mother of six-Joe Donelli - Juanita's husband-Filomena Rosario - Juanita's mother-Mrs Brewster - Owner of the Velada Cafe and friend of Juanita's mother"},{"Title":"Best Mysteries of All Time: A Stranger in My Grave (The Best Mysteries of All Time)","review":"This Reader's Digest Reissue of M.

But Mrs. Millar is expert at depicting all social classes, including Mexian immigrants, and their family interests, and has a sly humor that keeps this book amusing thruout.

The story begins with Orion, a young athlete who dreams that Zeus has chosen him to revive the ancient Olympic games. Orion and his loyal comrades make a perilous journey from Elis to Athens where they must convince the suspicious Athenian council to put down their shields.The Olympic Games are renewed, but not without political implications. Colorful characters participate, serving to intensify the brutality of the era through boxing, chariot races and javelin throwing; games played with few rules and plenty of aggression. Olympia 420 is a story rich with sports and action.Jennifer Herzog carefully illustrated Olympia 420 with concise pen and ink maps, sporting events and vivid images.

I like the play but its one major failing is that Gar, especially through Gar Private, is very often reduced to a stereotypical, stage Irish man. While his constant jokes do serve to highlight his frustration at the monotony of his life, and especially the lack of communication between him and his father, his constant chatter, and unbridled spontaneity are too overpowering and detract from what is otherwise a beautiful play. My favourite scene, and the scene I loved playing most is when SB is alone on stage and goes over to Gar's room and looks at his son's suitcases. For the first time, the mask drops and we see that he is a man of feeling who can not voice his inner hurt and turmoil. The end is lovely, the theme of memory, deceptive and alusive."},{"Title":"Philadelphia, here I come!","review":"This is set in play format with a strange inclusion of the antagonists alter ego the two characters are Public the man everyone sees and Private the man no one sees or hears only Public can hear him. Together they make up Gar. The play is set the night before Gar is set to leave Ireland and move to Philadelphia. The story focuses not on his leaving but more on his escape from his unexciting father. The inclusion of Private Gar added humour and explanation of events in the play. An enjoyable play with greats dialog and a good story."},{"Title":"Philadelphia, here I come!","review":"Of course this was Brian Friel's first big success. It should have been. It's about the mysteries of immigration, the loss of what's left behind, the hope of what's hoped and longed for, the inability to feel what you say and to say what you feel, love lost and given away, and how we are not what we seem, or even what we think we are. It's also about not really understanding all this and still doing something.

If you read a story and you don't know what's going on, even reading the notes and finding out that the story is based on rhetorical arguments of the day (which were very popular) and how it's a parody isn't going to make the story anymore enjoyable. YOu will get the jokes but only after they've been explained.This is a rather depressing prospect considering that it means that there's a shelf life onSimpsons World The Ultimate Episode Guide: Seasons 1-20.Still, several aspects do come down to us in the modern world without too much translation. Jokes about people passing gas have always been amusing. This is why The Miller's Tale is so funny and even if you don't know the tropes of Courtly Love being parodied. Other stories take effort but are worth it. Some are very influential in their ghastly and grisly methodology (The Pardoner's Tale is a fake morality tale that serves as a horror story).And some stories do just fall flat and serve only to bore the reader.Still it's worth a read.

I just had fun reading it and taking it for face value. I feel somewhat obliged to write something about this book. Some of the tales (the Knight's and the Sergeant-at-Law's) were very long, and normally I would be screaming at the fact that I had chosen to read such a lengthy novel, but once I got into it, length really wasn't a real issue, but I don't know if this is something that was in the original manuscript, or in the translation, but to me, Chaucer seemed to jump around and some of the tales didn't seem to flow as well as others."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"this boke sux. its a bunch of midevil poetry. it is so retarded and dum. i dont like it al all.Initially published in the Journal of Literary Criticism, 24(1)."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"I enjoyed reading the Canterbury Tales from a language lovers point of view.

They are written in \\"old English\\", however, and read like a foreign language for most of us.

Cohen's tales retain Chaucer's colorful insight into fourteenth century England including life as a knight, the horror of the plague, and the religous hypocrisy of the age.

I know I was. If you're like me, you're picking up The Canterbury Tales because it's one of those classics that you eventually have to read to be one of the \\"literati.\\" Or, and actually more likely, you're being forced to read it by some professor somewhere. As such, you're ready for a dry and dusty tome, struggling for every page. But that's not what's here.The Canterbury Tales is much more entertaining, much more visceral and much more fanciful than many of the works that have followed it (and most of the classics). It is a collection of short stories that runs the gamut, from precious religious narrative to bawdy toilet-humor. Most all of it is in verse (usually couplets) and the reading is fast and fun. My personal favorite comes first in the Knight's Tale, but the whole is filled with surprises and engrossing stories. Reading the Tales, you'll also have an interesting perspective into a society many hundreds of years past--a society that turns out to be not far different from our own.I'd also like to take this opportunity to recommend a modern fantasy/sci-fi novel that is kind of a take on the Tales entitled Hyperion by Dan Simmons.So, to conclude, if you are sitting up in your dorm room, staring at the Tales, trying to figure out how to approach: just start. It'll do the work for you."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"This is a wonderful, hilarious book! Granted, it is not an easy read, but if you are a good reader or don't mind working through the old language, you will find this to be a very funny book. It also takes some understanding of the period it was written in. Without that understanding and the aforementioned traits, you may find this book to be &quot;a waste of time&quot;. Rent the movie A Knight's Tale to see appearances by Chaucer, the Summoner, and the Prior. This movie, despite being somewhat fluffy and anachronistic, does have some elements of The Canterbury Tales which, after reading the book, you may notice."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"In Chaucer's work, 'The Canterbury Tales', perhaps the greatest of English literary works from the period of the language known as Middle English, there is one particular piece that have always stood out for me.'A Clerk ther was of Oxenford also,'This is perhaps my favourite character, as when I first read it, it seemed to epitomise what I hoped for in my own life.'That unto logik hadde longe y-go.....For him was lever have at his beddes heedTwenty bokes, clad in blak or reed,Of Aristotle and his philosophye,Than robes riche, of fithele, or gay sautrye,But al be that he was a philosophre,Yet hadde he but litel gold in cofre,But al that he mighte of his freendes hente,On bokes and on lerninge he it spente,and bisily gan for the soules preyeOf hem that yaf him wherwith to scoleye........gladly wolde he lerne, and gladly teche.'Every now and then I cannot help but re-read this part of the Prologue, for a reminder of what I'm aiming for in my own life.Chaucer was son of a wine merchant, something near and dear to my heart. Chaucer was well-read, well-phrased, well-mannered, industrious in literary and legal/administrative pursuits, as I trust I will become, if not already so qualified.As one can see from the above examples, English has changed much over the past 600 years, but not so much as to make these passages unrecognisable. Compare for yourself with a modern translation such as this, and see how much you can decipher.Chaucer is one of the first great English authors of name; most (but not all) literary output in English prior to this time was anonymous. Living in the 1300s, he held administrative posts of importance under Kings from the time of Edward III to Henry IV. Never one to shrink from spending too much money (he had to reapply for pensions and ask for advances several times in his life) or shying away from controversy (he fell out of and came back into favour several times). When he died, he was laid to rest in Westminster Abbey, in a section on the south side that has since become Poet's Corner, largely due to Chaucer, the first great English poet, having been buried there.In addition to his magnus opus, 'The Canterbury Tales', a collection of stories with prologue told by pilgrims on their journey to Canterbury (car radios and in-flight movies were rare in those days), Chaucer wrote minor poems to suit various occasions (his first record as poet comes from having written a poem as elegy on the death of John of Gaunt's first wife, Blanche, in 1369), and the major work for which he was noted for 'Troilus and Criseyde', which showed his sense of humour, power of observation and attention to detail, and keen dramatic skills in language. This work is often compared to Dante and Boccaccio, perhaps the most famous poets of the day. 'The Canterbury Tales' is actually intended to be much longer - 120 tales told by 30 pilgrims (two each on the way to Canterbury, and two each returning). As it is, there are only 24 tales plus a prologue - had it been completed, it would be by far the longest poem in the English language.There is a strong, practical side to Chaucer's writing, sophisticated yet not aloof and removed from the affairs of the world, cultured yet in tune with the better (and more interesting) aspects of the common people, too.This edition by Nevill Coghill is designed for those who only want the Canterbury Tales, not the other writings of Chaucer, but want a set of the complete tales and prologue from standard texts. This is a fairly standard version that is useful for students - the Penguin classics have long been a staple for undergraduate and general readership, and this volume fits the bill nicely.For those who want the Canterbury Tales in good form, this is a good volume to get."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Have you ever sat amongst friends, or maybe even strangers, and swapped stories with each person attempting to make their tale appear to be the most impelling. This is in essence the design of Geoffrey Chauncer's &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;, a collection of stories told by a group of travelers on a pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral. Of these stories the most noted are &quot;The Knight's Tale&quot;, &quot;The Wife of Bath's Tale&quot;, &quot;The Miller's Tale&quot;, &quot;The Reeve's Tale&quot;, and &quot;The Parson's Tale&quot;. Chaucer, born in the early 1340s (the exact date is unknown), lived a most notable life and had a profound impact on English literature. Much of his works are influenced by love and his distain for the Church in the form of satirical humor. The latter due impart to the corruption within the clergy and the condition of the people from their suffering of drought, famine, and disease.

If you must read a translation I would suggest the translation by Nevill Coghill, it is quite good. However I must reiterate that to get the full effect of this masterpiece of the English language you must read it in its original tongue.

A humorous tavern owner suggests a way to help pass the time, everyone tells a story, and the persone who tells the best story gets a free dinner. The stories range from serious tales about chivalry and love (knight) to the disgusting and perverse (summoner). Apparently Chaucer planned to have each member of the party tell two tales, but I suppose he didn't get around to finishing the collection. Also, I think 1 or 2 of the stories are not complete, but that's in every edition you can buy."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"The annotation style if this edition ruins it. Putting the definitions of words in line with the text, rather than as footnotes or end notes, disrupts the flow of reading.

I'm off to find another edition only partway into the first poem."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"The Canterbury Tales is an entertaining romp through the Medieval English countryside. If you don't know what it's about, the Canterbury Tales is a collection of stories told by a group of pilgrims on their way to Canterbury Cathedral. The tales are told as a way to entertain each other on their journey and the one who tells the best tale will earn a fine meal paid for by the other travelers. This is actually an incomplete work as Chaucer died before completing it, but it is a fine example of early English literature and one of the most important pieces of the English Canon.The tales here vary in length and content as to the prologues and epilogues containing the goings on of the party members. Chaucer writes with a great sense of humor and, since he is writing in the language of the common folk, the content contains many lewd and bawdy jokes and events. It is a very entertaining read and if one wants more than just entertainment, there is a lot of social commentary about life in medieval England that can be gleaned throughout the text.I was a little unsure what to expect when I read this and don't be turned off by the introductory prologue in which our narrator introduces all of the characters. It can be a little long and dry in parts, but it helps to give a clear picture of the characters in the party as they interact with one another and tell their respective tales.Added note: I had to read this again for another class and this time we read it in the original Middle English. Having read the Canterbury Tales earlier, I appreciated the fact that I already had a handle on the general storyline of the tales and could instead concentrate on the nuances of the language and the beauty of the rhyme scheme. I thoroughly enjoyed this second time through the book."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"The book I am reviewing is the Bantam Classic Edition translated and edited by A. Kent Hieatt and Constance Hieatt. This volume includes a critical introduction and a helpful glossary written by the editors.The text is arranged in a format utilizing a facing-page translation.Chaucer spoke and wrote in the London dialect of Middle English which was popular during his time. In THE CANTERBURY TALES he used the device of having a diverse group of people tell two tales each while traveling together on a pilgrimage from London to Canterbury, the location of the Shrine of St. Thomas A' Becket.Almost every social type of the fourteenth century is represented among the pilgrims such as a knight, lawyer, doctor, cook, miller, nun, merchant, monk, priest, squire and several others. Chaucer is also one of the pilgrims. Readers will recognize many of the characters as being reminiscent of their twenty-first century contemporaries. The physician, for instance, loves gold and makes a lot of money during times of pestilence. He also has a close and mutually profitable relationship with an apothecary.Anyone who recalls being introduced to Chaucer as a student long ago will find the modern texts and translations a welcome change.The result is a Chaucer who is understandable and very enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"I got this book for english class.its not modern english.but o well."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"I just adore Chaucer's Canterbury Tales.

The characters with holy occupations run the full spectrum of good and evil. The Prioress and the Monk are benign characters, with mostly harmless vices and tendencies. The Prioress attempts to be dainty and \\"to counterfeit a courtly kind of grace\\" (6). The Monk is described as a \\"fat and personable priest\\" who enjoys hunting and eating to the scholarly life in cloister (8).The first corrupt pilgrim we meet is the Friar, who \\"knew the taverns well in every town / And every inkeeper and barmaid too / Better than lepers, beggars, and that crew\\" (9). For a fee, the Friar grants confessions. He avoids the downtrodden in favor of the wealthy and \\"anywhere a profit might accrue\\" (9).Unlike the Friar, the Parson is the ideal country priest, living by example. He is poor \\"Yet he was rich in holy thought and work\\" (16). \\"Holy and virtuous was he, but then / Never contemptuous of sinful men\\" (17). Along with the Parson rides his brother, the Plowman, also an honest worker who lives by the Gospel: \\"he would help the poor / For love of Christ and never take a penny\\" (17).The Summoner rides with the Pardoner, and neither is described as a good man. With a pustular face, the Summoner scares children. He is \\"hot and lecherous as a sparrow\\" (20). His job gives him power over the diocese, since he summons people for excommunication. The Pardoner carries relics with him, and makes his money by selling \\"Our Lady's Veil\\" and a \\"gobbet of the sail\\" of St. Peter's boat (22). A salesman and a charlatan, the Pardoner reminds us of Brother Cipolla in Boccaccio's sixth day, tenth story.The pilgrims rationalize their weaknesses with their beliefs. The Wife of Bath says that Jesus \\"spoke to those that would live perfectly, / And by your leave, my lords, that's not for me\\" (261). Controlled by passion, she \\"never used discretion when in love / But ever followed on my appetite\\" (275). She quotes Paul's teaching to justify her many marriages.The Wife of Bath is not the only one grappling with the scripture to justify her behavior. Even Chaucer at the end makes a retraction of the text, possibly because of his personal faith or to prevent a backlash. In the final page, he prays \\"that Christ have mercy on me and forgive me my sins\\" (489). His retraction contains similarities to the \\"Author's Conclusion\\" in The Decameron. If his readers enjoy the tales, Chaucer urges them to praise God. If they were displeased with the tales, he invites them to blame his ability as a writer. He lists his body of work, retracting it all. However, as clever as Chaucer proves to be in the previous 480 pages, this list seems more like an advertisement than a renouncement."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"This is a very enjoyable reading of The Canterbury Tales, rendered into modern English verse. The tales are read by many voices, including those of Martin Jarvis, Jay Carnes, Ray Porter, John Lee, Malcolm Hillgartner, Ralph Cosham, Simon Vance. Appropriate accents are used by the readers.The price is right and the quality is excellent. The text is complete, except for a curious omission of the Guildsmen in the Prologue.The text of this audio book was originally published as Canterbury Tales: Rendered into Modern English by J.U. Nicolson, published by Garden City Publishing Company, Inc., New York (1934). The complete Nicolson rendering is available as a Dover Giant Thrift Edition; the prologue and selected tales are available as a Dover Thrift Edition.The update into Modern English is acceptable, and is a good choice for someone who has no mastery of Middle English, or would merely prefer to listen to a modern English reading. While Coghill does a better job of updating the text than Nicolson, this is a scholar's quibble - either edition is just fine.The only problem with this audio book is the lack of a listing of the contents by disk and track.

Please note that this version is Chaucer in the original Middle English, with easily accessible side notes and foot notes. This version is actually preferable to the Riverside Chaucer and the Norton Critical edition for simply reading and enjoying Chaucer in his original language. The Everyman's library edition is NOT a translation, and includes ALL the tales (unlike the Norton ed.). It's worthwhile reading Chaucer in the original Middle English, despite the difficulty for a modern reader, because of the beauty of the poetry, which can't be translated. The Everyman's edition is the easiest to use, as all the footnotes and glosses are complete and easily accessible on the same page with the text, not in back as with other editions. This edition is hardbound yet affordable and will last several lifetimes.If there were ever a \\"desert island book,\\" Chaucer's Canterbury Tales is it. His story-telling ability is without parallel, and his poetry is magnificent, even better than Shakespeare, which, of course, is not a completely fair comparison, since Middle English is a more musical language than Modern English. Compare, for example, the sound of Italian to the sound of modern English, and you'll know what I'm talking about. Check out, for starters, the Pardoner's Prologue and Tale (the basis for Bogart's Treasure of the Sierra Madre), the Nun's Priest's Tale, and the incomparable Wife of Bath's Prologue and Tale. Chaucer's Tales cover a wide tonal range, from hilarious farce, to mock-heroic, satirical, bawdy, to horrific, autobiographical, to High Chivalric and so on. Together they form a literary encyclopedia of Medieval life, history, and culture.Note: Amazon rather confusingly lumps together all the Canterbury Tales reviews for translations, partial editions, and etc."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"This version of the Canterbury Tales in modern English is brilliant. Nonetheless I was deeply disappointed in finding that the Parson's Tale was omitted completely, the reason being that &quot;it does not interest the general public&quot;. I disagree with such a sweeping statement."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"The paperback version has the original text of the tales on the left hand page and the modern translation on the right. The publisher does not provide any cues in formatting of the Kindle edition to show difference between the original text and the modern. The two texts run together making reading almost impossible."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Most people probably associate \\"The Canterbury Tales\\" with stuffy hoary old English professors and musty craggy libraries. It doesn't help that many english classes assign the Middle English text to students. Though the original language of the Tales doesn't present insurmountable difficulties for the modern English reader, many may find the task daunting nonetheless and completely miss out on all of the good stuff. This edition presents the tales in modern verse (while still maintaining the rhyming couplet form of the original). Numerous footnotes also illuminate the vocabulary of Chaucer's time (he worked on the tales from around 1387 up to his death in 1400).The tales trace the path of a group of pilgrims from the \\"The Tabard\\" Inn in Southwark, England to just outside the town of Canterbury. A host of interesting 14th century characters all agree to ride to the shrine of the martyr together. The host of the Inn decides to join them and makes things interesting with a contest: the person that tells the best tale along the way gets a free supper upon their return. The rest of the book then consists of twenty-four tales (Chaucer had planned over two hundred, but never finished the project) each told by a specific person linked by comments of the company. Thanks to his position as a foreign diplomat, Chaucer probably found inspiration from Bocaccio's \\"Decameron\\" (written around 1350) in the structure of this work.In the tales themselves, the culture of 14th century England comes alive. Not only that, great stories unfold. The Knight's tale, one of the longest, explores painful medieval love. Two brothers, Arcite and Palamon, in ancient Greece spot a beautiful woman, Emily, from their jail cell. They both declare their undying love for her, and vouch their lives to winning her hand. And since both men want her the two of course turn from loyal brothers into mortal enemies. With some strange luck and the help of the gods, one of them eventually triumphs.Some of the pilgrims don't get along too well. The Miller and the Reeve almost attack each other after hurling insults back and forth. The Miller tells a hilarious tale about Nicholas the Gallant who wants to sleep with an old carpeter's young gorgeous wife. He convinces the old man that another flood (akin to Noah's) is pending, and that he should sleep in a bathtub on top of his house. The old man buys the story, and Nicholas sets to his task. Another wooer of the young woman disrupts the couple, and ends up a victim of flatulence (but the giver of the stink ends up even worse). Since the carpenter was depicted as a fool in the tale, and the Reeve is a carpenter, he counter attacks with a tale about a stupid miller.The tales weave incredibly diverse stories. Some end in tragedy (e.g., the Physician's Tale in which a noble Knight must choose between turning his beautiful virtuous daughter over to a corrupt and lecherous judge or killing her out of respect for her honor), some in comedy. Others relate miracles or demonstrate a simple moral point. Yet others show the prejudices of the time, (the Prioress' Tale contains some nasty anti-semitism) or the fashions of the time (the Canon's Yeoman's Tale declares alchemy a fraud). At least one has a surprising feminist bent (The Wife of Bath's Tale, although 14th century values ultimately win out). Some of the more comical characters are the wards of the 14th century Church: the Pardoner, the Summoner, the Friar, and the Monk. All of them get depicted as hopelessly corrupt and hypocritical (in that they don't practice what they preach while having scruples about profiting from their church offices; corruption in the church was a fiery issue of the day).Two of the original prose tales, Chaucer's tale of Melibee and the Parson's tale, only appear in summary here. Chaucer's first tale gets rudely interrupted by the host who complains that \\"Your dreary rhyming isn't worth a turd!\\" Whether the character called \\"Chaucer\\" (the narrator in many sections) actually represented Chaucer himself remains controversial. The Parson's tale, the last in this book, reflects on the Seven Deadly Sins. Chaucer's \\"Retraction\\" appears directly afterwards. In this he excuses himself for any sin he may have committed in this book. So are the Canturbury tales supposed to be meditations on the sinful and sinless life? Since Chaucer didn't complete the project such questions remain somewhat speculatory (also, Chaucer didn't actually write most of the tales himself - this is a collection of tales mosty from other sources in the manner popular at the time - but he did rewrite them with his own vision in mind). What the Canterbury Tales ended up as, nonetheless, is a collection of romantic, baudy, raucous, tragic, and vastly entertaining stories that gorgeously reflect and effectively evoke Chaucer's times. This, maybe more than anything, helps explain why the book has seen continual publication since the fifteenth century."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Every English-speaker should read Chaucer. As Dante did for Italian, Chaucer did for English - making the English vernacular an accepted language to write literature with, standardizing usages by inspiring imitation, and making up or adopting literally hundreds upon hundreds of words into the language. Chaucer is where old English ends and Middle English begins.This translated version is okay if you just want to get the story out of the tales, but if you find you like Chaucer even the smallest bit I would strongly urge you to try reading the original Middle English. It honestly is not all that hard if you give it any effort at all and you will be richly rewarded - Chaucer's poetry is simply breathtaking. This translation is decent, but know that you are missing half the show."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"If you've ever considered reading this quintessential Chaucer classic in the original Middle English, don't. Read this version instead (unless you just happen to be really into Middle English). Neville Coghill does a masterful job of bringing the text into a form that is easily absorbed by the modern reader. The narrative flows smoothly in an inobtrusive meter, yet retains all the charm of the original version and enough of the old vocabulary to lose none of Chaucer's intended flavor. Helpful endnotes are sprinkled throughout to offer explanations of some of the more obscure allusions.As to the substance of the text itself, what can one say? The story is straightforward: a motley band of unforgettable characters from every walk of English society, brought together on pilgrimage, and entertaining themselves along the way with a friendly contest about who can spin the most rousing tale. Their offerings range from the noble to the cynical, the bawdy to the pious, and all shades in between. If you've never experienced the richness of The Canterbury Tales, this translation is an excellent choice. Heck, it's an excellent choice even if you have read it before. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Having tried to wade through a \\"non-modern english\\" version of The Canterbury Tales, I appreciate this book. It brings out Chaucer's playful language in a way that's more entertaining, because it's easier to understand. Re-reading some of the stories in this book, I was surprised by beautiful statements, amusing turns of phrase, and the sheer bawdiness of his writing.However, I gave this book three stars first becuase I don't put Chaucer on a level with Spenser or Malory, and second because this is a standard Penguin book, which means it's more stripped down than I like. I prefer footnotes to explain references that I might not be able to take in context. In something as heavily alligorical as Chaucer's work, I believe this is very important."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Alle that I can saye Is that these booke hath Mayde my daye Goode!

Keynes' \\"A treatise on probability\\" on this site which I bought but is useless, and similar comments by other buyers (on \\"Vanity Fair\\" by Thackeray; on \\"The Italian\\" by Radcliffe)"},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"In Chaucer's work, 'The Canterbury Tales', perhaps the greatest of English literary works from the period of the language known as Middle English, there is one particular piece that have always stood out for me.'A Clerk ther was of Oxenford also,'This is perhaps my favourite character, as when I first read it, it seemed to epitomise what I hoped for in my own life.'That unto logik hadde longe y-go.....For him was lever have at his beddes heedTwenty bokes, clad in blak or reed,Of Aristotle and his philosophye,Than robes riche, of fithele, or gay sautrye,But al be that he was a philosophre,Yet hadde he but litel gold in cofre,But al that he mighte of his freendes hente,On bokes and on lerninge he it spente,and bisily gan for the soules preyeOf hem that yaf him wherwith to scoleye........gladly wolde he lerne, and gladly teche.'Every now and then I cannot help but re-read this part of the Prologue, for a reminder of what I'm aiming for in my own life.Chaucer was son of a wine merchant, something near and dear to my heart. Chaucer was well-read, well-phrased, well-mannered, industrious in literary and legal/administrative pursuits, as I trust I will become, if not already so qualified.As one can see from the above examples, English has changed much over the past 600 years, but not so much as to make these passages unrecognisable. Compare for yourself with a modern translation, and see how much you can decipher.Chaucer is one of the first great English authors of name; most (but not all) literary output in English prior to this time was anonymous. Living in the 1300s, he held administrative posts of importance under Kings from the time of Edward III to Henry IV. Never one to shrink from spending too much money (he had to reapply for pensions and ask for advances several times in his life) or shying away from controversy (he fell out of and came back into favour several times). When he died, he was laid to rest in Westminster Abbey, in a section on the south side that has since become Poet's Corner, largely due to Chaucer, the first great English poet, having been buried there.In addition to his magnus opus, 'The Canterbury Tales', a collection of stories with prologue told by pilgrims on their journey to Canterbury (car radios and in-flight movies were rare in those days), Chaucer wrote minor poems to suit various occasions (his first record as poet comes from having written a poem as elegy on the death of John of Gaunt's first wife, Blanche, in 1369), and the major work for which he was noted for 'Troilus and Criseyde', which showed his sense of humour, power of observation and attention to detail, and keen dramatic skills in language. This work is often compared to Dante and Boccaccio, perhaps the most famous poets of the day. 'The Canterbury Tales' is actually intended to be much longer - 120 tales told by 30 pilgrims (two each on the way to Canterbury, and two each returning). As it is, there are only 24 tales plus a prologue - had it been completed, it would be by far the longest poem in the English language.There is a strong, practical side to Chaucer's writing, sophisticated yet not aloof and removed from the affairs of the world, cultured yet in tune with the better (and more interesting) aspects of the common people, too.This edition by A. Kent Hieatt and Constance Hieatt is designed for those who want the major portions of the Canterbury Tales. Be advised, this is not a complete or annotated set, and the translations from Middle English to modern idiom, while good, do not come with notes to explain possible choices and phrases. This is a book to give the flavour of the major stories, and is designed for readers who want the story rather than the details. As a Bantam book, it is designed for the undergraduate or general reader, and serves this audience well.For those who want the Canterbury Tales in basic form, this might well be the volume to get."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"...combines reviews. One person reviews the CD version of the book, while another reviews a modern interpretation of the middle english. I am here to review the book at hand, which is \\"Canterbury Tales\\" by Geoffrey Chaucer, published by Everyman's library.First off, the book is complete, and rendered in middle English, so it is not for the faint of heart. Notes are given in the margins, although these generally seem useless (if you read the book aloud, you will understand most of the phrases they \\"translate\\", even though your eyes won't believe what your mouth just spoke). Of far greater value are the footnotes to many of the lines, which render in a modern sense some of the more obscure greetings, curses, idioms, etc. the reader is likely to find. Unfortunately, looking down at the footnotes will break your rhythm, and it can be difficult to find your place again, with so many unfamiliar words staring at you. I wish the editors(presenters?) would have put THESE footnotes in the margins, instead of the simpler fare found there (however, I understand that some people may not read the book as easily as I did).The work itself seems complete, however, although I am no scholar of Chaucer. Even the Parson's Tale is found here (it is deleted in many works, since it is little more than a maudlin sermon), although I would skip it if I were you. The poetry is incredibly pleasing to the ear, if offensive to the eye; I cannot stress enough that one should read the book aloud to hear its greatness.I won't review the work, since I feel I have no right to criticise Chaucer. However, the presentation here is good, with the exception of the footnote problem. While this edition is not for the faint of heart (it takes real work to read), I would recommend it to anyone who wants to actually hear the words Chaucer heard in his own head as he wrote this."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"This is not easy to read in Kindle format.

It would be alright if we could view it page by page (in it's original format), but without that option it's harder to understand. (Yes, it's obvious which part is which, but finding where it stops and starts takes away from the reading experience.

But the selections are winning, and Barbara Cohen's telling, which reduces Chaucer's Middle English to charming fairytale language is well done.Equally effective are the color illustrations by Trina Schart Hyman.Not having seen William Blake's 1809 illustration of Canterbury Tales, I was surprised and disappointed to see he only did one illustration (the pilgrims leaving the Tabard Tavern for their journey to Canterbury), and Ms Hyman has him beat a mile. She even makes some of the implicit elements of the stories refreshingly clear.Take, for example, the illustration in the Pardoner's Tale of the three rogues discovering gold coins under the tree. They had left an alehouse in search of Death, who had just killed a friend of theirs, and had met a withered old man on the road. With great insolence, they insulted, accused, and threatened him if he would not tell they where they could find Death. The old man directs them to a tree in a grove.Ms Hyman, in her illustration, shows the old man was really Death in disguise. He is now the frightening figure behind the tree, with the skull face and his walking stick now the grim reaper's scythe. A brilliant touch!"},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"I love the Canterbury Tales. Normally, I'd just leave it at that, but I can't this time.

These twenty-nine characters, from the knight to the pardoner, describe everyday occupations during the medieval period. Chaucer uses sharp wit and occasional dirty humor to emphasize the moral lessons each tale teaches. Not only do the tales themselves teach us, but the characters that tell them. Chaucer has been brilliant to create the exalted knight, gentle prioress, rowdy miller, lively squire, and more!

Being a Medevial book of litererary renown written in poetic language, and a book about people on, well, a holy piligramage, I expected it to be more nurturing to the soul.If you ask me, it is no better than a late-night television cartoon written in a deceptively intelligent language and given a medevial setting There is nothing really noteworthy about the plot, and while its characters were colorful at times (in the case of, say, the Wife of Bath) they were the most assembled from stereotypical moulds (for instance, the Knight.) Many of the stories were choppily done, in fact, a few of them were left half-way unfinished, which was highly annoying. There is no sense of real momentum at all, as it is merely a bunch of randomly assorted short stories that have no connection to eachother and rarely possess deep meanings, and most of the stories are morally disgusting.Really, the book has little purpose other than to give the occasional thrill if you ask me, though I suppose it does achieve something in introducing the unlearned to more vile and double-dealing aspects of human nature (wether or not that is necessary is arguable.) Even the Nun's story had stupid thing against it- the Jews connive to kill a little boy, and in the end \\"are all put in jail.\\" I'm not even talking about Jewish characters, the author just put \\"The Jews.\\" The only truly inspiring story I could think of is the Second Nun's, or perhaps the Knight's. For the most part, it wasn't highly intelligent or spiritual reading at all.The Rainbow Side:It was highly entertaining to read, for the most part. A lot of the stories have a interesting details and storylines (such as the lavish Knight's tale and the expressively ridiculous Wive's tale). By saying that the book had little plot, I meant the book as a whole. Quite of a few of the stories did have good twists and turns. A great deal of their entertainment value, of course, came from their lack of morality. They are replete with who men who switch beds with other men's wives and old men who marry young girls who deceive the old men and lay with younger men. Of course, stories like these are hard to put down, as disgusting as they are. I was annoyed with myself for reading it, really."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"As I was reading the book I was confused because the book starts with the intro about the author of the tales.

Coghill's melodious verse captures the timely flow of the original text, thus preventing the reading from becoming a slow and erudite undertaking. Chaucer's Tales were not designed for sluggish meditation, but to be read aloud in an engaging manner, which is what makes this translation an ideal buy for those who wish to experience the Tales for their original charm.The immortal Canterbury Tales is a must for all lovers of great literature. What we can witness in this noble poem \\"is the concise portrait of an entire nation: high and low, old and young, male and female, rogue and righteous, land and sea, town and country\\", as Nevill Coghill describes in his introduction to this translation. The past has become magical to us through the great works of Epic poetry; where the Greeks had Homer, and the Roman's Virgil; the English have none other than Geoffrey Chaucer.It is only infrequently that we can find classic ideas that have captured readers throughout the ages, be it Pickwick's proposed adventure to study his fellow men, Dante's quest for his beloved Beatrice, or indeed Chaucer's undying Pilgrimage; The Canterbury Tales manifests its own unique appeal in an immortal journey through the Tales of many different voices.On the Eve of a Pilgrimage from a London Cheapside Inn to St Thomas a Becket's shrine in Canterbury, a group of thirty pilgrims are challenged by the inn's Host to a competition: to while away their morrow's journey by each telling a tale; on returning to London their Host will then decided the best storyteller: and their reward? a luxurious meal on behalf of that Pilgrim's fellows. What follows are many tales, of many varieties: those of courtly love, bawdy comedy, fresh wit, menacing macabre, didactic fables, in short, to use John Dryden's words \\"God's plenty\\".But it is the prologue to Chaucer's great collection of tales that marks its individuality from the Likes of Ovid, Petrarch and Boccaccio - of whom some of the tales are largely indebted to. The translator of this edition advocates that \\"in all literature there is nothing that touches or resembles the prologue\\". And this is by all means a cogent argument: what we witness at the beginning of Tales is patchwork quilt of Medieval England, a Tapestry of Chaucer's times, or if you like: a doorway into a world long faded away.The prologue simply follows the task of introducing the diverse tellers of the Tales, and yet in doing so it records a valuable sample of history. William Blake faithfully promulgates the Prologue's vitality by declaring that: \\"Chaucer is himself the great poetical observer of men, who in every age is born to record and eternize its acts\\". The Pilgrims are not only well presented characters, they are also true embodiments of normality. What we see in the Tales is not just a snap-shot of Olde England, but something indeed far bigger: a blueprint of our own society's individuals - \\"the perennial progeny of men and women\\". What Chaucer portrays to us in his Canterbury Tales is nothing greater than our very selves."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Chaucer wrote the Canterbury Tales in \\"Middle English\\" (not quite like Beowulf and what's written today but in between) and this version is fairly easier to read because it's written in modern language. If you want the challenge read the Norton edition, but this is good for beginners and people that really don't want to spend time reading the Middle English with all those footnotes. However, even with the Modern English, it's a lot easier to read but perhaps not as easy to understnad and decipher the tales.Now for the book, historically, the novel outlines the importance of the Church on the country and how in England, the church had become something that was seeking material wealth and status instead of any spiritual growth. Also, it shows the harsh feudal system that ruled the era. Chaucer explains that fourteenth century England was filled with people in pursuit of wealth and power, and that this was also the cause of the problems of his society. It is told as different tale's of pilgrims venturing together on a pilgrimage. The tales are important in understanding the time and culture, basically that's why it's a classic and it's also the first work of poetry written in the English language; so pretty important."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"The Bantam edition (ISBN 0-553-21082-3), edited, introduced and translated by Peter G. Beidler, is inexpensive but readable. I like having the original on one side and a translation on the other because it enables me to make an attempt at reading the original and then check my comprehension with the translation. The introduction and notes are informative but not intrusive. It's true that only ten of the tales are included but there is enough to keep you busy for awhile. I recommend this if you are looking for an inexpensive and portable edition."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Although it does not include ALL the tales, most of which were never completed, this is a wonderful edition because:1. the Middle English orginal text is on the left hand side.2. the translation is on the right hand side.3. each tale has a summary preceding it.4. all explanatory notes follow the summary to each tale.5. excellent translation of each.6. essays at the beginning set the stage and include Chaucer's bio, setting of religion, why the pilgramage to Canterbury was being made, and so forth.7. incredible low price for such an edition.I found that picking up the tempo and pronounciation of Middle English was rather easy. Especially helpful if you adopt a sort of Irish/Londoner accent and read aloud.To sum, hard to go wrong with this edition."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"I was trying to find an illustrated version of the original Chaucer as a wedding gift for a friend of mine, and found this one. I didn't realize (my fault--it's in the Publisher's Weekly review) that this was a child's version of the classic. The illustrations are nice, and, quite frankly, I haven't read the author's interpretation, but I wanted to make it clear to folks that it's not the original text, nor even an unabridged translation."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"If you, reader, are willing to put a little time---not that much, really---this is your \\"Canterbury Tales.\\" The editors have kept most of the Middle English, with modern typography and some modern spellings, and have put the glossary, those needed words, to the side of the line of verse. I found this helpful. I could reach the Middle English and glance to the margin for help here and there. The introduction has help on pronunciation. In the end, I was reading aloud to myself in middle English and found the text no more slow-going than other English-language poetry, easier to reach and understand than John Donne.I discovered that the work is, in Middle English, funnier than the translations let on. The rhymes themselves are humorous. The poem also is earthier than the translators suggest. Why don't you memorize and recite the opening in Middle English. Amaze your friends. Be the life of the party. Come on, what else were you going to do with your time?"},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Chaucer is an author with unusual staying power. Sure we read classical writing and appreciate it but it doesn't seem to have the impact that Chaucer's Canterbury tales still have on us. We can see ourselves and our foibles in the pilgrims he writes about and the stories he attributes to them. To think that this was written in a time period we relegate as a time period of ignorance and religion! We can imagine that even in a time where superstition ruled there were still people that that saw the world quite similarly as we do today and certainly Chaucer was among that group.This version is incredibly well translated and provides a succinct introduction including a nice brief biography of the author. Also the notes are pretty good - I just wish they were footnoted rather than all in the notes section.So if you if you think reading a work that is six hundred years old might be a little boring start in out of sequence and go right to the second tale - The Millers Tale. Like something straight out of a Jerry Springer show if this story doesn't give reason to laugh than I don't know what will. The only hang up you may have is reading in the metered format that the tales are written in. I will say that it is not difficult to get the rhythm o the words and before long you won't even notice. The book is relatively thick but it is fast reading so don't be discouraged by that - its well worth it. Reading Chaucer gives a glimpse of how the secular mind worked in the middle ages. He provides straightforward writing that isnt simple but yet isnt overly complex verbose. Without being totally austere he can tell interesting stories quickly and, since (as we all know) brevity is the essence of wit, be remarkably funny.If you are reading this for school you should be excited to know that not only are you reading a seminal work of secular English writing that is referenced throughout our culture. Also it is actually fun to read. If you are thinking about reading this just for fun you are doing the right thing I waited too long to pick this book up and but I am really glad I did it is thoroughly enjoyable and while while a little historical background may help I doubt you will need a degree in history to appreciate this one.-- Ted Murena"},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales is perhaps the best literary work of the Middle Ages. He paints a lucid picture of life during this time period and his familiarity with every social class, as well as his vivid and comical descriptions of his unique characters, makes this poetic book charming. Chaucer embraces several genres, some of which include romance, satire, and fabliau. He uses the voice of a naive narrator. However, one should not conclude that the point of view expressed is his entirely because this may very well be literary trickery. Canterbury Tales is as modern and entertaining today as it was six hundred years ago, with themes such as the corruption of the church, which ironically is still prevalent today."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"The wife Bath Tale opens up with a Prologue.

There's nothing in the way of analysis or notes; after a brief introduction that lays out who Chaucer was and where the tales come from, he lets it rip.The tales themselves are deserving of their fame because of the way that they manage to be maintain a literary value and yet still appeal to the masses. While each tale stands alone (and some of them stand alone very well indeed), the device of a group of disparate strangers stuck together that comprises the frame is exceptionally captivating. There's something very neat and pat about the concept: two tales each on the way, and two tales each on the way back.Even though this was obviously never accomplished, we still get fun interaction between the principles, and get a feel for what the entire project would have looked like (like a thicker book, I suppose, but I digress).That Chaucer used this unifying element to bring together stories from other sources is to his credit, because the variety of sources adds to the concept, by creating starkly different tales that ably bear out the voices of their various tellers.If you have any sort of interest at all in the classics, or have enjoyed the stories to be found in traditional folklore and the greek myths, I urge you to give this edition a shot when trying Chaucer."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"If you haven't read the Canterbury Tales in their native language than you are missing out. It isn't very hard, once you get in the flow of things it becomes just like reading anything else. The Bantam edition allows you to read the translated or the native version.

I was looking for a fuller picture of the tales, yet the translaters picked the tales that they fealt were the most important and I did enjoy it very much. For any of you out there that want to read the full Canterbury Tales in Middle-English I would suggest the Norton Anthology of Middle English Literature. That is Volume 1A of their English literature Anthology. It shows the full story without any translations. It is very exstensively annotated though, so you can decipher the Middle-English vocabulary.No matter what edition you read though, your in for a genuine literary treat."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Chaucer, the father of English uses the &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; to define a time period not known to many. Like many poets he uses and wrote for the specific contexts within which he lived. His works are like a mirrror to his time. During this time there were many medieval and courtly romances to pursue one another to a direct point. Being a engrossed student and an avid reader Chaucer knows just what his feelings are and expresses them quite frequently throughout his work. The Canerbury Tales, is a story of pilgrims that come together and set off on a pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Thomas. Chaucer made his groups of pilgrims into a picture of the society of his time of which the like is not to be found elsewhere. In the journey there are men of a variety including a squire, physic, a man of law, carpenter ,and a knight to name a few. Also a wife of bath who tries greatlty to show her defense of being married five times. This is a story that Chaucer puts together brillantly to show the effects upon life during his time. The contrast between apperence and reality are use of the general prologue and Chaucer's great power of vivid description. The Canterbury Tales still remain, to a larger extent, a measure of the English society of the 14th century as it covers a cross-section of the society of that time era."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"G.

There seems to have been a product crossover between this and a modern English tape.Having read the Canterbury Tales I think Shakespeare, the \\"canonical\\" classic English writer, does not compare to Chaucer. The Canterbury Tales are so extensive, whimsical and vibrant that I they should overturn Shakespeare as the celebrated English texts.Chaucer presents us with an entire universe - the England of his time. Over a dozen people from all walks of life tell their tales, women and men, rich and poor, criminal and saintly. Reading the Tales is like reading a textbook on medieval England, but one that's come to life and had been soaked with the warmth of Chaucer. He mocks any and all aspects of society and is not above toilet humour - but for me this hardly detracted from the work, instead making it more real and unelitist. In fact it is largely due to Chaucer and his unelitist use of the vernacular English that the movement of using the language of the people for literature started.Of course there are difficulties. The work is in Middle English. But please please please don't read a \\"translation\\" into Modern English! The original is so musical, so understandable that the extra effort in decoding does not compare to how it appears. I'd imagine a translation to be very flat unless the translator was almost divinely inspired. Chaucer's language is not that difficult, just read aloud and phonetically and follow the rhythm and rhyme of the verse. This will make most words easy to understand.Some tales (esp. the 2 prose tales) have been considered boring by many readers. Still, get an edition like this that includes them all. In Chaucer's overview of England, you won't find everything interesting. You won't laugh at all the jokes, some of the humour will be lost on us all through the 6+ centuries separating us and him. Sometimes he will be overbearing, pompous, dogmatic. But as a whole, the work still does an amazing job at describing medieval life: in terms of satire, language, poetry and meaning."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"I read Chaucer's \\"Canterbury Tales\\" in Middle English in college. I also read them in a paperback version that \\"updated\\" the language. Both versions were a lot of fun to read -- I say \\"fun\\" even though reading such a long tale from so long ago in poetic form isn't easy. Still, I was very impressed with the way Chaucer told his story. I confess I was awed that a writer from 700 years ago could frame his tale around a long journey and people it with specific characters, each of them very, very real, from how they looked to how they spoke. On top of that, I was impressed with the way each traveler's chosen tale revealed something about that particular traveler: the Miller's Tale could not be told by the Prioress, for example, or vice versa. Each tale said something about the values of each teller.I don't know how the versions I read relate to this particular \\"translation.\\" My review is really about \\"The Canterbury Tales\\" themselves, not about this particular edition.

Sometimes the readers are a little one-note, but once they get into the stories, they all tend to liven up. I will say that they did bring the stories to life, and I have vivid images from listening to their renditions.Recording: Not great. This is the fourth audio CD I've gotten from Naxos, and usually their quality is terrific. This one, however, is so soft, and the levels vary so much, that it was almost impossible for me to listen to it in the car--which was the reason I got it. If you're buying audio recordings for a commute, sadly, I can't recommend this one. The readers would sometimes drop to whispers, and the recording engineers couldn't/didn't adjust, making some of the dialogue absolutely inaudible.

I'd definitely recommend this seller."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Had wanted to read this for about 15 years, but it's funny how more books are published and then you have to read them? How 'bout that? This book has been out six centuries, so I guessed another 15 years would not hurt me. Chaucer's facility with language, his ability to rhyme, his familiarity with the human condition, and his ability to link the human conditions to elements of people's trades and careers at this time truly make this book one which paved the way for many other satires, multi-person narratives, and rich, nuanced tales of particular events at particular times.This book is endlessly satisfying. I found Chaucer's poetry to be very intelligent, with allusions to the work of the day, to cultural references, to fashion, to religious beliefs, to prominent figures in the world at that time, and most of all, to allowing his imagination not to be limited by expectations on the limits of his writing. The stories in the book come via the relating of experiences told by travelers on their way to Canterbury. At times, the stories are considered too dry or too preposterous or perhaps they are too derivative. But Chaucer imbues the multiple characters, the minister's wife, the metalworker, the barrister, the civil servant, with characters who respond as mentioned to stories, if the stories are not seen to be up to scratch. Many of the stories concern sexual hijinx. Some concern convoluted family relations, some concern work concerns. Chaucer's currency with the lives and ways of many in 14th century England make the book rich and satisfying. He was a master poet and it seemed that Chaucer enjoyed spinning these tales for the more privileged who would have read this book at first. It is not surprising, however, that the book has remained current. The interests, themes, and topics from which Chaucer very ably spins his tales remain relevant today."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"The Canterbury Tales is so appealing due to it's diverseness. Chaucer was involved with every level of society during his time. This is shown with how the characters are so well-rounded. The short, but insightful description of the travelers is also helpful in picturing this group riding on thier way to the shrine of Becket. A great book everyone should read, but one of those you have to be in the mood for. Also don't expect a continuing theme or story, but short stories that sometimes leaves you hanging."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Book is very well written (translated) and maintains the feel of Olde English and the references to God (unusual these days).

A storytelling contest between pilgrims on their way to Canterbury. This is probably the best translation I have read. It does have some downfalls the author excluded some of the tales including the Parson's tale which is actually meant to be a conclusion(Chaucer died before he could finish the tales). Other than that the book is very good. It does break some myths and sterotypes we have about people of that time and some of the stroies are rather humorous and could still be considered humorous in todays society."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"This version of the Canterbury Tales (Everyman) contains all of the tales (including the rather tedious prose tales), and is in the original language. As anyone planning to read the Tales will be aware, old English is not easy! This book takes a lot of time to read. Is it worth it?Yes. But a qualified yes. As an insight into life during this time in history, and particularly as a demonstration of how little humans have changed over the centuries, this book is very useful. Many of the tales are quite amusing and interesting. On the other hand, many tales are filled with rather drawn out, tedious sections, and a couple are just plain boring.For a person who wishes to read most of the major English classics, this book must be read, and I think the only way to really appreciate it is in its original form, not in modernised English. For this purpose, the Everyman version is excellent, as it features convenient gloss on each page, so looking up difficult words can be done at a glance, which disturbs the flow a lot less. I would highly recommend trying to read the book in as short a space of time as possible, though, because you do get used to the grammar and vocabulary, and while it is fresh in your mind, it allows you to read the rest of the book with a lot less glossing.Be aware that I read this book for personal interest, not as part of any particular course, so I am reviewing from the point of view of a general reader, not a literary scholar."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"The book stated in was in \\"good\\" shape, but I was say it is a little less than good, but still useable.

I look forward to reading the other tales independently. For all who like to have people raise their eyebrows as they see you reading such a prestigious sounding book (which, unlike Shakespeare, requires little explanation if you are familiar with the times) you should look into this work. Chaucer does an excellent job hiding sub-plots within the compelling tales. This is a classic which I will read without being forced to by my own will for a 4.0 GPA :-). Its clever rhyming scheme keeps interest during the slower spots (which are few and far between).

Then, when you finally figured it out, it was something maybe KIND OF funny, in a satirical yet also juvenile way.

There are some redeeming tales however, such as the Knight's Tale, but as a whole, this book should be avoided by anyone with a sense of honour and decency."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Chaucer's Canterbury Tales is a widely discussed collaboration of tales that depict various groups of people in many different assessments. In The Wife of Bath, the portrayal of women is extremely controversial. The question of whether Chaucer was a misogynist or supported women's liberation is a passionately discussed topic. Based upon Chaucer's various portrayals of women, he was not a male chauvinist who desired superiority over women. Chaucer portrayed women through his opinion as an Englishman in Medieval England, where the common view was that women were subordinate to men. This is seen in the Wife of Bath's contradictory personality as well as the characters of her tale.To understand the importance of feminist criticism, it is important to know what it is and stands for. Feminist literary criticism is the term for analyzing literary works through the examination of female points of view, concerns, and values in comparison with the time period and culture. In Mary Wollenstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights Women, she asserts the observation \\"Women, I argue from analogy, are degraded by the same propensity to enjoy the present moment; and, at last, despise the freedom which they have not sufficient virtue to struggle to attain.\\" One of the primary purposes of feminist literary criticism is concerned with \\"uncovering the contingencies of gender\\" as a cultural, social, and political system and instrument of domination. (Jehlen) Meaning, that their goal is uncover any iniquities placed upon women due to cultural setting, political standpoints, or social foundations.Although there are immutable biological differences between men and women, these differences create various social differences in different societies. One society may be completely different than another, at least in their treatment of the separation of gender. Also, in a patriarchal society, such as England in Chaucer's time, the separation of gender involves more than just social differences, but also the idea that sexual differences are the same as sexual inequality (. Rigby) It is inequitable to be judgmental of Chaucer and his views of women, as anti-feministic as they are, because Chaucer was from a completely different social construct and historical time period.Through Chaucer's Wife of Bath, as well as the characters in her tale, he portrays various views of women within Chaucer's time. He represents women as unchaste and unruly in the Wife of Bath, Dame Alice. He also depicts women as helpless and overlooked in the raped maiden of The Wife of Bath's Tale. The queen within the tale is shown as gracious. However, the women questioned by the knight portray a sense of only worldly desire. The old woman shows the wisdom of women, although it seems that she is submitting herself to her husband, she has control over him.His portrayal of Dame Alice is the antithesis of the stereotype for women in Chaucer's time. She was not pure an innocent, as she confessed that \\"I won't remain altogether chaste\\" Alice was not submissive to each of her husbands, she chose to rule over them. She strikes fear into the town and its parish to the point where she gets and does whatever she wants. The fear and respect the town has for her is seen in lines 459-463 of the General Prologue: \\"In all the parish not a dame dared stir, Towards the altar steps in front of her, And if indeed they did, so wrath was she as to be quite put out of charity\\" The Wife becomes such a powerful feministic force, at times, by being able to masquerade around town with the qualities and luxuries of being a man and appears to be so happy not following the typical and stereotypical roles set for women at her time and throughout most of history. The Wife of Bath is a zealous woman who freely admits to all the lust, the conniving and the egocentricity that defines her. Dame Alice has radical views about women and their position within a marriage, especially for a time when women were expected to be passive within a marriage. This direct opposition to previously set roles for women is what defines her character.However, the Wife of Bath, while seemingly an example of feminism in all of her qualities, is actually inconsistent with herself.. She is, instead, a mockery of herself. The Wife of Bath is inconsistent in her belief structure. While, at times, she claims to be able to beguile her husbands into doing whatever she wants, creating a view of herself as strong and independent, she often gave into what her husband would want. She freely admits that men are far more intelligent than women appear to be in lines 440-442 of her Prologue \\"One of us two must give in, without a doubt; / And since a man is more reasonable/ than woman is, youmust be patient \\"Nevertheless, since I know your pleasure I'll satisfy your physical pleasure\\". In this quote the Wife of Bath not only concedes that men are more reasonable than women, but also that a good woman and wife will do and give up whatever is necessary for her husband to be satisfied. If the Wife had really been what she appeared to be externally, she would not have admitted that men, in a general stereotype, could contain more reason and intelligence than women could. This quotation leaves an unanswered contradiction about the Wife of Bath. Chaucer easily contradicts the Wife of Bath by showing and telling more personal sides of the Wife of Bath and thus proves her to be much more of a hypocrite and much less of a archaic feminist then originally thought. The Wife also diminishes herself, and all women, by explaining that all women can be bought, in lines 413-417 of her Prologue. \\"And Therefore I tell every man this truth,/ Let whoever can, win, for everything is for sale,/ With an empty hand men cannot lure hawks,/ For a price I would endure his lust,/ And make myself a pretend appetite\\" The other travelers within The Canterbury Tales also accept her as a rebellion of women's position. The Pardoner requests that the Wife teach them. This also defies biblical and cultural standings on women's positions, as teachers, that they are not to teach over them, as explained in 1 Timothy 2:11-12 of the Judeo-Christian Bible.The Wife of Bath also reverses the roles of Husband and Wife in some of her descriptions of her marriage, as in lines 154-159 of the Wife's Prologue:\\"A Husband I will have, I will not desist, / Who shall be both my debtor and my slave, / And have his troubles along with it/ Upon his flesh while I am his wife, / I have the authority all my life/ Over his body and not he\\"She is dictating that she will have total control over herself, her husband, and their household, contradictorily to cultural and biblical standards, as discussed by C.S. Lewis in his work \`Mere Christianity', \\"The function of the husband is to see that this natural preference if hers is not giving its head. He has the last word to protect the other people from the intense family patriotism of the wife\\" The Wife sees the relationship between men and women as a battle in which it is crucial to gain the upper hand. She uses tactics, which were seen as the only stereotypical form of defense for women: sexuality, duplicity, and vulnerability. Her armor was indeed necessary. Medieval England presented women as second class citizens, viewed as goods and chattels, with no financial independence. They were often beaten, and it is clearly in the Wife's nature to protect herself. She uses weapons like her sexuality and her youth to make her husbands suffer, so much so that they feel impotent. This weapon was highly effective with first three husbands who she managed to dominate, \`But since I had them completely in my hand' and they handed over all of his land and property as she withheld sex in order to get her own way with them.The Wife also used a weapon of deceit and she claims that women have this weapon from birth. She tells her audience that she would deliberately pickarguments and accuse her husbands of the very sins she herself is guilty of, because she admits that attack is the best form of defense. The Wife claims that all the other wives are better treated than herself, and commonly uses her weapon of nagging. She accuses her husbands of being cheap, complaining about extravagance of the neighboring women. She easily attains power over her first three husbands in this way, as they usually submitted for the sake of peace, as she notes, \`They were most happy when I spoke fairly to them,/ For God knows I nagged them spitefully./ The Wife ruled over her husbands.The maid in The Wife of Bath was a small character role, and yet her fleeting moment in the story is extremely important. The characteristics of this woman seem to have the ability to go to all women. She is vulnerable and innocent, as she is still a maiden. The only thing known about this woman is that she was overpowered by the knight and severely taken advantage of. \\"From which maid at once, in spite of her protests,/ By sheer force he stole her maidenhood\\" This example of male domination within a tale is not atypical. Chaucer shows women's weakness in her.In the Queen, Chaucer shows the graciousness of women, as fickle as it might appear. Despite the fact that the Queen knows of the wrongdoing of this man, she begs for his life. It is ironic that she, a woman, is fighting for this man's life after what he had done to another woman.The various women that the knight questioned provide insight as to what Chaucer thought about women. The majority of the answers that the knight acquired were monetary or tangible, such as money, fine clothes, lust, or beauty. Once the idea that women \\"take we great delight/ in being considered dependable and trustworthy. / and able to hold steadfastly to one purpose, / and not betray things men tell us\\" However, this idea, which was the only virtuous answer was quickly dismissed because it was allegedly \\"not worth a rake handle\\" It was not plausible for a woman to be considered virtuous, which is ironic, since being virtuous was the feminine stereotype.The old woman, which gave the knight the correct answer, shows the wisdom of women. She required the knight to pledge his honor to her before she revealed the answer. This was wise of her; it caused the knight to base his later decisions on everything he stood for. She was foul and haggard in appearance. The knight was excruciatingly upset at the fact that he needed to marry her due to her appearance, age, and class.Women were portrayed in various different ways, through the Wife of Bath as well as the characters of her tale. Chaucer did not hold any animosity against women or strongly desire to subdue them, he merely believed what he knew, which was female subordination within his society."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Why did I think this rendition of The Cantebury Tales was translated into modern English? It is the second of three items purchased from Amazon, and a second disappointment. Perhaps I should not shop online. Regardless, it is a classic and, I suspect, not read by nearly as many who would enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"average, boring later half of book. Interesting thoughts though."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Early this year, I took a trip to the Huntington library in Los Angeles where I saw a copy of an early manuscript of the \\"Canterbury Tales\\" and a little voice told me it was time I read this classic I had heard about most of my life but had never touched, not in high school or college.I knew nothing about the \\"Canterbury Tales\\" other than it was very old and written by Geoffrey Chaucer. I only vaguely knew it wasn't written in modern day English. I knew that I wanted to read the book in middle English because of a quaint notion that I needed to hear Chaucer's voice speak to me over the centuries. I might not understand much of it but at least I would have the experience, like with Shakespeare of a kind of intimacy was the text.The first attempt at the \\"Tales\\" was a Norton critical edition but I purchased it before realizing it only contained nine of the tales. So then I searched for a more expansive edition that contained all of them, even the fragments and the often discarded, Parson's tale. That lead me to this one edited by A.C. Cawley. It cost me $3 dollars and was published in 1975 which gave the book itself a ye olde flavor. Add to that the musty smell and I felt very comfortable with my book.Cawley doesn't over do the glosses and annotations to Chaucer's tales but he select the seemingly right word or phrase to offer up in modern English that helped my comprehension. I should admit that I used two other aids, Peter Ackroyd's retelling and also an Oxford guides to the Canterbury Tales. They were useful and I will review them separately.So what to make of the classic itself? My overarching feeling was that Geoffrey Chaucer must have had a devilish glint in his eye. That for all the piety, the religious sentiments and moral teaching contained in the tales, I came away with the sense that he didn't take any aspect of humanity too seriously. He saw in himself and others the absurdist, contradictory, peevish, sinful, humorous makeup of humanity. I relate to him because of that. Other thoughts are that it sucked to be female during those times as women had no autonomy, being forever tethered to a husband or father or cast aside as a widow or nun. And yet men feared women's sexuality to such an extent that it could cut short a woman's life through no fault of her own. The other thought is about how a religious world view was front and center and commerce was a minor matter. Yes, people wanted to be rich and powerful but only if it didn't jeopardize ones standing with God. And many occupations were somehow connected to the church, it was the corporate state in its day."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"The Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey ChaucerThis ebook is probably the best place to start with Chaucer, father of English poetry and the originator of comedy in the English language."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"This is a good translation.

The Canterbury Tales, as mentioned in most of the review prior to mine, recounts the soujourn of twenty-nine pilgrams to Canterbury. Chaucer had original intended, or so it would seem, to write four tales for each pilgrim--two to be told going to Canterbury and two to be told on the return from Canterbury. It is very likely that Chaucer omitted the twenty-five or so tales that he did for a stoutly religious reason--that once you meet God in your life (which was the intent of a pilgramage) there is no returning. This is why the pilgrims are never seen leaving Canterbury. In all, the tales tell a very strong moral tale. Nearly every line of this wonderful work can be interpreted with a religious overtone and it is no doubt that Chaucer intended for it to be this way. In closing I would like to make reference to a review I read on this page. The short story for in no way came out of this work. The development of the short story can only be attributed Edgar Allan Poe. To suggest that the short story evolved from this would be a grave error. That aside this is a wonderful tale on the surface level and a morally deep tale if you chose to read into it."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"This translation allows you to read the stories, which often are in poetry, with pleasure.

They are actually more enjoyable if read in the old English language, although it is a bit difficult to understand. These tales were penned as poetry by Geoffrey Chaucer sometime between 1380 and 1390. Chaucer is extremely funny if crude, and each of these twenty-four tales is a gem in it's own right. He has based his format on 24 mythical pilgrims that are travelling together to get to a religious shrine. This type of religious pilgrimage was extremely popular in Chaucer's day. Anyway, they help to pass the time of their travels by each telling a tale. These individual tales enable the reader to get a very clear glimpse of the personality of each of the storytellers. The tales are all different and range from bawdy to religious sermons, but they are highly entertaining. I have read these tales numerous times and I never grow tired of rereading them."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"It's easy to forget how enchanting and how modern Chaucer was.

Nothing of course is better than the real thing, but I suggest this always as a happy second."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"What would it be like if you had to make a very long journey on horse back? Pretty boring, right? But what if someone had the brilliant idea of telling stories on the way there? That would make the trip go a lot faster. This is the premise of the Canterbury Tales. There are a lot of people who all want to go to the shrine of St. Thomas a Becket at Canterbury Cathedral. They all met at a pub when the pub owner said that they should all tell one story on the way there and one on the way back. The version of the Canterbury tales only consists of four of the one hundred twenty eight that were told.The first story that is told by the Nun's priest. This story is about a poor widow who lives on a farm. As you get further in this story it starts retelling the story of a chicken and a hen. This chicken had many wonderful hens around him. \\"This noble rooster ruled over seven hens, whose work it was to please him. They were his sisters and his wives.\\" (pg. 20) But there was one hen named Lady Pertelote that he liked the most. One night he had a dream about a fox eating him. The next morning he told Lady Pertelote and she thought it didn't mean anything. A couple of days later a fox tricked him to shut his eyes and then the fox snuck up behind him and snatched him in his mouth. He was saved by the widow.The next person to tell was the pardoner. His story was about greed. There were three people who were searching for death because they heard of all the horrible things he had done and wanted to kill him. While on their way they met an old man who told the men, \\"If you're so anxious to find Death, turn up this crooked road. I left him in that grove, under a tree and there he'll stay.\\" (pg. 41) So that's what they did. When they got there they saw a sack full of gold and decided not to chase after Death but take the gold by night. They decided for one of them to go into the city and get wine to celebrate. The person that went was the youngest of them all. While he was gone the two thought up a plan to kill the third one so that they only had to split the money between them. The third boy wanted the money all to himself so he poisoned two of the bottles of wine and left one free of poison for himself. As he got the tree the two men killed him and they celebrated by drinking the wine and they died too. In the end they all got there wish. They met Death.Those two were my favorite and the next two are by the Wife of Bath and the Franklin. The wife of Bath is about a man who threatens the life of another if they don't tell him what women want. The franklin's tale is about women who loved a man who left her and she was very sad. Nothing could make her feel better. If you want to know what happens at the end of these stories you'll have to read the book.Historically this book is very good. It is based in the year of 1386. It show the life style of people who lived in the middle ages. It taught me that not all people were rich back then. It is historically spot on but the thing about this book is because it was written in the middle ages all the living conditions are right but it's very whimsical. Chickens can't talk, and Death isn't a person. In a way it shows how people thought back then. It tells us that some people might have wanted to meet death. Maybe in a physical way because they wanted to die or they just wanted to see someone death took away from them.The reason I liked this book was because of the old English. I like taking in the metaphors and deciphering it. If you like Shakespeare then you'll most likely like this book. It is very whimsical and magical. It shows the people in the middle ages in a very metaphorical way. This book shows how life can be mystical and great even when you don't except it."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Over some period I have read several translations of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. My first experience, selections in a high school text, was not promising. (Perhaps, I was not yet ready for Chaucer.) Translating poetry from one language to another is difficult and often unsuccessful. Translating Chaucer from Middle English is not much easier. English has changed dramatically in the last 600 years, to the point that Middle English is nearly indecipherable. For example, we read Chaucer's description of the Knight's appearance:Of fustian he wered a gipoun (Of coarse cloth he wore a doublet)Al bismotered with his habergeoun (All rust-spotted by his coat-of-mail)A glossary, diligence, and time are required for reading the original Chaucer. If you choose to do so, the Riverside Chaucer edition (edited by L. Benson) and the Norton Critical Edition (edited by Olson and Kolve) are highly recommended. The Signet Classic paperback edited by D. R. Howard modernizes the spelling a bit, but largely adheres to the original Chaucer and is an easier introduction to Middle English.Although in most cases the instructor assigns a particular version of Canterbury Tales, it can be exceedingly helpful to pick-up an additional version or two. A slightly different translation may entirely surprise you, even resonate with you, making Chaucer much more enjoyable. I suggest that you look for these versions:Selected Canterbury Tales, Dover Thrift edition - provides a poetic, rather than literal interpretation, and is quite readable. The collection of tales is fairly small, however.Canterbury Tales, Penguin edition, translated by Nevill Coghill, is an excellent poetic translation. It is a complete collection, arranged by Group A thru H, and also includes The Parson's Prologue, The Parson's Tale in synopsis, and Chaucer's Retractions. Coghill's translation remains my favorite.The Canterbury Tales, Bantam Classic paperback edited by Hieatt, uses the \\"facing page\\" format with the original Chaucer on the left and a modern literal translation on the right page. I found the literal translation a little wooden, but this edition can be quite helpful if you need some help with Middle English. (A guide to phonetics, grammar, spellings, and a glossary is provided.)Chaucer's Canterbury Tales (Barrons Educational Series) uses an \\"Interlinear Translation\\" format in which each line of Middle English is followed by a modern translation (literal to make the comparison easier). I rather like this approach.Canterbury Tales, John Murray Publishers, London is hard to find, but provides a partial translation to modern English, maintaining as much as possible of the Middle English. This rather clever approach is somewhat risky, but the translator H. L. Hitchins pulls it off. With some effort I could follow the text without continually referring to a glossary and in a limited way I was \\"reading Middle English\\".Canterbury Tales, Pocket Books, prose translation by R. M. Lumiansky, is easy to read, but while this prose format adheres to the storyline, it is only a shadow of the poetic Chaucer. It might prove useful if you are not comfortable with poetry.Good luck. Reading Chaucer is really worth the extra effort."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"The question is not whether to read the Canterbury Tales, but whether to read them in this translation -- or whether to go for the Middle English with all its difficulties.I'm a purist. As a Chaucer teacher myself, I'd say read the tales in the Riverside Chaucer or in the Norton Critcal editon with lots of footnotes. But, yes, that is harder, and I'd rather see readers get some experience than none.So, if you are going to compromise, Nevill Coghill's poetic translation is really as good a place to go as any. You will get the basic sense of Chaucer's verse; you'll get the basic rhymes and rhythms too. This is the translation that's used in most high school classes, and in many college survey classes that don't read the text in the original. It's really a fine compromise -- not only a good place to start, but also a decent trot if you are struggling with the Middle English.You can find some closer translations of some of the tales online if you look up Michael Murphy's websites. But for all their virtues, they don't have the smoothness of Coghill's renditions; Murphy's translations are not the complete Tales; and it's clunky to print them out. This economical edition is probably still the best place to start with Chaucer, father of English poetry and the originator of comedy in the English language."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"The version of this classic I read was a translation into modern English by Nevill Coghill. As you can see above, I awarded Chaucer (and the translation) five stars; but I do have a criticism. This translation (and many other publications of Chaucer) do not contain the two prose tales (&quot;The Tale of Melibee&quot; and &quot;The Parson's Tale&quot;). These are rarely read and I understand the publisher's and the translator's desire to keep the book to a managable size. Still, that should be the readers decision and no one else's. I had to go to the University library and get a complete copy in order to read those sections. As I mentioned, this copy is a translation into modern English. However, I do recommend that readers take a look at the Middle English version, at least of the Prologue. Many years ago, when I was in high school, my teacher had the entire class memorize the first part of the Prologue in the original Middle English. Almost forty years later, I still know it. I am always stunned at how beautiful, fluid, and melodic the poetry is, even if you don't understand the words. Twenty-nine pilgrims meet in the Tabard Inn in Southwark on their way to Canterbury. The host suggests that the pilgrims tell four stories each in order to shorten the trip (the work is incomplete in that only twenty-four stories are told). The tales are linked by narrative exchanges and each tale is presented in the manner and style of the character providing the story. This book was a major influence on literature. In fact, the development of the &quot;short story&quot; format owes much to these tales. All of the elements needed in a successful short story are present: flow of diction and freedom from artifice, faultless technical details and lightness of touch, and a graphic style which propels the story. In poetry, Chaucer introduced into English what will become known as rime royal (seven-line stanza riming ababbcc), the eight-line stanza (riming ababbcbc), and the heroic couplet. His poetry is noted for being melodious and fluid and has influenced a great many later poets. He has a remarkable talent for imagery and description. With respect to humor, which often receives the most negative responses from a certain group of readers (as witnessed by some of the comments below), there are at least three types: good humor which produces a laugh and is unexpected and unpredictable (for example, the description of the Prioress in the Prologue), satire (for example, the Wife of Bath's confession in the Prologue to her tale), and course humor, which is always meant to keep with the salty character of the teller of the tale or with the gross character of the tale itself. I am really stunned at the comments of the reviewer from London (of June 21, 1999). He/she clearly has no idea of the influence of the work nor on the reasons why Chaucer chose to present the humor the way he has. T. Keene of May 17 gave the work only three stars, presumably because it was once banned in Lake City, Florida. (Does that mean it would get fewer stars if it hadn't been banned?) Perhaps our London reviewer will be more comfortable moving to Lake City! Another reviewer suggested that &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; was only a classic because it had been around a long time. No! Chaucer's own contemporaries (for example, Gower, Lydgate, and Hoccleve) acknowledged his genius. My goodness, even science fiction books acknowledge the Tales (for example, Dan Simmons' &quot;Hyperion,&quot; which won the 1990 Hugo Award for best science fiction novel of the year, is based on the Tales). These brief entries are too short to review all of the tales. Let me just descibe the first two. Other readers might consider reviewing the other tales in later responses. In &quot;The Knight's Tale,&quot; the Theban cousins Palamon and Arcite, while prisoners of the King of Athens (Theseus), fall in love with Emelyn, sister of Hippolyta and sister-in-law to Theseus. Their rivalry for Emelyn destroys their friendship. They compete for her in a tournament with different Greek gods supporting the two combatants. Arcite, supported by Mars, wins but soon dies from a fall from his horse (due to the intervention of Venus and Saturn). Both Palamon and Emelyn mourn Arcite, after which they are united. It is the basis of &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen&quot; by Fletcher and Shakespeare. &quot;The Miller's Tale&quot; is a ribald tale about a husband, the carpenter John, who is deceived by the scholar Nicholas and the carpenter's wife Alison that a second flood is due. In this tale, a prospective lover is deceived into kissing a lady in an unusual location. And, recalling the response from our reviewer from London, apparently this Tale should not be read by people from London (or Lake City)!"},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Over the years, this book has been banned upways, sideways, and down.

The collection of tales is fairly small, however.The Canterbury Tales, Bantam Classic paperback edited by Hieatt, uses the \\"facing page\\" format with the original Chaucer on the left and a modern literal translation on the right page. I found the literal translation a little wooden, but this edition can be quite helpful if you need some help with Middle English. (A guide to phonetics, grammar, spellings, and a glossary is provided.)Chaucer's Canterbury Tales (Barrons Educational Series) uses an \\"Interlinear Translation\\" format in which each line of Middle English is followed by a modern translation (literal to make the comparison easier). I rather like this approach.Canterbury Tales, John Murray Publishers, London is hard to find, but provides a partial translation to modern English, maintaining as much as possible of the Middle English. This rather clever approach is somewhat risky, but the translator H. L. Hitchins pulls it off. With some effort I could follow the text without continually referring to a glossary and in a limited way I was \\"reading Middle English\\".Canterbury Tales, Pocket Books, prose translation by R. M. Lumiansky, is easy to read, but while this prose format adheres to the storyline, it is only a shadow of the poetic Chaucer. However, it can be helpful if you are not comfortable with poetry."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"In addition to its literary importance, Chaucer's Canterbury Tales are an enchanting reading experience. The Bantam Classic edition presents the tales in Modern English translation alongside the Middle English so that one can fully appreciate the tales as Chaucer composed them, or if you're just in the mood for a fun romp you can speedily read the translation. The tales themselves move at a quick pace, so beginners will probably enjoy the modern version much more.The Canterbury Tales revolve around a group of 29 on a pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral to pay homage to the martyred St. Thomas a'Becket. The members of the pilgrimage come from all walks of life, including a Knight, Prioress, Merchant, Miller, the ever-entertaining Wife of Bath, and many others. The Canterbury Tales are the pilgrims' stories and each one reflects the individual character's personality beautifully. One can't help but feel a part of this lively group.Whether you like a bawdy, raucous tale or a morally sound fable you will definitely find something entertaining in this book. I laughed out loud several times and found Chaucer's use of symbolism, wit, wisdom, and the glimpse into 14th Century life absolutely fascinating."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"I remember slogging through The Canterbury Tales in Middle English when I was in high school and although the language is beautiful, having to take time to decipher it all did diminish somewhat the enjoyment of a terrific collection of stories. Since most of us are more comfortable with modern English, a good translation makes all the difference, and Nevill Coghill's excellent translation does full version to Chaucer's book. Reading this version takes the work out of it and makes \\"The Canterbury Tales\\" a pure pleasure.Chaucer writes about everyman and his stories represent one of the motliest crews in English literature: the Wife of Bath who has put away five husbands and is looking for a sixth; the pardoner, the reeve, the clerk, the knight, and a host of others from all walks of life. There is something in here for everyone; my three favorite stories are the Pardoner's Tale; the Miller's Tale (reading this in Coghill's translation, I could see why it has been excised from the bowdlerized versions used in high school English classes; it's rude, crude and downright lewd, but it's so hysterical they had to sew my sides up again when I finally stopped laughing), and the Franklin's tale of the knight, the squire and the magician who outdo each other in chivalry.Antisemitism was commonplace in medieval Europe and Chaucer is no more free of it than anyone else of his time; but to say that The Canterbury Tales is not worth reading because Chaucer was true to his time is overstatement. One must accept that Chaucer was as human and imperfect as most of his peers; without compromising the fact that Chaucer was a literary genius who had a profound effect on English language and English literature.Judy Lind"},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"CHAUCER : THE CANTERBURY TALES. Translated into Modern English by Nevill Coghill. 504 pp. Penguin Classics. ISBN : 0140440224 (pbk.)Nevill Coghill's brilliant modern English translation of Chaucer's masterpiece, 'The Canterbury Tales,' has always been a bestseller and it's easy to understand why. Chaucer was an intensely human writer and a great comic artist, but besides the ribaldry and sheer good fun of tales such as 'The Miller's Tale,' we also know he was capable of other things. His range was wide, and the striking thing about Coghill's translation is how amazingly faithful it is to the spirit of the original - at times bawdy and hilariously funny, at other times more serious and moving when Chaucer shifts to a more poignant mode.But despite the brilliance of Coghill's translation, a translation so effective that it was even made into a successful musical, and despite the fact that it remains the best possible introduction to Chaucer for those who don't know Middle English, those who restrict themselves to Coghill are going to miss a lot - such readers are certainly going to get the stories, but they're going to lose much of the beauty those stories have in the original language. The difference is as great as that between a black-and-white movie and technicolor.Chaucer's Middle English _looks_ difficult to many, and I think I know why. It _looks_ difficult because that in fact is what people are doing, they are _looking_ at it, they are reading silently and trying to take it in through the eye. This is a recipe for instant frustration and failure. But fortunately there is a quick and easy remedy.So much of Chaucer's power is in the sheer music of his lines, and in their energy and thrust. He was writing when English was at its most masculine and vigorous. And his writings were intended, as was the common practice in the Middle Ages when silent reading was considered a freakish phenomenon, to be read aloud. Those new to Chaucer would therefore be well advised, after reading and enjoying Nevill Coghill's rendering, to learn how to read Middle English _aloud_ as soon as possible by listening to one of the many excellent recordings (one of the best is by Robert Ross on Caedmon).Coghill certainly captures the spirit of Chaucer, but modern English cannot really convey the full flavor and intensity of the original. Learn how to roll a few of Chaucer's Middle English lines around on your tongue and you'll soon hear what I mean. You'll also find that it isn't nearly so difficult as it _looks_, and your pleasure in Chaucer will be magnified enormously."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"The Canterbury Tales were almost ruined for me by my freshman English Lit class. They insisted on making us read it from The Norton Anthology of Literature, which of course is untranslated. This is pointless. Unless one is a specialist or going for a doctorate there is no point in reading The Canterbury Tales in Middle English with all those endless footnotes. It takes one of the greatest books in English Literature - or World Literature, for that matter - and makes it torture. I have no need of \\"thilke\\" or \\"willhem\\" or \\"clepen.\\" That is why Nevill Coghill's translation is such a boon. Now we can enjoy it in our own language the way the fourteenth-century English did (in truth, it is not that hard to translate as many of the words stay the same). I have taken to reading it, not as a novel, but as a collection of short stories - skipping around as I please. I think it is agreed that the best parts art the Miller's Tale, The Pardoner's Tale, and The Wife of Bath (and the Prologue, of course) which makes for excellent starting points."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"\\"Brilliant\\" is the right word for Chaucer, I think. Not \\"magnificent\\" - it sounds too authoritative, and authority was one thing Chaucer had little regard for. I mean this not in the sense that he devoted himself to passionately tearing down authority - simply that his ultimate motivation was to parody, sometimes to satirize, and just generally to poke fun. The mood of the work as a whole is one of a game, interspersed with various asides from both Chaucer and his various characters beseeching the readers not to take what they say too seriously and to maintain a general spirit of fun.The backstory to the telling of the titular Tales (alliteration!) is that of thirty pilgrims, each given their own unique introduction in the prologue (though some, such as several priests, are lumped together), travelling to Canterbury to the site where Thomas a Becket was killed by Henry II - of England, of course. The host of the Tabard Inn, Harry Bailey, suggests that they make a wager where they each tell two tales on the way to Canterbury and two on the way back, and whoever tells the best tales gets a dinner to be paid for by the rest of the party. But this is fairly unimportant - what is important is the characters, the tales, and Chaucer himself's relationship to both.The tales snowball off one another in such a way that, while it is certainly possible to read them non-chronologically, the best understanding of the work as a whole is achieved by just reading straight through - and then once more after that, as some earlier stories reference characters not fully given a chance to shine until later in the work. For example, during the Knight's tale of courtly love, he himself pokes some very subtle fun at the typical absurd purity of his Medieval romantic characters, which prompts the Miller to tell a fabliau tale in which similar high romantic rhetoric is used simply for the purposes of hot, dirty, extramarital sex at the expense of a poor, old, foolish carpenter, prompting the Reeve (himself a carpenter) to revenge himself on the Miller by telling a tale in which a cruel, stupid, thieving Miller's daughter and wife are both raped by young students whom the Miller has tricked. The cycle of degradation of the romance finally ends when the Cook begins a tale of a prostitute, Chaucer trailing off the tale without ending it, presumably because he has already made his point - namely, the dichotomy between ideal views of romance in the eyes of higher, aristocratic figures, and the realities of romance (or, rather, lust) in the eyes of the common figures of the day. And yet, despite this, the dirty, crude, ribald fabliaux of the Miller, Reeve, and Cook actually reinforce aristocratic feeling of superiority.I could quite easily go on, and on, but I will not. Suffice it to say that this is perhaps the greatest (in terms of sheer worth, not puffed-up self-importance), most entertaining, most rewarding work in all English literature. I intend to read the untranslated version as soon as I can. Speaking of which - Coghill's translation is quite excellent, with smooth-flowing rhymes and handy footnotes (although sometimes their placement did seem a bit arbitrary - why did he feel it necessary to explain what a Summoner was, but not what a Manciple was?) My one criticism was that he decided not to translate the prose tales of the Parson and Chaucer's Tale of Melibee, giving a self-written summary in their stead. While the summaries were fine, and perfectly informative, I want Chaucer, dammit! But all in all, a fine job, Mr. Coghill."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"This version will appeal most to those who have read and studied The Canterbury Tales and enjoyed them.The Canterbury Tales are best heard aloud. With commentary by Professor Murphy and talented actors, the various tales come appealingly alive. Chaucer's Middle English has its archaic words explained, and leaves the beauty of the meter and rhymes intact.The tales explore primarily relations between men and women, people and God, and consistently challenge hypocrisy. The tales also exemplify all the major story forms in use during the Middle Ages.The book's structure is unbelievable subtle and complex, providing the opportunity to peel the onion down to its core, one layer at a time. Modern anthologies look awfully weak by comparison.Although the material is old, the ideas are not. You will also be impressed by how much closer God was to the lives of these people than He is today. The renunciation at the end comes as a mighty jolt, as a result.My favorites are by the miller, wife of Bath, pardoner, and nun's priest.Where do you see the opportunity to give and share spiritual and worldly love? How can you give and receive more love?"},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Chaucer has the talent of telling a good story, and if you read a Modern English version, the tales are enjoyable, but so much is lost. Chaucer uses words that can give a story many different meanings. If you really want to get into Chaucer, look at the words that he uses...they can tell a story of their own or just give insight into the deeper meaning (and there is always a deeper meaning). You may want to read a Modern English translation first, just to understand what the overall message is, but I recommend reading the Middle English version to discover the deeper meaning that Chaucer is trying to get across."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Listening to the Canterbury Tales as an audio book is probably the best way to fully appreciate them, as they were certainly conceived to be listened to and not read silently for oneself. The narrators are varied and talented; they certainly succeed in bringing out the most from each tale. Also, the excellent translation makes the work perfectly accessible and easy to understand.This unabridged version makes one realize however that this work was never finished or has been incompletely transmitted to us. For instance, the first tales such as the miller's and the reeve's are cleverly linked to one another. Sadly, soon enough afterwards, no structure is perceptible and tales simply follow one another with no apparent logic.In addition, the unabridged version includes lesser known tales, some of which are dismally boring, such as the Tale of Melibee or the Parson's Tale, both in prose. They are closer to a long series of quotations than an actual narrative. Was Chaucer being ironic in including them? Or else, are they later additions that Chaucer did not write himself?Overall, listening to the Canterbury Tales is a unique experience that is highly recommended to all, for sheer delight but also to realize how much, and how little, our culture has evolved since medieval times."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"At the Tabard Inn, thirty travelers from a diversity of classes and occupations are planning to make the annual pilgrimage to Becket's shrine at Canterbury. It is agreed that each traveler will tell four tales to help pass the time, and the host of the inn will reward the best storyteller with a free supper when they return. The Canterbury Tales is a sometimes bawdy, sometimes spiritual classic, skillfully translated into modern English and presented in an unabridged audiobook format. Read by Martin Jarvis and a full cast, The Canterbury Tales reveals the trials and travails of daily life in late fourteenth-century England through stories, conversations, jokes and arguments between travelers. Truly the most memorable way to experience this literary classic, The Canterbury Tales is especially recommended for public library collections. 17 CDs, 21 hours, tracks every 3 minutes for easy bookmarking."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"In order to understand English litterature and the English language, many have read, or at least tried to read, Chaucers \\"Canterbury Tales\\". I too did begin (and sort of finished) the work in Middle English, which is not as hard as one might be lead to think, but is quite labourious and painstakingly slow at times. With this version, a great compromise has been found, translating it as true to the original as possible yet in modern English. I know that every time you make a rewrite or translation, things are lost, but sometimes it is necessary, or just quite convenient. This is one of those times.It is great fun reading the Canterbury Tales. The structure of the work makes it very accesible and easy to pick up after some time away. You could treat it as a whole entity or as a collection of short stories centered around a group of persons on a pilgrimage. One of the books that any decent home library shouldn't be without."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"If you were force fed this in school and didn't appreciate it at the time I invite you to revisit this and see what we may have missed the first time around. Chaucer is not only enlightening concerning the varying natures of the characters he introduces but he is also extremely funny. My favorite selection is the somewhat bawdy Wife Of Bath but it's all good. Well worth picking up again if you're at all curious."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"I got this version of \\"The Canterbury Tales\\" over my spring break (Partialy because that is the time of year the story takes place.) and a instant obsession was sparked between me and the fine black ink printed on the paper. I remember getting up before the sun rised just so I could sit in the quiet and take in every word the book had to offer.It is so poetic its like a smooth flowing song, often you forget you are reading and drift off. Dozens of memorable lines fill the book, especially the first couple paragraphs in the General Prologe. Characters like the Knight and The Wife of Bath really become memorable, and almost 700 years later you can almost still relate to the stories they tell. I cannot stop praising this book. I highly recomend it."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"The Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer inform us of what is was like to live in the Middle Ages and experience a real pilgrimage. This does not read like a novel, rather it is a frame-story that includes a collection of short stories for each character. A Knight's Tale is the classic court romance with chivalry and contempt, although a bit long, it is one of the better tales in this compilation. Chaucer emits his satire exceedingly well through the tale of the Pardoner, sure to entertain the witty reader. Other tales consist of just plain humor, as in the Carpenter's Tale and Reeve's Tale. Do not let the Middle English prohibit you from reading this, for this edition includes both the Middle English, which not exceedinly difficult to read once you get into the rhythm, and modern English. The Canterbury Tales is an absolutely wonderful collection of stories that has something to offer each reader."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Essentially every other version of Chaucer is either in the original Middle English, which is very hard, or in a modern translation, which hardly seems worth the bother. This edition reaches a happy middle: the original language is maintained, word for word, but spelling is modernized. (This is incidentally, how ALL general versions of Shakespeare are edited-of course, Shakespeare's English is a lot closer to our own, but his work would still be much more difficult to read if you had to decipher the original spelling.) Of course, a few commonly used words and a greater number of rare words have not survived into modern English, and the reader needs to learn these; a list is provided. But that is much easier than having to also decipher virtually every word because its spelling is not recognizable.Naturally, pronunciation changes over time, as does spelling, so some of the rhythm and rhyme doesn't quite work. But it's more than passable, and in any case reconstructions of Middle English pronunciation are all hypothetical, with scholarly disagreements.There is nothing wrong with the Middle English editions for those with the time and inclination to tackle them. But after discovering Murphy's edition, I felt almost like I had been hoodwinked into believing that Middle English was much further from Modern English than it really is."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"While this is one of the better translations of The Tales I've seen, it's still unfortunately a translation. Even with a perfect translation, much of the rhyming and character of the original is lost. On the other hand, you can also lose much of the essence of the story by reading the Middle English text simply because the vocabulary can be so different (even though most of the time you can guess the meaning). Your best bet is to buy a copy of The Tales that keeps the original text but adds a line-by-line translation. The book may be twice as thick, but this way you can both read it the way Chaucer intended it to be, and read the translation right under the original words in case you're completely baffled by the vocabulary. I recently found a copy like that at a garage sale for 50 cents. It was the best 50 cents I've spent in a long time."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Lao Phrasebook (Lonely Planet : Language Survival Kit)","review":"This is an excellent book for those who wish to travel to Laos, or even those who wish to begin learning lao in small steps.

His poetic descriptions of man's fascination with the moon and John Glenn's return to space make this book thoroughly enjoyable and very readable. It is written so smoothly and with such emotion that I actually forgot I was reading a nonfiction, historical study. Walsh's love and knowledge of the subject make it easy to understand the outer space passions of such famous figures as Stephen Hawking and Tom Hanks. His thoughtful, storytelling-style will help readers such as myself not only visualize Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin's famous journey, but feel what they and the country felt and experienced when they took that fateful stroll on the cratered moon surface.I was no space buff, but I am now, thanks to Walsh's thorough and clear explanations, and attention to the historical significance of the many facets and missions that made up NASA's successful space-aeronautics program. As Walsh juxtaposes the development and advances in the program against the important events taking place in the U.S. at the time, as well as the Soviet's own space program, I felt as though I not only was reading about the time and the events in question, but had experienced them myself. This was a courageous and successful approach that resulted in a wonderfully interesting and emotion-filled retelling of the adventure that is the U.S. space program."},{"Title":"Echoes Among the Stars: A Short History of the U.S. Space Program","review":"Echoes Among the Stars by Patrick J. Walsh is not only a concise lesson in the history of the U.S. Space Program, but also a lyrical tribute to man's quest for knowledge. Walsh's book methodically and elegantly recalls the missions that led up to Neil Armstrong's first captivating step on the moon, fulfilling President John F. Kennedy's vision, and continues to trace the development of the Space Program through the voyages of the space shuttles.Walsh imparts the episodes that inform America's modern psyche with the adventuresome spirit with which they were undertaken. I keenly felt the valor of the astronauts. Creating a parallel between the space programs of the USSR and the United States, Walsh demonstrates how the competition between the programs led to \\"a handshake across the heavens.\\" By placing the events of the Space Program within the political and social context of the United States, the magnitude of NASA's accomplishments becomes even more striking. The useful chronology at the end of the book is a wonderful, succinct reference of achievements and tragedies sustained by both the Soviet and American space programs alongside political and social events.In a nation that seems to be consuming itself with political angst, Echoes reminds the reader of the powerful patriotism that has made the United States great. Passages relaying the greatest accomplishments of the astronauts-John Glenn's first earth orbit, Ed White's first American spacewalk, Neil Armstrong's first steps on the moon, Tom Stafford and Alexei Leonov's handshake-as well as the greatest tragedies-the losses of the Apollo I and Challenger crews-are treated with accomplished storytelling skills that left me filled with emotion. A well-crafted history, Echoes is also a rarity-a truly graceful narrative. Echoes belongs on every well-appointed book shelf in the United States."},{"Title":"Echoes Among the Stars: A Short History of the U.S. Space Program","review":"First of all, let me state that the subtitle of this book should really be something like, &quot;A Short History of the Manned US Space Program up to 1975,&quot; since there is very little information on the Space Shuttle and International Space Station programs and almost nothing on unmanned missions. About half of the book concentrates on the Apollo program. On the flip side, there are some nice discussions on the competing Russian programs. I think a good rating for this book should be 3 stars if you're a space nut and know a lot about the space program and 5 stars if you're a novice space nut. Regardless of your level of space knowledge you'll find this a well written and easy to read book.The book opens with a small chapter on the early unmanned space race to place the first satellites in Earth Orbit. The book then movies into the Mercury and Gemini programs and presents the competing Russian projects. The section on the Gemini program presents a good summary of each mission, its problems and accomplishments and shows how this program proved many of the concepts, like docking, needed to make Apollo the success that it was.The next few sections of the book cover the Apollo missions to the moon and the various steps of the program. The first chapter covers the Apollo 1 fire, the subsequent investigation and changes made to the vehicle. I found this chapter especially refreshing since it avoided the gruesome details of the astronauts' deaths which is not always the case with some books on the space race. The next section covers the precursor missions, Apollos 7-10, which led up the first moon landing which, of course, receives its own chapter. The next two chapters cover Apollo 12 - 17 and provide some very good summaries of these missions. It is interesting to note that during these times, the comparative Russian manned space program is almost at a complete standstill.After the moon landing chapters, about half of the book, the Skylab and Apollo-Soyuz Test Project are discussed. I found the section on Skylab extremely disappointing. Here was a program that more than doubled US spaceflight time and which conducted many important micro-gravity related experiments, yet it only receives six page of text, less than half that of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project chapter. The final chapter of the book covers the last 27 years of manned flight and only examines the most important missions. It just seems that the author ran of steam covering everything that happened after the moon landings took place."},{"Title":"Echoes Among the Stars: A Short History of the U.S. Space Program","review":"I was greatly disappointed in this book. It is not about the space program, but rather about the MANNED space program: primarily Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo. There is still a need for a short overall appreciation of the space program. Planetary exploration and space astronomy are missing, as are the applications: communications, weather, and remote sensing. T.A.

Referring to the accounts as &quot;a real eye-opener,&quot; THS historian Don Lynch, who recently sailed with Pellegrino on James Cameron's 3-D Imax filming expedition to the Titanic, found the author to be a true seeker, blessed with hyper-energy and an undying sense of wonder that makes him seem at times like an overgrown child, &quot;if not occasionally like a class 1-A pain in the neck... but a lovable pain in the neck&quot;.

Nevermind that he is one of the few people who really does the hard and much required work of studying the details of the British and American inquiries into the loss of the Titanic. Then, when Pellegrino comes along with books based on actual expedition research combined with nearly a half century of unpublished letters and collected diaries - the collection being the life's work of Walter Lord (one of America's most respected historians) - these same Quinn critics attack Pellegrino specifically because he presents information they have not read before. They claim, without investigating any further, that because it's not in the British or American inquiries it must be all made up. So you're damned if you do present new information, damned if you don't. It seems to me that new writers on the subject of Titanic just can't win for losing.When I wrote to Pellegrino for information on Titanic survivors Edith Russell and Alfred White, he sent me copies of letters and memoirs. This does not seem to me like someone who is &quot;making it all up.&quot; The stories may seem unbelievable, but that is precisely why the titanic stirs so many emotions. It is, as Pellegrino writes, &quot;all the wondrous horror of a Greek tragedy penned by God with Shakespeare as his muse.&quot;"},{"Title":"HER NAME, TITANIC","review":"This is the first book since &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; that actually carries you back through time to the decks of the sinking Titanic until you actually feel it yourself. You feel the emotions of the people that night - and then you are yanked forward in time to the expeditions that first discovered and explored the Titanic, and then Pellegrino moves you back and forth in time again and again from the night of the sinking to the expeditions until at last you become, like James Cameron's Rose, unstuck in time. It is easy to see how Cameron was so moved by Pellegrino's morphings through time. A reading of this scientist's other books reveals that he seems to be unable to tell a tale in linear fashion. In both &quot;Unearthing Atlantis&quot; and &quot;Ghosts of the Titanic,&quot; he unfolds archaeological investigations by telling the whole history backwards! It is difficult to imagine what he will do with time next. But I'll be there for the ride. You can bet on it."},{"Title":"HER NAME, TITANIC","review":"Charles Pellegrino is an outstanding author-of-all-trades, who really hits the mark here. His interest in both the Titanic then and now makes his view unique. Touching, Funny, Sad- This book has it all. Read this book before any other (except Lord's books)"},{"Title":"HER NAME, TITANIC","review":"I study Titanic and try to get every book possible on Titanic,( I've been studying Titanc, way before the movie was made). But when I bought this book and read it, I regreted it. It's a good book, for... how shall I say it, Beginner readers for Titanic. I give this book, in my opinion, 1 STAR because of it's lack of thought. The book seemed like it was made for new Titanic fans. Since I've been interested in Titanic for a long while, this book wasn't at all great."},{"Title":"HER NAME, TITANIC","review":"I've read many of the works published on the sinking of the White Star liner, Titanic, and I have to say this is, without doubt, one of the poorest yet. Pellegrino obviously is trying for emotional meditative discourse, but failing that, ends up making up out of whole cloth entire conversations and scenarios. Titanic was *not* the first ship to use the SOS call. The inclusion of the Frank Towers myth is a dead giveaway that Pellegrino picks and chooses his myths, without bothering with such inanities as fact-checking. If it's entertainment and an emotional response you're after, go see Cameron's movie. If it's history you want, better to stick with other, far better, far more accurate works."},{"Title":"HER NAME, TITANIC","review":"I came to this book through a rather round-about path, first introduced to the author through some papers he had written on advanced nuclear propulsion systems for rockets. Then some of my colleagues at the Air and Space Museum told me that the guy wrote mind-bending techno-thrillers on the side (and he does!), and finally I came to his non-fiction. I happen to be a hard-core engineer/test pilot and have always considered myself about as hard-boiled as they come. But when I read about Thomas Andrews and his men in the engine room - and about Rosa Abott and her two boys, I was really overcome and I just had to put the book down and leave the room before my wife and the kids saw that my eyes were full of tears."},{"Title":"HER NAME, TITANIC","review":"Those familiar with the work of Charles Pellegrino know that his writing always drifts from the distant past to the present to the distant future, connecting disparate circumstances together into a coherent \\"big picture\\" by way of entertaining discourses on paleontology, archeology, biology, and astrophysics, to name but a few of the fields Mr. Pellegrino has worked in. In \\"Her Name, Titanic\\", the disparate events in question are the sinking of the ocean liner Titanic in 1912 and its discovery on the ocean floor in 1985, as well as subsequent missions to document the Titanic's wreckage more fully. \\"Her Name, Titanic\\" presents previously unpublished information about the sinking of the Titanic in the form of fictionalized narratives and direct quotes from survivors, based on newly discovered (at the time of writing) diaries and communication logs. There is much discussion of the technology and accomplishments of deep sea exploration, including interviews with Bob Ballard and other members of the teams that discovered and explored the Titanic wreckage. I didn't like \\"Her Name, Titanic\\" as much as I usually like Charles Pellegrino's books. This book actually focuses on one subject more than most of his books do, which turned out not to be a good thing. I found Pellegrino's enthusiasm to be somewhat less infectious than usual, as the middle portion of the book bogged down with too much talk about deep sea submersibles. Of course, if this is your field of interest, you may find that part of the book fascinating. Titanic aficionados will be thrilled to read new accounts of what happened that night in April 1912. I give the new information 5 stars and the more tedious aspects of the book 3 stars, so 4 stars as a whole."},{"Title":"HER NAME, TITANIC","review":"If you're interested in the Titanic, this really is NOT the book for you! Pellegrino seems more interested in his own history, along with Bob Ballard's, than he does with the Titanic's. There are a few interesting passages jammed into a lot of rambling about machinery, sea exploration, ant SPACE EXPLORATION? If you want to read about the equitment used to find the Titanic and its many uses and missions beforehand, you MIGHT enjoy this book. If you want to read about the tragic story of the Titanic and what happened on that fateful night I would recommend &quot;The Night Lives On&quot; by Walter Lord."},{"Title":"HER NAME, TITANIC","review":"Charles Pellegrino, while providing interesting insight into the finding of the sunken liner Titanic, obviously neglected to do his research on that which haunts him so. As a member of the Titanic Historical Society and a general Titanic enthusiast, I know much about the dreaded night of April 14th 1912 - in both fact and myth. Pellegrino draws from neither for his book, instead creating unfounded dialogues that, unfortunately, shed a bad light on some of the heros of that night. His extreme emotionalism - he takes it almost to the point of being farcical - distracts the reader from the events of both the 1912 sinking and the 1985 finding of the Titanic. This book had the potential to create a fascinating discourse between the two main events in the life of the liner, both academically and emotionally, but unfortunately it doesn't. Luckily we now have James Cameron's film &quot;Titanic&quot; to build what Pellegrino couldn't."},{"Title":"HER NAME, TITANIC","review":"The fact that this book is about Titanic (well sort of anyway). This book is not a true work of history. The research is faulty, the words and thoughts of the various characters is bogus fiction.

I wouldn't recommend this book mainly because it detracts from people's experiences of the titanic."},{"Title":"HER NAME, TITANIC","review":"This unique and fascinating book goes beyond any TITANIC bookthat has ever been written. It is perhaps the most dramatic account of the sinking of the legendary &quot;unsinkable&quot; Cunard liner -- and of the incredible, science fiction-like finding of the ship.&quot;As ropes were unhooked and boat number fourteen struck out, portholes still glowed below the surface. From five feet under, in a room that was still unflooded, a man was peering out into the ocean. Adjacent portholes illumunated the white bottom of a lifeboat. Looking up, he watched it cast away...&quot;Time seemed to have come unstuck the day the TITANIC's grave was discovered. An empty lifeboat davit turned up on the robot ARGO's tv screens, and suddenly it was 1912 again, suddenly the horrors came spewing out like a nightmare from the past. Scientiests burst into tears, and many who saw those first pictures suffered what they later called minor nervous breakdowns. The world looked on, dumbfounded by the fallibility of man's suppsedly most invincible creations.HER NAME, TITANIC includes a vivid portrait of explorer Robert Ballard, the brilliant leader of the expedition that discovered the TITANIC's remains. The author portrays Ballard and his crew in a compelling style unlike that of any other book on the subject. Charles Pellegrino is a scientist as well as an author, and he describes in riveting detail the scientific aspects of the machines and the processes involved in the expeditions.But more than that, this is the first book to go beyond the headlines. By delving deep into the meaning of the TITANIC, which has evolved slowly from tragedy to symbol, and by putting himself into the minds of the people who play the characters in the drama. Charles Pellegrino has created a spellbinding work of oceanography that succeeds in illuminating new truths about the meaning of science -- and about the tragedies and joys of the human adventure."},{"Title":"HER NAME, TITANIC","review":"I'm always up for another look at the Titanic, especially if new light is shed on the story. Unfortunately, Pelligrino spends a huge percentage of the book referring to himself admiringly in the third person, or subtly inflating his own worth in the parallel story line of Ballard's expeditions. On top of that, it's not interesting. The retelling of the events on the ship are fine, but they can't carry the deadweight of Pelligrino's attempt to make himself a central figure or as important as the story. It's the literary equivalent to watching an actor talk about how moved they are by their own acting.

Mr. Pellegrino's first-hand account of the expedition to find Titanic along with his carefully written narrative of her last few hours, puts you in a position where you just can't put the book down, even for dinner!

Get this book!Doug Griswold"},{"Title":"HER NAME, TITANIC","review":"&quot;Her Name, Titanic&quot; is an incredible tale of the Titanic, and Her tragic misfortune. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in the ship's past, crew, passengers, story, myths, route, disaster, and capivating spells. People also interested in space exploration will find this book fascinating. Charles Pellegrino did a phenomenal job in paralleling inner space, and outer space.In &quot;Her Name, Titanic&quot; we are invited onboard, to explore the ship at our leisure, on the surface, as well as on the ocean floor. We share the passenger's experiences during the time of disaster, and are able to envision the Titanic's last few minutes during her maiden voyage.It is a well written piece, and contains the ability to take the reader into a lifeboat, granting us permission to hear the cries of disbelief, fear, and shock, over the ocean's surface that dreadful night. With Pellegrino's descriptive words, and use of metaphors, the readers are able to observe the bodies floating helplessly in the North Atlantic, and feel the life-saving grips of survivors on the edges of lifeboats pulling them to safety. Readers can feel the ice-chilled water temperatures, and the chill in the air biting at their bodies, while turning from page to page.This book envelopes the reader completely, as the ocean enveloped the Titanic itself. I found it an entertaining peice, as well as a tragic peice. A piece written in truth, as well as misery.The Titanic has held thousands of people under Her spell, for almost a hundred years, myself included.

I first read &quot;A Night to Remember,&quot; and couldn't put it down. This book, on the other hand, has been difficult to stick with. The author just doesn't seem to know quite what he wants to write about. He goes back and forth between the actual sinking (very interesting, but most of this stuff can be found in Lord's book), the discovery of the ship (which includes a great deal of very technical dialogue), and the Challenger explosion (perhaps this connection is a bit of a stretch). As someone who has become very interested in the subject of the Titanic (as a result of the movie), I found this book disappointing. The author seemed more interested in letting us know how involved he was, personally, in the entire expedition, but that just didn't interest me.

I'd written to Dr. Pellegrino on why no other writer on the Titanic seems to have the information that he does. I was told by Dr. Pellegrino that it was due mostly to the access he had to some forty years of correspondence between Walter Lord and Titanic survivors. It seems to me that the animosity shown towards his book stems more from jealousy on the parts of the other historians because they were not granted the same access to the correspondence.Oh well, I guess the small-minded pettiness that people are capable of show up in all professions and all areas of study!"},{"Title":"HER NAME, TITANIC","review":"If I could give this book a rating of less than 1 I would..... it deserves it.

The main point he is making is that your average profit should be greater than average loss, which is true enough. Unfortunately, there is an implied assumption in this section that suggests you can change the stop without impacting the probabilities of success -- i've found this not to be true in my own trading. I would certainly liked to have seen some mention of this in the book, but that's a bit of a nitpick to be quite honest.In the book, Mr. Guppy uses the 2% risk model Elder uses. However, there are bits missing. For example, he has no real way of limiting risk. He has a model whereby through diversification and position limits, he will limit outstanding risk to 20%. However, from my brief reading of the book (I plan to go over it more thoroughly later), there is nothing stopping you from entering another 20% worth of positions, and another 20%. Stopping your entire portfolio out several times. Sure, I hear you say, this could never happen to a top trader -- however, if it happened to Steve Walton &lt;See Stock Market Wizards>, I suspect it can happen to you.Overall, I think this is an excellent book, and I learned quite a bit from it. Mr. Guppy's writing style may not be quite as polished as some writers, but I think it's still quite good. If you are a position trader, i'd highly recommend this book -- if you opt for the swing or daytrading timeframes, I think you might be better off with Elder or Tharp -- although it certainly does no harm to study all of these authors, as they each have a lot of really good things to say about this topic. I think this book may indeed be destined to be in fine company, alongside Elder and Tharp.

It is due for a revival. Glasgow lived most of her life in Richmond, Virginia, and was critically praised as an early naturalist writer. She attempted to describe the South without the romantic accretions of &quot;Lost Cause&quot; mythology that arose following the Civil War.Glasgow wrote Vein of Iron in 1935, and the book placed second on the best-seller lists that year. It is typical for her work which bridged the gap between serious and popular literature. I first read this novel three years ago and was pleased to have the opportunity to reread it as part of a book group. I was surprised at how much I had missed -- and probably got wrong -- on my first reading. If serious literature can be characterized as a book that bears reading slowly and more than once, then Vein of Iron has met this standard for me.The book is set primarily in rural Virginia from about 1901 through 1935 (running into the first term of President Roosevelt). The story centers on the Fincastle family of Scotch-Irish descent which has lived in what has become a rundown manse in the small fictional village of Ironside since before the Revolutionary War.Several family members get a great deal of attention in the novel. Ada Fincastle is a young woman in love with a young man named Ralph McBride. She loses Ralph, as a result of a forced marriage to a rich, selfish girl, Janet Rowan, who claims Ralph got her pregnant. She ultimately marries Ralph, but only after a two-day torrid affair in the woods before the divorce between Ralph and Janet is concluded. Ralph returns from WW I cynical and disillusioned and the couple struggle to retain their love for one another.Ada's father, John Fincastle, is the other major character in the story. Fincastle is a Presbryterian minister who has been defrocked &quot;after he had told the Presbytery he rejected the God of Abraham but accepted the God of Spinoza.&quot; (p.45) Fincastle has spent his life writing a multi-volume work of philosophy, heavily influenced by a combination of philosophical naturalism, German idealism, Spinoza, Schopenhauer, and, I think especially, Buddhism and Eastern thought. Glasgow herself was a religous seeker of an unorthodox cast who had been fascinated with Buddhism when young. I found her portrait of John Fincastle compelling.The main characters also include Ada's grandmother as well as Fincastle's wife, who dies early in the book, and a character named Aunt Meggie all of whom retain traditional Presbryterian religious convictions and all of whom are sympathetically portrayed.Much of the theme of the book is stated in the title, as the characters, regardless of their differences in religious outlook maintain their fortitude and strength in the face of difficulty, adversity, and change. Besides fortitude and interior toughness, the second large theme of the book, I think, is human compassion. As the family suffers and observes the suffering of others during the Great Depression, John and ada, in particular, come to realizew and to put into practice the value of limiting one's own egocentrism and trying to work to alleviate the sufferings of others. There is a Buddhist mantra that is repeated at several important places in this novel: &quot;May all beings be delivered from suffering&quot; -- known as the lovingkindness (or metta) meditation that seemed to me initially and still seems to me upon rereading to be at the heart of this book.The book has excellent descriptions of life in rural Virginia and of the growth of the urban South in a larger fictious city called Queenborough. Industrialization and the suffering resulting from the Depression are portrayed well. There are also sympathetic, non-stereotyped portrayals of African-Americans, uncommon in a work of this era.For all the descriptions of place and the intensity of the love story, I still concluded on my reading that the main focus of this book was spiritual. Glasgow writes knowingly both of the loss of faith in traditional Western religions and also of the need for the spiritual values of wisdom, self-understanding, and compassion. Her book has a serious tone throughout and her quest remains distinctly modern.I found, as I did when I first read Vein of Iron that much of the book is overwritten and that its tone is melodramatic in places. In spite of that, Vein of Iron works on many levels. I found it primarily a picture of a timeless spiritual quest. It encourages the reader away from the materialism of the everyday, whether found in rural Virginia or anywhere else, to search for meaning, wisdom, and compassion, regardless of whether the reader finds these values within or without the boundaries of a traditional religous faith."},{"Title":"Vein of iron","review":"(...)Vein of Iron, written in 1935, is the saga of a Virginia family who live through changing times. It starts in 1901 when the central character Ada is 10 years old, and she is deeply disappointed when, even though she has saved up her money for a doll with real hair, she has to settle for a cheaper doll that she doesn't want. This sets the tone of the book, which is filled with the realities of life's struggles and disappointments. It also deeply explores religion and faith as Ada's father is a former Presbyterian minister who has lost his faith and there is constant conflict between right and wrong as well as tradition and change.The title refers to the vein of iron within the characters, especially the women, which keeps them going throughout adversity as they struggle through their personal challenges as well as the social changes creating upheaval around them. The love of Ada's life, Ralph McBride, is stolen by the trickery of a supposed best friend. He eventually does come back to her as a soldier off to fight in the World War and their two-day illicit romance results in a pregnancy, which alienates her from her beloved Grandmother. Later, after her lover comes back from war, disillusioned by his experiences on the battlefield, their marriage is marked with more disappointment and struggle as they leave their beloved mountain home and move to a large town. When the Depression hits, and her husband loses his job, she finds work selling gloves in a shop where her wages keep getting reduced and the family struggles to put food on the table. There's always compassion though for those even less fortunate and we get to know their small community of neighbors.There were a lot of themes going on at once in spite of the simplicity of the words. Yet the story itself was so engaging that I was reading it on the bus one day and went two stops past my usual stop. The sense of place is dominant throughout and I was transported into the author's world. It was not always a pleasant place to be, especially during those Depression years, but I totally related to it all, and admire the \\"vein of iron\\" in the author, as well as in her characters. Recommended."},{"Title":"Vein of iron","review":"Ellen Glasgow is definitely an underrated American female writer; how many have heard of her? She writes elegantly and truthfully. The setting for Vein of Iron is an area of rural Virginia where I spent much of my childhood. I don't think it has changed much! In this novel, there are wonderful passages about the impact of Christian beliefs on the life of the people who settled in the region (which can surely be generalized to many rural settlements throughout the U.S.). Glasgow creates a fascinating character in Ada's father, who struggles with his spirituality. Ada is strong, faithful, optimistic- just as I imagined our female predecessors to be at that time. This is a character-driven, setting-driven novel, and I loved it. My daughter surprised me with it for mother's day. Thanks, daughter!"},{"Title":"Vein of iron","review":"The story of Ada Fincastle begins at the turn of the century in the small village of Ironside, Virginia. She is a good-natured child living modestly with her family. Her father is an &quot;ex-communicated&quot; minister turned farmer; who writes philosophical books in his spare time. Her mother, aunt, and grandmother take care of the house.As the story commences, Ada's boyfriend, Ralph, and her have a fairly serious relationship. However, Ada's best friend, Janet, who is rich and spoiled likes Ralph and wants him. Ada and Ralph have a fight at a party and Ralph goes home with Janet. Ralph was caught in Janet's room (looking for a photograph) and was forced to marry her because of this moral transgression. Janet had schemed this from the beginning.Ralph's marriage doesn't work and divorces Janet before the start of World War I. Before Ralph leaves for France, he and Ada have a weekend in the woods and Ada eventually winds up pregnant. However, Ada is willing to accept the scorn because they were 2 days of bliss. When Ralph returns from the war they marry.During the roaring 20's they move to a big city and begin acquiring possessions and money. However, Ralph is injured in a car accident and they are forced to spend their savings. Just after his recovery, the Great Depression hits and they find themselves in dire straits.The purpose of Glasgow's epic tale is happiness. Ada and Ralph are reminded often that they experience the deepest happiness when they are together. Happiness in possessions is shallow and when examined for their &quot;true happiness&quot; it is often revealed to be not even present. Happiness can also be a double-edged sword; often when life takes away happiness one remembers with regret other times when one was happy. Ada wonders throughout the book why God allows happiness to be fleeting.The book was very slow to start. About 40 pages into it I was debating on putting it away. However, I gave it another 50 pages and it was getting better. I am glad I made my way through it. The descriptions and scenes of the desperation, especially those of the Great Depression, rival those of Steinbeck's. Glasgow's characters are typical and are similar to those found in her other books. Her examples of the moral changes that came after the first world war are also priceless (I loved it when Ada was shocked when her boy came home and said the world &quot;Lousy&quot;.) Also, one can see many similarities between the roaring 20's (and its declining morals) with those of the 90's. The characters worried and said almost the same things that newspaper pundits are saying today."},{"Title":"Vein of iron","review":"Not really a review, but I collect Ellen Glasgow books. It should be noted in her bio here that she won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1942 for In This Our Life. I don't see that book here on Amazon, but it should be since it was a Pulitzer Prize winner. I saw that some say her books are \\"overwritten,\\" but you must take them in the context of when they were written. She is a wonderful author and depicts life in the South and rural America extremely well. Her real gift is her insight into her characters and what makes all of us human."},{"Title":"My Imitation of Christ (CONFRATERNITY of the PRECIOUS BLOOD)","review":"The Confraternity of the Precious Blood is well known for producing pocket sized editions of work geared to aspects of Christian teaching. They have material on the Psalms arranged around the \\"Book of Hours\\". They had a great edition of \\"Christ in the Gospel\\" from 1949 that featured readings that brought you through the ministry of Christ through accumulated common features of the 4 Gospels in a six month period. They also have a New Testament that is arranged for getting through the entire NT in six months of daily readings. However, this particular classic work is given a stellar treatment, much like the book of Psalms and Christ in the Gospel in that it features pen and ink artwork by the great artist Ariel Agemian. The full page drawings are very impressive and stunning. His art provokes thought on the eternal condition of your soul as you read through the classic Thomas a' Kempis text that is so appropriate for reflections on daily living and building your prayer life up from perhaps a time of fallowness.If you could select any book on faith that would be useful to carry in your pocket and atmospherically remind you each day to think about your relationship with God then this is the work to buy. When I was young and I first heard of \\"The Imitation of Christ\\", I thought, here we go, another book that throws quotations at you and bores you to death with points of law. Well, when I finally opened it and checked it out, was I ever wrong! It is one of the greatest works ever written for getting you to think about God and your relationship with him and the true vanity of this world. All the more enhanced by this Confraternity of the Precious Blood edition! Well recommended! (The Confraternity of the Precious Blood is a cloistered convent group, aided by Priests and staff to outreach to the world through the publication of these works, based in Brooklyn NY, since the late 1800s)"},{"Title":"My Imitation of Christ (CONFRATERNITY of the PRECIOUS BLOOD)","review":"The Confraternity of the Precious Blood's version of My Imitation of Christ is perfection. It comes in a handy pocket-size, and it is managable when read one chapter at a time (just a page or two). They are little nibbles of spirituality that can be read in the morning, reflected on throughout the day, and built on. With time, it is much like chipping away at the block of old, bad habits and slowly molding and practicing new, better ones. The practice of perfection in virtue can be overwhelming, but My Imitation of Christ is inspiring and deeply provoking. This is not a book about Catholic rituals and prayers - this is a book about what it means to be Christian, or Christ-like. To imitate Christ in all aspects (as nearly as one is able) is the Christian's primary and ultimate goal.The Confraternity also publishes My Daily Bread, which is another indispensable book for Christian devotion, and together with My Imitation of Christ are the perfect gifts for any new, Christian library."},{"Title":"My Imitation of Christ (CONFRATERNITY of the PRECIOUS BLOOD)","review":"This is my favorite daily devotion book. The lessons are very thought-provoking and just the right length to spend a few minutes in the morning orienting yourself for the day. I am on my 3rd or 4th reading of it, and the devotions still seem fresh and inspiring. Every time I finish it, I think, \\"I wouldn't mind going through that again\\" and start it over. The sketches for each devotion are also interesting. I HIGHLY recommend purchasing this book and using it for a daily meditation/devotional book."},{"Title":"My Imitation of Christ (CONFRATERNITY of the PRECIOUS BLOOD)","review":"I've had this precious volume since high school.

Han can make all those esoteric terms like quark, meson, lepton, and neutrino meaningful and interesting, which is no small feat. I finally understand how all the particles relate to each other and the larger universe, and enjoyed reading the book in the process."},{"Title":"Quarks and Gluons: A Century of Particle Charges","review":"We found this book to be excellent for those people with some scientific training or interest, to learn about particle physics. It's written in such a style that people will want to keep on reading it and not put it down."},{"Title":"Quarks and Gluons: A Century of Particle Charges","review":"A number of books for the educated layman have been written explaining the fundamental concepts of the Standard Model of Particle Physics. This book is one of the very best. Prof. Han has taken a historical time-line approach to introducing the reader to the theory and experiment of quarks and leptons, and their force carrier particles gluons, and the weak gauge bosons. This book utilizes a superb combination of text, tables, and diagrams to illustrate the author's points. Han's book has two particularly well-written narratives. The first is his lucid discussion of the chromo or 'color charge' in hadron formation, and the second is a presentation of conservation or zero-sum attributes of particles in collision. All introductory works explain, for example, that a proton is two up and one down quark. Han goes beyond that to invoke the need for color neutrality of red, green, and blue. Zero-sum conservation is found in few other books at this level. Han uses simple accounting tables to keep track of electric, nucleonic, leptonic, color, and baryonic 'charge'. Using these simple concepts the fact that beta decay must produce not a neutrino, but an anti-neutrino makes perfect sense. Han restricts his purview to just the fundamentals of the Standard Model. Anti-matter is discussed, but there are no excursions into string theory, supersymmetry, or even the Higgs boson. The historical time-line essentially ends with the confirmation of the top quark in 1995 at Fermilab. Nonetheless, this book is lucid, well-written and often witty. It is an outstanding intro to particle physics for the non-physicist."},{"Title":"Quarks and Gluons: A Century of Particle Charges","review":"Quarks and Gluons: A Century of Particle ChargesIn the past atoms were the building blocks of matter. Then we realized that atoms were composed of protons, neutrons and an outer shell of electrons. This realization gave us a comprehensive understanding of the workings of nature.Then we delved even deeper into things, and tiny though protons and neutrons are, we managed to work out that they were composed of even tinier entities called quarks held together my bosons called gluons. It is indeed a compliment to human ingenuity that we were able to do this and derive a model for it called the Standard Model.The collection of particles and forces that make up this Model are described in an excellent, easy to read manner, in this book. But even though it is a very readable book, it deals with the themes of quarks and gluons, in a quite comprehensive way. The use of graphs and mathematics is non existent i.e. the presentation is mainly textual, but in spite of that, a good understanding of what is happening at the most fundamental level in nature can be obtained by reading this book.This reviewer highly recommends it."},{"Title":"Quarks and Gluons: A Century of Particle Charges","review":"This is a very interesting book in QP.

He had a special love and feeling for humor. And here he provides excerpts of the works not only of the most well- known humorists of his day but of many whose names few would recognize today. The greats of the day- S. J. Perelman, Ring Lardner, Dorothy Parker, Damon Runyan, O. Henry, Thurber, Benchley, Don Marquis et. al. are here often with some of their less notable work. Perhaps I have lost it, and simply was not in the right spirit for it but I found a good share of the writing, dated and flat. There was some interesting stuff which was a bit humorous, for instance Russell Lynes on snobbery in the days when Newport was the spa of the Four Hundred. In this piece one Newport grand- dame refuses to invite a wealthy carpeteer to her home saying ,\\" Just because I bought a rug from him doesn't mean I have to let him walk on it.\\" And from time to time, one- liners like this do pop out of the page and inspire a chortle, a guffaw, or perhaps simply a dry , little smile. The anthology is big and I far from covered it all in my reading. My guess is other readers, should the wish to go back there, will find more treasure in it than I in my somewhat scattered reading did."},{"Title":"Que Tal (Spanish Edition)","review":"This is the first review I have ever written, so that is saying something about this book. I agree with the other reviewers that this book is disorganized - the layout is unappealing and confusing. Some vocabulary words are presented with only a picture, which I guess is to help one visualize the meaning of the word, which is fine, except with some pictures it is almost impossible to figure out what the word means. Case and point is on the page(p.50) where the book is introducing words to describe family members and relatives. The book presents the word for cousin with only a picture of a boy and girl with a dog, with the only clue to figure out the definition being that their names are present. And they share the same last name!!! So they could be cousins yes, or brother and sister, or husband and wife!!! This is just one instance of many of the whole \\"figure out the word from a poor picture\\" approach. Exercises are poorly designed and presented.The entire book feels like you are reading appendices, at least that is how it feels like it is presented. The website isn't very helpful either. Also, if you have \\"Quia\\" homework based off of this book good luck, the website is just as poorly designed as the book. At the end of the course we are allowed to write our thoughts and opinions on the course, teacher, and text book, and you better believe that I will direct them to the Amazon reviews for my thoughts and opinions!

Often times they will provide you with a vocab word, but no translation beside it.

Wicked uncles are such a hazard to young heirs who are also orphans! His bondage brings him to America.There, at the age of twelve, he saves the life of a young boy, is bought by the boy's father, and meets for the first time, the five-year-old Della Kensington. Drawn to each other in spite of the disparity in their stations of life--their purported stations in life, that is, for no one believes Jared's story--they grow up as not quite sister and brother. Jared has but one goal in life; to return to England and reclaim his inheritance. Only then will he be whole again.By the time Della is nearing twenty, Jared is finally ready for the journey to his past. He encounters surprise after surprise, the first being that the current Earl is that younger brother, Justin, whom he thought dead. The second is the warmth and sincerity of the welcome offered by the new Earl, and his fianc&eacute;e, Fiona, from a neighboring estate. She has been promised since her cradle to the Earl of Alveston, and is perfectly willing to switch her allegiance to whomever holds the position.Into this mix comes Della, a young woman wise enough to know that sometimes freedom binds stronger than chains. As the two couples wind their way through Georgian society new dangers appear.This is truly an emotion-packed story of star-crossed lovers. You won't want to put it down. Most likely, you won't be able to, either."},{"Title":"Bound by Love","review":"An English gentleman, Alfred Kensington, newly arrived in the colony of Virginia, rewards the bond-boy who saved his son's life by buying his indenture papers, freeing him, and offering him employment in his household. The boy is strong, good-looking, reliable and intelligent, and eager to please. The only fly in the ointment is that he insists that he's actually an earl - that he was kidnapped five years earlier and sold into slavery. The boy has to be mad!But some years later, when Jared is now 27, he announces that he is going back to England to try to prove that his story is true. He has no expectations of regaining his title and lands, but he wants to confront his uncle, the one who arranged his kidnap. In the meantime, Alfred's daughter Della has fallen deeply in love with Jared, who only sees her as a sister.The scene then shifts to England; Jared journeys to his old home, only to find that the present earl is his younger brother Justin, whom he'd believed dead all those years. He's quickly ensconced as the earl, lord of all he surveys and owner of all the lands and money which go with the title. But he can't help feeling a lingering, nagging sense of guilt about taking everything away from his brother. Even Justin's fiancee, Fiona, was actually betrothed from birth to the Earl... not the earl's younger brother. And it seems that Fiona would be only too happy to switch her affections to Jared.It's into this tangled situation that Della arrives some weeks later, visiting as part of a last-ditch effort to persuade Jared to see her as a woman instead of his sister - and if he won't, to say goodbye. But she quickly realises that there's more going on here than she expected; Jared the Earl is a very different man from Jared the merchant in Virginia. Does she stand a chance with this new Jared?This is a love story, but it's also a story about a man finding out who - and what - he really is. Jared was degraded as a young boy, and he carries the scars of that part of his life still: some visible, such as those on his back, and some invisible and carried inside himself. He can't accept that he is worthy to be an aristocrat, because he was brought so low. His friends and family must convince him - and he must convince himself - that true nobility comes from within, regardless of someone's birth or upbringing. Jared's soulsearching is very well told; sometimes painful, and always engrossing.Very highly recommended - if you can get your hands on a copy, snap it up!

This expanded edition was updated for the 1990s, and although much of the original 1970s edition's text was left unchanged, Comfort had to rethink some of his ideas about multiple partners as a result of the AIDS epidemic, something that all of us should still pay attention to.Despite some use of erudite \\"History of Sex\\" material cited by other reviewers, Comfort didn't lapse into overly clinical language, using colloquialisms for male and female genitalia instead of their medical names. Comfort, after all, wasn't writing for doctors in a dry academic tome; he was writing to the rest of us, using words and phrases that we are comfortable using within the confines of our bedrooms.There are, of course, other \\"cookbooks\\" with recipes for great sex, but Comfort's classic was, and still is, among the best of them."},{"Title":"The New Joy of Sex: A Gourmet Guide to Lovemaking for the Nineties","review":"I refer to the original version from the early 70's.

When Guinevere, Lady of Leonesse, finds herself desperate for protection for both herself and her people from an ex-Knight of the Round Table, she turns to King Arthur to save them all.Guinevere's decision - to marry the king, leads her into danger and intrigue as she begins the wildest journey of her life.When Lancelot saves an unknown lady in the forest, both their hearts become engaged. Lancelot becomes a friend and trusted confidant to the King, and Guinevere becomes Arthur's wife. While fighting to keep their love at bay, war threatens to tear them apart forever.Chadwick's love of re-enactment becomes apparent in this wonderful story of forbidden love. She describes everything in such striking detail; the reader can almost smell the stench of burning straw or feel the adrenaline and fear accompanying battle.

But I cannot help but feel that it was written with the possibility of it being made into a film at the back of the author's mind.Hollywood has never been very good at portraying English history and the film they made of this book is no exception. Although many people will have found the film entertaining, it bears no relationship to what Arthur and his knights may have looked like, or their surroundings.Arthur, or someone very much like him may have existed but certainly not as a \\"suited and booted\\" knight in shining armour.

It comes from the book \\"The Biography of a Grizzly\\" about a bear named Whab. At age ten in 1954, as a 5th grader, I made a book report on this book. In the 6th grade I had a different teacher and did not like reading very much so I decided to change last years book report a little to make it look like I actually did some research then presented my report on \\"Whab, The Biography of a Grizzly\\" again. Little did know, at that age, that teachers knew each other. My taecher caught me and made an issue of it in the classroom to the extreme of making me stand in front of the class and confess what I had done. In addition, she started calling me \\"Whab\\" which later was reduced to \\"Wab\\" and has been my nickname for all these years. Very few people know my real name is Larry.Obviously this book made a lasting impression on my life.

A bear cub who is orphaned at the hands of the human learns to cope and survive to one day exact his revenge on the hated human. The book is written through the eyes of the bear it seems and you can't help but feel his pain and rage as he struggles through life alone. Whab, the name of the bear, is taken advantage of as a cub and through life. As he grows and becomes more bitter and angry,he will at times meet up with his old enemies from the woodland and through his eyes they all seem so much smaller now. This book is not all anger and bitterness but has some very tender moments as well. As well as this book is written, I never imagined I could ever feel pity or sympathy for such a creature as a grizzly. Ernest Thompson seton is a gifted writer and I have passed this gift on to many friends and aquaintances over the years. If you are looking for a book that your children will pass on to thier children for generations ; get this book.

My nostalgic memory is of a haunting,memorable, and very literate tale of an excellent bear-person, who resolutely faces what life offers; infancy &amp; vulnerability; growth &amp; education, maturity &amp; strength, suffering fools and agressors, and finally, decline and mortality. Seton's magic is to dissolve completely the artificial barrier between nature's creatures and ourselves."},{"Title":"The biography of a grizzly","review":"I first read this book as a kid in the 1950's. A neighbor loaned it to me. I was fascinated by it, the first time I had read a book devoted to one animal in a personified way. It still evokes exactly the same feelings now as it did then. While a pure scientist might object to how personified and dramatized it is, based on reading other books on bears and grizzlies in particular, it seems pretty fact-based to me. A reader might wonder where the book, essentially a chronology, is going, but it does build to the conclusion, which is not earth-shattering but as touching and emotional as it is simple. It really conveys many things that we humans can relate to and feel. I've given it to my oldest child to read, and will eventually give it to the others.The book is an easy read, has a simple style, and really helps the reader picture how things look from the animals' perspective. Animals do have intelligence and emotions, recent learnings show that even sharks do, so this book is probably more relevant and true to life than when it was written.I recommend it to readers from about age 10 to the oldest adult will all enjoy it and come away thinking and feeling in ways they didn't expect."},{"Title":"The biography of a grizzly","review":"When Mother read this to me when I was a child, it delighted me and made a huge impression.

I'm buying a copy for my library - maybe I'll be able to read it to the grandkids - or vice versa :) A fairly short story about the life and death of a grizzly. What stands out in my mind after all these years is the way the aging process is made part of life. Probably best for the budding naturalist rather than those who think predation is a dirty word and all carnivores should be muzzled. A great philosophical work for those who want to teach some of Nature's ways to the young. Its a pretty transparent allegory of our lives. Deals (gently but clearly) with topics like death, fear, competition - winning and loosing. I'd say ages 8 to 13, best read together with your child. (At least the first time!)

Dr Barnett makes a bold move at creating and following a novel metaphor through out the book. He states that the mind is analogous to the criminal system and that through no fault of our own that prisons are created within our mind. He feels that there are many medical illnesses that have their origins within the 4 prisons mind. First, phobias are unresolved conflicts that have triggers that the patient attributes to the phobia rather than the unresolved conflict. The trigger produces anxiety, which is a manifestation of a powerful fear that imprisons the mind. The second is repressed anger. He states that suppressed anger is like a sleeping volcano that can erupt in the form of a headache, peptic ulcer, back pain, hypertension or obesity. The third prison is pain and sadness, which he feels central to the genesis of all emotional illnesses. He makes a convincing argument for the earlier the rejection, the more devastating the effects because the client has fewer resources with which to deal with it. Asthma, depression, drugs and smoking are attributed to rejection. The final prison is that of guilt which is consistently a potent factor in the production of emotional illness. Impotence, frigidity, obesity, skin diseases and suicide many times have their origins rooted to guilt.Dr Barnet makes the argument that a crime is any act that endangers the peace of society. The analogy here is that a crime of guilty is often self-imposed on children who interfere with their parent's harmony. He makes the bold move to suggest that many of these self-imposed crimes are perpetrated in utero. His argument makes sense even though it flies in the face of western medicine. He states that at least on a subconscious level, the child hears and feels what his parents say or feel about him. The most convincing argument for this is that of gender conflict. It makes sense that a child would have conflict with their gender if their parents were disappointed that they did not get the sex that they desired. This suggestion that they are not desired at birth, places the child into a prison of guilt as the child grows. Prisons of guilt and fear can also develop from similar circumstances.The court of the mind is similar to other court systems. When an individual is accused of an emotional crime, his mind makes a decision that is binding and will determine that individual's future. This courtroom analogy goes further when delving into psychiatric evidence that we all operate from more than one ego state. To fully understand the complex metaphor the ego states must be reviewed. The three states of the mind are the child, the parent, and the adult. The child is the first state and is the feelings part of our being that provides drive and energy. The child ego says: \\"I like or I want.\\" Very quickly the parent portion of the ego develops that is essentially mimicry of the child's parents. The function of the parent is to gather all information it can about the people in the immediate environment of the child so that they may respond in a harmonious manner. The parent ego says: \\"I should.\\" The adult develops after years of maturing and is concerned with collecting information about the world and filing it for future reference. The adult ego says things like: \\"I can, or I will.\\" In the court of the mind, the accused is always the child that is being prosecuted for an attribute that has caused offense. The prosecutor is usually the parent, usually the mother. The accuser is always someone within the child's immediate environment, who is distressed by who they are. The judge unfortunately in early life is the child's parent ego whose job it is to protect the child with its archaic methodology. The defense team is the child who thinks that they are only doing what is right for them. When the verdict comes from the parent ego state, a sentence is passed that ensures the crime will never recur. The punishment is always fashioned to fit the crime. If the expression of a feeling has been found unacceptable, the parent may decree that the sentence is to withhold any expression of that forbidden feeling. Often times the toddler verdict can be \\"you must not exist,\\" \\"you must never feel angry,\\"\\" you are not lovable,\\" \\"you must not succeed,\\" \\"you must not be afraid,\\" \\"you must not love,\\" or \\"you must not think.\\" The implications of these decisions are long reaching and consistent with emotional problems experienced in adulthood. The decision is reinforced with guilt. Whenever the child thinks about performing the act, the immaturely developed parent ego state merely flashes the results of the last transgression on the child's emotional television screen and guilty foreboding occurs.The release from prison can only occur when the information is re-presented (re-trial) with the mature adult ego state as a judge and a pardon can be justly handed down. However the initial incident is deep in the bowels of the subconscious. Hypnosis is used to reveal the lost information to the adult so that a correct judgment can be determined. Often times this re-judgment can occur on a subconscious level and still be effective.Rehabilitation must also occur after the pardon. To resolve old bad habits, new positive reinforcement must be ongoing. Three rules need to be followed for rehabilitation to occur. First, they must promise to stop putting themselves or their feelings down. Second, the individual must promise to never again allow anyone to themselves or their feelings down. Third, they must never knowingly put anyone else down.The author goes onto justify how these prisons of the mind will manifest in physical ailments and detailed methodology on how a trained hypnotherapist can go about resolving these crimes. If a hypnotherapist is not available, he goes into detail on how self-hypnosis can help. The book concludes with case studies and information on how the power of the mind has been useful in healing disease.Overall, this was an excellent book with innovative thoughts that are far ahead of its time. The in utero development of the subconscious mind and the far-reaching effects of adverse parental interaction are definitely plausible."},{"Title":"Unlock your mind and be free!","review":"Dr. Barnett's book is fairly short and easy to read. It contains an excellent explanation of the root causes of emotional (and many physical) problems, using a Transactional Analysis model. By using hypnosis to get at these root causes, he has been able to free many patients from depression, addictions, obesity, and psychosomatic medical disorders. It was particularly useful for me that he has the credentials of having been a family practitioner for many years prior to entering the full time practice of hypnosis. Many books on hypnosis aim to clear up emotional disturbances by using more superficial means, such as direct suggestion. Barnett does regression therapy to truly get at the root cause of the problem, and cure it. He makes an excellent point that it is not our negative emotions which cause us problems, but our resistance to feeling the truth of our emotions that is the REAL cause of stress and unhappiness. A must read for all serious hypnosis practitioners."},{"Title":"Unlock your mind and be free!","review":"In a world often fraught with depression and emotional prisons...Dr. Edgar A.

This book covers all the bases concerning Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy filings. From common mistakes and misconceptions to the highly specific legalese of bankruptcy law, this book addressed nearly every one of my concerns about this complex and emotionally challenging process. I opened the front cover a bankruptcy know-nothing and set it down feeling like an attorney.This is not a DIY guide to financial rebirth (in fact the authors highly discourage this), but more of an \\"Everything-You-Ever-Wanted-to-Know-About-Bankruptcy-but-Were-Afraid-to-Ask\\" reference. The authors do not delve into the minutia of the process. They seek to be more like tour guides, leading you through the perilous wilds of US bankruptcy law with their collective wealth of knowledge on the subject. I found more useful information in the first 10 pages of this book than I did in six hours of web-surfing.The most superlative compliment I can bestow upon this volume is that it helped to allay my fears and crystalize my plans for my financial future."},{"Title":"Personal Bankruptcy for Dummies","review":"This book is clear, concise, understandable and even funny at times.

I liked the photographs which accurately depicted various professions/lifestyles in Nigeria and some of them provide wonderful ideas for story book extensions. For example, the photograph of the grandmother making a traditional outfit could be complemented by presenting to the children a few yards of woven fabric that is typically used in Nigeria for such outfits. Other professional roles we see Nigerians in are: BAKER, DOCTOR, WOOD CARVER/CARPENTER, LAWYER, POTTER, BLACKSMITH and FINALLY THE TRADITIONAL NATIVE DOCTOR or HERBALIST who gives us an excellent botanist lesson on plants and their healing properties. All in all, it paints Nigerians as an industrious people, which is what we are."},{"Title":"Crewel Lye (A Caustic Yarn)","review":"\\"Crewel Lye\\" is the eighth book in Piers Anthony's \\"Xanth\\" series, and in some ways, it is the most impressive of the first nine. Most of the Xanth books take place in a reasonably well-define timeline that we might call the \\"present.\\" This actually spans quite a long time, since the main character in Xanth-1, Bink, is 25 years in that book, but around 60 in Xanth-9. But \\"Crewel Lye\\" takes place **400** years earlier, so it doesn't have the benefit of a lot of the usual Xanthian touches that prop up other books. (By Xanthian touches, I mean things like finding out how to get into Good Magician Humfrey's castle so as to get an Answer.)Anyway, in the \\"present\\" time, Jordan is a ghost, which means that he died with unresolved issues. When little Princess Ivy asks what happened, he tells her the story of his demise. Thus, most of the book is actually narrated in the first-person, which is different from the other Xanth books, and a nice change of pace. First-person narration forces a writer to be disciplined about observations, thoughts, etc., because only those of one person can be related to the reader. This is important for this book, because the \\"cruel lie\\" that does Jordan in actually has a different interpretation, one that Jordan doesn't realize, but the reader can figure out. It makes for a very clever ending, even if it becomes somewhat obvious.Jordan's story -- he is a barbarian who wants an adventure -- is full of action and violence, some intrigue, some romance (or just plain offscreen sex), and even though I was concerned that I wouldn't get to read about the usual Xanth characters, I was engrossed in it."},{"Title":"Crewel Lye (A Caustic Yarn)","review":"Crewel Lye is about the journey of Jordan the Barbarian. Like all Xanth books, this one is comical and full of puns.

I think that anyone who reads the Xanth series should definitely read this one."},{"Title":"Crewel Lye (A Caustic Yarn)","review":"I read this book several years ago and wrote a review of it then, but didn't post my name.

She handed it to me and told me to keep it--because I wouldn't want to return it to her and she could get another copy, which she did purchase!I was enchanted. There is no other word for it. This exceptionally \\"punny\\" book is hilarious. My son went as a \\"baseball bat\\" for Halloween the year before last, if that says anything! To this day I'm always buying Crewel Lye (though it's not the first in the series, and I had such fun catching up!) for friends and family (well, there's not many readers left without a copy these days.) I must have bought this book at least eight times now, if not more.I think the Xanth series should be required reading, it really taught me how much I could love the genre. You won't go wrong with Crewel Lye, in fact, you might just end up hooked!"},{"Title":"Crewel Lye (A Caustic Yarn)","review":"Taking a slightly different path, Piers Anthony's Crewel Lye is the story of Jordan the Ghost. Those who read the series, will remember that Jordan plays a key role in \\"dragon on a pedestal\\" and this book is his personal story. In Xanth, ghosts are people or things that have unresolved issues at the time of their deaths. Several years after the events of Dragon, Jordan meets Ivy at the magic tapestry and she convinces him to tell her his story.Four hundread years before, Jordan was a barbarian in search of adventure. For that he leaves his home and his girlfriend. While adventuring, his magical talent comes to bear and he uses it extensively. Jordan's talent is that he heals from every injury in a brief amount of time. That carries forward onto death even - and indeed, Jordan dies during this story! - multiple times!!Jordan hears that Castle Roogna is where adventures can be found and makes his way there. When he arrives he is given a quest and some magical help, and he is off to the races. As it turns out, his quest is to retrieve the King's daughter and bring her back to the castle to wed one of the magicians. However, this being a Xanth book, there are many twists and turns and puns to get through. The King's daughter, it turns out, is not interested in coming back. Not only that, but the first time she meets Jordan, she poisons him and then throws his body into the Gap Chasm.No suprise then, that Jordan falls in love with her, captures her, and takes her back to the castle. Many more interesting adventures are in store with lots of puns along the lines of quicksand (which makes you go fast - obviously), and slow sand (the reverse of quicksand). Since there are competing magicians for the King's daughter's favors, some of the magical help is actually a hindrance and lots of strange things happen. This is an opportunity for Anthony to explain his beliefs about how women differ from men and why their relative body shapes and sizes affect their behaviors and attitudes.The title is Crewel Lye and it is a pun for the whole book. This special kind of Lye is needed to restore the clarity of what the tapestry shows. But, it is also the name of the whole story if spelled \\"cruel lie\\" as Jordan finds out - not once, but at least twice!This was a different book than the other Xanth stories I've read. It was more serious in tone in many respects. Extreme violence and death was a constant theme in this one, whereas it is severely de-emphasized in others. Sex comes into play here in a variety of fashions and it is quite fascinating to see how the author manages to avoid explaining it directly, while giving everyone a very good idea of what is going on.Overall I rated it a three star book as an OK read. It was not as much fun as Dragon on a Pedestal, but it was not a bad book either."},{"Title":"Crewel Lye (A Caustic Yarn)","review":"Once again we have another book well written and filled with puns.

Since barbarians normally don't have magic, this could be disturbing. He falls in love with a beautiful women, who appears to love him too. But love, and magic, aren't always what they appear to be. Although, sometimes, they are. With some competing Magicians involved Jordan's life becomes a little bit complicated.While, I loved the early Xanth books and I still strongly recommend them, Crewel Lye is not up to the standards of the earlier books. It is still an enjoyable read, it is just not as good as the earlier stories. In particular, I got tired of Jordan referring to the rules of Barbarians. It wasn't very funny and it dragged on the story.The first Xanth stories had more creativity. Crewel Lye seems like a copy of Castle Roogna. The characters are different, but the story is almost the same, including the ending. There are enough changes along the way to make it interesting, but not as good as the first few books of this series. I wouldn't recommend it, but I don't warn you off either. It's okay, which is better then alot of books."},{"Title":"Crewel Lye (A Caustic Yarn)","review":"I've been rereading the entire Xanth series, and \\"Crewel Lye\\" is not up to par.Piers Anthony rarely has a \\"light touch\\", but this time his laying it on too heavily even gets on my nerves... After about the second allusion, the reader already knows the ending, but Anthony keeps on hinting at it - with a sledgehammer (I won't write a spoiler here, though ;-)The plot is rambling, and character development is nonexistent - for better books on these counts, go to books 1, 3, 4, 5 or 6 (not so much 2 and 7) in the series. The usual puns, which I as a non-native speaker really like (some new ones again!). The usual sexual under(?)tones, which you get used to. The book's not too bad on these counts.But: I'm definitely not a prude or overly conservative, but the sheer goryness of the book turns me off. Jordan gets dismembered various times, and the descriptions are given in loving detail. This clashes horribly with the usual carefree and light tone of the Xanth series. In addition, the gory parts are not even well written, and if I want blood splattered, I will not turn to an Anthony book.Overall: a disappointment. I'll keep it mainly to avoid an empty slot on my Xanth shelf."},{"Title":"Crewel Lye (A Caustic Yarn)","review":"After devouring Mr. Anthony's Incarnations of Immortality series, this was the first Xanth book I tried and I enjoyed it immensely. Now a diehard Xanth fan, this remains among my favorites of the series.

Fiction has the National Book Award, children's books have the Caldecott, community cookbooks have the Tabasco Award. First place in the Tabasco Community Cookbook Award 2000 has been awarded to Good Food Served Right: Traditional Recipes and Food Customs From New York's North Country.Good Food Served Right is more than a collection of recipes; this book is an extensive collection of traditional recipes and food customs from that area of New York State known as the North Country. Primarily a land of dairy farming and forestry located above the Adirondacks and below the Canadian border, Northern New York is that stump of the state with an independence borne from too long, arctic gray winters and only occasional notice from the rest of the world, not always a bad thing. Good Food Served Right breaks beneath that surface and reveals a riotous, brilliant crazy quilt of ethnic diversity through its food. Italian Pasta a Ceci, Armenian Shish Kebab, Mohawk Fried Bread, Jewish Stuffed Cabbage, Korean Kimchi, Lebanese Spinach Pies, and French Yellow Pea Soup are some of the recipes that represent various groups who make their home in the North Country. There are also the local annual events such as fireman's field days, county fairs, ice cream socials, hunting clubs, and cheese making in the area. Some of the other recipes that caught my eye were Maple Johnnycake, Whoopie Pies, Deep-Fried Northern Bullhead, Crow's Nest and Hoppin' John. Each of the books 25 chapters are introduced with a well researched brief history and personal essay from the author, Lynn Case Ekfelt, a university archivist and folklorist. The project was under the auspices and support of TAUNY (Traditional Arts of Upstate New York).In this day of cookbooks touting the latest diet, or collections of convoluted recipes photographed in far flung locations Good Food Served Right is a well-written cookbook giving us a practical manual of real recipes for the home cook and a window onto the North Country's food defined by a mix of it's history, culture, and geography.Excerpt from Good Food Served Right, \\"An Amish Saturday in Rensselaer Falls\\":\\"The house, though big enough in its own right, is dwarfed by the huge barn beside it, the unweathered, unfinished wood screaming \\"new\\". In fact, the family has just hosted a barn-raising at which they cooked for 300 people. I don't hear all of the details of the meal but I do learn that 40 chickens were involved. The house, too, has an unfinished look to my \\"English\\" eyes as we drive up - no curtains dress the windows, no flowers brighten the yard. In fact there are no touches of color anywhere except the blue of the dresses belonging to the five young women in the kitchen and the plain blue wooden cupboard against the kitchen wall. Like the room, its inhabitants are unadorned. Barefoot, they wear solid blue or brown dresses fastened by pins, no buttons or zippers. Each has an apron to protect her clothing from the rigors of house work and a cap modestly covering her hair.\\""},{"Title":"Good Food, Served Right : Traditional Recipes and Food Customs from New York's North Country","review":"Good Food Served Right demonstrates North Country (New York) diversity through an appeal to our taste buds. Written and researched by folklorist and home cook Lynn Ekfelt, this informative and entertaining book is part adventure travel, part ethnography, part grandmother's recipe file. It is also a great read.&quot;The idea of depending primarily on local products is only part of traditional cookery,&quot; Ekfelt observes in the introduction. &quot;Another important aspect can be summed up in the old adage, 'Waste not, want not.' This guiding principle is behind the cooking of all traditions and has led to the creation of such diverse dishes as bread pudding and head cheese.&quot; The book goes beyond the recipes to explore the ways food is &quot;so closely related to our concepts of nurturing.&quot; observing that, &quot;food preparation and eating is an important time of apprenticeship--a time when new members of a family or community learn how to take their place as contributing members of their groups. MOre than food-related values are passed on during these sessions. They are also a time for retelling of family legends and establishing a communal response to events both within and outside the family.&quot;Good Food Served Right is divided into three sections. &quot;Nature's Bounty&quot; explores the many uses of apples, cheese, fish, game, maple syrup and wild foods. &quot;Who We Are&quot; features favorite edibles from North Country African Americans, Amish, Armenian Americans, French Americans, Greek Americans, Homesteaders, Hungarian Americans, Italian Americans, Jews, Korean Americans, Lebanese Americans, Mennonites, Mohawks, and Yankees. &quot;Building Community&quot; looks at the foods traditionally served at county fairs, church suppers, fundraisers, firemen's field days and ice cream socials.Each chapter follows a formula: a personal essay about some food-centered event or activity, tested recipes collected from local cooks, interviews with the cooks, and a history of the featured cuisine. Ekfelt sets the scene for the &quot;Maple Syrup&quot; chapter with: &quot;It's a long walk from our car back into the woods to the sugar shack, and my boots get heavier with each step. Not for nothing is March known as 'mud season.' We push open the door to the shack an are met with a gust of fragrant steam.&quot; After recipes for jack wax, maple fluff frosting, maple fruit salad and more, she ends up with a transcript of her interview with the cooks and information about maple syrup, sugar maple trees and the history of the maple syrup grading system.Lively black and white photos show us just who the cooks are in common situations at home or in their communities. The classified bibliography tells us where we can find more about our favorite topics or tastes. There is an appended &quot;Quantities to Serve 50 People&quot;--something I've been looking for for a long time--as well as tables on measurements, equivalents, and substitutions, and a very complete index."},{"Title":"The Gilpin Gold Tram: Colorado's Unique Narrow-Gauge","review":"I couldn't be more pleased!

I enjoyed it, but I would have liked it better if had more focus. It had some technology, (not enough for me -- I'm a gadget person) but probably too much for people who aren't looking for that. As for the people side, I didn't really feel I came away knowing the players (as I have with Perrett's other books). Some coverage of the politcal goings on, but I wanted more. At times the book seemed to drag with recitations of 'so many sorties, so many shot down one day, more sorties, more planes lost the next.'But I don't mean to be so negative -- I did enjoy the book (and am re-reading it) and can recommend the paperback version to anybody with an interest in the subject. Mr Perrett does write very well."},{"Title":"Winged Victory: The Army Air Forces in World War II","review":"Geoffery Perret has given us some near classical one volume histories on US military history in the past {War to be won...A Country made by War}. Yet here he stumbles, not fatally but certainly critically. His previous works have shown a novelists smooth touch with the unsparing eye of a serious evidence driven historian. But here, the tale of the nurturing, birth and colossal growth of the USAAF in WW2 fails to evolve on his canvas as crisply as his previous works. The overriding obsession with Hap Arnold shown here should have left me with a clearer idea of who the man was and what made him tick. Yet I am still largely in the dark about the man, and in spite of his passion, I am still not quite sure how to frame his herculean efforts on the part of the AAF. Also, the brisk but detailed style of &quot;There's a war to be won&quot; is missing here. In that book we were able to effortlessly leap between the development of equipment, doctrines and training programs to the battlefields where all the above were tested by blood and fire, and often had to be improvised over. In &quot;Winged Victory&quot; however, I found myself bogged down in top heavy dissertations on personality conflicts and technical aero-babble that ill suits a one volume history. All in all, the book has some chapters useful for quick referencing and tidy summations, but as a one volume history, falls well short of what Perret has given us in the past."},{"Title":"Winged Victory: The Army Air Forces in World War II","review":"After reading some of the reviews of this book, I would have assumed it wasn't really that good. However, I have read it from cover-to-cover, and very familiar with the air battles of WWII, and have NOT read any of his other books.First of all, I'll deal with the last item. I have not read any of the author's previous works. I don't know what subjects he covered with those books, but for the topic at hand, the behind-the-scenes look at the USAAC/USAAF before and during WWII, he does a brilliant job. More on that in a minute.If you are looking for a book that covers the details of every major air combat in WWII, this is not your book. If you want a book that gives the details of each mission and how it was fought...not your book. If you want a book that ties the details of how the generals fought the war, what they decided to do, how it impacted the overall battles and conflict...this is your book. This book ties together all the details that you never hear when you read the other books...why was Ploesti bombed multiple times at a heavy cost, and what did it really gain us? Why did none of our fighters have the range of our bombers at the start of the war (they could have)? Why did we change from daylight \\"precision\\" bombing in Europe to night-time mass attack in Japan (which we disagreed with in Europe)? Why did the Navy control the bombs that the USAAF dropped?This book covers all that, and does it very well. Given that it doesn't talk about the battles so much as the reasons behind them, it is still very engrossing. Understanding why we did what we did was very enlightening to be able to tie with the knowledge of the specific air battles we fought. Knowing what Arnold, Spaatz and the other generals (and our allies) thought put all the pieces in place. If you want a book that does that, this book is for you.I also don't agree with the reviewer who claimed that the author \\"had it in\\" for specific people. The author covered each person who majorly influenced US air power in WWII pretty well. I feel he respected most of them, but if they had a flaw, he didn't cut them any slack and gloss it over. You get to see what lead each one of them into a position of leadership over the USAAF when WWII kicked off.Several other reviewers commented that it seemed there was too much general reciting of attacks later in the book (such as when the bombing campaign of Germany began). I didn't find that at all, and if they think this book is bad, they should read some other books where the recitation of each mission becomes very droll after a bit.If there is a flaw to this book (besides a few very minor items), it is perhaps that he uses generalizations a bit more, but this is a book about the overall impact of the USAAF in WWII, not specific units, people or battles.At any rate, enjoyed it greatly. Makes a good volume to add to my collection."},{"Title":"Winged Victory: The Army Air Forces in World War II","review":"It's an ambitious project to tell the history of the Army Air Forces in World War II in one volume, but Geoffrey Perret goes beyond that, and he\`s up to it.He begins with a capsule history of Army aviation from the start. If you're looking for shoot-'em-up whoop-de-do, go elsewhere. Perret is primarily an institutional historian and nearly half the book is done before a shot is fired.Something has to give, and it's logistics. Within the compass of fewer than 500 pages, Perret does a fine job on leaders, tactics, planes (but not other types of equipment, such as weapons, communications and navigation); and a reasonable job on politics (home and foreign), recruitment and training. Strategy is another matter, which I'll get to later. I would not have thought you could write a history of the AAF without mentioning Takoradi, but Perret has done it.To a great but not overwhelming degree, this is the story of Hap Arnold's Army Air Forces. Arnold had many flaws, such as limiting his pool of commanders to a few, sometimes not very good mates from his younger days, but overall Perret is an admirer.He says he cannot imagine anyone else commanding the air force, no one else standing up to George Marshall of the ground forces or Ernest King of the navy. Well, as the French say, the graveyards are full of indispensable men. But Perret is probably right that Tooey Spaatz, the most likely replacement, would not have done well. Spaatz had a good deal of the idiot in him, claiming as late as 1943 that by maintaining 36 sorties per day by heavy bombers he could control enemy shipping in the Mediterranean.(Perret acknowledges that some people at the time thought Frank Andrews would have excelled Arnold, but Andrews was killed in a crash. Indispensable men again.)Spaatz and his fantasies about heavy bombing is as good an example as any of the hidebound, stupid, blinkered ideology that cost so many Americans their lives -- Germans, Japanese and assorted would-be bystanders as well, of course. There are many such.Arnold was as guilty of this incompetence as anyone. Since the first heavier-than-air plane went up, the flyers have been promising that strategic bombing would win wars quickly and cheaply. The idiocy of this as ideology ought to be transparent, but apparently it isn't: If each side has a strategic bomber force, who wins?These promises have never been fulfilled, although they continue to be made in 2009.Perret is, with one important exception, clear about this. \\"The tenor of this book is a skeptical one,\\" he writes on the last page, \\"questioning the official Air Force view of the success of strategic bombing, criticizing the Air Force's highest leadership, and casting doubt on the official history of the AAF.\\"The key point that Perret is insufficiently skeptical about is the ur-sin, the mistake that begat most of the other mistakes: Billy Mitchell. Perret does not have a profound understanding of sea power, and while he is somewhat disparaging of Mitchell's performance in the famous trials of bombing obsolete battleships, he never clearly states what was nearly obvious then and was proven by events: Bombing of the kind that Mitchell preached (dropping bombs from heights at high speeds on moving ships) is useless. In the entire history of warfare, such bombing has never sunk, damaged or even inconvenienced a battleship steaming in open waters on a war footing. (The qualifiers are necessary because radio-guided bombing sank, for example, the Italian battleship Roma, but she was not on a war footing and was undefended.)Other kinds of aerial attack can succeed, but Mitchell was wrong from start to finish. Yet it was Mitchellism that prevailed and caused the United States to devote the vast majority of its air efforts to strategic bombers.These not only could not win the war, there is some question whether they didn't cost the Americans more than they cost the enemy -- until, in a profound irony, at the very end strategic bombing of a sort never imagined before did end the war.Without strategic bombers, the A-bombs could not have been dropped. The two A-bombs saved hundreds of thousands of American lives. The mistakes up to then had cost hundreds of thousands of casualties. (Astonishingly, there is not a chart or table in the book, and no summary of casualties.) It would be a nice calculation to figure out the net advantage. It's been done for the Marine casualties at Iwo Jima vs. the Air Force casualties avoided by having Iwo as a base (the Marines come up on the short end of the balance), but not, so far as I know, for strategic bombing as a whole.Despite the gaps and a few errors (such as having the Doolittle Raiders fly off the Enterprise instead of the Hornet -- goofs that ought to have been corrected by the time of the paperback edition, except that American publishers don't bother to correct their books any more), \\"Winged Victory\\" is about as good a short history of a long war as we are likely to get."},{"Title":"Winged Victory: The Army Air Forces in World War II","review":"We all know the important role of the AAF in WWII, but most books and movies focus on the ground war. The battles in the sky, often involving thousands of aircraft, are hard to imagine in the day of precision bombing that requires but a tiny fraction of aircraft of the campaigns in WWII. From the creation of the AAF, to the horrors of air battles, to the targets destroyed, this book will fill in student of WWII and aviation with an important chapter of history that is unlikely ever to be repeated. Strategic bombing alone didn't win the war, but without it, the cost to the Allies would have been far greater."},{"Title":"Winged Victory: The Army Air Forces in World War II","review":"It is very difficult to reach a conclusion about the real quality ot this book. Intended to be a general picture of USAAF in WW II, it lacks appendices, a place where much of the lack of information in the book could be informed. It talks very little about the pilots, only about generals, and in some parts it is really a boring reading. On the other side, we must consider the author had only one book to show his point, and he did the best possible."},{"Title":"Winged Victory: The Army Air Forces in World War II","review":"Thw writer has done a marvellous job, writing the history of USAAF in one volume only, in a modern and acesible language. But there are two serious flaws: 1)there are no apendix, which could include the number of planes built, destroyed in combat, the number of enemy plane shot down, number of enlisted men at end of war, etc, etc.. 2)The photo session is so small, so ridiculous, that it should have been better to have no photos at all."},{"Title":"Winged Victory: The Army Air Forces in World War II","review":"One of the best books you will find on the Army Air Force prior to and during World War II. This is one of the few authors that doesn't impose his opinions on the reader. He goes out of his way to give both sides of an issue or a personality. Even such controversial figures as Britain's Bernard Montgomery or our own Douglas MacArthur are treated with an even-handedness that is all too rare. Very entertaining and very informative."},{"Title":"Winged Victory: The Army Air Forces in World War II","review":"I picked up this book because I was researching my grandfather, who was a B-17 pilot shot down over Switzerland. I looked this up in the book, and immediately found inaccurate information. The author claims that only 10 crews made it to Switzerland in March of 1944, yet when my grandfather was shot down on 18 March 15 other crews were interned by the Swiss on the same day, the highest number in the entire war. The author also claims that many of the bombers landed with little or no damage, insinuating that they were intentionally getting out of the war. This is also false- the AAF conducted an extensive investigation during the war, and found that almost every bomber that landed in Switzerland had extensive damage. I'm not sure where the information in the book came from, but it is incorrect. Any crewman interned in Swizerland could have set the record straight in that regard, and there are plenty of them around who belong to the Swiss Internees Association."},{"Title":"Winged Victory: The Army Air Forces in World War II","review":"This is a smoothly written tome, however, after Perret's earlier--and better--efforts it is a genuine disappointment. The general complaints about this work have been ably delt with elsewhere so here is a partial listing of Perret's errors of fact (See the works of Gordon Swanborough, William Green, and Francis K. Mason for supporting documentation).>pg.27-28: The first Boeing Model 299's were designated as operational test aircraft, thus the alpha numeric 'Y1B-17' not YB-17. The aircraft's nickname \\"Flying Fortress\\" was coined not by Boeing but by a local Seattle newspaper.>pg.48: The RAF was not \\"...clamoring...for the B-17...having done almost nothing about four engined bombers..\\" By the time the RAF received its 20 B-17C's Bomber Command was already operating several squadrons each of Short Sterlings and Handley-Page Halifaxes with the first Lancasters less than a year away. All were long range four-engined heavy bombers of UK design and manufacture.>pg.40: \\"The Spitfire was inferior to the Me-109.\\" Perret loves this wartime misidentification of Messerschmitt's -109 and -110 and keeps repeating it. The proper designation is and was Bf-109 and Bf-110. As for the 'inferiority' of the Spitfire about which Perret is so sure it is contradicted directly by General Adolf Galland the Lutwaffe's fighter commander who favored the RAF's mount.>pg.67: The first US-manned squadron, \\"Eagle Squadron\\", in the RAF was not designated the 71st Fighter Squadron. It was simply, 71 Squadron.>pg.69: Iceland was not occupied by the US 5th Division. It was occupied by USMC units that included the 5th Marine Regiment.>pg.92-93: The B-25D was not a development of the B-25C. The letter designation here denotes their location of manufacture; California=C, Texas=D.>pg.119: Mustang Mk.I's were not operated by the RAF's Desert Air Force in the summer of 1942. A small number were operated in early 1943 by 14 Squadron of the DAF. Mustang's were never armed with eight 0.303-in machine guns. The Mark I, an RAF/RCAF-only version, carried four o.303's and four 0.5-in machine guns. All other versions dispensed completely with the 0.303 guns.>pg.186: \\"No Allied fighter of 1942 could match [FW-190].\\" The Spitfire F. Mk. IXc was more than a match for the -190 and entered service with the RAF in July 1942. It was developed precisely to combat the FW-190 and it more than succeeded.>pg.196: No 75-mm cannon-armed B-25G's or -H's saw operatinal service in the MTO. They operated with limited success in the CBI and the Pacific.>pg.250: \\"...B-24 had no belly turret.\\" The version referred to here, the D, carried the same Sperry ball turret as the did some B-17E's and all B-17F's thru G's.>pg.260: \\"...faired 108 gallon belly tank as the Hurricane.\\" The arrangement of the RAF Hurricane's undercarriage and radiator precluded the use of ventral tanks. The tanks Perret refers to were not faired but rather torpedo-shaped. They were mounted ventrally on Spitfires and under the wings of Hurricanes. Later it was to be used by RAF/RCAF Tempests F. MkV and VI, the Thunderbolt F Mk. I and II as well as the Mustang F Mk. III and IV (P-51B,C,D and K) of the USAAF, the RAAF and the afored mentioned services.>pg.270: The AAF did not force North America to redesign the P-51 Mustang around wing tanks. The very first operation RAF/RCAF Mutang Mk. I's had wing tanks and with them exceptionally long range.I think I have proven my point.Beware of Perret's us of both Barrett Tillman and Bill Sweetman in his footnotes. Both are prolific aviation authors but both prefer a good tale over hard technical facts."},{"Title":"Winged Victory: The Army Air Forces in World War II","review":"Four stars or three stars?? The book is a readable narative that the author doeasn't claim to be definitive. To use military lingo it's written in the \\"tactical\\" rather than the \\"strategic\\". Not subject matter but writing approach. I would have preferred more policy and less execution. The high level decision making process and those who made them are too quickly skimmed over for my taste. The book tends to bog down in statistics too often. But to cover the entire WW11 air war from the army's standpoint in one book is a daunting task! The book ends up more of a \\"battle\\" book and lacks the depth that an exhaustive study would produce. Let's say three and a half stars."},{"Title":"Winged Victory: The Army Air Forces in World War II","review":"Mr. Perret's work is good for a single volume history of the AAC in WW2. However, it is too wrapped up in personalities, particularly that of Gen. Hap Arnold, and overly consumed with the Mediterranean Theatre. If this were a cradle to grave history of the Air Corps, or a biography of General Arnold, the time spent at the beginning dealing with the early careers and personalities of the Air Corps might be relevant. However, this is a history of the AAC in WW2 and the space spent on the early years of the the Army's flying organization, and the misadventures of its later commanding generals would have been better spent telling the tale during WW2. Too much focus rests on the Mediterranean Theatre. So little space was devoted to the operations of the Eighth and other Air Forces based in England that Mr. Perret added nothing to my knowledge of the subject from Col. Boyne's &quot;Clash of Wings.&quot; And as for the Pacific, either the AAC accomplished little (as some in the Navy would insist) or it was seriously neglected. Details of the tempo and nature of operations are lacking except for the occassional recounted exploit. Too often we're treated to musings about Arnold's frustration with this or that item. Still, Perret lays a good ground-work to start from, but I won't be stopping with him. Despite some nice descriptions of the aircraft employed, some informative work on Chennault and the AVG, and an amusing confirmation of the Air Force's cradle-bred and ongoing obsession with appearances, this is not a definitive work on the subject."},{"Title":"Winged Victory: The Army Air Forces in World War II","review":"This guy does not check his facts with primary sources and has many axes to grind.

She has the courage to tell the truth even though a book telling working mothers what they want to hear - which is that they are doing the best thing for their children - would probably have a better shot at being a best seller. It is evident that her love for children, and her concern for how the care they receive will affect society, is her motivation in writing, not any political or traditionalist axe to grind.As Ms. Venker points out in Myth #5 (I'm a Better Mom for Working), however unpopular the idea may be, children's needs do not change based on their parents' economic status. As an educator and a former director of a non-profit day care center I can personally vouch for what Ms. Venker says about it being a myth that a small amount of quality time is a substitute for spending most of the day with a child. Children do just need quality time, and they need large quantities of it. They will starve on one bite a day of emotional filet mignon.I also had ample opportunity working in day care to see children's perspective on what was important in their lives. I vividly remember a mother trying to soothe her children who were upset at being left in the morning by saying, \\"Mommy is working so we can afford a trip to the snow on the weekend. You like trips to the snow, don't you?\\" With tears in his eyes the older boy, age 4, said solomnly, \\"No, we'd rather have you, Mom.\\"In teaching elementary school age children, my current work, it is obvious to me which children have been raised in situations where their needs were met, and which were not. Aggression and lack of empathy are just two of the problems. This does not translate into full-time stay-at-home vs. full-time working outside the home. There is much ground in between. Ms. Venker lays out the issue of keeping a foot in the workforce very clearly, saying, \\"while they have young children women will have to be creative in fitting other work around their primary obligation to their children.\\" As a writer and a mother she doesn't just talk the talk, she walks the walk. This book is not by some childless woman writing about theoretical ideas, this is someone who knows what every mother goes through in the ups and downs of raising children.Finally, as the middle-aged mother of two college students, I would urge mothers-to-be and mothers of young children to read Ms. Venker's book and then remember the cliche that's so true - they DO grow up fast. By the later grades of elementary school they won't always want to spend their free time with you. You'll have years and years to work. Much as I love my work, I've never regretted working very, very part-time while the girls were little. I sincerely hope you read and think seriously about 7 Myths of Working Mothers, and that you will be able to look back at the choices you made in your child's early years with no regrets."},{"Title":"7 Myths of Working Mothers: Why Children and (Most) Careers Just Don't Mix","review":"The thesis of this book is simple: women can have it all, but not necessarily at the same time. That is, a woman can choose to excel at motherhood, or she can choose to excel at a career, but she cannot do both simultaneously.As such, this book attempts to burst the bubble of the super-mom myth, the idea that one can juggle both tasks, and succeed at both. Indeed, according to Venker, a working mother comes close to being a contradiction in terms.Of course a mom can work part time, and some moms, especially single moms, may have no choice about full-time employment, but for the average woman, to think that one can excel in a fantastic career path, and produce great, well-developed kids at the same time is simply wishful thinking.The first myth, \\"Men can have it all, so why can't we\\" is just that: a myth. Most men who work full time do not spend an equal amount of time with their children. In any set of relationships there are always trade-offs. Men in full time jobs trade off the privilege of having the lengthy, intimate moments with their children that a stay-at-home mother has. And it is the same if it is the mother who is working full time.Indeed, the term \\"working mother\\" in this regard is misleading. If a mother chooses a full-time paid career, she is basically leaving the job of mothering to someone else. She is paying someone else to mother her children.Another myth is that the roles of dads and moms are fully interchangeable. They are not, because men and women are not the same. There are inherent, biological differences. As Venker demonstrates, \\"fathers will never be parents in the same way mothers are\\". Thus the androgyny ideal is a furphy.To speak about completely equal roles in marriage therefore is nonsense. There is never complete equality in marriage. Instead there is give and take. There are concessions and there is bargaining. Any good partnership requires a division of labor, and women seem hard-wired by nature to have more of a nurturing, caring and, well, maternal, disposition. It is not just breast-feeding that is the mother's distinctive.Another myth is that day care is good for children. Quite the opposite is the case. The longer a child is in day care, and from an earlier age, the worse it is for the child. As one child expert has put it, \\"A home must be very bad before it can be bettered by a good institution\\". Yet we have abandoned our children in droves to strangers. Feminists have convinced many women that they can only be fulfilled and liberated if in the paid workplace. Totally absent from the debate is the needs of the child.Then there is the myth that we can give our children quality time in place of quantity time. This is just plain false. Children need our undivided attention, and they need lots of it. They do not need a committee drifting in and out of their lives. They need a mother and a father, and especially a mother during the early years of life. \\"What children need - what children have always needed - is time and attention, and the undivided loyalty of one adult, preferably their mothers\\". Says Venker, \\"Anything less just isn't good enough.\\"Motherhood is the most noble and most important of occupations. We have allowed feminist ideology to rob us of this truth. We have allowed a market-driven economy to convince us that we are by nature working, not relational, beings. We have allowed the lure of materialism and consumerism to cause us to put wealth ahead of family.This may all smack of chauvinistic doubletalk. But recall that our author is a woman. And as she rightly concludes, \\"the traditional family structure is not something that holds women down. The traditional family structure simply keeps women from having to worry about producing an income while they work on the most important job of their lives.\\""},{"Title":"7 Myths of Working Mothers: Why Children and (Most) Careers Just Don't Mix","review":"What makes this book such an excellent read is the thoughtful and systematic way in which the author acknowledges and then refutes the most common justifications for moms not staying home to raise their own children. With the logical precision of a good trial lawyer, Venker takes on these prevalent myths, one by one, and shows convincingly the fallacy behind each one of them. In particular, I thought her use of various empirical studies to support her points was effective. I also liked her insightful treatment of the flawed economics of the case for moms going to work, since money is such a common justification for the decision to go back to work and leave the kids at day care. Finally, I give the author points for having the courage to say something that will not be politically popular and that will leave a lot of parents feeling uncomfortable about the choices that they have made. Yet, if it causes even just a few moms to re-think their choice about going back to work, it will be a book that was not written in vain."},{"Title":"7 Myths of Working Mothers: Why Children and (Most) Careers Just Don't Mix","review":"I am a child of day care. At first my mother just put me in day care at age 2 1/2 for about 9-10 hours a week. That was wonderful, she picked out a wonderful facility with a big yard, and not too many kids. I remember running around like a maniac and being in child heaven. Then my father made my mother start working when I was 3 years old and my brother was 1 years old and we had to go into day care full time. My father then left us for another woman and there was no other option.Do I feel like full time child care hurt us? Well, we survived. But as a small child I HATED IT. The days were very long. There was a lot to do at the \\"day school\\"...but there was a lot of anxiety too. At 3 years old there always is a fear that your parents won't come back.So I agree with the authors premise. But I really wanted more meat. A sample of 2 (my brother and I) from a family in crisis does not constitute a good study. (For the record, I'm very successful, my brother is languishing). I wanted to know how young is too young, and how much is too much.Another weak point of this book is that the author repeats a few times how its so terrible that women have so many choices today. Sometimes she gets very nostalgic for the days when women had only a few career options because then they had less to loose. And sometimes it seems like she's saying it would be so much better if we didn't get out into the workforce before having kids because we're seduced by the materialism and the glamour of it.Well...as a professional woman in her early 30's who is hopefully going to have a child in the next year or so I'm so glad I've had the last 10 years to build a nest egg, to find a man I want to spend my life with, and to advance to the point where I'm making $55/hour. (If you're going to work part-time, its nice to have a well paying part-time gigg)I think by going from having it all to motherhood and making very little if anything (depending on if I work part time or not at all) my life will be a lot richer than if I'd just stay the professional course. If I give it all up I can then be more devoted to my children...thats really having it all, and I feel very lucky."},{"Title":"7 Myths of Working Mothers: Why Children and (Most) Careers Just Don't Mix","review":"An excellent and informative book! The author packs a lot of valuable information into a relatively short 170 pages and writes in a very readable style that makes the book hard to put down (both essential qualities for a busy stay at home mom of toddlers!). Ms. Venker is not against working mothers across the board, but her premise is that a mother's work should take second place to her role as mother and be fit in around her children's schedule (for example, working while the children are home with Daddy).This book is a breath of fresh air to me! I was an excellent student in college whose professors fully expected and encouraged me to plunge ahead in the academic and professional world. However, I knew that once I had children, they would become my first priority. Since that decision, I have felt the pressure and disdain of the media and of fellow mothers who believe that being a stay-at-home mom is a demeaning and foolish role.

I agree whole-heartedly with many points in the book, including Mrs. Venker's observation that the media contends that working mothers have two jobs, raising a family and working outside the home when in fact their children are being raised for them the majority of their week.

There are thousands of happy children of working moms (myself included) who would disagree with the author that working moms somehow can't be good mothers.Furthermore, this is classic Michelle Bachmann hypocrisy.

This book has little to do with real life, but it does 2 things for the author (1) it enables her to sell books to keep her fabulous starbucks lifestyle, and (2) it justifies her own existence, for this is nothing if not an obvious attempt to reconcile her conflicting feelings about her lifestyle and the working life she still feels something for. Amid this neurosis is a flurry of the most uncharitable, illconsidered opinion, sometimes supported by the likes of newspaper articles, and sometimes having no support at all. It really seems that by writing this the author wants to work, but wouldn't have have time to sit at the park and sip pumpkin spiced latte with the girls, but if all women were doing it she wouldn't feel so bad. What better excuse than that it makes her a more valiant, fabulous, virtuous mother than all the working moms out there. Talk about a set-up! If it's not the breastfeeding nazis, or the natural birth KGB, its this stuff. This is just another stop on the guilt train--as usual tickets sold to women ONLY.

There are many types of people and situations --there can't be one right way --and not everyone has choices. Stay at home mothers may want a voice --but believe me, most working mothers want a voice --many act as though we work for our own benefit --yes, we may benefit in some ways --but many went to work specifically to benefit our families --things such as medical benefits, a decent neighborhood, etc. In the end, some may have been fortunate enough to offer other advantages such as educational opportunities or memorable family vacations after providing the basics --- Or perhaps, the opportunity for them to know their father who is able to work near regular hours since there is another income. For some, having the father work extensive hours and have minimal time with the kids so that the mother is home works well to meet their goals. For other families, it does not. For mine, we originally had no choice --a bit over 16 years ago, I went to work leaving our one year old thinking I was doing a horrible thing. I did it because there was no other way --my husband was a Architectural Draftsman making $15k per year (no med benefits). Because we believed me being home was the right thing, we did everything we could to be able to have me at home. He bartended on the weekend and took his office's after work janitor job when the janitor quit --I did accounting work at home and tried coordinating waitressing eves. In the end, I had to go to work full time, we could not make it and we needed benefits. The world was very unsupportive of me and made me feel like a bad mother for doing this --I did not want to leave my daughter, I did not want to go to work, my husband listened to me cry at lunch each day --I did it for my family. --That one year old is now 17. I also have a 12 year old. I ended up continuing to work as by the time I may have had somewhat of a limited \\"choice\\", my kids were in school and my views had changed. My working has brought benefits to my kids, my home and my marraige. I have a very happy marriage of 20 years. My husband is an active parent. Have I missed previous moments because I worked? Yes --and that does make me sad --but I also know I have had other moments that are valuable--and my kids have had significant moments because I work --with me and others. No matter what, I am a happy person which I feel might be the most important ingredient to a good mother. But that is me --what works for me and my family certainly may not be the best answer for all because we are all different. I was fortunate to find a way of life that has worked for us. -- My kids? Very happy, well adjusted kids who I am very proud of. A couple days ago my daughter, senior in high school was discussing this issue and said I will definitely work --I was surprised and asked her why --she said that when she sees all her friends with stay at home mothers, the mothers seem very unhappy and do less for their kids than I do --(referring to college visit/app process, driving places, spending one on one time, working together, etc.) My response was that you have to wait and see --you don't know what choices you may have --and being able to stay at home, if only for awhile can be a very wonderful opportunity --and -certainly -not all stay at home mothers are unhappy.There is no right answer and it is a very small and close minded person who can't understand that. As women, as mothers, I hope some day we can support each other rather than knock each other down to make ourselves feel superior."},{"Title":"7 Myths of Working Mothers: Why Children and (Most) Careers Just Don't Mix","review":"I am a mother who works part time out of necessity. I agree with many of Venker's points: children do much better when raised by their own parents, day care IS institutional and definitely second best compared to a mother's care, and women should think of child care issues before they decide to get pregnant.I stay home with my daughter as much as possible but I have to work at least part time in order to not scrape by. What irritated me most is her assumption that all working mothers work so they can continue to \\"lavish\\" themselves with material goodies. I suppose health insurance, medicine, and fresh food are luxuries in her opinion. In my area and in many areas a decent home, not a luxurious palace, costs upwards of $100,000. Basic health insurance for a family of three is a $300 per month. Fresh vegetables and yogurt for baby are expensive. Gasoline is approaching $2.00 per gallon. Does this woman have any clue what it costs to raise a family today? I think she actually thinks she's living in the \\"Pioneer House\\" days!Venker asserts that all working mothers are either a)selfish women who do not want to lose their identity or b) foolish women who did not begin planning for their future child care needs the day after they graduated from college. She makes no exceptions and is harsh and judgemental. She accurately surmises that that many Americans overuse their credit cards and live above their means but that does not mean that every woman who works is trying escape her parental responsibilities! There are many of us out there who are not indigents but who must work in order to provide for some of life's niceties. Things that are fun and enriching for children, such as trips to children's museums, zoos, the ice cream shop, and the YMCA pool are not free!She also gets testy when working mothers enviously claim that stay-at-home types are \\"rich.\\" Well, I beg to differ but I have worked as a personal trainer to many stay-at-home moms and by any standard they ARE rich. Many of these \\"martyrs\\" have a dirty secret: they pawn their kids off any chance they get. Venker's sunny vision of them doting on their kids from the moment they wake up till they sleep is false. If they didn't dump the kids somewhere how else could they squeeze in time for pedicures, facials, tennis sessions, Pilates sessions, lunch, and shopping?And no, these pampered stay-at-home moms did not carefully save their dimes and nickels throughout college and in early adulthood so they could stay home. They got access to money and time the old fashioned way: they married it.If you are a working mother, don't waste your money by letting this repetitive windbag of a writer insult you.

The author has decided to cut through the culture's politically correct rhetoric and simply tell it like it is: children want their moms around. Her basic premise, while covering myriad other issues in the debate that rages on versus moms who stay at home and moms who choose to work, is this: motherhood has become all about the mother's needs and not the children's needs. This can only be a decidedly unpopular argument in a culture that celebrates putting the almighty Self ahead of everything else.Venker nails so many juicy truths, unflinchingly, that she's got my admiration. She clearly doesn't give a hoot about being \\"popular\\" because she's presenting clear hard facts about shunning one's children in the name of seeking chosen \\"fulfillment\\" outside the home while children are left to pay the price of feeling shuttled and ignored. The negative fall out is many-layered. But the best message the author presents is actually a question: Why do women who have no desire to do the work of motherhood (and she rightly calls it work, noting that it is sometimes tedious, thankless, sacrificial and requires vast amounts of time) even have children to begin with? These women are enamored of the IDEA of having kids, not the steadfast reality. Yes! This is true! FINALLY, someone has asked why this sort of uncommitted woman even HAS kids.I \\"stayed home\\" (that is, made the commitment to be a full time mother, and whole-heartedly, I might add) in the 1980's. My husband and I lived in a 2-bedroom condominium and scrimped mightily so that I could be home; we had a second child while in the same condo (because we couldn't afford to move) and, 9 years after the second child, we were joyfully surprised with a third. We didn't always relish living in a condo while other families with two incomes (or even just other families) moved \\"onward and upward\\", and I never appreciated the pervasive opinion from society at large that we could do \\"better\\" for our family by bringing in more money if I would only go to work. Ha! What I appreciated, and still do, and will forever, is that I was raising my own children.More important are the memories my kids have voiced now that they're teenagers. They recall the comfort and ease of being reared in an unhurried environment, with me there, and they always remember other kids coming over to our place who had nobody home at their own. I remember that, too. Looking back, I am grateful to have had other kids in our apartment while their moms were gone, to feed them home-cooked meals, hug them when they felt sad, assure them that their moms really did love them. And while I may have been a brief comfort in their lives, I wasn't their mom.So that's the reality for mothers who choose to work: your kids will miss you. Dearly. You will feel a nebulous guilt. And when you blink and they're 18 going out the door, looking back at you saying, \\"Really, Mom, it's fine. It was all fine,\\" know that you might feel a little better about your glaring absence, but you can never get those years back.Anything worthwhile takes time and sacrifice -- human lives being at the top of the list. Are you ready to commit? At the very least, read this book and THEN decide."},{"Title":"7 Myths of Working Mothers: Why Children and (Most) Careers Just Don't Mix","review":"My mother was a stay at home mom when I was growing up, and I remember thinking at an early age that being a stay at home mom was the last thing I wanted to do.

Venker is able to give a response to every single excuse a full time working mother has made for choosing to go back to work- even the sacred \\"You're so lucky you can say at home, we could never afford it\\" excuse.Here are some great quotes from her book:\\"But to suggest that women should remain in the workforce their entire lives to prove something to themselves and the world at their children's expense is simply wrong.\\"\\"[the working mother] She's amazing we say! Just how does she do it? And the answer, of course, is that she doesn't. She pays someone else to do the work of motherhood for her so that she can pursue a career.

Subtracting work related costs, you'll find that the average two-income family nets perhaps ever thousand dollars a year.\\"\\"Couples get used to making a rather hefty income together and having whatever they want, whenever they want.

It was very important to me to have one of us there to raise our own children (not daycare) so we waited until we had purchased our first house and we found that my husband's job was sufficient to cover our needs. This meant that we got a little later start than most and we had a few less toys than some, but it was worth it to both of us! 30 years later, I lost my husband and had to make some hard decisions again, as I still have two young children at home. After allot of research and creative thinking, I opted to turn a hobby of mine into a job that I could do from home. It isn't easy, I don't draw a huge income, but it makes ends meet and I can give the same TLC and attention that I gave to my older children to my younger two.I agree strongly with the author, if you have children, then you need to fit the career to the children, not the other way around. Children deserve our best, not our leftovers at the end of the day, after all, they are not an accessory and they need and want our focus. I enjoy my children and my career, though after losing my husband, I was told that the only option that I had was working full time. I am sorry, but those nay sayers don't give women enough credit!

Some women have had to work in every generation to support their families and some women hire other people to raise their children so they can play golf and have their hair done. FINE! Perhaps if women stopped being so critical of choices made by others, we could find more constructive ways to help children to grow up in loving and attentive environments.On a personal note, I left my career to raise my two daughters and have never regretted a moment. They are wonderful, funny, competent women and they are looking forward to being parents.

People who are 19-29 really need to read a book of this nature to prepare for the life that is ahead of them. I am so blessed that i had parents that stressed that \\"life will change drastically once you have kids\\", \\"be sure to have safe sex and put education first, and get your education before you start having kids\\" and \\"life involves alot of sacrifices and tough choices\\". I was raised with a strong sense of family and raising children and making sacrifices for them. Having had parents like this, made reading S.Venker's book like a deeper conversation with them.I am also very concerned with how children are being raised in this day in age, especially women. Women are being raised with a \\"Corporate\\" mentality and raised to hold onto their careers for dear life as it will be the only way to protect themselves from THE SUM OF ALL FEARS(nasty divorces, abusive relationships, etc). Raising daughters this way will prevent them from shaping their priorities around starting a family and makes it harder for them to embrace unexpected motherhood. Any husband in this day in age, has a fight of his life coming for him if he marries a woman like this. Telling women that going into the workforce will complete them and give them a since of purpose is a ridiculous as it gets. Men work to support their families, but you'd be hard pressed to find men that claim that their joy in life is working 10-12 hrs a day and being away from their family, missing all the developments that take place.Society paints full time mothers in the same light as a person with a 7th grade education, and thats not right. Regardless of what role you play in the family, both spouses are the reason for the success of the family and the career(s) as they both make it possible for everything to get accomplished. In society today, full time mothers are looked upon as people who have no profitable talent, and im sure that alot of husbands harass full time mothers, using their financial responsibilities as leverage.Where this mentality hurts women is that it creates a divide b/w men and women and really stifles the support for raising children and family roles. No longer will the children have a parent at home to raise them, someone else will. In the end, children will suffer the most, the party that doesnt have a means to voice their opinion. Our society no longer values the sacrifices that raising a family demands.I think the root of the problem is extreme feminist propaganda and husbands that have taken their full time parent spouses for granted. Due to both factors, society has undervalued (a complete understatement) the importance of part-time/full time motherhood, and women today are forcing themselves to reject the characteristics within their biological nature."},{"Title":"7 Myths of Working Mothers: Why Children and (Most) Careers Just Don't Mix","review":"I found this book extremely well written and helpful in my decision to take some time off from practicing law to raise my young son full-time.

Note that in THIS economy this works best with friends who are in the various medical fields (physicians, nurses, OT/PTs, speech theraphists)...these people often have openings for PART TIME professionals.In any case, I believe in dealing with \\"what is\\" rather than just what \\"should be\\"...and the truth is that not all women work for vacations. Many work for survival.True story:I shudder to think what would have become of my family over the generations if my great grandmother had not gone to work when my great-grandparents came to the city.My great-grandfather and his famiy had been \\"burned off\\" their land in a famous East Texas situation. They came to Dallas where he worked as a butler and my great-grandmother as a maid and cook.

The preface by Rupert Pole (her Los Angeles widower, as opposed to the late Hugh Guiler, her New York widower) notes, \\"Toward the end of her life Anais and I discussed the original diaries, and she asked me to publish all her diaries just as she wrote them.\\"Having now read four volumes of the unexpurgated diary, it is my educated opinion that this was _not_ a good idea. It is unfortunate that Pole has dutifully released this volume of material in this form. It's like he published the first draft of a book--there is so much dross among the gold that I often felt that I was not so much reading as doing penance. It is apparent now that not all the material cut from the expurgated volumes was eliminated because of its scandalousness. If we have learned anything after the sexual revolution, surely it is that even the salacious can be dull.And yet. And yet. Amidst Nin's whiny posturing, her mechanical proclamations of audacity and innocence, nestle passages of such power and beauty (especially starting in 1938) that this volume intermittently becomes riveting. There are also a number of entries where Nin drops her self-glorifying posturing and looks at her own behavior with clear and unflinching eyes. For the first time, for example, I began to understand what she saw in Gonzalo, something that was a mystery to me even from the previous unexpurgated volumes. She becomes enormously likeable when she appears to be displaying some candor.I regard it as truly unfortunate that this book is unlikely to have many readers owing to its lack of editorial discipline. Be patient with it, but be prepared to skim, and don't read it as an introduction to Nin's work."},{"Title":"Nearer the Moon: From a Journal of Love : The Unexpurgated Diary of Anais Nin, 1937-1939 (Vol 4)","review":"Some of the readers who have reviewed this book have criticized it as not being up to the level of its predecessors. I think they mean it's not as steamy. Face it, the woman was getting a bit older, calmer, and more mature. She was losing the feverish intensity of her youth. But the beauty of the Anais Diaries, other than the view they give of this brilliant, underappreciated author is that they offer an in-depth look at an entire life, starting when she was a by turns dreamy and extremely practical 11-year old girl, longing for her father and being a good girl, through her twenties and thirties when she had the courage to try everything and the sense to lie about it brilliantly.I wish the editors had gone on and done the \\"personal\\" versions of her later diaries, as I'm just prurient enough that I'd like to have known what her love life was like in middle and early old age. But the later diaries show a woman who had achieved her ambitions and peace with herself.I'll be honest here. I love Anais Nin. I'll be more honest; I am IN love with Anais Nin. Reading all of these diaries is my greatest literary adventure since discovering Carlos Castaneda in 1975. An in depth reading of the diaries is one of the most profound learning experiences a reader can find. If you want to go on with it you can read Henry Miller, and Proust and all the books that influenced her. You could make a life out of it.I think though it would be better to live one. That is her lesson; live your own life, not the canned life the society wants to sell you."},{"Title":"Nearer the Moon: From a Journal of Love : The Unexpurgated Diary of Anais Nin, 1937-1939 (Vol 4)","review":"This is the last, so far published, of the Anas Nin's Unexpurgated diaries, edited by her second (bigamous) husband Rupert Pole, after her death and that of nearly everyone else discussed. The intensity of her love life continues. Her style continues to evolve to more emotion, sensation and thought brought up from the subconscious, and less external facts. This was partly due to the influence of psychoanalysis and Surrealism.She, ahead of most women, was involved in the change of role from helping men to working independently. This was aggravated by her fear of abandonment, left from the early loss of her father. She was in conflict between her own ambition and the fear of losing her men if she competed successfully with them. She was starting to succeed with her own fiction at this time, but her greatest literary success was still her contribution, in every possible way, to Henry Miller's work. This book itself is among her best works and probably of more lasting value than Henry's work, but not in a form that could be published during her life time.Her conflicts and neuroses contribute to the unique value of these books. The emotional scars left by her father contribute to the complexity of her love life and to her difficult but intense and semi-promiscuous sex life. Her partially liberated role and her dependence on the diary for emotional support made it difficult for her to convert from diary writing to fiction, resulting in writing more real and candid than possible when writing for publication. She was in contact with other leading artists of her time, sometimes physically as well as intellectually, and was completely devoted to her relationships and her writing, but most of her writing was so personal that she showed only small sections of it even to her lovers.Her first works to become popular were her erotic stories, written a few years later. These are unusual and perhaps unique as the first serious erotic literature in English and as the first erotica written by a woman. They therefore revealed aspects of sexuality and particularly of female sexuality that were not previously available in writing. Most of that material, as well as her other fiction, was taken directly from these diaries, where it appears more realistically (or surrealistically), in more detail and in its real context.More can be found at: [...]"},{"Title":"Nearer the Moon: From a Journal of Love : The Unexpurgated Diary of Anais Nin, 1937-1939 (Vol 4)","review":"nearer the moon is a book whic has affected my life in so many good ways. I have become a better lyricist, and a more insightful poet because of her ability to be so bold, honest, and real while being one of the greatist poets and writers of our time. Anais Nin's writting not only stands asa representation of how beautiful life is, but also stands as a bench mark in history.

A great change, and one worth reading!"},{"Title":"Prey","review":"&quot;Prey&quot; may well be a disappointment to Lovecraft fans. The tale treats with a certain beast from Lovecraft's story &quot;The Dreams In The Witch-House&quot;, and has altered the character somewhat. While this treatment works well within the context of the story, it would be better if one was not familiar with the character beforehand. However, Masterton is an especially skillful teller of Weird fiction, and the story rockets along. The story of a recently-divorced man who has custody of his young son, and retreats to a remote house on the Isle of Wight, working through his thoughts there while attempting to renovate a strange old place, is well-told and not without its effective moments. The other characters are well-drawn, and the interplay between characters is believable. There are elements that are left unexplained, though, as if the original story was heavily edited for publication. An interesting sidelight to this story and HPLs story is that a creature somewhat like this was supposedly found on the Isle of Man in the early thirties, and it is possible that Lovecraft had heard of it before he wrote his tale, and that Masterton has also, hence the setting. This is an above-average story of the supernatural, with some elements of the classic ghost story added to pieces from the Cthulhu Mythos...well-worth reading."},{"Title":"Prey","review":"This is the best book written by Graham Masterton.

It was hard to get into, but once I drew a mental, it was downhill from there. I inhaled the rest in one afternoon and refused to part with it until I had finished. He does not write like Stephen King or some of the other &quot;classic&quot; horror authors. His descriptions are not clear enough to give you an instant mental picture of his subjects. Translation? You have to think a little more, but the climax gets you. I found one mistake in my book though, don't know if he wrote it, the editors missed it or if someone's record skipped, but there was an obvious error. Great book overall. I love stories like that - way out there. He might have given the priest a little more spunk though and not inferred that God was powerless."},{"Title":"Prey","review":"this wasn't very inventive. i recognized so much from other places. and the dialogue was at times poor. the evil characters was not that credible. but i still liked it. the details were carried out nicely. the main characters all the time finding or doing something interesting. very little of the usual irrelevant stuff, like to much focus on career and home life. and most of all: this was very suspenceful and very enjoyable. it starts with and keeps on being interesting. thsi book was packed with interesting amusing stuff. M knows he's not inventive, so he's not messing up trying to add \\"interesting\\" details destroying the story. he delivers suspence in big packages. so i forgive him his flaws. basically this is a story about a haunting that is really serious. something or someone is in the attic. something is going on in the village. as the main character investigates, he finds a lot of interesting stuff about the house (having a history) and the village (especially about a family of old, a mysterious character, and disappearences). i won't go any further into the plot, as it is very enjoyable read finding out."},{"Title":"Prey","review":"I would like to say that i am fairly new to Mastertons world but i recently read Prey and enjoyed it immensly.

All of the scary elements that I was hoping for were there, and the pace drew me in immediately. But as the book went on I became annoyed at first, and gradually frustrated with the character's complete lack of brains.As bad things start to go down, the characters seem to want to do everything except for the obvious - leave. There is nothing that really forces anyone in this story to stay where they are at, and as the death toll mounts and creepy goings on get more sinister, it never seems to cross any ones mind that the simplest solution would be to find a nicer neighborhood. It is like there is a Masterton IQ Reduction Chip (tm) lodged inside each character's head!And as silly as that sounds, had the author used a gimmick like this to explain the stupidity of his characters, I probably could have enjoyed the narrative enough to have given it 3.5-4 stars instead of 1."},{"Title":"Prey","review":"Something unseen is lurking in the attic of Fortyfoot House. David's dreams and delusions seemed so real to him and Danny in their new home which had been an orphanage in the 19th century. There is an adjoining cemetery with an assortment of 60-70 elaborate gravestones and a small, abandoned Gothic chapel across the stream from the back garden. In this garden near the back gate there stands a marvelous sundial near the rose arbor. The 'thing' in the attic is causing them nightmares.There was a recent (2003) novel by Michael Crichton with this same title. Thus, when I saw it on sale, I thought at first it was his until I remembered THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT. This horror story was released almost ten years earlier in Britian and is not about scary monsters of animals or cloned dinosaurs. It is scary, full of ghostly figures and apparitions. SHIVERS calls this book \\"one of the most disturbing novels I've read.\\" Not so, it's not disturbing -- it's just a restless soul seeking redemption. Apparently the old woman had osteoporsis, as she was all bent over.It is legend that if a person dies under mysterious circumstances or is killed by persons unknown, his spirit lingers behind until someone discovers the secret. Like the movie THE GRUDGE, these restless spirits neeeded redemption and the truth to come out concerning their deaths. It reminded me of the cable-t.v. movie of a house which lured people there but lived off the occupants. When one died, the plants were more vivid and healthy. Now, that was scary.Graham Masterton has mastered his art in the horror genre. If you like to feel shivery and get that heart beating fast, this is the book for you. I take back what I wrote in another review about his Polish connections. He is a gem who found his niche."},{"Title":"Prey","review":"Masterton borrows characters from Lovecraft's short story, \\"The Dreams In the Witch-House\\", for this unmistakably Mastertonian novel. What I mean is that if you are a Lovecraft fan (and I am not as familiar with Lovecraft as I am with Masterton), don't expect this novel to be in Lovecraft's style. This is a Masterton novel, which means it is full of gory violence and gratuitous sex.Sometimes with Masterton, you have to enjoy the ride because you may not like the destination. I am giving this novel three stars because the ride was lots of fun. Masterton loves to come up with new ways to disgust you with gore and guts, and then titillate you with some sex. Meanwhile, he gives you a clue here and there about why strange things are happening but doesn't give it all away.But sometimes his endings go a bit haywire, and I think that's what happened here. So if you are a Masterton fan, enjoy the ride. If you are a Lovecraft fan, you've been warned."},{"Title":"Prey","review":"...if it weren't for the protagonist being the most amzingly stupid character that has ever been created in a horror novel and if it weren't for the ridiculous way that the characters develop.WARNING - SPOILERS AHEADThe story was well paced in true MAsterton style.

People do not suddenly form relationships over a couple of hours with people they just met. David finds Liz trying to squat in the house, he taks her down to the cafe for a drink then out of the blue he's holding hands with her. This can be no more than an hour after meeting her. He then allows her to go off shopping with his 7 year old son. After a day or two they are talking like an old married couple, with Liz complaining that David can never make a decision and he needs to buck up his ideas if their relationship is to survive.This guy makes such stupid decisions. Even when he knows for sure that Liz has been possessed and become dangerous, he leaves his son unsupervised with her!!!!!!!!There is also the small matter of a number of Deus Ex Machina incidents. A young girl rescued from the past is seen to be very vulnerable as you would expect, then with no warning she reveals herself to be a white witch with magic powers that allow her to overpower the villains that so far have had no trouble at all handling her. If only she hadn't waited until young Danny had been kidnaped before revealing this secret power...The ending is another classic Deus Ex Machina.

Masterton pulls no punches when he writes and his stories are fast moving and creepy as hell. PREY is no exception.

The bizzare house and strange creature known as Brown Jenkins intrested me so i purchased it and read it. Of the novels I have read this is definatly one of the most graphic and creepy. What startled me most however was realizing the origin of this novel. I did not realize this until I watched an episode of the Masters of Horror and an adaptation of H.P. Lovecrafts \\"the Call of the Witche House\\". Once the character in that stroy started seeing the weird angles in the house and a rat with a human face I realized what the insperation of prey was. Prey in a story that is based a lot on Lovecraft, complete with the old ones and weird cults. The end is kind of a dues ex-machina, and Brown Jenkin isn't so much scary as he is annoying and disgusting, and the fact that he doesn't get killed in the end left em unsatisfied.

He hears scuffling and scratching in the walls and attic that could be a rat and in reality is more like a rat monstrosity. Locally the town has a history of children who disappear, never to be seen again. They are taken where the clock can't find them, taken by this rat/boy creature, Brown Jenkin. He starts to see spirits of people long dead, yet are not dead. He learns the history of the house, which is still happening yesterday, now and tomorrow. The house not only has a sinister past, but an equally sinister present and future. This time travel tale is unsettling, and engrossing. It's an uneasy read. I cannot stress to you enough just how good Masterton is, and if you can only pick up one or two books at a time, let this be on your list."},{"Title":"Prey","review":"I have been a fan of Graham Masterton's fiction for a number of years now, since I first came across his work when just a schoolboy. This is certainly a very entertaining horror read, and engages the reader on many levels.Masterton is a master of mood and setting, and here he perfectly captures the air of an English summer on the Isle of Wight, in the midst of which stands Fortyfoot House with all it's menace...The evil presence of a being known popularly to locals as Brown Jenkin, part giant rat, part human, scurries through the walls of the house, twittering and calling in the darkness. Strange lights and sounds come from the attic at night. Why did so many children die in the space of a few days at Fortyfoot House in November 1886? Why is the roof constructed in such a bizarre fashion, so that it's angles appear...impossible?Masterton has drawn heavily from the Cthulhu Mythos originated by classic writer H. P. Lovecraft for this story. At first I was dismayed that he did this, as I am thoroughly versed in the original canon. My fear was that he would take such liberties as to ruin my enjoyment of this book, despite being such a Masterton fan. However, with reflection I do not see it as a problem at all. Sure, he has taken huge liberties with Cthulhu Mythos lore, but why not? Too many people are too precious about it. Besides, the constant addition and taking of liberties only serve to enhance and contribute further to the cycle. While this novel is certainly fringe-Mythos, it is still a fantastic read. And you cannot ask for more than that.With plenty of gory detail to satisfy without overpowering you, Masterton has written another great horror tale. A classic horror page turner."},{"Title":"Prey","review":"David Williams is not having a good year. His wife leaves him and his son, Daniel, for another man, taking most of his money in the process. In his emotional distraction he loses his business. It is only by happenstance that he finds a position restoring Fortyfoot House, a century old deserted orphanage. No sooner does he settle in but he starts hearing spooky scratching and rustling in the attic. And he sees ghostly presences in the garden and bedroom.The only good news in David's life is the appearance of Elizabeth, an attractive college student, who moves in while on a summer job. She helps with the cooking and provides needed companionship. As David investigates the strange goings on about Fortyfoot House he discovers that the strange noises and lights are blamed by the villagers on a strange rat-like creature called Brown Jenkin. He is associated with the original owners of the house. In 1886 a terrible disease struck the orphanage and all the children died. In some fashion Brown Jenkin had something to do with the deaths.Soon the haunting turns into killing, as first a rat killer, and then a neighbor, are horribly slaughtered. David discovers that the house isn't quite where it appears to be. The horror builds until the lives of both Daniel and Liz are threatened and David is drawn into an insane ritual that promises the end of the world. David must face inhuman evil if he wishes to end the nightmare.Graham Masterton, less known that writers like King, Straub and Koontz, is still one of our best contemporary horror writers. &quot;Prey,&quot; written in 1992, is something of a tour-de-force. Masterton makes use of both legends and occult mythology to craft a tale that draws the reader in and keeps him or her reading to the very end. Masterton has the ability to build the horror of a scene so that is has real impact. His narrative flows naturally and his use of internal dialog contributes to the dark atmosphere. &quot;Prey&quot; is a classic of top-notch spookiness."},{"Title":"Prey","review":"I think this is one of the best page turners I have read in along time. I definately think it's better than &quot;Jack Built&quot;. It is very twisted and makes you think about time and space. Worth your money on all counts. If you like horror...this is a good one!"},{"Title":"Prey","review":"I have only read four of Graham Masterton's novels to date-\\"The Burning,\\" \\"The House That Jack Built,\\" \\"Spirit,\\" and \\"Prey\\"-and all four have left a lasting impression on me. I don't understand why this author does not receive more praise from horror readers. Why does an overrated writer like Richard Laymon sell thousands upon thousands of mass-market reprints, receiving laudatory accolades the likes of which haven't been seen since Roman generals celebrated triumphs and ovations in the streets of Rome, while Masterton remains in the shadows? Beats me. I'll take a Graham Masterton novel over the vast amount of hash that passes for horror any day. His novels literally burst with energy, extreme gore, and intriguing plots. For instance, this author took the old haunted house theme and reworked it in a new, intriguing way in \\"Spirit\\" and \\"The House That Jack Built.\\" With \\"Prey,\\" Masterton fleshes out H.P. Lovecraft's story \\"The Dreams in the Witch House\\" into a lengthy novel loaded with soul numbing horror. While I agree with many other reviewers who state that this book is not Masterton's best effort, I disagree when they say it's an unworthy read. Even an average effort from this storyteller is a cracking good yarn.\\"Prey\\" takes place on the Isle of Wight, a location known to me primarily as the site of one of the best live performances from Emerson, Lake, and Palmer. But forget about hearing \\"Pictures at an Exhibition\\" here. Masterton introduces us to Fortyfoot House, a monolithic structure with a past so horrifying that it's continuing presence instills great dread in the natives. David Williams, an interior decorator plodding through a shattered marriage and catastrophic financial difficulties, moves into the house with his son Danny to renovate the decaying abode in an effort to resuscitate his ill fortunes. Right from the start weird incidents occur. Father and son witness through the windows of a shattered chapel a ghostly man clad in black moving across the lawn. An old painting of an evil, red headed woman in the same chapel scares both of them. And then there are the scratching noises in the attic, noises that David first attributes to common rats until he hears the local myth about Brown Jenkin. According to the hysterical tales floating around the island, Brown Jenkin is a dangerous supernatural creature of frightening size and shape. Moreover, there is talk about local children disappearing whenever strange lights appear in Fortyfoot House. David Williams considers this talk nonsense and begins renovating with the help of a young woman named Liz who turned up to squat at the abandoned house.After the local exterminator dies in an extremely grotesque manner while searching for Brown Jenkin, Williams begins feeling real dread. Despite increasingly bizarre occurrences, however, he refuses to leave Fortyfoot House. After all, he needs the money the job will bring in. Still you would think the apparitions moving across the lawn and in the picture hanging on a wall in the house would cause the most stouthearted to head for the hills, especially when one's child is in danger. But Williams stays as things get weirder. More deaths occur, as do more malefic hallucinations. David learns about the history of Fortyfoot House from a local woman and the local vicar, learns about the family that lived there and ran the place as an orphanage, about a wicked woman named Kezia Mason and her alleged ties to witchcraft. And he learns more than he ever cared to know about Brown Jenkin and the purposes of the house when he opens a trapdoor in the attic only to stare into a nightmare beyond all known conceptions of time and space. \\"Prey\\" goes well beyond the bare bones story created by H.P. Lovecraft, turning \\"The Dreams in the Witch House\\" into nothing less than an apocalyptic tale where the eldritch horrors of the Cthulhu mythos put in a personal appearance.I ultimately liked \\"Prey,\\" especially Masterton's skillful creation of a detailed backstory explaining the origins of Fortyfoot House. I enjoyed the gory sequences as well (check out what happens to the vicar when he and David decide to step through that trapdoor). What I couldn't help but notice were the numerous plot holes threading their way through the story, plot holes so huge you could lob the planet Jupiter straight through them without touching the edges. What in the heck is this guy doing staying in the house after these nightmares start unfolding on a regular basis? And with a kid? No way, Jose. Masterton occasionally does an effective job of overcoming this problem, at least in the beginning, but after a time the continued presence of these people in Fortyfoot House just doesn't ring true. And while I thought the ending exciting and properly disturbing in the grand tradition of Lovecraft, I didn't buy for a second how Williams suddenly got another chance to avoid the disastrous effects of the house. Doesn't that sort of negate the events of the entire novel? And why not just grab Liz and run off instead of letting her go?Yes sir, there are more than a few problems with \\"Prey.\\" Are they enough to ruin the book? Hardly. The pace moves at lightening speed once Masterton establishes the plot elements, the creative history of the house is massively entertaining, and there is enough bloodshed to warm the black hearts of the gorehounds. I can't give the book five stars though, both for the issues listed above and the lack of the distinctive Lovecraft narrative voice. One of the things I love about good old H.P. is the ornate (some would say overblown) prose, which always seems to add an additional gravitas to the shrieking horrors. Masterton writes in plain old English, effective enough for a good story but not comparable to the master. An entertaining read."},{"Title":"Prey","review":"I know Masterton has some rabid fans out there that will blast me for this... but this book should have been much better than it turned out to be. First the short spoiler free synopsis:Man gets divorced, loses business, takes son and gets a job renovating a house that is for sale. According to local towns people the house is both haunted and the home of a rat type creature that has something to do with disappearing children. Random squatter girl shows up to squat in the haunted house, man and child invite her to say, scary things start to happen. End SynopsisMasterton has an excellent way of inducing panic in the reader, he is very good at making the house creepy, the sounds scary, and to make the hair on your arms prickle up. This is my first Masterton book, and I am very impressed with his handle on atmosphere. He also has a fairly good story here with the ability to draw on some of the Lovecraftian themes that he seems to be going after. Between the atmosphere and the plot this book should have been 4-5 stars no problem.But we do have a problem... for all of Masterton's talent in the areas of atmosphere and plot... he is severely lacking in the intelligent character department. First off, there is no way that anyone would have stayed (keep in mind there is a small child here) in that house after people started dropping dead. Second... this entire book takes place in less than a week, which, I'm sorry the relationships that develop and are apparently so important to the story, cannot have developed in that time frame. 17-18 year old girls don't immediately fall in love with mid 30 year old guys with no money, no real job, and a kid just so they can squat in a house. The choices the characters make border on ludicrous, almost as if they have all completely lost their minds. They are like lemmings chit chatting before leaping off the cliff...My second grip is that the ending was extremely rushed, Masterton had been so careful with the atmosphere and the mood that I was almost able to forgive the idiot characters, until we hit the homestretch in the book... from there it seems like he jammed about 150 pages worth of material into 50, and his strong points of atmosphere and plot lost out.Still, despite my complaints, this book does have merit. I do plan on reading another by him in the near future. He has a tremendous grasp on manipulating the reader through atmosphere... I hope that in his other books his characters will be stronger. I give this particular novel 3 stars but it should have by all rights been a much better book."},{"Title":"Prey","review":"This was my first Masterton book; I remember getting a copy of it in my language ( I'm Polish) from another fellow Polish student in 9th grade. That's all it took for me to be hooked on Graham forever, just this one book.That was ten years ago, now my bookshelf is crammed with Masterton, I pretty much bought everything he wrote, and let me tell you, there wasn't one book I haven't like, from what I read all ready. I treat his book like precious jewels, because he doesn't write that much, and hopefully he has new things coming out so I can immerse myself in him again.Prey was a fascinating read. This was beyond a haunted house story. I still remember vividly reading this into the wee hours of the night, sweaty, with matted hair over my head, not daring to turn the lights off and go to sleep.This story will suck you in, its scary, deep, well written, and its insanely entertaining!Briefly why I loved this book: We have two main characters, David and Danny who move in to the creepy Fortyfoot House on an Isle, far away from people and help, with scary noises in the attic, graveyard full of kids of suddenly all died and ghost nurse sightings, photos that change all the time, and a mystery that will knock your socks off in the end.

He has a style that brings the other world into reaching distance of this world. He creates works that lovers of the surreal side of horror enjoy. In many respects that is what his horror novels have in common, since none of them are consistently.As usual, Masterton creates a vivid first person narrative, and shows the person a picture of a dark and foreboding place in the other side of the world of \\"reality\\". I have never been disappointed by a Masterton Horror novel, and whilst I also wonder why he has not received more wider acclaim than he has, it is very evident that he has influenced the film world of horror either implicitly, or explicitly. I sometimes suspect maybe that he has done a script under a Nom De Plume, especially since Masterton's Books have appeared under the names of \\"other authors\\".PREY is a rather vivid example of Masterton's many books that I have seen all too many times. He can paint a brilliant picture of a lush, beautiful island, as well as the house in the book, and then push us \\" through the looking glass\\" to the other side, and in many ways, have the other side come slithering into our world. Very few writers create the kind of atmosphere that Masterton can, and yet, when he does , the \\"elite\\" horror fans continue to pan his work in the worst possible way.Overall, with Masterton's works, I would much prefer to buy hardback copies of Masterton's material, and on occasion I have, but they are mostly in the rather short lived \\"trade paperbacks\\" which have enough acid to cause them to give the book the PH level of a Kitty Litter tray."},{"Title":"Prey","review":"I only have a couple of words for this book.

And another thing the ending was absolutely horrible, i mean after going through this whole book and putting up with the [bad] dialogue and finally the suspense it barely manages to build you would think you would get a explosive and entertaining climax.

It is the tremendously crafted story of Sandy, a black child of the 1920s in rural Kansas. In poignant tightly written chapters, Hughes' depicts various events in Sandy's life often slipping into the perspective of those closest to him. Sandy lives most his life with his strong-willed and deeply religious grandmother Aunt Hager. She is a benevolent woman who desires peaceful racial relations despite the overwhelming amount of racism and discrimination professed by both white and black community members. Sandy's mother Annjee is a loving and hard working woman eternally devoted to her husband Jimboy who is a good hearted man constantly on the move. Sandy's aunt Tempy is a well-off woman trying to immerse herself in white society and denigrating her own race in the process. His other aunt Harriett is a wilful woman who turns from the church for a different kind of existence. Through these expertly drawn characters, Sandy views their examples and he must make the choices that will effect his future. The novel is a tremendous chronicle of the struggle of a family to survive financially. It gives accounts of the psychological dilemma created by growing in a racially divided society and the diffuse joy in life that can be found even in troubling circumstances.Maya Angelou wrote of Not Without Laughter: \\"This book was written when preachers had to be poets and poets were preachers, because they needed to be available to all the people all the time.\\" The messages this novel gives are not subtle. But, through its varied perspectives and eloquently written prose, it envelops the issues it preaches with emotionally edifying ideas. It leaves the reader with a feeling of deep connection to all the characters, particularly the beautiful Sandy in whom we invest our hope and trust to fulfil his potential to become a good, intelligent and strong man who does not feel limited by his racial heritage despite any restrictions society may attempt to place for him. Although it may be a shame that Hughes never wrote another novel as he aptly demonstrated his skill in this one, Not Without Laughter stands as shining work be a skilled artist."},{"Title":"Not Without Laughter","review":"Langston Hughes is a truly gifted writer. In this story he shows six different characters, all afflicted by racism and the numerous tactics each devises to combat its force. Their methods include,hating white america, enduring the blow, assimilating, laughing in the faces and then there is Sandy...He is slowing coming of age amidst all of these adults that he loves and admires, but soon he shall have to pick a path of his own. He knows that he must fight against the threat of racisim with out developing so much anger it consumes him as well. He knows must stand up for the race and culture he loves and some how advance his people with the power of his life.

He was one of the earliest innovators of the then-new literary art form jazz poetry. (quoted from wikipedia)This novel, published in 1930, covers the life of a colored boy in Kansas, during the early 20th century. It is mostly plain but beautiful prose, but sometimes it derails into blues texts and other songs. The poet can't deny his calling.Storms!Langston Hughes was born in Joplin, Missouri. I picked up this book from my Mount Readme for no better reason than Irene battering the east coast and super- taifun Nanmadol approaching East China. It seemed the right time to read a novel that starts with a twister which carries grandmother's front porch into orbit, written by a man from Joplin, of all places.A secondary motive: I just read O'Neill's lamentably flawed play \`All God's Chillun Got Wings' and felt like getting a more competent look at chillun from somebody with more insight.Poverty and racism are parts of this life, but it is not all misery. This life is not without laughter, ambitions and successes. Music and church are core elements of life. Music means the blues, it means dance music, and it means gospel. The family is divided in Christians and sinners, thinks grandmother. She had been born in slavery and now lives a precarious life as a washer of white people's dirty laundry. She is a magnanimous soul. (... I's been sorry fo' white folks, fo' I knows something inside must be aggravatin' de po' souls...).Sandy, the boy, grows up in his grandmother's house. The father is often absent, working or bumming elsewhere. Papa is a bit of a rolling stone, full of blues and good with his guitar (wherever he laid his hat was his home). Sandy's young and beloved aunt is part of the sinner faction. She runs away with a carnival, hoping for a career as a singer. Sandy's mother then leaves too, to join her husband in Detroit. Sandy stays alone with grandma', who wants to raise him to become a man who accounts for something.Direct exposure to Jim Crow racism comes in small daily doses, like being sent to the back row in the cinema or being teased by the white kids in the street, or, worst of all, not being allowed into a new amusement park despite free entry tickets. The adults tell other tales on the porch at night, of worse troubles. Like unions that don't allow blacks to join. Like a case of a whole black village burned down and the people expelled.\`Does anybody understand the earth ... among you high yellers, you jelly-beans, you pinks and pretty daddies, among you sealskin-browns, smooth blacks, and chocolate-to-the-bone...?'(Thanks to RF for this recommendation!)"},{"Title":"Not Without Laughter","review":"\\"There ain't no room in this world fo' nothing' but love, Sandy chile. That's all they's room fo' -- nothin' but love.\\"In the above passage, Aunt Hager Williams gives her thoughts on the slavery she experienced in her youth to her young grandson, Sandy (James) Williams in the climactic chapter of Langston Hughes's remarkable coming-of age novel \\"Not Without Laughter\\" (1930). The novel offers a picture of African American life in a fictitious Kansas town, modelled on Lawrence, beginning in about 1911 and concluding with the end of WW I in 1918. \\"Nothing but Love\\" is a fitting summation of the book as a whole.Hughes' partially autobiographical novel tells the story of young Sandy Williams between the ages of 9 -- 16, and Sandy and his family are the main characters. The boy's aging grandmother, Hager, is the titular head of the family and inspires the boy with her ambitions for him to make something of his life. She earns money for the family by washing clothes for white people. Hagar's daughter and Sandy's mother, Anjee, works as a domestic for a demanding white family. She is married to Jimboy, an itinerant guitarist and singer who spends little time at home but rather wanders throughout the country looking for work. Hager has two other daughters. Tempy Siles has made a successful marriage, moved into the black middle class, and tends to look down upon the rest of the family. The young daughter, Harriet, has a restless streak. She dislikes white people and religion and spends a great deal of time singing and dancing in disreputable parts of the town. After a time as a prostitute, she succeeds as a blues singer.The novel tells the story of how Sandy learns from his family and from other largely African American people in the town and, in the final scenes of the book, in Chicago. The book and its plot begin slowly, but I soon was engaged with the lives of the characters. Hughes gives a rare realistic and enthusiastic look at African American life during the early 20th Century in its variety, difficulty, and hope. There is, of course, great emphasis on the pervasive discrimination African Americans suffered in the American midwest, as most of the institutions in Kansas enforced rigid segregation and discrimination and most of the whites had racist attitudes. But there was much hope and strength in the African American community as well. Sandy receives his greatest inspiration from the strong Aunt Hager who speaks in dialect, as do many of the characters, is deeply religious, and wants Sandy to make a contribution to uplift the race. Hager is an admirer of Booker Washington. Sandy is exposed to the world of learning from Tempy, who raises the boy after Anjee leaves the family to live with her wandering hustand and after Hager dies. Tempy is an admirer of DuBois, but she presses Sandy in the direction of rejecting the African American culture which the young boy, and Hughes, are unwilling to do.Besides the emphasis on educational uplift, there is much in Sandy's world of guitar playing, music, the blues, and poetry, as songs such as \\"St. Louis Blues\\", \\"Easy Rider\\" \\"John Henry\\" and many more get a great deal of attention and quotation. The book is in the language of poetry and dialect. Scenes take place in dance halls, barber shops, carnivals, and pool halls, as well as in schools, churches and the home. The town \\"bottoms\\" -- the home of prostitutes and gamblers -- is described as the only location in the community that is free from race discrimination. The book describes the importance, and frequent repression of sexuality, in the budding awareness of Sandy, and in the experiences of the other characters. Hughes offers a complex and varied perspective on African American life. He emphasizes the importance of knowledge and empowerment. He also treasures the distinctive features of African American life in its poetry, dance, and music and emphasis on family. He suggests to me that African American life can develop its own culture without merely adopting that of white America. The overall tone is one of laughter, love, and forgiveness.Hughes' novel won the Harmon Gold Medal in 1930, a prize awarded between 1925 -- 1930 for high achievement in African American art and literature. The novel is not as well known today as it deserves to be. It is a precious story of African American life and of growing up.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Not Without Laughter","review":"This book really makes you think of how hard it was for African Americans during the 1930's and it captures your heart almost immediately.

It's a great coming of age story, but I was amazed at how much we found to discuss: the characters (although there was some complaint that they are a bit flat and unchanging - other than the narrator), the position of Blacks in 1920 Kansas and today, the role of music, the prominent place that the church played in the Black community, the perception of light-colored Blacks versus darker colored Blacks, Black history in the US, and how the middle-class Blacks looked down on the lower-class Blacks. We thought that young people might enjoy reading this novel - it's seemingly written for a \\"young adult\\" audience -- but some of the matter-of-fact discussion of prostitution and sex may get it banned from conservative schools.Some thought that the novel ended a bit quickly and brightly -- pointing toward the best (but perhaps unrealistic) future for the young narrator. There are so many tragedies and sad events throughout the novel, it's hard to believe that they'll all be overcome so quickly.I assumed that Langston Hughes was gay, but there may be some doubt about that classification (It's in the Wikipedia - so it must be true.) He never joined the Communist Party, and while he wrote some homoerotic poetry and a couple of short stories with characters we would today call \\"gay,\\" Hughes never presented himself as gay.

Further, she attempts to wrestle with a previous work by Herbert Grundmann that the teachings of German mystics were formed by the intellectual underpinnings of the mystical and religious experience of medieval women. It is then Hollywood's hope to demonstrate the influences of the beguine mysticism, as exemplified through Porete and Mechtild, on Eckart's work. In addition, Hollywood explores how these three mystics, \\"... subvert medieval discourses on, and practices concerned with, gender and subjectivity.\\"Accordingly, Hollywood brings together Porete, Mechtild, and Eckhart to illustrate several strains found in all of their writings. First, both bodily and spiritual suffering are implicitly and explicitly criticized by Mechtild, Porete, and Eckhart. Scholars, in the past, have tried to define the language of female mystics, and these two are no exception, in terms of erotic and bodily imagery, which historians maintain is the cultural predilection of women towards such imagery. However, Hollywood believes that all of these writers have an apophatic nature to them. It is more explicit in Eckhart, but Hollywood maintains that all three use apophatic means to try to describe God. None of these mystics can properly describe God because of His unknowable nature, so they use terms that were familiar to their intended audience.These mystics also emphasized the suppression of the will to become one with God. Eckhart stressed the importance of surrender of the self [the soul], \\"for the divine being is equal to nothing, and in it there is neither image nor form.\\" While the women, Mechthild and Porete, describe divine experiences, thus emphasizing personal authority due to God's intervention, Eckhart conveys \\"priestly authority\\" available to men during the period, however, his emphasis upon personal detachment allows the concept of the soul's union with God to be available to all. Thus, to Hollywood, women were forced to seek access to the divine and to public voices by inscribing their souls with suffering and with wounds marking the presence of God and the limits of description. Taken together, the three mystics and their attitude towards the body are similar in that they all stressed the importance of minimizing the body to concentrate on the soul. Medieval society emphasizes asceticism as the path to God, but again, the three mystics emphasize what the soul must do to forge a path to God. Of course, Hollywood does make several assumptions to make her thesis work. First, that the two female mystics attempted to explain God in unknowable terms, and that they used terms that their society could understand, and the second, that Eckhart did read these two female mystic writers."},{"Title":"Sword & Sorcery Anthology","review":"De Camp has collected a variety of major early writers of Sword & Sorcery in this volume.Several names have become less famous as the years have passed, but this collection has caused me to add the various authors' names to my bucket list.The Hipster gives it a Thumbs Up."},{"Title":"Transforming Power: Biblical Strategies for Making a Difference in Your Community","review":"Transforming Power is Linthicum's challenge to the Evangelical World to be smart about power - not the smoke and mirrors power of politics, which he hardly mentions, but the real, daily life power of bringing positive change to neighborhoods and cities. Starting with a solid biblical theology of society, with its spiritual, cultural, economical and political strands, Linthicum then moves to a description of God's intentions for the world. His discussion of the shalom community will not be new to frequent urbana.org readers, but he manages to bring freshness to the topic.Linthicum's core message is what he calls the \\"Iron Rule of Power\\": never do for others what they can do for themselves. This notion, honed over decades of community organizing, means simply: don't create dependencies. Linthicum's case study is Nehemiah, who managed to enlist the residents of a decimated Jerusalem in the rebuilding of its walls.Moving to the New Testament, Linthicum discusses the difference between relational power, legislative power, and violent power. The former is the greatest, because it is the longest lasting, and the most effective. It is also the power wielded by Jesus to the tremendous frustration of the wielders of legislative power in his day. In the same way, Christians need to be great stewards of their relationships, in order to most effectively distribute God's empowerment among his church.Transforming Power is both a theoretical book and a practical book and is well worth the read. While it could have used a bit more discussion of spiritual realities and strongholds, the book should provide a powerful biblical framework for our use of, rather than our flight from, power."},{"Title":"Transforming Power: Biblical Strategies for Making a Difference in Your Community","review":"The book is an inspiring, practical Biblically-based manual for moving fromcharity to transformation of community.

A mustbook for people working in low income communities, especially with faithconnections."},{"Title":"Transforming Power: Biblical Strategies for Making a Difference in Your Community","review":"Transforming Power was a great help to me in my understanding of systems and of the necessity of utilizing power to make systemic change. The foundation for this book is that power, when used correctly, is strengthening and liberating. It is critical that Christians understand power and use it in such a way that gives people a purpose, direction, and joy which sets them free.After reading Linthicum's view that Christians are often afraid of power and see having power as a negative and \\"un-Christian-like\\" it occurred to me just how much this has affected the role the church is playing in today's society. A common belief is that Jesus was gentle and did not want or utilize power. While it is true that Jesus was gentle and loving, it is also true that He used power to fight injustice and saw it as a powerful tool. As Christ followers we need not to be afraid to utilize healthy power in order to bring about a shalom community.There are two major sections of this book, \\"Theology of Power\\" and the \\"Practice of Power.\\" Linthicum begins with \\"Theology of Power\\" which lays out a Biblical theology of power giving readers a Biblical framework to place power. He does this by first describing God's desire for a shalom community and then looking at human's destruction of this community.Jesus' use of relational power to triumph over the corrupt and dominating power of the current systems is an example of the positive way in which power can be used. There are many Biblical examples of relational power being used in a positive way by the early church and by the apostles.Linthicum gives practical principles and strategies for utilizing power that brings about transformation. It is the work of the church to learn the Biblical examples of using power and apply it to our world today.I would give this book a rating of five starts. It introduces the reader to Biblical narrative that is often overlooked and incites the reader to action. This book is an easy read that is very powerful. The descriptions of systems by Linthicum were clear and easy to understand. I have already used a number of his Biblical references and power practices in my ministry since reading this book. I know that I will be able to use the theology of this book in many situations during my ministry."},{"Title":"Transforming Power: Biblical Strategies for Making a Difference in Your Community","review":"This is an outstanding piece--it should be far more widely read than the attention it has received."},{"Title":"Fires (Phoenix Fiction)","review":"&quot;I hope this book will never be read.&quot; So begins Yourcenar's Fires...a richly dense collection of famous myths and legends stunningly revitalized through the voices and eyes of the heroines.

A work of Goodman's youth, around the time he taught at Black Mountain College, Communitas is by turns common sensical, prophetic, poetic, absurdly idealistic, & frequently (deliberately) hilarious.What was so terribly dehumanizing about American cities (the model here is New York) in the Forties has not been corrected in any major way. In the aftermath of 9/11, with that horrible, gaping hole where the Towers stood, one turns again to Communitas & reads about banning cars from New York, making the the city's avenues pedestrian & bike friendly, preserving good neighborhoods with indigenous personalities, & transforming other harsh, declining or gentrifying areas into safe, humane areas that are welcoming & which provide homes, schools & shopping areas that erase racial & class divides.The Goodmans eagerly to take on Frank Lloyd Wright, Bucky Fuller, the international & all the other various schools of designs for living then current. They reach back to earlier American, British & European models of community that showed promise through their partial successes.This is a deeply felt & humane call for holistic, human-sized communities within our cities. Ultimately, the solutions may not be so grandiose as some of those suggested here. But the World Trade Center Towers, awesome as they were, were coldly & absurdly beyond human scale; symbols of our subservience to a system of economics that is usually blind to basic human requirements; gigantic obstacles to the simple warmth of an afternoon's sunshine.

The other are two books,[by other authors]... Freyre, the most popular and readable of the three, was a Pernambucano (from the sugar cane regions around Recife) and often blurs the distinction between Brazil as a whole and sugar-cane regions of Brazil. His methodology reflects his education, a US oriented 1930's anthropological perspective (he was a student of Franz Boas). This book in particular treats a very specific historical event: the development of a sugar-based agricultural economy in late 1500s, early 1600s in northeastern coastal Brazil. The book makes the generalization that Brazilian culture as a whole evolved from this cultural base, and places little importance on the parallel development of cattle-based cultures in the northeastern interior or the primitive jungle trading activities of Sao Paulo's city fathers (Raposo Tavares, etc).Because of its focus on a very provincial-specific economy and culture, I would criticize Freyre for offering a very incomplete study of \\"Brazilian Civilization\\" in this book. In his defense, however, this book is too often read as a stand-alone study, when in fact Freyre intended for it to form a trilogy with another two books...The former traces how the rural sugar-based culture of early northeastern Brazil affected and was affected by the emergence of cities and urban life-patterns in places like Recife, Salvador, and Rio de Janeiro in the mid 1600s through the end of the 18th century. The latter book follows the study further, through the independence period and especially the twilight of the Empire, establishment of the Republic in the 188o's. If you read one, I recommend all three books to appreciate Freyre's thesis, that the original sugar-culture that developed and was discussed in Masters and Slaves had a lasting impact on Brazil's evolution as a whole, even in areas and regions where sugar cane and slavery were never established bases for economic development. This vision of Brazil remains incomplete without an understanding of Sao Paulo and the south, a region which today is arguably the strongest center of influence in the country. To complete that, I would recommend some books by [other authors]"},{"Title":"The Masters and the Slaves (Casa-Grande & Senzala): A Study in the Development of Brazilian Civilization","review":"Gilberto Freyre is now considered one of the grestest thinkers of Brazil, alongside S&eacute;rgio Buarque de Hollanda. As mrs. Laidman recognized, we can't look for his work as if it's been written yesterday: when many people all over Americas (both North and South) believed that &quot;whitening population&quot; was the solution to all problems; when fascists and nazis took power in Europe, Freyre looked at mixture of races and saw it as a positive feature, something that could lead our people to a better place, God knows where, but better. During the 60's and 70's his ideas were fiercely attacked by new generations of sociologists and historians - and that's good, that's how science advances. But, they attacked him, mostly, for his political positions. Today, people rediscovered Freyre, understood him on his own time. Yes, his presumptions about sex addicted people, indian women burning in desire and so on are considered today too much. But the essence, the mix of races and cultures as a positive fact, the understanding of Portuguese government as something absent and masters of plantions, on the absence of State, rulling their slaves and families and regions, masters as the actual power in colonial Brazil, is considered a remarkable way to understand our country and it's people. By the way, many people in Black Movement also recognizes Freyre and his role in understand Brazil's black influences. Despite his presumptions, Freyre is more up to date than ever."},{"Title":"The Masters and the Slaves (Casa-Grande & Senzala): A Study in the Development of Brazilian Civilization","review":"When Gilberto Freyre first launched this essay, 1933, it revolutioned the way brazilians thought about themselves. Until then, we understood us as a &quot;white nation&quot;, with some black people who, eventually, would disappear. Black people's only importance were as slaves, planting sugar cane or coffee. Freyre brings to History black people's contributions: culturally, genetically. Most of all, underlines that brazilians are a mix of cultures and races, not a pure race, and it is a positive feature for as all."},{"Title":"The Masters and the Slaves (Casa-Grande & Senzala): A Study in the Development of Brazilian Civilization","review":"Freyre did extensive research for &quot;The Masters and the Slaves, A Study in the Development of Brazilian Civilization&quot;, an informative and stimulating social history of Brazil. However, not all of what is written should be taken at face value.The book was written more than 50 years ago and Freyre, like any other historian or ethnologist, unavoidably comes to the table with cultural and personal biases transparent to himself.Freyre makes a number of presumptions, sometimes contradictory, sometimes a bit absurd from today's perspective, about the sexual attributes, habits and dispositions of the Amerindians, peoples of African descent and the Portuguese. Portuguese men are categorized as oversexed (over and over again), Amerindian women as ever willing sexual partners while the Africans are determined to be less sexual because they use music and dancing to stimulate their sexual urges (!). Then, just to confuse the reader, Freyre talks about Africans escaping to the Brazilian bush and \`raping' the (ever willing?) Amerindian woman. Did these alleged rapists bring their drummers with them? All three groups can step forward and take offense at Freyre's presumptions.In the year 2000 we would interpret Freyre's presumptions as racist, but we have the benefit of hindsight and he didn't. In his time he would have been considered forward looking and anything but a racist. The reader needs to take note of the author's presumptions, biases and preoccupations and then continue reading.

And most people only care about the Fabio-cover pages and unimaginative fiction. As JKG puts it &quot;[life in society] can also be pleasant - a womb in which the individual rests without the pain of mental activity or decision.&quot;JKG wrote this in the Affluent Society : &quot;Nothing counts so heavily against a man as to be found attacking the values of the public at large and seeking to substitute his own. Technically, his crime is arrogance. Actually, it is ignorance of the rules. In any case, he is automatically removed from the game.&quot; I'm not sure if he was 'seeking to substitute his own' ideas, but he gave an option for emancipation - to free oneselve from persuasive grasp of big business.

It's a really good book."},{"Title":"Economics & the Public Purpose","review":"This was part of a trilogy that began with *The Affluent Society* (1957), and continued with *The New Industrial State* (1967). However, as Galbraith readily concedes, he learned a great deal in the intervals between writing these books. In 1958, Galbraith's political career was on an upward trajectory; by 1967 he had ruptured with Pres. Johnson over the Vietnam War, and in 1974 he had become reconciled to life in the political and academic wilderness.For strangers to Galbraith's views, it is necessary to understand that he was first and foremost a student of what was, rather than idealized systems. Hence, many of his critics, faced with a dualistic world view, will accuse him of favoring a command economy, on the grounds that he was critical of the pretensions of capitalist economies. I hope readers will immediately see the error of this way of thinking: a clear-sighted analysis of a system that embraces the whole of a society's transactions cannot possibly be reduced to a dualistic judgment.Second, Galbraith was an institutionalist. While orthodox schools of economics tend to emphasize the inherent, automatic nature of all economic transactions regardless of the nature of the agents, institutionalists such as T. Veblen, J. Commons, C. Ayres, and Galbraith identify the economic agents--viz., institutions in the society--as the decisive factor. Galbraith frequently aroused a lot of ire by pointing out the shortcomings of a social science (economics) being dominated by political demagogues, although he preferred to say this using dry wit.In this book, he unites several concepts into an explanatory system. One of these is the concept of the \\"convenient social virtue,\\" the tendency of people to profusely admire traits in other people they are not prepared to compensate; hence, the admiration of workers whose sense of duty and self-sacrifice transcends any rational economic explanation. He applies this analysis to women, who remain an undercompensated cadre of the workforce. Another concept is that of \\"the market system\\" as distinct from the \\"planning system\\"; usually economists and demagogues speak of the public sector [bad] versus the private sector [good], as if there were nothing but kinship between the multinational corporation and the corner espresso cart.Galbraith explains that, while the giant industrial firm has very different needs and wants from small shops, it is likely to be very closely aligned to the needs and wants of those holding political power. Hence, the boundary between public and private sectors is less meaningful than that between the planning and the market systems. While the market system is admired, it is also punished with far greater danger and with \\"self-exploitation\\" by desperate proprietors.The illusion that we live in an economy that is a free market, with an adversarial relationship to the state, is a dangerous one. First, it leads to people assuming that problems of waste and unemployment will solve themselves once an obvious regulatory obstacle is removed. In reality, we live in a planned economy ridden by systems of price controls and monopoly, and that planning is designed to serve industrial management. Assuming the opposite, of course, will only make such problems worse.Second, it is dangerous because we overlook the influence of the planning system on the basic purpose of the state. The insistence of economist-demagogues is that the state is miraculously devoted to the toiling masses, and intent on expropriating the creative fountainhead, John Galt and Henry Reardon. Militarism is assumed to be therefore a rational response to a genuine foreign threat; whereas if the influence is understood to be symmetric, or even understood to flow the other direction, then one will expect militarism to serve the planning system and one will be skeptical of it.There's a lot more in this book, and I believe it deserves a far better review than I've supplied. But I hope this gives a taste of the issues that Galbraith addresses."},{"Title":"Economics & the Public Purpose","review":"In this excellent book, Galbraith examines the economics profession's claim that the current economic system reflects the individual's free choices. For example, the leading orthodox economist Paul Samuelson defines economics as \\"How ... we choose to use scarce productive resources with alternative uses, to meet prescribed ends ...\\"Galbraith comments, \\"the imagery of choice ... means that this choosing - this decision to purchase this product, reject that - is what, when aggregated, controls the economic system. And if choice by the public is the source of power, the organisations that comprise the economic system cannot have power. They are merely instruments in the ultimate service of that choice.\\" So if the consumer has the power, she, not the firm, is to blame for the firm's products or results (e.g. pollution). In theory, the market uses power for the public good; in fact, large corporations use this power for their own purposes.He sums up, \\"economics ... also serves the controlling economic interest.\\" Mainstream economics is a system of ideas that diverts all attacks into channels that are safely futileIn analysing the US economy, Galbraith oddly distinguishes what he calls the \`planning system' from the market system. The \`planning system' is composed of the thousand giant firms that run the show. The market system is composed of the roughly twelve millions of small businesses.What does the US economic system produce? \\"Unequal development, inequality, frivolous and erratic innovation, environmental assault, indifference to personality, power over the state, inflation, failure in inter-industry coordination are part of the system.\\" He shows how mergers usually produce worse performance, higher rewards for executives and job losses for the workers. \\"On no conclusion is this book more clear: left to themselves, economic forces do not work out for the best except perhaps for the powerful.\\"Galbraith says that the public must take power away from the corporations and use it to plan the economy. He urges us to take responsibility for our society."},{"Title":"Economics & the Public Purpose","review":"John Kenneth Galbraith (1908-2006) was a Canadian-American economist, who taught at Harvard University, served as U.S. Ambassador to India (1961-1963), and wrote a number of bestselling books, such asAmerican Capitalism,The Affluent Society (A Mentor Book),The New Industrial State (James Madison Library in American Politics),The Great Crash 1929,The Age of Uncertainty(which was a TV series on the BBC), etc.He wrote in the Foreword to this 1973 book, \\"This book is in descent, the last in the line, from two earlier volumes---'The Affluent Society' and 'The New Industrial State.' There are also some genes, though not many, from ... 'American Capitalism.' ... The earlier volumes were centrally concerned with the world of the great corporations... There is also the world of the farmer, repairman, retailer, small manufacturer... This book seeks to bring them fully into the scene... This (book also) gives the first elements of the international scene.\\"He begins with the observation that not only does General Motors exist to serve the public, but \\"General Motors also serves itself.\\" (Pg. 3) He asserts that no innovation of importance originates with the individual farmer. \\"Were it not for the government and farm equipment and chemical firms, agriculture would be technologically stagnant.\\" (Pg. 48)He notes that the market system is subordinate to the planning system, which supplies power, fuel, machinery, transportation, communications, etc. He then contrasts the \\"relatively secure and favorable income for participants in the planning system\\" versus a \\"less secure and less favorable return for those in the market system.\\" (Pg. 50) He suggests that the growth in acquisitions of one firm by another is motivated less by monetary rewards, than by the \\"prestige\\" of \\"not a greater rate of return but a greater size.\\" (Pg. 101)The technostructure thus favors a policy that keeps prices under control, and then serves its affirmative interest in the growth of the firm. (Pg. 115) Galbraith invents the term \\"Bureaucratic Symbiosis\\" for the tendency of public and private organizations to \\"find and pursue a common purpose.\\" (Pg. 139) He asserts that the small businessman and farmer are \\"extremely vulnerable to adversity emanating from the planning system.\\" (Pg. 177)He concludes that \\"the economy must be managed\\"; but not one economy, but two: \\"one that is subject to the market and one that is planned by its constituent firms.\\" (Pg. 214) He proposes that conversion of \\"the fully mature corporations... into public corporations.\\" (Pg. 261)Not as innovative or thought-provoking as the earlier three volumes, this book nevertheless represents an important continuation in the development of Galbraith's thought."},{"Title":"Historical and autobiographical sketches of the McMullen family, 1902","review":"This book based on limited family input collected circa 1856, then written after all of John Mercier McMullen's siblings were deceased in 1902 has been proven by his genetic male descendants based on DNA testing and extensive genealogical research, to have been a political fabrication. It was not published in 1902 or following his death in 1908 by any surviving male relations of John M McMullen including, his own sons. Rather it was a maternal grandaughter who published it in 1960. His motivation in modifying, fabricating or in several cases actually eliminating truthful information appears to have been a desire for acceptance by the British aristocracy of the day in his Upper Canadian village of Brockville. This resulted in an effort by John McMullen, to position his historical family as pro-UBE, anti Irish and of lowland Scot extraction. The facts suggest exactly the opposite, with oral history as provided by sibling descendants, genetic DNA test results and actual interviews with Irish families in the village of Kells Co. Kilkenny (where John came from, not the north of Ireland) who knew this family as late as 1950. An example of fabrication would be his statement that James McMullen was one of the 13 apprentices of Derry, exposed as a falsehood in correspondence with the association itself.

The house plans feature very small rooms and appear to be taken directly from the Adobe Architecture book. Many of the drawings have little content.

The book simply is not that detailed and runs more like an outline than anything else. It was obvious to me that the author probably hadn't experienced many \\"SWAT\\" situations to incorporate as examples in the book. Perhaps that could be remedied now if he chose to update the book with a second edition. For law enforcement officers or students. I would stay away.

Wilson astutely points out the ways that social norms for behavior lowered crime rates in 19th century New York (despite what many might think) and even affect such small details as whether a car is left untouched in a crime zone (according to Wilson, studies show that many people will not touch a car until someone else vandalizes it first; then it creates a free-for-all in which the car will be stripped, showing that \\"group think\\" is a dangerous trend if left unchecked). On the other hand, group think can also be used for the good if moral voices in society can harness the tool of \\"peer persuasion\\" for the greater good (as was the case with the some of the more positive movements in U.S. history). This book is a must for anyone who wants to understand the basic psychology of society as a organism, or who wants to evaluate ways to make a positive difference in our nation.

The plot he weaves around a lone man (Patrick Galvin) who ventures into Hong Kong as a priest and emerges cleansed of his Christian beliefs and inducted into the customs of Hong Kong - yet this is not truly a book focused on religion, it does not point fingers at Christianity as being wrong or evil, simply a portrayal of one man who feels his god has \\"left him in the lurch\\".This book will strike its most poignant chords with those who have lived/are living in Hong Kong, or those who have had some exposure to traditional Chinese culture and living. Martin Booth creates a character that, through flashbacks, teachings, and snaps of his current life in old age describes his transformation from a naive \\"gweilo\\" (a term roughly translated as \\"[white] foreigner\\") to one that has managed to adapt to his new surroundings and his new life. The Iron Tree is glaringly honest and simple to its core, with characters contrasting before the vibrant Hong Kong background. Even the firmly faithful and loving Father Callaghan, a priest Patrick becomes firm friends with, remains rooted in the realism of his world; for example \\"[after having restrained Patrick from saving a drowning man] \\"We're here to save the living, my son, Father Callaghan said, \`not the dead. They've already gone to their gods and are beyond our touch. We're here for the abandoned, not the lost.'There is a secret guilt in Patrick's past that is not revealed until the logical ending of the book, where all loose ties in his past are tied neatly together as he finishes his story, and his straightforward voice is clear and unique, shining through every word of this expertly crafted prose.Overall, a powerful novel - I firmly recommend it, for it will leave your mind - if not your heart - in awe."},{"Title":"Six Bridges","review":"&quot;Six Bridges - The Legacy of Othmar H. Ammann by Darl Rastorfer is a very well written book about a great 20th Century engineer and his engineering feats in long span suspension bridges. This is a must read for everyone for it reveals the trials and tribulations of a man who made history by using scientific principles to design world record breaking bridges.With his European education Ammann sought out a dream to come to America and seek opportunities in the new country. Within two weeks he started his first position. The early years of Othmar Ammann's career are clearly outlined showing how he gained his knowledge with diligence in various career positions. His thoroughness and dedication to hard work is demonstrated by the trust, faith and confidence of the people who hired him. His reputation was building.I enjoyed the stories which tell of his character building during hard times also. After his plans for a bridge challenged his future with an employer, he was able to move on and demonstrate his convictions with successful accomplishments. Interesting political considerations are also profiled in the important decisions of costly construction and pressures from public opinion. Ammann's skill to work with people results in many obstacles being overcome.When the trials and tribulations of office competition evoled, Ammann had the fortitude to break away and start anew. He was a man of visions and had dreams to fulfill. He was a man of principles and nothing could sway him. He was confident his engineering background and skills could lay a path of successful bridge design and construction.No other bridge engineer has influenced one city more than O.H. Ammann. The history of the planning stages of the designing and construction of these six bridges is well written and interesting for all readers. These six bridges: Georg Washington, Bayonne, Triborough, Bronx-Whitestone, Throngs Neck, and Verrazano-Narrows all are beautifully photographed. A chapter for each bridge outlines their construction with great description and many breathtaking photographs. If you have never been to New York Ctiy this author will certainly take you there with beautiful photos and interesting, informative narrative. Another book including O.H. Ammann's life is: Henry Petrosky's - &quot;Engineers of Dreams: Great Bridge Builders&quot;e-mail &lt;sparty@pathwaynet.com&gt;"},{"Title":"Six Bridges","review":"During the first half of this century, American bridges became the largest and most beautiful structures ever built; Othmar Ammann, a Swiss engineer who came to New York in 1904, was the quiet genius who built six of the very best.George Washington, Bayonne, Triborough, Bronx-Whitestone, Throgs Neck and Verrazano-Narrows are his monuments; like the skyscrapers, literally \\"invented\\" in New York, the builders of suspension bridges perfected their art in the US. It shows what can be accomplished with new wealth, pride and vision. One of the finest is the Verrazano-Narrows bridge; the towers for the cables are as high as a seventy story building. To put this in perspective, that's twice as high as the tallest \\"skyscraper\\" in Phoenix.Each tower was assembled with 10,000 steel cells, fastened with six million rivets and two million bolts. The Empire State Building has 365,000 tons of steel, the bridge has 1,265,000 tons. Like the Parthenon, where the pillars were sculpted to present the most pleasing appearance, the bridge towers are tapered from top to bottom. The two towers are plumb, but the curvature of the earth means the tops are one and five-eighth inches further apart than the base. Since metal expands in hot weather, the roadway at the center of the span rises or falls by 12 feet during a temperature change of 100 degrees.Bigger bridges will be built. Some will be more beautiful. But these six are the ones that set the standard. Everything from now will be an adaptation of them. It's like the Golden Age of radio, or television, or movies, or the Internet; experimentation and innovation is always greatest when technology is new.A suspension bridge is truly an artistic sculpture, because it is based on natural curve of a cord strung between two points. Look at a spider's web, the curve of a bird's wing, or wheat bending in the wind; there is a contrast between nature and the massive stone blocks of earlier bridges. The book is admirably illustrated with more than 200 photos; they show the artistry, and the incredible labor that went into the construction of each.In today's society, when lowest cost seems to be the only consideration, some wisdom from Ammann in 1958 stands out, \\"In fact, an engineer designing a bridge is justified in making a more expensive design for beauty's sake. After all, many people will have to look at the bridge for the rest of their lives. Few of us appreciate eyesores, even if we should save a little money by building them.\\"It shows good design is possible, and adds a great deal to a community. Like Will Bruder's design of the new Phoenix library, skillfully described in the book &quot;Phoenix Central Library&quot; by Oscar Riera Ojeda, et al, this book is a must for anyone interested in better communities."},{"Title":"Six Bridges","review":"This is the first to examine the works of Ammann, one of the finest modern bridge designers of modern times. This uses over 200 archival photos to present displays of his New York bridges, their construction, and the development of his ideas. The in-depth details on bridge designs of the times and Ammann's place in the world of bridge designers makes for excellent coverage.Diane C. Donovan Reviewer"},{"Title":"Six Bridges","review":"I'd like to take this opportunity to \\"thank\\" Othmar Ammann for creating the main object in my worst nightmare - The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge (the nightmare involves getting a flat tire while traveling the upper deck). It's good to face your fears and Darl Rastorfer's fine book \\"Six Bridges: The Legacy of Othmar H. Ammann\\" enabled me to face mine in the least threatening way possible. The book would be an excellent addition to any coffee table or a keeper in the car for when you're getting a tire replaced.\\"Six Bridges\\" is actually a concise history of bridge building in the United States with no shortage of drama including Ammann's investigative leadership of the Tacoma (Washington) Narrows collapse, which still ripples through the civil engineering world today.Swiss-born Ammann became the greatest long suspension bridge designer and master craftsman. Rastorfer uses Swiss-like economy in taking us through the engineer's four-decade career from his first design submission for the George Washington Bridge in 1924 to the opening of the Verrazano in 1964. We learn that Ammann wanted to return to Switzerland more than once but destiny repeatedly intervened with project challenges growing in tandem with his reputation.The author neatly rivets together personal and technical information, creating a sturdy and handsome edifice. Nuances showing in the personal demonstrate Ammann's deep-seated entrepreneurship including parting ways with mentor Gustav Lindenthal when Lindenthal refused to climb down off his giantism in contemplating a Hudson River crossing. Ammann's close relationship with New Jersey Gov. George Silzer gave the engineer courage to break with Lindenthal, Rastorfer notes (p. 25). Another ally and collaborator was the main character of the book \\"Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York.\\" Lots of nuance to pick through in that fellow's legacy.Ammann joined the Port Authority of New York in 1925, the year he became a U.S. citizen. Offspring from that period include the Bayonne Bridge and Lincoln Tunnel. Years before the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey got its official name it existed in the person of Othmar Ammann.Interesting that Ammann's early career was spent connecting New York and New Jersey and his later works involved better connecting parts of New York City. Logically, you would have expected the reverse. Not surprising at all upon learning what bridge building, the auto industry and that \\"Power Broker\\" guy with his highways created in the Five Boroughs after World War II. \\"Build it and they will come\\" comes to mind.The Verrazano-Narrows is just as likely to confound sociologists as civil engineers. After his \\"muscular\\" Throgs Neck Bridge triumph, what did Ammann have left to prove? Rastorfer nails it using the engineer's own words - to create \\"an enormous object drawn as faintly as possible\\" (p. 138). We come to learn that the Empire State Building is a toothpick compared to the long-span Louisville Slugger hewn by Ammann. New York should be called The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge State but that doesn't fit on a license plate.Our author scales the heights through compelling photos and prose summarizing the 12-year effort. We meet Hard Nose Murphy and the fearless \\"Boomers.\\" My conservative nose got rankled by the demolition that forever changed Bay Ridge, Brooklyn (might as well call it \\"Bay Bridge\\" now) and management stalling on putting up netting after three workers fell to their deaths. Netting went up after unionized workers walked off the job (wonder if that would happen today) and four workers were saved by the netting. As Gay Talese does in his book \\"The Bridge,\\" Rastorfer enables the back-stage heroes to take a bow.Ammann must have been grateful for G-d creating men able to laugh in the face of vertigo. The crewmen must have been glad for a master craftsman that used each project to create another world engineering benchmark. Rastorfer has recorded their achievements, which some of us drive by or on unthinkingly every day, in such a memorable way.Hopefully, the 65th anniversary of the creation of Ammann & Whitney, Consulting Engineers (which occurred when Ammann and partner C.C. Combs joined forces with reinforced concrete design pioneer Charles Whitney) will be marked in some way this year. When that occurs we should reexamine the pillars of Ammann's work - shining like the towers of one of his bridges. Like an Ammann design both will surprise upon close inspection - 1) Bridge engineering is NOT an exact science (p. 38) and 2) \\"It is a crime to build an ugly bridge\\" (p. 35). Given these, how was Ammann able to create an unbroken chain of success? See the end of Chapter 1 for the master craftsman's humble and surprising answer."},{"Title":"Six Bridges","review":"This book is as special to New Yorkers as it is to Engineering Enthusiasts. As New Yorker in Exile, I now live a life where if I traverse one major bridge a year, it's an event. When I lived in New York City (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and Stane Island at various times), the crossing of these major Bridges was a daily event. Not a day went by when I didn't listen to the Traffic reports and have to quickly calculate my Commute strategy in order to choose the most efficient Span to cross. When going Upstate to visit the parents, I often crossed The Whitestone, Throgsneck or Tri-borough if traffic was too congested in Manhattan. Sometimes, I'd cross the Verrazano, The Brooklyn and the George Washington. This book honours the creation of the modern bridges, their design, construction, completion and functionality as well as describing the political and economic climate in which they were conceived and completed. It answers many of the passing questions that came to my Driving Mind as I stalled in traffic at the Tolls of these Bridges and it brings back memories of my life in the City of Islands. As I mentioned in the title of this review, while kinda technical and history-laden, this is a love song to the Bridges of New York City. Buy it, read it and you'll learn to be grateful for living in a time when these bridges ease travel and not curse them as I used to do occaisonally during Jams. Before reading this book, I never bothered to imagine New York before them and now I appreciate them all the much more."},{"Title":"The Unknown She: Eight Faces of an Emerging Consciousness","review":"What an awesome book!

To comprehend the book requires the reader to still the analytical mind and tap into the realm of the intuitive. Approach follows theme.

The book ends with those interviwed saying such similar things, concentrating on four areas: exploring the feminine consciousness, what's important about spiritual practices, the need to go beyond transcendence to transformation in everyday life (and in a balanced way), and finally where we're headed because of our bringing in the feminine consciousness and transformation.

Of course I enjoyed Janet's contribution, but also I thought that that 'The Inheritance' episodes were very well done, and held the book together, and I also very much enjoyed 'The Corbie's Nest' and 'The Luck of the Sixpence'.I thoroughly recommend this book to all readers with a love of Scotland, and a bit of mystery, intrigue and romance."},{"Title":"The model stock plan","review":"Don't be fooled by the title this book has nothing to do with the Stock Market.

Me pregunto que seria de mi si estuviese en esa situaci&oacute;n, caer&iacute;a en la anarqu&iacute;a o tratar&iacute;a e imitar la decadente sociedad de la que vengo? Aunque estoy de acuerdo con el autor en muchas cosas, no estoy de acuerdo con la premisa de que el mal es innato y que la supresi&oacute;n de los controles provoque caos. Quiz&aacute;s sea yo el menos indicado para se&ntilde;alar esto y solo sea un simple so&ntilde;ador, ya que en mis a&ntilde;os de colegio fui un Piggy cualquiera, blanco de las burlas y las mofas de los m&aacute;s astutos aunque menos intelectuales que yo. Y despu&eacute;s en mi vida adulta como profesor he visto que el egocentrismo de los ni&ntilde;os los lleva a veces a ser crueles con sus compa&ntilde;eros. Pero aun me resisto a creer, deseo firmemente demostrar que ese proceso puede revertirse, aunque veo que por lo visto en los &uacute;ltimos tiempos la violencia infantil en las escuelas por parte de ni&ntilde;os ha aumentado bastante. La novela sin embargo trata el punto de vista del autor que supo expresar sus pensamientos magistralmente, aunque debo decir que las descripciones de la selva me resultaron cansonas. Pero eso ya es culpa m&iacute;a, pues nunca he sido muy adepto a las descripciones de paisajes, siendo atra&iacute;do enormemente en cambio por los aspectos psicol&oacute;gicos de las obras...... Descripci&oacute;n de la obra Esta obra de William Golding es una f&aacute;bula al estilo ingles ( parece ser que a los ingleses les encanta escribir este tipo de f&aacute;bula moralista de mundos en decadencia. Solo tenemos que acordarnos de Un Mundo Feliz, 1984, Hacienda de Animales y otras mas, todas sobre mundos o sociedades en su ocaso o dominados por seres autoritarios) en que un grupo de PRE-adolescentes y ni&ntilde;os se ve atrapado en una isla desierta . Los personajes principales de la obra reflejan cada uno una condici&oacute;n distinta del ser humano. Ralph, el gobernante elegido por el grupo, tiene buenas intenciones, don de mando, y una inteligencia por encima de la mediocridad aunque no siempre tiene las mejores ideas. Se apoya inconscientemente en Piggy y solo al final se da cuenta de que era el &uacute;nico amigo verdadero y el &uacute;nico con visi&oacute;n suficiente para pensar casi como adulto. Piggy representa la inteligencia, no siempre escuchada cuando se mueven otros intereses, a veces solo cuando es demasiado tarde. Jack es el antagonista por excelencia, en busca de poder no escatima en esfuerzos por satisfacer sus ansias de ser un gobernante de la isla y dar rienda suelta a instintos que quiz&aacute;s en un mundo civilizado hubiesen permanecido acallados. Su odio visceral hacia Piggy desde un principio es el odio hacia el sentido com&uacute;n que le impedir&iacute;an dar rienda suelta a sus ambiciones y man&iacute;as. La historia puede prestarse a m&uacute;ltiples interpretaciones, pero creo que la mas clara de ellas es la sombr&iacute;a visi&oacute;n del autor hacia la humanidad en si y de c&oacute;mo el mal es algo innato que surge en el ser humano una vez se han relajado los controles que lo mantienen a raya...

The book was in excellent condition."},{"Title":"Welding with Children: Stories","review":"Tim Gautreaux's writing is simply amazingly good. His characters are sublimely human, and he has a knack for finding the good in all of them - even those who might be a bit unsavory. He places them in situations that are ordinary and unique at the same time - and in those situations he finds ways to reveal things to us that allow us to learn more about ourselves. The characters learn about themselves as well, and this is a treasure to observe. The stories here deal with joy and sorrow and all of the areas in between. The people here are struggling to come to grips with their own families, with their work, with the people around them - and with the world in which they live.In the title piece, a man attempts to assert more of a guiding influence on his grandchildren, and in the process winds up changing several aspects of his own life as well. His trials in striving to accomplish a task given him by his wife, while sitting with his grandchildren at the same time, is presented with some of the most genuine humor I've read in a while - but it's a gentle humor, and it never belittles the characters or the situation (and this finely-tuned humor is used to good effect in several of these stories, even the more \`serious' ones.\`Misuse of light' is a moving portrait of a man who works in a camera shop learning about the lives of his customers through the small areas where their lives intersect with his. When someone sells a camera to his shop and he finds a roll of film in it, he develops it in order to get a glimpse into other lives. Opening this door can, as he learns, have jarring effects - on him as well as on the lives he enters. When he uncovers information that causes pain to the young woman who has sold him the camera, rather than abandoning his \`study', he probes a bit further in order to get to a level in this past wherein she can find a bit of peace. It's something that makes the character endearing - it's a story to restore faith. Another story dealing with faith it \`Good for the soul', in which a parish priest with a bit of a drinking problem, attempting to do a good deed (against his better judgment), runs afoul of both the law and his community.\`Easy pickings' details a rather inept thief's attempt to take advantage of a solitary elderly woman - rather than being a cakewalk, he finds that he's definitely bitten off more than he can chew. There's a great deal of the above-mentioned gentle humor in this tale - and Gautreaux delivers it with tender respect, never ridiculing his characters. \`The piano tuner' is, like \`Misuse of light', a finely-crafted work in which one character sets out to help another cope with the world - and does so with no expectations of any sort of reward. It's a good example of how those among us who are a little \`different' can find their niche - and a gentle lesson in showing such folks more tolerance.\`Resistance' is another case of one human helping another - in this instance, an elderly man, a widower, sees a need and fills it. The little girl who lives next door is very obviously the victim of an abusive, drunk father. When the neighbor learns that her parents are unable/unwilling to help her with her science project, he takes on the task himself - and the light he creates shines not only into her dark life, but also into his own.\`Sorry blood' and \`Sunset in heaven' both deal with aspects of growing old. In the former, an Alzheimer's patient is victimized by one of the lowest low-lifes you're liable to meet (and hope that you don't). In the latter, the plight of an old man similarly afflicted opens the eyes of a middle-aged man to the possibilities in his own life.\`Rodeo parole' is a frightening, surreal look at a desperate attempt by prisoners to be viewed in a more favorable light by the parole board - by making themselves sitting targets for a bull enraged by repeated electric shocks from prison guards. Its few pages explode with action.My two favorites in this collection are \`Dancing with the one-armed gal' and \`The Pine Oil Writers Conference'. In the former, a man on the run from (or is it \`to') himself meets a woman hitchhiker as he travels west from Louisiana. They're both looking for something - and neither is sure just what, although they think they know - and the \`answers' they find aren't the ones they expect. It makes for a very interesting and revealing encounter - both for the characters and the reader. \`The Pine Oil Writers Conference' is, for me, the gem of this book. Gautreaux has created the classic \`riddle wrapped in an enigma' with this story - an aspiring writer (a minister) attends the conference, hoping to find out if writing fiction is \`the thing he does best'. The short excerpt included in this story produced by the character for a conference workshop is so well written than it made me sorry there wasn't more of it.I've never read anything by Tim Gautreaux before - but you can bet I'll be looking for his other short story collection (SAME PLACE, SAME THINGS) as well as his novel (THE NEXT STEP IN THE DANCE). This little book was a great discovery."},{"Title":"Welding with Children: Stories","review":"This collection of short stories is outstanding in its own right; but the locations of the stories and the depiction of the characters set it apart. If you are interested in southern Louisiana, be it Cajun or piney woods, this is a book you must have!"},{"Title":"Welding with Children: Stories","review":"This collection of short stories is populated with surprisingly complex characters yet quirky characters. The stories are vividly set in rural blue collar cajun communities (with some New Orleans thrown in). He avoids stereotypes, and instead gets you inside people's heads in a wonderful and friendly way."},{"Title":"Welding with Children: Stories","review":"Like Flannery O'Connor and Ellen Gilchrist, Tim Gautreaux crafts sly tales that build upon the landscape and characters of the Delta South in a manner that shows his love of the people and place, their hopes and dreams, foibles and flaws. The stories turn equally tragic and humorous with deft turns of Gautreaux's pen.In Welding With Children, Gautreaux devotes a fair number of the stories to older people caught in a modern world not of their making, yet they manage to find ways to reach out to (in the case of the title story) their grandchildren, to neighbor youths, or even strangers. The old Cajun woman and her bour&eacute;e playing neighbors who end up outwitting a would-be robber/murderer is an especially delicious tale.However there are other stories -- such as the one about a camera salesman who develops old rolls of film in used cameras his shop buys in search of found art, or the one about a minister/would-be novelist at a writers' conference -- that illuminate other corners of the soul.This, and Gautreaux's previous work, should put Hammond, Louisiana, on the literary map."},{"Title":"Welding with Children: Stories","review":"These are fabulous stories narrated in a clear, concise manner. The characters are typical Southern Gothic who help keep the Southern Literay Tradition alive. Gautreaux is a great storyteller who has both the gift of creating a vivid environment (Louisianna), and the ability to make you relate to his characters."},{"Title":"Welding with Children: Stories","review":"I love every story in this book. I did not want the story &quot;Welding with Children&quot; to end. I wish Gautreaux would make it a novel. My favorite story is &quot;Good For The Soul&quot; which is hilarious. You cannot live in Southern Louisiana and not know Father Ledet. I pray Tim Gautreaux lives to be a very old man and writes for the rest of his days. I am buying every person I love this book for Christmas."},{"Title":"Welding with Children: Stories","review":"This second collection of short stories from Tim Gautreaux is, perhaps, even better than the first. Of course, if you look inside the book and see who published the individual stories, it's obvious that they must be good; The New Yorker, Atlantic, and Esquire are not noted for publishing bad fiction.While these are fiction, the stories ring so true to life and the lives of the characters, that we can all see ourselves in someone in this collection. Most of Gautreaux's stories have a touch of humor, but all show the depth of character that draws readers into the stories.Anyone who reads these stories and enjoys them, should also read his novels. You'll find that same voice and an author you can trust, who will not betray your empathy for his characters."},{"Title":"Welding with Children: Stories","review":"I just finished reading this book, and could start all over again. Gatreaux has a wonderful way of crafting a story with believable people. No matter where the reader is from, because of his character descriptions, it is easy to identify with these folks from Louisiana. Gatreaux's short stories evoked all kinds of emotions, but there were many places where I simply laughed out loud. The best thing about this book, is the ability of the author to depict flawed characters living flawed lives, who nonetheless experience redemption in various ways. I will be looking for more books by this talented writer."},{"Title":"Welding with Children: Stories","review":"If you get off the interstate and on to the old highways, you can see them. They're the people who live between the suburbs of one great city and the suburbs of the next.

He gives us a sad, funny, sympathetic and ultimately hopeful introduction to his friends. He shows us their fears, their friendships, their courage and their dreams. Take him up on his invitation.

It covers servlet and JSP basics and the specifics of deploying web apps on Tomcat. Important web.xml, custom tag library info, and security realm information is covered. The only real Tomcat server configuration discussion is in a chapter on the server.xml file and a chapter on integrating with the Apache server. I was disappointed in the lack of configuration info (especially SSL info, of which there was none) but I have several jsp and servlet books and this book does a better job of describing servlet and JSP deployment basics than any of them. If you are a sysadmin but not a web developer or app deployer, you will be disappointed by this book."},{"Title":"Apache Jakarta-Tomcat","review":"This book is poorly organized and missing essential information. You would be better off with the open source doc, and much better off with another book. I downloaded the book files and got the first set of classes running . Then I made the tiny changes suggested in Chapter 2 and went to my first servlet compile. PROBLEM 1: what and where is the jar necessary to compile? Couldn't find the info in the book, so I did a text search from the Tomcat root on the superclass the compiler was looking for. Aha, .../common/lib/servlet.jar. Then I made the suggested textual change to the JSP file. PROBLEM 2: I made a hard-to-see typo on that one, and learned what a JSP exception looked like. The book didn't cover that eventuality, so back to the web. Searching news groups told me that this was the most common JSP exception, and my installation might be faulty. So I dove into the exception printout, which is pretty opaque, and figured out my mistake. PROBLEM 3: the book says you can use a compressed war file if you &quot;add a new Context entry in ... referencing the apress Web application.&quot; This is not a trivial task and the book gives no other help. After a few hours (!) of online searching and experimenting, I discovered this: 1. No one explains what should go in the &quot;Config URL&quot; slot in the &quot;live&quot; Manager install page in Tomcat 4. 2. If you go the &lt;Context&gt; route in server.xml, the error log in .../logs will probably have all the info you need about what went wrong. Book doesn't say a word about checking this if you run into trouble, but it is the FIRST place to look (OK, I was working tired). Tomcat is actually easier to use than this book.I skimmed the rest of the book after this, then put it down forever. I went out and bought Marty Hall's &quot;More Servlets and JavaServer Pages&quot;, and I think you should too."},{"Title":"Apache Jakarta-Tomcat","review":"I was very disappointed when I cracked open the book today to find that much of book is focused on things like writing servlets and jsp based pages, rather than administration of Jakarta-Tomcat.

Chapter 9 Integrating the Apache HTTP Server is just plain funny. If you delete the &quot;What is Apache&quot; section along with the pictures, weak example and summary, the chapter is only a few paragraphs long! Zero help!If you enjoy books that are essentially general overviews and contain remotely related content that can be better handled by other dedicated books, then this book is for you!I just purchased &quot;Professional Apache&quot; by Peter Wainwright and was very impressed with the level of detail given by Peter.

Starting chapters even show, in detail, how to set up tomcat server. Advanced users can skip through these chapters.The book is written for tomcat version 4.0, so even the reader familiar with earlier versions of tomcat can expect to find something new. Explanations of new features of tomcat like Security Realms (Chapter 5), embedding tomcat (chapter 6) and Persistent Sessions (chapter 7) are very good.The book is very well organized and has lots of small examples and code snippets. So you can write and run what you are reading about (I always find this approach better).

E.g. on p.103 at the end of chapter 5 you can read: &quot;In the next chapter, we cover securing a Web application using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).&quot; Well, there is no such chapter in the whole book. The same at the end of chapter 12, where Goodwill promises a Chapter on integrating the XML Apache Soap project into Tomcat. Again, no such Chapter.Covering the basics, the book does a good job, but as said, the provided ducumentation does it as well."},{"Title":"Apache Jakarta-Tomcat","review":"The author in the preface says that he expects this book to be a complete reference for Tomcat. I would say that it falls far short of the objective.I had expected a meaningful look at Tomcat. Most of the information presented is already available with the standard Tomcat distribution. There is no attempt to go beyond the surface. It seems the author was in a rush to get a book published, rather than spend time providing some insight into Tomcat.There is no proper introduction to the terms or concepts related to Tomcat. I don't expect an introduction to servlets or JSP.

The Java/Tomcat community has been struggling for some time with Tomcat, trying desperately to gain some sort of useful insight from the horrid online documentation. Then along comes this long-awaited manual that could have easily saved the day for thousands of sysadmins.Problem is, this book provides next to no useful information on the integration of Apache and Tomcat. It's bad enough that this information comes at nearly the end of the book. What's worse, the integration chapter is only a few pages long, and goes no further (in fact, doesn't even go as far) as the documentation that's provided online.This book is a huge disappointment - you are far better served by picking up a good O'Reilly book on servlets/JSP/etc. and figuring out the Tomcat installation/webapp deployment issues on your own."},{"Title":"Apache Jakarta-Tomcat","review":"This book is good only for the beginner. It scratches onlythe surface for most of the topics. At times, I thought itwas a work in progress, and for some reason, the author wasin a hurry to get the book published.

There would be no time for sub-plots or romantic involvements or &quot;No! You go on without me ...&quot;. All there would be is car chases and explosions. Godwill's book is rather like that.I liked it.Forget the measured blend of theory, fact and example which is the style of O'Reilly's authors. This book cuts to the chase, and it works.You see, Tomcat is a servlet runner. It isn't that interesting or even the best of breed (Jetty is way better). Tomcat is as interesting as what you do with it, and Goodwill drags you along through a flash tour of all the goodies.Its a bit like a night tour of Naples on the back of an Italian cigarette smuggler's Vespa. Somehow, at the end, despite not having understood much, you find you know your way around and feel comfortable exloring further on your own.Take it or leave it.

This was a great book as it puts you right there in the Great War (WW1). It gives you a feeling of what it was like to experience the times. I would encourage anybody who loves history, especially the Great War to read this book. The footnotes right behind each chapter are very enlightening. You just look the number up in the diary entry at the back of each chapter and it gives added details. A great read!"},{"Title":"Islands, Islands, Islands","review":"By the end of page 2 of Matt Ash's ISLANDS, the protagonist finds himself abandoned by his wife for a baby-faced tennis pro and fired from his position as History Professor for suggesting publicly that Fr. President should keep his cassock zipped. By the end of the short first chapter, we suspect that Matt is virtually friendless, cut off from as past he'd rather not remember and scrambling to survive by any means possible.This is the first challenge that the reader has to face in this daring and disorienting novel: the protagonist is not your typical sympathetic first person narrator--the sensitive, honest romatic hero we all like to relate to. No--he's deliberately alienating, self-doubting and self-protective, ready to rationalize every failure and burn and slash everything and everyone around him with caustic wit. He distances himself from the reader as effectively as he has distanced himself from others in the novel. Nor is he a &quot;reliable narrator.&quot; We know he's hiding something, but we're not sure what. When clues are dropped by Matt, they are often false. Whem questions are asked, he walks away. There are moments when every reader must wonder why anyone else in this novel has anything to do with him.Yet that is the central magic of this novel: against our will and better judgment, we find ourselves caring about this guy. He reveals himself indirectly and inadvertently when he's trying to hide behind facades of toughness and sarcasm. We notice kindness, vulnerability, sympathy, and caring in scenes where he'd rather be seen as aloof and contemptuous. He is painfully honest when he's trying to be manipulative and smiles most broadly when his pain is deepest. As a lover, he is Cary Grant on the outside, but Woody Allen inside. Perhaps it is his veiled vulnerability that attracts us, or our growing recognition of the depth of pain he tries to hide. Maybe each of us relates to Matt's inner conflict between the desire to isolate himself from the complications of society--as a kind of &quot;Man Who Loved Islands&quot;--and the pull we all feel towards human community and love. Is Matt--are WE--willing to pay the price of pain and vulnerability and failure for the joy of community, the pleasure of love?In the end, Matt Ash is the guy we hate to love, but love him you will.ISLANDS, though, is more than a romance (though ultimately it is one), nor a psychological profile of 21st century ambiguity and uncertainty (though it that too). The novel is an odyssey, clearly borrowing its structure from Homer. Matt Ash, the character,is given a research project to explore the essence of &quot;islandness,&quot; but it is unclear whether there is some mysterious plan or purpose behind the project defined by the Eisenhower Committee that sponsors it. What Matt Ash, the writer, does is to give each of ten islands a story or unique characteristic or mood that captures some element of the essence of the place: Prince Edward Island becomes a place of Gothic isolation, Venice of masks and mystery, Australia of the search for a distinct national character. Santa Catlalina is visited in the off season of winter; Hawaii remains hidden behind the games of lonely tourists seeking paradise. On the Isle d'Yeu in France, Ash finds the ancient joy of the telling of tall tales for curious strangers--all done with a tongue-in-cheek play on Alain Robbe-Grillet's sensational novel, THE VOYEUR. If Manhattan is a place of the seductions of lovers, Sicily--the key story--is the island where stoicism, realism and the hardest truths of human vulnerability are encountered directly. The result for Matt and for us is heartbreaking, but perhaps liberating as well.Much of the joy of reading this painfully joyful novel is that the reader is kept constantly off guard, uncertain, surprised, caught in a detective novel--at once comic and perilous--in which the anticipated solutions are constantly kept doubtful and shifting. Whatever conclusion Matt himself will make, and what its consequences might be, the novel keeps pulling us forward as we travel the islands, enchantingly and beautifully evoked in a way no guide book could ever do.ISLANDS, ISLANDS, ISLANDS, among the first publications of the innovative press, Superiorbook.com, has quickly gained a reputation as an underground favorite, particularly on campuses. It's a novel unlike anything you've ever read. Whatever else you may discover on this tour, I can promise you that you won't be bored. With the emergence of this Island, 2000 looks like a very good year."},{"Title":"A Wine Lover's Diary","review":"I bought this book for my dad, who is a true wine lover. He still enjoys this beautiful book, and logs in his visits to different wineries, wine tasting parties, and his favorite wines."},{"Title":"Night Picnic: Poems","review":"I love this book but fail to find the right words to describe it. As Simic writes in metaphors I am making a clumpsy attempt to compare this collection to a cup of tea -- subtle aroma with awakening strength; simplicity in forms with depth in meanings. Sympathetic, elusive, hopeful, hopeless, provocative, and more. The writer left ample room for a reader's own perspective. The poems cover a broad range of subjects and the collection is stimulating from beginning to end. Here is just one example: \\"Light,/Mystic tipster,/You come rarely,/If at all//Down in the hole/To see me kneeling/With a clip-on halo/Waiting for you.\\" The excerpt is telling of the effortlessness in rendition but the weight of thoughts."},{"Title":"Night Picnic: Poems","review":"I very much enjoyed Charles Simic's Night Picnic. I have yet to discover a volume of his poems, or essays for that matter, to which I would give less than 4 stars. Although I have given this volume 5 stars, if I could I would have given it 4 stars. This is NOT a minor work, to be sure; however it is not, in my opinion one of Simic's best works. Still, I do highly recommend Night Picnic - the poetry is delightfully engaging and the hardbound volume itself is of a quality rarely found these days.I do hope you will pick up this volume, but afterward may I suggest you go further and invest in Simic's absolutely mesmerizing volumes: A Wedding In Hell and The World Doesn't End - I have perhaps a dozen volumes of Simic's poetry in my collection and these two are by far my favorites yet. Of course Charles Simic famously was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry for The World Doesn't End, which you should know is primarily a work of prose poetry."},{"Title":"WINTER GRASS","review":"IMO this is one of the finest Western novels ever written. Not only is it a gripping story, but it's a subtle philosophical novel as well.The setting is Montana at the transition from open to closed range. The protagonist is a progressive rancher who is attempting to save his cattle from a drought by careful fencing while following the letter of the law regarding open range. He is actively opposed by the other ranchers who see him as a threat. One in particular, an Englishman and his siblings here to prove themselves to their father in England.The rancher is middle aged with a heart condition. He has raised a white girl from infanthood after \\"buying\\" her from an Indian tribe. (Her parents had been killed in an Indian raid.) He is trying to protect his project through a female attorney in Bozeman. (She had support from the ranchers in establishing herself.)The plot is two pronged: the ensuing range war and the attempt to adopt the girl legally. (She has a wealthy grandfather back east who is asserting his rights after disowning his daughter because she married \\"beneath her.\\" The man was an immigrant and a South Slav laborer.)The issues, then, are: progressive change in a way of life opposed by tradition and family rights opposed to emotional ties. (The grandfather is acting more from duty and principle than genuine concern for his granddaughter's well being.)Weather is a central concern here. The time frame covers a summer of drought followed by severe winter blizzards and the ruin of many ranchers. The turning point is a \\"debate\\" between two of the characters concerning nature and mental abstraction (principles) while stuck in a stage coach in the blizzard. On the large scale, how best to survive with a way of life in an often hostile natural setting. On the small scale, the struggle between human love and abstract principle.I realize this sounds very heavy. It isn't dealt that way. These conflicts arise organically from the times in which the book is concerned with and in the plot of the story. It's an engrossing and entertaining read and a quick one. The issues are dealt with deftly on a level accessible to anyone. The characters are well rounded and believable. The conflicts are real. The outcome is satisfying."},{"Title":"Head Lock: A Tom Bethany Mystery","review":"A few weeks ago I came across the Jerome Doolittle book \\"Body Scissors\\"-his first Tom Bethany mystery novel. It is an excellent book and I was impressed by the quality of writing, the attention to detail and the characterization. I then found and bought Doolittle's 4th novel, \\"Head Lock,\\" expecting more of the same high quality work. What a disappointment! Doolittle, who was a speech writer for former president Jimmy Carter, is still stewing over the fact that Carter was a one-term president. Doolittle's venomous hate for former president Reagan et al was apparently too much to contain, and in \\"Head Lock\\" he has a political hissy fit. Throughout the novel he heaps abuse and saracasm on Reagan, George Bush, Christians, pro-lifers, L. A. police, Republicans, Conservatives-any and all that he envisions as an enemy of Carter and the True Left. This book is a political temper tantrum masquerading as a novel. And if the abuse Doolittle shovels out isn't enough to turn you off, the \\"heroes\\" of this book are (a)a prostitute who has murdered two people and repeatedly bedded a teenaged boy; (b)a married mother of two who carries on a steamy affair with the detective hero, while her husband smiles his approval; (c)a detective (Tom Bethany) who breaks a dozen laws to entrap and blackmail a cartoon-character anti-abortion leader. Then, at book's end, Bethany preaches a long, boring sermon to the reader about the efficacy of religious faith vs. good works. What drivel! I give this book one star --- a star because Doolittle has provided us with compelling written evidence showing why Carter (and his aides like Doolittle) were thrown out of the White House after four years."},{"Title":"Head Lock: A Tom Bethany Mystery","review":"Though Jerome Doolittle can scorch the souls of Republicans, dishonest businessmen, dopey politicians and a lot of other of folks, he saves his greatest venom for hypocrites.In Head Lock, he finds a good one, a preacher, outspoken opponent of abortion, senatorial wannabe and sexual miscreant.I've been reading several of the Doolittle series featuring the somewhat odd private investigator Tom Bethany in the last few months, and, unfortunately, have read them a little out of order. This is not a fatal mistake; I've just found myself a little confused by the lives of some of Bethany's friends as they leave one career--say, operating a massage parlor, for another, running a religious theme park. That's also not the fault of the author or his sharp writing. Doolittle is a must read for anyone appalled by what passes for political and moral leadership in this day and age. Be prepared for some of Doolittle's zingers, hurled at many people in all of his Bethany books, but thrown with a little extra sting at phony moralizing. Suffice it to say that, in this book, Bethany puts away the bad guy in fine fashion, though not until after he's done irreparable harm to a teenager he doesn't even know. I recommend Doolittle without qualms; someone has to take on the phonies of the world and not be real nice about it in the process."},{"Title":"Head Lock: A Tom Bethany Mystery","review":"Once again, Jerome Doolittle is unafraid to take on issues that are controversial. Via Tom Bethany, the non working workaholic, he inserts some thought provoking insights into the heated debate of abortion. Perhaps the most frightening part is the antagonistic characters may be ousted from Jerome's book and placed into the world and we would be able to identify them. Jerome knows how to weave a story and fill it with humor, comraderie, and perhaps even a touch of wishful thinking."},{"Title":"Tourette's Syndrome: Finding Answers and Getting Help (Patient Centered Guides)","review":"My son starting displaying tics, so I went to the library insearch of information.

I like it.The text includes frequent quotes from people with TS, theirparents, and others, which I found helpful and reassuring.I haven't read enough TS books to really say how thisone compares to others, but I don't think anyone who buysthis book will be disappointed.FYI, after reading this book, I was convinced my son didin fact have Tourettes, so I took him to a neurologist, andit was confirmed.

He ran into a strange group of fortune tellers along the way. He thought little of it until he stopped one of them, Sophie Madrigal, from killing the very man he was sent to locate! t seemed that Sophie had her heart set on revenge and was determined to relocate and kill Hardwick before Gabriel could drag the villain back to what &lt;>he considered \\"Justice\\"!It dawned on Gabriel that Sophie, Aunt Juniper, and Dmitri had connections and he would quickly locate Hardwick if he stayed close. By doing so, he found out that the group were not a bunch of tricksters, as Sophie wanted him to believe. Sophie and Juniper were real!Sophie wanted only to get rid of Gabriel! No matter how rude she was he refused to leave her alone! Her visions, that seldom happened, increased in his presence. So did her talent. It seemed that Gabriel was a perfect media for her, though she loathed to admit it. And no matter how much she began to like him, she dare not tell him. His fate, according to her talent, was to die during this mission!***** Awesome story! This is one the reader will be reluctant to put down for any length of time! I sure could not! A major recommended read from an author who has proven her talent many times over! *****"},{"Title":"Gabriel's Fate","review":"In the nineteenth century out west, Sophie Madrigal makes a living by telling fortunes, but her real motive is to bring Ivo Hardwick to frontier justice administered by herself for the murder of her son. Pinkerton undercover agent Gabriel Caine also seeks Ivo, but being a quasi-member of the law he must bring the killer in alive.When Sophie and Gabriel meet on a train, the attraction overwhelms everything else. However, they have nothing in common but the need to find Ivo links the twosome. Still, Sophie's Aunt Juniper decides that it is in the cards for Gabriel and her niece to share a lifetime of love. Using every trick she knows as a spiritualist, Juniper plays matchmaker between two stubborn individuals who fate has deemed belong together.GABRIEL'S FATE is a refreshing western romance because of the inclusion of the occult in the thrilling story line. The plot is action packed, and the strong cast makes this is a fascinating reading experience. The lead couple disagrees on everything, making them an engaging duet, but it is the support ensemble of eccentrics that allow Gabriel and Sophie to shine as they amusingly enable fate to take its \\"natural course\\" of action. Emma Craig provides the audience with an appealing amusing novel worth reading by sub-genre fans.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Gabriel's Fate","review":"Gabriel Caine was born in a family of revivalists, which he considered in the same light that Emma Craig considers clairvoyants. A strange bond to share, indeed, this disbelief in the gifts and beliefs of one's family. But Emma's prickly and non-trusting nature doesn't allow for men to enter her life, and Gabriel willingly accepts whatever bond he can find. Too bad the only other bond they share is a desire to locate murderer Ivo Hardwick.With his roguish, dark looks, Gabriel's accustomed to women simpering and smirking over him. But Gabriel prefers a challenge, and Emma meets that challenge perfectly. Beneath that haughty exterior, he believes she has character and heart, which he intends to reveal. He also intends to uncover Emma's carefully guarded secret. He knows she intends to kill Hardwick, but he doesn't know why. Further, his under cover assignment to the Pinkerton Agency requires that he bring Hardwick back alive.Emma Craig creates a fascinating and daring blend of spiritualism and the occult in GABRIEL'S FATE. By treating psychic gifts as blessings from God, the spiritual battles of these wounded and disbelieving characters lends strong motivation to the tale. The secondary characters, including a tarot card reading aunt, a Russian midget, and a Chinese pub keep the reader entertained with their antics and audaciousness. In addition, Craig's heroine breaks romantic standards with her concern for extra pounds on a figure the hero considers lush. Consequently, with powerful conflict and strong motivation, GABRIEL'S FATE comes very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Back There Where the Past Was: A Small-Town Boyhood","review":"This is just a great book by a truly sweet man! He has lots of stories to share about growing up in the 1930s and '40s in Small Town America which unfortunately no longer exists. Hammondsport New York was not the only small town back then, but one of many. I wish my children could have had the experiences Charles Champlin did -- I wish I could have had them! The good old days really were better and obviously simpler and more innocent.I bought this book used from a Seller at Amazon MarketPlace in 2012, but it was published in 1989. There are no reviews for this book! Why not? It is fun to read, it is about real people, it is a part of the history of America.

I have been pleased, and find that overall it is a good series to teach from. THE GOOD: Each chapter in New Interchange has a good variety of skills to learn and practice. Students are constantly engaged in reading, writing, listening, speaking, learning new vocabulary and practicing new grammar rules. The content isn't too heavy, and the book makes good use of color and white space so as not to overwhelm the student. I find that the structure of each chapter is constant and reliable so that the students become used to how things are done. The tapes and Teacher's Guide are invaluable! The workbook provides additional practice of concepts that the students have just learned in the student book. All of these resources combine to make it incredibly easy for me (as a teacher) to prepare and give good lessons. THE BAD: I have found that my students are often confused with the grammar exercises. What may seem like clear-cut explanations to a native English speaker obviously aren't that clear to the learners. I am also a little saddened by the fact that each chapter really doesn't go into great depth for any one skill or theme. Each skill is presented, learned and practiced in what sometimes feels like a rushed manner. I have also found it difficult to present an entire chapter in two one-and-a-half hour sessions, as the authors suggest. OVERALL: A good series with lots of skills practice. It is very useful for learners who want to study a variety of general English skills. Very nice for overworked teachers who don't have a lot of time to prepare lessons."},{"Title":"New Interchange Demo Cassette (New Interchange English for International Communication)","review":"The latest edition of &quot;Interchange&quot; is certainly an improvement on the original.

I'm brown.\\"The social construct of race is a concept ambiguous to many adults, and can be incomprehensible to young children, particularly those of color. Able to accurately identify the Crayola colors in their environment, African American youth are often bewildered when their own chestnut/walnut/pecan/ebony/beige/mahogany/red skin tones are universally referred to as \\"black\\". And in a society that typically assigns negative connotations to the word \\"black\\", racial identity becomes even more problematic.Call me Black Call me Beautiful addresses the question of racial identity through Richard, a young African American boy. As the story begins, Richard is portrayed as a happy child with a multiethnic array of peers, both on the soccer field and in the classroom. When Richard's demeanor turns sullen, his concerned mother prods her son for an explanation. It is then that Richard reveals that a white friend, Max, has called him \\"black\\", a label perplexing to Richard as he stares at his hands and arms, which are clearly brown to him.In simple yet poignant terms, Richard's mother first affirms her son's observations: \\"You are my caramel brown baby, Daddy is smooth, dark chocolate brown, and I am honey brown.\\" She then explains that \\"black\\" and \\"white\\" are merely terms to describe groups of people. The story's themes of self love and appreciation for others resound in the mother's advice to Richard: \\"So the next time Max calls you black, smile at him with joy. Explain to him that despite your different skin colors, you are both absolutely beautiful!\\"Central to the story are Jennifer C. Kindert's bold and colorful watercolor illustrations. The characters' skin tones and facial and body features capture the wide array physical characteristics within the African American family. Also captured visually is the ambiguity of race. Indeed, white Max's beige skin tone and facial features closely resemble those of Richard's black great-grandmother, Dorothy. Detailed and synchronized to the plot, the illustrations compliment the text both nicely and appropriately.Children of all ages will benefit from this book, as will parents, teachers, and librarians. The straightforward and conversational writing style allows for easy understanding by all readers. Call Me Black Call Me Beautiful fills a much-needed place in multicultural children's literature. Dr. Henderson translates potentially difficult concepts in a style that is simple and joyful."},{"Title":"Call Me Black Call Me Beautiful","review":"I can attest (both professionally and personally) to the many obstacles parents of color face in raising healthy children.

Years before even hearing about this book I met the woman of my dreams. The issue was not finding the woman of my dreams, but having the chance to date her. This woman went away faster than she arrived and I never dated her.Ironically, I first heard of this book while reading a Men's Health magazine. Like many men out there, I thought improving my physique would be the answer to attracting and dating beautiful women. Deep down i knew something was missing though. Despite creating a great physique for myself, women did not approach me and i certainly did not risk approaching them. Also, I saw some of the scrawniest men dating beautiful women!I decided to stop spinning my wheels and buy the book finally. It taught me that physique was only a small piece of the pie. A great physique is only a symptom of self improvement, a principle that this book places great emphasis on. In fact, I've learned that attracting beautiful women is a symptom of being your best self.I am now dating the woman of my dreams I mentioned before and have been for 9 months. This book not only teaches men how to grow some stones and approach women with amazing confidence, it teaches men how to continuously improve themselves, sustain a loving relationship and just have fun with it.Thanks for all the priceless knowledge and encouragement to take action, Corey Wayne! Thank you for teaching me that it is my birthright to be truly in love with the woman of my dreams."},{"Title":"How to Be a 3% Man, Winning the Heart of the Woman of Your Dreams","review":"3% Man? No really! The title should be more along the lines of, \\"How to be a nice guy so women think you might be gay\\". This book teaches you how to be just like all the other guys who don't get laid and have no clue about women.Corey tells you to take her to dinner (a nice place), pay for the dinner, open her car door, hold her hand (but only if you get just the right signals). If you're funny, enough of a gentleman and get all the right signals you can go for the goodnight kiss on the doorstep. IF (and it's a BIG \\"if\\") she kisses you back then leave her there and call her three days later. It's absolutely laughable! You just spent $200 on this stranger and maybe you get a kiss? Um, no thanks. He forgot to tell us about the guy she was texting all during dinner, who's coming over to have sex with her when you leave. How about teaching us how to be THAT guy?There's nothing about creating chemistry or sexual tension with women, you know, the stuff that actually makes man-woman interactions fun and exciting. Just be a gentleman and magically, possibly, (but not likely) she'll want to kiss you.Corey tells us the story of a slutty girl at a wedding who gets drunk on wine, invites him back to the hot tub, gives him every sexual sign imaginable, but he \\"plays it cool\\" and never even kisses her! Get a clue man! Seriously, what's the point? Actually there's a bunch of stories of desperate women throwing themselves at Corey and he seems to have no clue its happening. He just stays \\"confident\\" and \\"centered\\" and ends up nowhere.This book is a lesson in \\"nice guy\\" frustration and it's not worth the 99 cents he's charging.BTW, I gave it the 2nd star just because it made me laugh."},{"Title":"How to Be a 3% Man, Winning the Heart of the Woman of Your Dreams","review":"I found an advertisement of this book in one of my fitness magazines and I was intrigued. I read every word of it in the magazine and I just knew I had to get it. Like Corey Wayne (the author), I felt frustrated and helpless in my dating life as well. I was a 21 year old student who hadn't had a girlfriend since I was 16! I knew a lot of girls, but none of them wanted anything but a friendship from me. The only girls I could seem to get were girls I had no interest in. I had practically given up all hope when this epiphany came! Over time I developed the confidence to talk to women, relate to them, and pass their tests! I soon had beautiful women calling me and texting me left and right. I also found the power within myself to become more masculine and now women are more attracted to me than ever! I recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve their dating life!"},{"Title":"How to Be a 3% Man, Winning the Heart of the Woman of Your Dreams","review":"I got this book recentlty, and It has been lightbulbs flashing every since. All of the advise in this book makes since...and looking back, I can see everywhere I have been going wrong.The \\"3% Man\\" in the title means that only 3% of men truly know women. The basic theme of the book is teaching how women are attracted to masuline men, who are centered, not waivering, not appeasing and willing to walk away. The old saying \\"distance makes the heart grow fonder\\"...is true, when used correctly. This book spells it out, and once you read it, you cannot refute it. It will be lightbulbs in your head to!This book has already changed my life with my confidence I have now because now I know all about a womans tests, and I know exactly what to say. I did disagree with some of the things that the author says to women...but I realize how I can replace his personality with mine, and get the same results. See, it is not a bunch of lines to memorize...it is simply understanding a females mind and tactics...and KNOWING what to do in every situation.This book is not so raunchy like some other dating books. Plus...I am a Christian, and I realize that everybody has there own levels of morality in dating. So using common since, you can use these techniques...and still maintain exacly your comfortable level of morality that is best for you. For example, the author seems to be pretty casual about divorce, and for me...divorce is not even an option.As they say...knowledge is power. This is the real deal. You can check out samples of the book at: www.understandingrelationships.comThese samples are what I had confidence in to buy this book. It is worth every penny for me. I love to help other, and I hope this will help you.btw:\\"If thou shalt confess with thy tounge, Jesus is Lord, and if thou shalt belive in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.\\" Romans 10:9"},{"Title":"How to Be a 3% Man, Winning the Heart of the Woman of Your Dreams","review":"This book is in no way ground breaking. It is definitely not worth the amount being charged for it. Most of the information found in it is the same message or principals that can be found online for free, by subscribing to newsletters. The only difference is that the author puts his own experiences into the messages.For me the worst part of the book is the authors inability to maintain a relationship. Yeah he may be dating the women of his dreams, or so he claims, but he has no ability to ever maintain the relationship with them. He always seems to blame them for the reason that the relationship would not work.If you want to be a player and just hook up with women they that is what this book will do for you. If you want to have a long serious committed relationship with a women then look elsewhere. If the author can not even maintain a relationship, they how does he expect to write a book about it. What point is there to finding the women of your dreams if you do not maintain a healthy long last relationship with her?The author has been divorced and has not long lasting committed relationships. \\"How to be a 3% man.\\" Hardly!!! \\"How to be a 100% player\\" is a better fit."},{"Title":"How to Be a 3% Man, Winning the Heart of the Woman of Your Dreams","review":"Being a student, and advocate of \\"the Dating Game/seduction/pick up community\\", let me say thatwhile initially i saw some overlap of some of the material taughtby David D. and others, Corey has done his homework, and isdelivering a good value to men.

I think to get everything outof it, you will have to reread it a couple of times, but if you'rea guy who has no game, even though the price is a bit steep, (in reality it's essentially an ebook in print)(i.e. average price of a dating ebook is $39.99) it is spot on, and you will get your money's worth!"},{"Title":"How to Be a 3% Man, Winning the Heart of the Woman of Your Dreams","review":"It is one of the best informative books I have read and will help help any guy with is relationships.

Though I just finished this book, my newfound confidence in interacting with women will make finding that woman much easier. I was at a friend's house last night and was listening to a couple of girls relationship problems and I could pick out where the problems arose and seen their thought process play out exactly like Corey says it does in the book. That's when it hit me that this book is for real. Thank you Corey, you changed my life."},{"Title":"How to Be a 3% Man, Winning the Heart of the Woman of Your Dreams","review":"This book echoes much of the other advanced materials out there, but puts it into a straight forward logical way for men to understand. The greatest thing I learned from this book is how to stand up for yourself as a man in relation to a woman. There are not many tools in our arsenal as men to put women in their place, but it must be done. My experience showed me that there was really only one way to put women in their place, and its the one thing all us men are too scared to do if we love our significant other. And that is to give them no mind, go on with your life, continue to have fun with other people until she decides to chase you (if ever). If she doesn't chase you, then she has a low interest level in you and you should move on. Don't take it all so seriously, let her reciprocate if she wants to.The reason why we all make so much mistakes with women is because we think we are supposed to game her into loving us. Rather we are supposed to give her the opportunity to game us. We are the prize not them. Women are a burden and they want to show us why they deserve us to take care of them and bang them hard and only them."},{"Title":"How to Be a 3% Man, Winning the Heart of the Woman of Your Dreams","review":"I read this book online in one sitting - it was more than 200 pages but I read quickly. I can't thank Corey enough for writing this book. He makes it abundantly clear how showing too much enthusiasm too soon can give off the wrong impression with a woman, and often, this impression can be fatal in a new relationship. Corey gives excellent advice on not calling too soon, talking for too long, calling too often, and even weekday dates until the woman has proven sufficient value for weekend dates. I think he's a genius. This looks like playing games, but going after what you want (a great woman) does require a plan, and there are customs and rituals that need to be observed. Excessive interest and availability turns a woman off - it does not help to surround your love interest with attention - if you do that to a cat, it will run away. If you let the cat visit when it likes, it will surely come back. This really was a fantastic book. I'm done chasing after women. We all need to remember our own value and dignity, and what WE, as men, bring to the table. Corey, I wish I had read this book many years ago - I would have done things differently. My advice? READ THE BOOK. If you don't throw yourself at a woman, but simply let her know of your interest (once or maybe twice), she will respond and pursue you, IF she is interested. A woman knows how to let you know. Therefore, there is no need to pursue madly the object of your affections - this backfires, every time. Instead, step back, be patient, invest very little at the start, and see if it is reciprocated. Corey, thanks again for this amazing book. Your website is also awesome, as are the regular tips you give and even the email dialogues you post there. You're really helping us!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"How to Be a 3% Man, Winning the Heart of the Woman of Your Dreams","review":"Are you a single or married guy, trying to figure out how to deal with your girlfriends'/wives' mood swings?

Bichu is just an ordinary jaguar making her way around the jungles of South America. On her travels she stumbles into a lot of trouble. Three white skin men are out hunting and end up shooting Bichu in the side. Bichu escapes them but runs into Urubelava a native hunter and also his daughter. For a long time Bichu is constantly ducking and hiding from Urubelava. But in the end the wounded jaguar makes a final move onto the green hill with red bushes and yellow banana trees. She has finally reached her home.Alan Caillou was the adventurous author of Bichu The Jaguar. Caillou used to work with the British Intelligence Corps. He would go in and out of North African territory bringing special information to the allies. He was captured by the Italians and escaped before they could execute him. He became a safari guide after the war. Later he came to America and started to write novels. This amazing man was not just an author but also an actor and he played character roles from movies from the \`60s all the way to the mid \`80s.I really enjoyed Bichu The Jaguar. It was more exiting than most books I've read. The main reason I like this book is because the characters are always moving, there was always something new about to happen. I also like this story because it can be quite humorous in some parts. This is by far one of the best novels I've read. I would call it a 7 on a scale of 1 to 10. This author obviously knew a lot about animals.I think other people should read this book because it tells you a lot about an animal's life. It can also tell you what a native South American's life is like. This is one story you'll never get bored of and want to read again and again and again. This novel is great to read because it is so well written and hardly anybody knows about it. When I first looked at this book's cover it didn't seem very interesting to me. I thought it was just about a jaguar.

Just incredibly vivid writing bringing to life a story of primal pain and drama, and in the process bringing you into the heads of two charactors, Bichu and Urebelava, who are utterly unlike you, and who you'll probably never forget.I know that because I didn't. I first read this story when I was 11. Some scenes in it, as well as the basic plot, went straight into the stock of symbols in my personal subconscious. That is of course rare enough, but for a book that a child can relate to, to stand up to rereading by an adult without seeming shallow and limited, is virtually unheard of. Tolkien's LOTR is the only other novel I have ever experienced that pulled off this feat.If anything I've said about this book resonates with you, then do yourself a favor and get a hold of a copy."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic to King James's Court: Discussion/Study Guide","review":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James' Court is an informative, beneficial, and interesting book to read. The plot is based around a 17 year old, Catholic boy named Michael. After the death of his father, he, his mother, and siblings get away from Philadelphia to spend a summer at a relative's house in rural Kentucky. There Michael is faced with many challenges concerning his Catholic faith and beliefs. He becomes involved in many heated biblical debates with local fundamentalist. I found that these debates made the book exciting and it kept me hooked in. Through many instances in the novel, I gained greater knowledge on why Catholics believe in what they do, and on the biblical information to support those beliefs. That made the book very unique. If you are a person questioning the Church's teachings and beliefs, then this novel is a must read."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic to King James's Court: Discussion/Study Guide","review":"Martin Deporres Kennedy has a fine gift for storytelling. He pulls you into the story. I read this through in one sitting. The story is a vehicle for introducing theological ideas, often through debates between characters. These debates are very realistic, and may reflect actual arguments that the author haard or participated in. I would strongly recommend this for students. It would be a wonderful thing for Catholic high school religion teachers to assign their class."},{"Title":"A Philadelphia Catholic to King James's Court: Discussion/Study Guide","review":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James' Court was an interesting book. Not being Catholic, I saw the book in a different light. The book was a bit boring in the beginning speaking of farms and churches in the country. But it grew from a few differences to a spiritual battle between Les' Church and Michael. The debates towards the end were heated and very valid points presented Michael. However, the antagonists and their opinions were portrayed as ignorant and represented no true Christian views.The book was over all offensive and exemplified the ignorance of the author toward other faiths that aren't Roman Catholic. It gave the reader a disorganized look into the Protestant Religion as a whole, though the author only speaks of Fundamentalists. It seemed vague, unfactual at times, and misrepresented the intended target of the book, Protestants. We do not need books like this that divide our faith but literature to unite us, excluding differences. The legacy of Pope John Paul II actually defies the intentions of this book. His life and death were a testimony to God's calling, to unite Christianity. I truly admire the Catholic faith, but this book seeks to demonize my faith in which I can not appreciate. I wasn't very fond of this book, but it was interesting though I wouldn't recommend it."},{"Title":"The Celts Ancient Peoples and Places","review":"I will start by saying that this was the first book I have read on the Celtic people, so I can't speak to Powell's accuracy. What I can say is that this book has two major flaws; one, a lack of maps; and two, a complete absence of information on Celtic women's lives.As far as the maps go, I realize that this book was more than likely written for a British/European audience. So it is understandable that Powell throws around place-names, regions, and rivers without any indication of where these localities are in present-day Europe--because his intended audience probably knew exactly where, say, the Rhine is. And it's no secret that American education is woeful. But as an American I was completely lost in the muddle of European place-names, and there are far, far too many mentioned in this book to put it down every time one pops up and google these places. As a result, for most of the book I had no clue as to the geographical location of the places mentioned. The addition of maps would have remedied this completely. While I can blame myself for not knowing the locations, if you are a dumb American like me, be prepared to buy an atlas alongside this book.The other drawback, as I said, was the utter lack of information about women's lives. He spends a great amount of time detailing warriors--their habits and clothing--but not a word is written about Celtic women. About family life he only mentions the fosterage system, and about the details of daily living there is nothing. Not even when he describes the dress of the average Celt does he think to mention what women wore! I realize that when he wrote this book, women were not of concern to historians and archaeologists, and so he cannot entirely be faulted, but because times have changed, a better book should be available (and I will find it!).The only real plus of this book is that he mentions the triple aspect of Celtic deities, and he does at least mention the Morrigan, as well as Epona. But that information takes up maybe two or three pages in the entire book, and so I must conclude by saying that I am sure there are far better, more balanced books on the Celts available. Don't bother with this one."},{"Title":"A Mathematical Theory of Hints: An Approach to the Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence (Lecture Notes in Economics and Mathematical Systems)","review":"This is one of the best books ever written in the field of AI.

I was too young to see Babe Ruth but read about the greatest baseball legend. I wanted to learn more so I bought Babe The Legend Comes to Life.Robert W. Creamer wrote a great book. Its 443 pages of interesting reading with no boring parts. Great B/W pictures too. I read the page burner in 3 days and had difficulty putting it down. The book reads smooth and the reader is given thousands of interesting baseball facts about George Herman Ruth growing up, his family and being put in a boys reform school at a young age for many years. With the help of one of the catholic brothers young teenager Ruth is disciplined, given an education, a small part time job and being allowed to play in sports especially baseball.We see his natural ability as a pitcher, and the beginning of becoming a power hitter. Eventually we see him spotted as a player and getting a contract to the minor league. He does great as a pitcher and some hitting. The Red Sox give him a small contract and he is in MLB. May still do not know Babe Ruth was a great pitcher, who if would of stayed a pitcher would of eventually been a HOF pitcher.However we see Ruth hitting monstrous deep home runs. Many are amazed at the distance and frequency. The Red Sox had money flow problems and would not offer Ruth a fair contract so they sold him to the Yankees.We see his partying life style, drinking, huge eating and having sex with many women. He marries a young 16 year old women but is unfaithful to her. We see him not listening to his managers, missing curfew, etc. and getting numerous fines and suspensions. His first wife died in a fire after being separated from the Babe for about 3 years. He remarries but still is not faithful to his second wife.The reader is shown Babe never really grew up and consistently disliked someone telling him what to do and controlling him. This may have been partially because of his locked up, imprisonment at the reform school. He got out and went crazy grabbing life with two hands and doing as much as he could when he could. The Babe is shown not deliberately wanting to hurt people but he would do what he wanted and got many people offended by his larger than life lifestyle. The reader is shown Babes kindness especially to children, spending hours signing autographs, playing games with kids and his family and going to hospitals to see sick people and cheer them up. We do see his kind side.We see him hitting 714 home runs the home run king till hammering Hank Arron broke his record and Roger Maris broke his 60 home run single season record. What is remarkable is Ruth played much of his baseball years in the dead ball years and a few times hit more home runs than entire teams did. He had a great average, slugging percentage,rbi, etc. MVP,led baseball in many statistics year after year, playing in many World Series and the first group elected in the Hall of Fame! You name it,the Babe did it!( Except manage in MLB...he desperately wanted that).Because of his crazy almost inhuman off field antics and high cost no one wanted to let him manage. The Boston Braves did a crappy deal with him as an assistant manager/player. The owner really put the screws to him for the gate (money). The Babe quits.We see his physical collapse with cancer. The book has a sad, sad ending of Ruth suffering in super pain and using morphine and other drugs to combat the pain.What a great player. I don't approve of his off field lifestyle but in a way I can understand his grabbing life with both hands after being stuck in a reform school for so many years. INMO The greatest ball player of all time because of his tremendous offensive power and his early great pitching ability. INMO no one comes close to the complete ball player (offensive player with so many records and super great stats and earlier a super great pitcher). The baseball player/steroid users of today INMO don't even count in the stat records.Babe The Legend Comes to Life a great baseball book and a great read for anyone wanting to learn about a man who lived life in high gear on and off the field. 5 stars"},{"Title":"Babe The Legend Comes To Life","review":"A good read, better than many biographies. The story is a must for all true baseball fans. Babe's achievements are even more impressive viewed after the drug enhanced records have been exploded."},{"Title":"Babe The Legend Comes To Life","review":"This book is so good it's pure evil! It's every baseball player and fans dream, because Creamer goes the extra distance to help determine what makes the Babe, the Babe. I love the preface of the book as Creamer points out that if you are a casual reader you may skip some pages, but if you are a serious baseball fan it is a must to read every page! Point well-taken. I titled this also because, it is not very well known that the Babe's longest homer possibly was his last, the 714th, when he was on his supposed last legs when he was traded to the Boston Braves. Everything about the Babe is so unreal when compared to the modern baseball player as Creamer points out in upbringing to new found wealth and how he built the game from his bat to his personality that was incurred by this new found life he could have with money. Babe Ruth is probably the best entertainer in American History, and anyone would do themselves a favor to get inside Creamer and inside the Babe's mind to figure out why."},{"Title":"Babe The Legend Comes To Life","review":"One of the best baseball legend biographies I've read. It moved quickly, but thoroughly...a very enjoyable read. Although the term \\"page-turner\\" is clich&eacute;, that's what this is."},{"Title":"Babe The Legend Comes To Life","review":"Although I suspect that most people who will read this book already know how BIG Babe Ruth really was to Americans, I wish those who do NOT realize his profound inlfluence on modern culture would take the time to check this out.Creamer has fashioned an extraordinarily readable, concise yet fully detailed biography of this great ball player. There is enough journalism here to satisfy those seeking accuracy, enough analysis for those interested in perspective, and enough elegant writing to please pretty much everybody else.Beginning at the beginning, and ending, abruptly, at the end, Ruth's life is presented within a vivid portrayal of early 20th century America. His tenacity, exuberance, lust for life is all here, including many unflattering incidents. Warts and all.If I had to single out the best things about this book, I'd have to start with how Creamer places Ruth's achievements into context. Staggering and astonishing are the two words I keep coming up with. Winning the Home Run Crown is one thing. Winning it over and over again for nearly two decades is another. Setting a home run record is one thing. Doubling the record is entirely another thing.It took forty years for Maris to break Ruth's record by one. When Ruth broke the record the first time, in 1919, he broke the old record by three or four, hitting 29. The next year, 1920, he hit 54. He averaged 40 a year for SEVENTEEN years.Before Babe, the all-time home run king hit 136 homers. Ruth passed that in his first few seasons as a full-time (non-pitching) player. Every homer he hit after that extended it...when he hit 700, only 2 other players were in the 300's.And don't get me started on his pitching. Wait till you read about how good he was. I had always known he was a pretty good pitcher...I didn't know he was THIS good.The name Babe Ruth is synonymous with \\"legend\\", and there are hundreds of legendary tales surrounding his exploits. Creamer sorts of fact from fiction, and most of time, the fact is the legend.For example, the \\"called shot\\" may or may not have happened. The events that we are certain that occurred during that game are still amazing.Plus, I prefer to believe that he hit a ball so hard that it went between a pitcher's legs AND over the center fielder's head. I just love that mental image.There is a lot of sadness in Ruth's life, from his relative abandonment as a child, to his inability to become a big league manager, to his vitality-robbing cancer...his life had ups and downs like only true epic characters can have.The book also gets Ruth's media domination right. At least it feels right. I wasn't there. Most of us weren't. But baseball was the only entertainment for the majority of the country, along with those relatively recent upstarts, radio and film...there is nothing today that really compares. There is really no one person whose personality captivated a country like his did.And it sounds like he loved every second of it.After reading this book, I would give anything to see Babe Ruth play just once..."},{"Title":"Babe The Legend Comes To Life","review":"An engrossing, informative biography of baseball's greatest player. Some biographers make the mistake of rattling off facts and statistics, as if to impress you with how much research they've done. Creamer wisely focuses on the story, including descriptions of important games that make you feel like you're on the field with the Babe. Comments by Ruth's contemporaries add to the realism. &quot;Babe&quot; gets off to a slow start--a chapter dealing with Creamer's feelings about writing the book, and more details about Ruth's childhood than you probably want to know. But once Ruth starts playing baseball, the book grabs you and won't let go. One caveat: the discussion of Ruth's womanizing, while necessary and not extensive, makes this book inappropriate for young readers. If you like baseball and want to learn more about Babe Ruth, this is the book to get."},{"Title":"Babe The Legend Comes To Life","review":"Of the 200+ baseball books I've read, &quot;Babe: The Legend Comes to Life&quot; is my favorite. Creamer wrote the book while some of the old-timers were still alive, and this makes his story come to life. If you want to learn about Babe Ruth, this is the definitive book to read."},{"Title":"Babe The Legend Comes To Life","review":"Originally published in 1974, Creamer's book was the first \\"serious\\" biography of Ruth and remains the standard work on the subject. The first few chapters are a bit slow as the author painstakingly chips away at decades of apocrypha and rumor to reconcile the many conflicting accounts of the Babe's youth. The pace picks up once Ruth reaches the big leagues and really takes off after he's sold to the Yankees. Creamer is frank about the Babe's ravenous appetites and the effect these had on those around him, notably his first wife. Ultimately, Ruth comes off as a jovial, well-meaning but rather selfish man who was fun to be around but not someone you'd want to depend on.This Kindle edition has a hyperlinked table of contents and index but contains no photographs save the cover."},{"Title":"Babe The Legend Comes To Life","review":"This a great book for baseball fans . sportslovers of all kinds and anyone interested in American history in the 20th century. Babe Ruth the icon is made human again for all of us who missed him when he played the game. The first sports celebrity in a nation that has gone on to become obsessed with celebrity and sports heroes. Babe paved the way in an era that saw tremendous change in American life. He is portrayed here &quot; warts and all&quot; and emerges as a warm hearted man with a huge appetite for living who was clearly in the right place at the right time.This is one of the finest sports biographies I've read."},{"Title":"Babe The Legend Comes To Life","review":"This superb biography by Robert Creamer describes the life of Babe Ruth (1895-1948) from early boyhood on through to his untimely death from cancer. As the author shows, George Herman Ruth was the rowdy son of a Baltimore saloon-keeper, a young man that spent years in reform school. Gifted with incredible baseball talent, the Babe joined the Red Sox in 1914 and was soon the top left-handed pitcher in the American League. As the author shows, Ruth's prodigious batting eventually led him from the mound to everyday status as an outfielder. After Boston's owner foolishly dealt him to the Yankees prior to the 1920 season, Ruth exploded onto the scene in the nation's largest city by hitting 54 homers - more than any other team in the league. Creamer shows us how media attention, radio, movies, and Ruth's love of the spotlight helped to make him into a national icon. The author also spares little in showing the Babe's flaws; his rowdy volatility and his self-indulgent night life and skirt chasing. But we also see how the Babe loved kids and could be very warm and engaging.Readers might also enjoy Creamer's biography on Casey Stengel and his narrative of baseball in 1941 (BASEBALL AND OTHER MATTERS). This is an excellent biography by a talented writer."},{"Title":"Babe The Legend Comes To Life","review":"the book starts out saying that some people may find some things in it boring , and that you could skip those parts , so i immediatly thought &quot; this must be a bad book &quot; . this book is written very good , and doesent miss anything , it includes every detail of his life , his feelings and his quotes . after you start reading this book , you wont want to put it down . all the information is well put and very informative about life back in the early 1920's and before . it goes from when he was in a boarding school to his life as a yankee. great book!"},{"Title":"Babe The Legend Comes To Life","review":"Legends transcend time. The Stories get better, the adjectives get bolder, until they become pass&eacute;. Ruth was the only athlete who was already at legend at age 21. There was no reason to exaggerate, and no words to describe his ferocious dominance. And the timing of his nuclear assault on history couldn't have been better planned. Fresh from the Black Sox crisis of 1919, America's greatest sport teetered on extinction. To this day, this baby faced Neanderthal had more athletic dominance over his peers than anyone in history...and more charisma than ten W.C. Fields. He changed the sport. Some say he changed the world.Home Runs were non-existent before him. Baseball runs were earned one base at a time; singles...sacrifice bunts...a sport of hard drinking pitchers, and gritty base stealers led by Cobb. After Ruth arrived, the physical dimensions had to be rearranged just to accommodate his abilities. Mammoth stadiums were built with double the capacity, replete with awe inspiring 450+ ft fences. All because of Ruth. But the parks were no match for him. He was the all-time home run champion at age 25, HR champ 13 times in 15 years, and in his 17 years as a hitter, he hit 235 home runs 450 ft. or further. By comparision, Bonds was HR champ just twice, and hit just 3, count em, 3 450ft HRs his first 15 seasons pre-roids.I've just read the new Ruth book out called The Big Bam, but afficionado's like me still choose Beamer's documentary as the voice of record. Unlike the rest, he best captures Ruth's massive power and abilities, childhood innocence, great sense of humor and rebelliousness, and rock star image. Ruth was the real deal. He was a true legend in his own time, and wore the badge humbly on his sleeve. He lit up every room he entered, and lit up every pitcher he faced. This book is a classic, like the man himself."},{"Title":"Babe The Legend Comes To Life","review":"This is a comprehensive book on our favorite early 20th century player from Baltimore. 50 years after his death he remains possibly the greatest, and no doubt the most famous, player to have ever entered the major leagues.This book can best be described as warts and all. It starts with his rough childhood in an orphanage - which was basically a reform school - and how the Babe just excelled and became a natural player and hitter. It goes on and chronicles his rowdy life on and off the field, his indulgences and his mishaps until his premature death. He was not a man of moderation or a person that was able to pace his life. He was the opposite of say the current but now retired \\" Iron Man\\" Cal Ripken also from near Baltimore but a person famous for moderation. \\"The Babe\\"would often show up with a hangover and little sleep for a game. Then he would stuff himself with hotdogs during a game and still knock the ball out of the park.He was a fascinating person, bigger than life, and every baseball fan must buy or borrow and read this book."},{"Title":"Babe The Legend Comes To Life","review":"Author Robert Creamer has created one of the finest George Herman \\"Babe\\" Ruth biographies. This book incorporates a plurality of fascinatingly engrossing details about the baseball career and non-baseball activities of Babe Ruth.This portrait describes Babe evolving from his tumultuous life in Baltimore as the delinquent son of a saloonkeeper into whom many people consider as the greatest baseball hitter and baseball player of all time.Robert Creamer gives the reader an exceptionally in-depth description of Babe Ruth's life activities, attitudes and habits before the beginning of his major league baseball career. Creamer even mentions a few facts about Babe's minor league baseball playing roommate Rodger Pippen who roomed with Ruth during their 1914 International League season. Although not germane to the Babe's career I do wish that Creamer had given a very brief history about Rodger Pippen's history and his later-to-be significance to Baltimore. Pippen's International League statistics for that 1914 season were omitted. After Pippen's baseball career he later became a notable sports editor for the \\"Baltimore News-Post\\". Rodger Pippen was the primary individual who convinced Baltimore to create Memorial Stadium n the early 1950's. It is also believed that he may have been the first individual to create the phrase \\"Believe-It-Or-Not!\\". Rodger Pippen was a longtime friend of my great-grandfather Boston Fear's family. When Babe Ruth was dying from cancer he decided to make one last trip back to Baltimore to visit Rodger Pippen, other friends and family.Robert Creamer presents many detailed facets about Babe Ruth's baseball career with the Boston Red Sox, the New York Yankees and the Boston Braves. It would have been a bit more of an improvement if Creamer had explored the Babe's epic making record breaking 1927 sixty home run season in more exquisitely minute detail. The biography could also have given the reader a more behind-the-scenes explanation of the silent and talking movies the Babe played in. Also, Babe Ruth's life after his major league baseball career ( the retirement years ) and his off-season exhibition baseball performances could have gone into more depth. Perhaps some day a Ruthian baseball scholar will write a book comprising these oft-overlooked topics.Robert Creamer's book splendidly evokes an appreciation of how highly important Babe Ruth was to revolutionizing and popularizing baseball. This biography is most definitely one of the \\"must-read\\" books about Babe Ruth. Every baseball lover should possess a copy of this book on their home bookshelf.Babe Ruth may very well be the most famous American athlete of all time. No less an authority as baseball hall-of-famer Ted Williams called Babe Ruth \\"the greatest baseball hitter and baseball player of all time\\" and that \\"Babe Ruth was Bunyanesque ( like the mythological folk tale Paul Bunyan ) bigger than life\\".For a small state in geographical square mile area Maryland certainly has produced an unusual statistically high proportion of Baseball Hall of Fame players ( e.g. Babe Ruth, Jimmy Foxx, John Franklin \\"Home Run\\" Baker, Judy Johnson, Robert Moses \\"Lefty\\" Grove, Al Kaline ) or potential-to-be Baseball Hall of Fame inductees ( e.g. Cal Ripken, Jr., Harold Baines, Bill \\"Swish\\" Nicholson ). However our state is very proud to state that we produced \\"The Sultan of Swat\\" , \\"The Bambino\\", \\"The Maharajah of Maul\\", etc. who is otherwise known as George Herman \\"Babe\\" Ruth! Even some of Babe Ruth's descendants today live around the Baltimore, Hagerstown and Salisbury cities of Maryland."},{"Title":"Babe The Legend Comes To Life","review":"Robert W. Creamer has captured the true essence of the player known as George Herman Ruth. Through quotes from players past you can actually sense the personality of Babe Ruth. The author makes you feel as if you are at home, in the locker room, on the field, or sharing the exploits of the Babe. America's greatest hero is brought to life within its pages, so much so, when the likes of a McGwire or Sosa hit a homerun today, you picture the Babe.

Some are excellent, others merely readable. This is the best of the bunch. Robert Creamer took a lifetime of experience in sports journalism and applied his story telling ability here. It flows. The story reads like a novel but the detail and factual support give the reader the sure knowledge that a great deal of research went into this book.Creamer was featured prominently in Ken Burns' film Baseball. Now I know why. He is an eloquent spokesman for the game.

I would have liked to have read more about his funeral and the aftermath of his death. Plus I would have liked to learn more about how his legacy was treated the years after his death.Nevertheless, this book is a great read and I highly recommend it to any baseball or sports fan."},{"Title":"Babe The Legend Comes To Life","review":"Detailed aspects of his life before and after baseball. Lived large and died young.Still holds record today for pitching and slugging. Baseball fans will like this and read about aspects of his life that are not well known. A good read."},{"Title":"Babe The Legend Comes To Life","review":"Before I readBabe: The Legend Comes to LifeI was already convinced by everyone I ever knew who saw him play, that no one, perhaps other than Ted Williams was even close to being his equal. Creamer created a work of art in this book. He takes us through the Babe's childhood, and after reading that, one has to wonder how George Herman Ruth turned out so well. However, once Creamer describes the Babe's career, personal life and incredible athletic ability, one begins to speculate what further heights he would have reached had he played today.Despite his incredible career, Ruth faced some personal difficulties which he buried in a sea of sexual encounters with women of various backgrounds, in his eating and drinking habits; he ate in huge waves of hot dogs, steaks, chops, ribs, desserts, and washed them all down with soda pop, beer and much stronger liquid refreshments. He slept very little and still out hit and out pitched any and everyone in the game for all time. And what the slanderers leveled against his clumsiness, were just that, slanders. Ruth was one of the finest outfielders in baseball and he could steal bases when younger and run bases intelligently with the best of them right up until a few years before his retirement. Moreover, his celebrated paunch, was all but eliminated between1924 and 1927, because of the diet and conditioning he began and his wife oversaw, and did not return until 1933, two years before his last game.His love for children, and his affection for the down and out, and for his pals was immeasurable. He was a wonderfully empathetic man, despite his practical jokes and and seeming reckless abandon at times.Creamer has put together such a work of genius, that I read it twice.There is one other set of factors not covered in the book which I want to present in the Babe's favor: In the Babe's era, the minimum height of the pitcher's mound was 15 inches, but many teams had it at 18 inches; today it is 10 inches. In Ruth's day the average center field fence was 450 feet from home plate today it is 405 feet a 45 foot difference and in the POLO GROUNDS, where the Yankees played before building Yankee Stadium the center field fence was 490 feet from home plate. The alley's were 30 to 40 feet deeper in the Babe's day than now and the baseball? The baseball differential between the liveliness then and the liveliness in the period from 1996-2006 was a joke, today's baseball is considerably livelier. Several computer studies by academics in consultation with physicians, have shown that Ruth would have nearly doubled his home run output in today' era. Many of the studies showed Ruth hitting anywhere from 950-1250 home runs had he started his career in 1988 and played to 2010.God gave us one Jesus, one Michael Angelo, one FDR and one Babe Ruth. Nothing more needs be said."},{"Title":"Babe The Legend Comes To Life","review":"I knew I'd have loved this book the second I read the title of the first chapter, (actually the second, but the first is more a methodological introduction): \\"The bad kid, Baltimore at the turn of the century\\". This is a true history book, a record of American history as the setting for the life of a grand charachter. The best thing is that Creamer doesn't indulge, doesn't condone: his account of Ruth is beautifully cold and unpassionate, and that's great because Ruth's persona was powerful enough to shine and impress by itself, without a biographer being apologethical about it. You can't say such a thing about many biographers, expecially about baseball oldtimers biographers. I like that Creamer hits hard when he has to and let Babe's accomplishments speak for themselves without being redundant. I already knew Babe Ruth was the best player of all time, and I already knew he was, in some ways, a SOB, but this book puts it all in perspective giving a beautifully rich picture of him, and of the times and places and people he knew. An absolute must for any people interested in baseball history."},{"Title":"Babe The Legend Comes To Life","review":"Babe: The Legend Comes to Life by Robert W.Creamer was a blockbuster when it was first published in the 1970s and is still, I think, the best sports biography of them all.Robert W. Creamer's book is an obvious labor of love and even now, 35 years after it was first issued, its impact can be felt on most every page.There can be no underestimating or underplaying the importance of Babe Ruth on modern American life and culture and with this biography, we finally have a book worthy of its subject.Ironically, it took Henry Aaron's heroic pursuit of the Babe's lifetime home run totals to rouse interest in publishing this adult oriented biography of The Bambino. As I recall, three titles came out in 1974 alone, and of course many more in the years following.But Robert W.

This may be about the best biography of its time. You can't do much better than Tom Parker if you take the audio route. I've read or listened to other works by Mr. Creamer & they are consistently good. That said he has alway seemed a bit to attached to the numbers. Baseball is the most satistical of sports & I do enjoy them. Ever year there is a new on that can be applied however unofficially to players of other eras such as the Babe. One of the newest ones now in vogue is the quality start.Six inningss minimum with three earned runs or less is a quality start. Having said that sometimes the numbers overwhelm the story. Stats on the Babe's minor league years will be forgotten about 2 seonds after you hear them. Mr Creamer endeavors to be accurate & may knock down some of the legends, or reduce them to believable proportions. The belly-ache heard round the world & The Babe hitting three home-runs in his last game are examples of the hype at the time. Creamer gets real & lifts, in the end his biography to a more adult level. I think Mr. Creamer dwells a bit more on Babe's other appetites, as well, such as women. His various ailments, injuries & suspensions have surprisingly depressed records that could have been even greater than they eventually were. Babe's juvenile behavior in his early years & the number of people in the baseball world that he irritated by his sometimes arrogant attitude through-out his career thwarted him in the thing he wanted most: to be a big league manager. That is sad & we'd have a lot more to talk about since he lived for another 10 years after he left baseball. He died relatively young but he was & still is (despite his numbers being slowlyeclipsed) the greatest. If you wanted a truthful biography this is is a pretty good one & its available in the audio version."},{"Title":"Babe The Legend Comes To Life","review":"The greatest name in baseball has to be George Herman \\"Babe\\" Ruth.

Creamer takes you beneath the surface and gets you into the real life and times of Babe Ruth, the greatest player ever. You will find how despite his shortcomings, Babe Ruth was a real, warm and genuine individual, with an absolute soft spot for children. Five stars, hands down!"},{"Title":"Babe The Legend Comes To Life","review":"I only have two images of Babe Ruth. The first is the slightly silly 1920's baseball videos where all the men run around in high-speed motion, and the whole thing looks somewhat comical. The second is of Babe Ruth at Yankee Stadium on his final visit, suffering from terminal cancer, taking the last waves of the fans while propping himself up with a bat. This book fills in a lot of the missing pieces---The Good Stuff* Babe lived a fascinating life. Starting out in a combination prison/orphanage, Babe never really had things easy. The book does a very credible job of relating the trials of Babe's youth, and his efforts to use baseball to lift himself out of a bad situation.* Creamer presents a fairly unvarnished look at Babe's life. The man could be uncouth, crass, borderline uncivilized, and yet generous, gentle and respectful. He could spend money like water, and while he was the highest paid player in the league by a considerable margin, would be broke by the time the next season started.* By the end of the book, I was very moved by Babe's story, and you almost can feel the tragic hero dying on the battlefield at the end of the last great battle.* One thing I had never realized was that Babe was an excellent athlete. I always had the caricature of an overweight player whose only real skill was whacking a ball over the fence. Turns out Babe was an excellent pitcher, a reasonable fielder, and was an order of magnitude better than any hitter of his day. The book does an excellent job of presenting those parts of Babe's life that seem lost to history.----The Not So Good Stuff*Once again the Kindle edition of a book sets new records for typos and misspellings.* There are no photos in the book.* Probably my biggest complaint is the book misses a whole dimension of Babe's personality. His feelings for his first wife are an amalgamation of conflicting emotions- starting with affection, love, and at times bordering on contempt and embarrassment. And yet we are never really given a glimpse of his personal feelings. Babe was a frequent visitor to various \\"dens of inequity\\", and never lacked for feminine company-while his wife sat home in Boston. Did it bother him? Did he care?* I would have loved to see a section comparing Ruth to today's players. What was the speed of the average fastball when Ruth played? Could Ruth hit today's pitching? Could Ruth pitch to today's hitters? I realize this is all highly speculative, but it would have been a fun chapter or appendix.----OverallI very much enjoyed the book, and it was a look at Babe Ruth that had always escaped me. The facts seems reasonably well researched, although Creamer was somewhat hampered by the effect of time on memory and the haphazard (by today's standards) record keeping of early Baseball.I think Creamer missed a chance to explore some other aspects of Ruth's life, but was probably hampered by his desire to focus on sports. Also, this book was written before today's \\"tell-all\\" style of journalism came into being.Any fan with more than a casual interest would appreciate the book."},{"Title":"Babe The Legend Comes To Life","review":"I first read Mr. Creamer's book on Babe Ruth when it was published in 1974. To me, it was one of the first modern biographies that I read, and I loved it. I have learned that many biographies published prior to the mid-1970's just don't read as easily as those since, and are not as \\"in-depth\\" as we now expect.This winter, I re-watched Ken Burns' \\"Baseball\\" for the sixth time, and enjoyed the comments from Mr. Creamer. I decided to buy his book once again. Unfortunately, I was slightly disappointed. Yes, it is still a fascinating story. However, at times, I found it slightly shallow in places. To be fair, this may be due to the times that I've heard Mr. Creamer tell the story on my DVD.

The author has done a commendable job of separating the facts from the fanciful fictions that have grown up surrounding George Herman Ruth. While his home run record has been surpassed, I still think one can argue that Ruth was the greatest baseball player when one considers that in addition to his hitting abilities Ruth was an outstanding pitcher.

But then on the other hand, how he was kind of like a big kid.The author I feel did an excellent job in writing this book from beginning to end. At some points he might not have the whole story for earlier years, but he did use newspapers, ect for play by play of some of the games.It is interesting to learn about how he interacted with other players and owners. It is kind of sad how his later years ended up and I believe more modern players are taken care of a little more in their later years.So much info in this book and well written. I learned a lot and highly recommend this book.Mike"},{"Title":"Babe The Legend Comes To Life","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It gave me a behind the scenes look at the greatest baseball player of all time. Not only did I enjoy the baseball stories, but I also found the stories about the unique personality of ths man very amusing."},{"Title":"Babe The Legend Comes To Life","review":"Some personalities are too big to be contained in a single book, especially one who exemplified bigness like Babe Ruth.Ruth was not much into analyzing the whys of his greatness. As retold in Robert Creamer's 1974 biography, when asked the secret of why he hit so many home runs, he replied: \\"Just swinging.\\" Asked about \\"the psychology of the home run\\" by the same reporter, Babe responded: \\"Say, are you kidding me?\\"Creamer seems to feel the same way. He's not the prose version of Jack Webb exactly, but his \\"Babe\\" is heavy on facts and remarkably light on the sort of thing modern sports writers like to fill their weighty tomes up with, cultural impact and inner-self profiling. Creamer presents teasing glimpses of Babe's revelries, and some hints of who he really was beneath the legend (one close friend says \\"I don't think he really loved anybody\\"). But his focus is on Babe the baseball player, his statistical brilliance and his awesome, game-breaking power.He broke into the majors as a pitcher, developing into \\"the best lefthander in the game\\" before it became clear, in this blessed time before the advent of the designated hitter, that he could do more to win games with his bat than his arm. What followed transformed baseball from a slightly noisier and faster version of cricket into the National Pastime. Babe Ruth didn't invent the home run, but he might as well have deserved the copyright, hitting 54 homers in 1920, more than any other entire team produced except for his Yankees, red-haired stepchildren to the fabled New York Giants until Babe arrived and changed everything.Even though his career home-run record was in the process of being broken when \\"Babe\\" was published, Ruth was about so much more than that. Creamer gets at a lot of the on-field stuff, especially, like the fact he once led the American League in batting average and, as a pitcher, produced the longest stretch of earned-run-free innings for more than 40 years.The book does come across as dry at points, though, focusing on Ruth's more measurable accomplishments and ignoring the less tangible stuff. Creamer doesn't overwhelm you with a lot of flowing prose, which is a good thing, but he leaves a lot of things alone that seem fertile ground for exploration. Possibly because the last bio I read was Robert Caro's \\"Path To Power,\\" it felt like Creamer was light on sourcing, but that's probably because his method of research was a lot less formal, chats at the bar with old-timers over the course of decades condensed into the iceberg we get here.What Creamer wrote, he got right, though, something I know as a fact. My grandfather covered the Yankees and was Babe's favorite ghostwriter, and my father, who saw Babe in the Yankee clubhouse, swore by Creamer as one of sportwriting's best for giving the honest, unvarnished truth. It's not a book for boys, as Creamer notes, but \\"Babe\\" will make you feel like one reading about this real-life giant who walked the earth."},{"Title":"Black Square & Compass: 200 years of Prince Hall Freemasonry","review":"I found this book to be packed with great information and recommend it to be added to any PHA library.

Her husband never recovered from the destruction of the World Trade center or the betrayal by a friend who sued him for something he never did. Unable to cope, he quit his job as a stockbroker and became a vegetable couch potato. Annie, a stockbroker at the same firm her spouse left, tries to make her income cover their bills as two salaries used to do while allowing her housekeeper to raise their two children.Her boss is coming on to Annie and she is ready to succumb to his charms. As she ponders an affair, her best friend's father accuses Annie of stealing bearer bonds from him and her housekeeper abruptly quits leaving behind two emotionally wrecked children in her wake. Annie realizes she must straighten out her own life, be strong for her daughters, and uncover what happened to the bonds while knowing she cannot truly aid her children or her husband until she helps herself.Leslie Glass displays her wry wit and cutting edge humor in a poignant family drama with a touch of mystery that hooks readers from beginning to end. The protagonist learns that she is strong because circumstances require her to be so; fortified with moral fiber and courage Annie takes charge of her life before she ends up in the same abyss as her husband. He is an intriguing character, her opposite for when the going got tough, he quit. Readers will appreciate this strong tale with a memorable cast who laugh on the outside, but cry on the inside.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"FOR LOVE AND MONEY: A Novel of Stocks and Robbers","review":"This book started out really well, and kept my attention throughout, however- Ms. Glass seems to have rushed the ending.

Protagonist Annie Custer is married, but unhappily so. Her best friend, Carol, is dealing not only with a neglectful husband but forgetful parents who stubbornly refuse to turn over their hoarded stock certificates to the safety of a brokerage account.Now Carol has secured her parents' reluctant agreement and begs Annie, a top-notch stockbroker, to travel to their home and pick up the certificates in person. It's a trip which Annie realizes will take her beyond the boundaries of the strictly ethical and possibly jeopardize her career. As if that weren't enough on her plate, Annie's husband is immobilized by trauma from September 11 plus the loss of his job. Her brilliant older daughter has succumbed to a depression so deep she refuses to start college, or even to get out of bed in the morning, while her younger daughter is probably curling up with a bong full of pot. Is it any wonder that Annie is consoling herself with visions of an afternoon romp with her good-looking boss, Brian?I checked this book out of my local library, where I found it shelved with mysteries and thrillers. There are mysteries to be solved: How have several hundred thousand dollars in bearer bonds gone missing? Is the death of one of the characters really due to natural causes? But the more engrossing questions are whether or not Annie will end up in bed with Brian, whether she will leave her husband and whether her family will fall apart completely when their steadfast housekeeper goes back to South America.The first two mysteries are not wholly solved -- in fact, it's left to the reader's interpretation as to whether or not a murder actually took place. But the dilemmas involving Annie's life are neatly resolved. I agree in part with another reader reviewer who feels that the climax seems rushed. I don't object to an ending that quickly wraps up loose ends per se -- I've been accused of ending novels abruptly myself. So what I find overly abrupt in Glass' ending is not the way the financial mystery is wrapped up but the quickness with which both husband and daughter emerge from their funks. Her husband and daughter both seem to be clinically depressed, a condition which doesn't usually clear up that fast.This is fiction, though, and deftly written and enjoyable fiction at that. I found the book an entertaining read. And I was delighted to discover another novel in the growing collection of \\"matron lit,\\" both because I'm a mature reader myself and because the protagonist of my latest novel -- probably ten years Annie's senior -- also consoles herself with an unexpected lover during a period of marital discord.That said, I'm glad I didn't pay the hardcover price for a book that can be devoured during the course of a few hours plane trip. I'd wait for the paperback edition."},{"Title":"Five Star Stories #4","review":"I have been purchasing Newtype for years, and have always wanted to read The Five Star Stories.

From Faythe to Ever Increasing Faith was an extremely realistic book to me as an African American Christian woman who is seeking to truly know God's purpose and plan in life because this is exactly what Faythe does throughout the book! Although Faythe has to continually remind herself of God's purpose and plan for her life, her strength and perseverance are a true testimony to her friends, family and even . . . the love of her life.Unlike other Christian books and movies that are currently available, this book is true to God's purpose and plan because it addresses our relationships with God on a personal but realistic level by showing how God is truly in control of every aspect of our lives. Faythe is successful in so many areas of her life because she allows God to be in total control. As a result, she lives the joyful life God intends for all of us.This well-written novel is an excellent gift for young, old, women, men and people of all cultures! I encourage everyone to purchase a book for themselves, several more to give to others (because you will want other people to read it) and look forward to more of God's work through Donna L.

It is written that if you have faith the size of a mustard seed (which by the way is pretty small in case you didn't know) that you could tell a mountain to move and it would. But no one has that much faith. Oh we come close, maybe an eighth of a seed, maybe a quarter, the most stalwart of us even a half, but never enough to say \\"Mountain, move!\\" and then watch it go. Moreover, while we may wish to walk the straight and narrow, it is not an easy path. We all have faults-it's what makes us human, it's what makes us real. And being real is one of the many things I liked about From Faythe to Ever Increasing Faith by first time author Donna L. Patton, and the character that has the title role in her novel, Faythe Alexander.Ms. Patton has created a young successful attractive African/American woman to be the star and strong role model in this highly compelling story, and with her, a world where people make mistakes, and learn. People grieve and go on, people love, and know heartache, yet love again. And people believe-they believe in a greater power; a God that is real, and alive, and helps them get through the struggles of existence, always there to guide and support. It is obvious from the way that Ms. Patton uses her gift of writing to minister, that she is a firm believer in the Lord, and walks with him on a constant basis.Don't get me wrong, this is not a book that preaches, but instead shares within the confines of a richly developed story one of love lost and found; of friendships renewed and reinterpreted, and the vastness and abounding love of a Savior for one of his creations, and the return of that love.Is it a romance novel you might ask? Well, yes, and it could easily fit on the shelves of any secular bookstore in the romance section; however, it is far more. Is it a Christian book? Well, again, it could go next to any book at a religious bookstore with pride, but to pigeonhole it into any narrow confine does an injustice to the writing skills that Ms. Patton displays.From Faythe to Ever Increasing Faith is a rare find; a book that ministers to the needs of the reader without hitting them over the head; yet never once compromising the message for the sake of the story. I would say that Ms. Patton should be proud of what she wrote, but I think her answer would be she didn't write it alone, she had help from someone \`higher up'. And I think she would be right.-Rick MohrSyndicated Book Reviewer"},{"Title":"From Faythe to Ever-Increasing Faith","review":"WARNING: Before you read this book, please insure that you have a warm fire burning in your fireplace, cup of coffee or cocoa at the side of your most comfortable easy chair, and that you are able to treat yourself to a quiet, uninterrupted afternoon, because this book is such that once you begin it you will not be able to put it down! Ms. Patton develops the characters and storylines of their lives in such a way, that you find yourself identifying with their struggles, fears, and triumps and you feel like she is writing about your life or someone who you know. I really loved the ending of the book which I hope Ms. Patton will pick up the ending and write the sequel that follows the lives of all the characters. The moral of the story is how the character Faythe used her friendship and her personal convictions to minister the unconditonal love of Christ to her friends. She did not walk in judgment of others, but looked in the mirror of her own life, judging her own mistakes, and made decisions that put her faith in action that moved her to new levels of faith and phenomenal blessings. She was able to draw people to the Lord by her own example and this I believe is the most effective way we all need to minister to others about the salvation of the Lord! I strongly recommend Ms. Patton's debut book and like me you will eagerly await her sequels and future novels."},{"Title":"From Faythe to Ever-Increasing Faith","review":"This book is truly a page-turner!

Then out of fear, she seized on a coincidence to accuse him of professional impropriety, effectively restoring the distance between them. Part of her still wants to let him close, but a stronger part finds the idea repellant, lest she wind up like her mother. Now a case forces them to work together, and AJ finds her defenses crumbling every time Dare is near. Indeed, the way Dare slips past her defenses is more dangerous than any criminal AJ has ever prosecuted.One of the city's most respected journalists and winner of two Pulitzer prizes, Dare has doggedly followed a path of corruption for years that now leads to working with AJ. He can never seem to forget the two intoxicating nights they shared, or stop baiting her into a response, even if it's negative. AJ needs his knowledge of Chicago's criminal underbelly. He needs to find a way to get close to her and win her trust.The second part of the Charmed and Dangerous miniseries, HARD TO RESIST follows HARD TO HANDLE with a powerful storyline and extraordinary characterizations. The unifying conflict of the series gains momentum, yet HARD TO RISIST could also be read as a standalone. AJ's complex family relationships and contradictory feelings add sympathy, while Dare's own family story provides powerful motivation. The past paced plot keeps the pages turning. Add this series to your keeper shelf, and watch for the concluding installation, HARD TO TAME. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Surrender Dorothy","review":"As a fan of Meg Wolitzer, having loved her other works, I looked forward eagerly to SURRENDER,DOROTHY. Regretfully, I was disappointed. The book takes place over a period of one month, August, as a group of thirty-year-old friends gathers for their annual time in the Hamptons. Although Sara is a doctoral candidate in Japanese history at Columbia, Adam a playwright, Maddy a lawyer, Maddy's husband Peter a teacher, they continue to rent the same filthy run-down hovel they've been renting for years. (Dorm life dies hard.) Horribly, Sara dies in a car accident as she and Adam are on the way to buy ice cream. The rest of the book and the month are attempts by the friends and Natalie, the dead woman's mother, (who inexplicably arrives to spend the time almost in her daughter's place) to come to grips with and cope with the tragedy. That this woman, who refused to allow these friends of many years' standing to attend her daughter's funeral, now feels a need to mingle with them is a trifle far-fetched. Throughout the month, we see how Sara has been thought of as the best friend of both Maddy and Adam. What is most peculiar is not that Sara and Natalie are close friends, but that their relationship is so all-consuming that every detail of their lives is shared - Every bit of each other's life is given up whole to the other - every day. The twisted irony of Sara's having thought at summer's beginning, that she would spend this August trying to disengage from her obsessive relationship with her mother and her mother's asking a young Japanese surfer to translate Sara's notebook and stumbling over &quot;I love her, but sometimes I want her to leave me the hell alone. I mean, enough is enough&quot; are the two most poignant moments in the book. Natalie is real, trying to accept the horrific fact of her child's death; no more will they say &quot;Surrender, Dorothy&quot; at the beginning of each telephone conversation, remembered from a shared passion with THE WIZARD OF OZ. The friends, however, are a trio of self-absorbed superannuated adolescents who, although pushed into the adult world a week early by the house owner's early return (Symbolism here?) don't have a clue."},{"Title":"Surrender Dorothy","review":"Gasp! A fag hag and a gay man, both Jewish! A married couple with a...(wait, I bet you'd never guess) a new BAYBEE! A world of utter misogyny and lameness where MEN are the center of EVERYTHING, lesbians don't exist, and stereotypes abound! Maybe if the entire world wasn't fixated on Will and Grace, or \\"Girls Who Like Boys Who Like Boys\\", this book wouldn't be so totally nauseating. But given that the pathetic woman who is obsessed with gay men who view women as circus clowns, footstools, or train wrecks-in-progress has become such a major overblown cliche, this book really didn't need to be written. Of course, the fact that the pathetic fag hag and the smug superior gay man HAS become a cliche has prompted a million and one books on this subject, trying to cash in on the trend. It is yet another attempt of popular culture to pretend that the gay man/straight woman sidekick pairing is chic, while lesbians (and both the women and men who love them) don't exist. Lame and tiresome, and I hope this trend ends soon."},{"Title":"Surrender Dorothy","review":"This is the first book I've read by Meg Wolitzer, and overall, I enjoyed it. The plot brings three just-turned-thirty friends into close and prolonged contact with the 50-something mother of their recently deceased friend. Wolitzer is able to pull this off because she obviously likes all of her characters, their various flaws notwithstanding. She also has the type of sense of humor that allows her to ligthen things up when emotions and events threaten to drag things down too much. The strongest character is the Mother, Natalie, who is one of the more appealing baby boomers in recent fiction, and by no means a mere caricature. My only objection is that several secondary characters are not as clearly drawn as the main ones. But in fairness to Wolitzer, in most novels the reader would not even care about knowing more about such relatively minor characters, and it's only her gift for making you care that makes this an issue at all."},{"Title":"Surrender Dorothy","review":"What a bunch of adolescents. All pretty self-serving. And dissappointing. I don't think friendship is too awfully deep when you screw around with your best friend's husband. Kind of a book about 30 year olds not wanting to grow up - forget the fact that their dear friend has died. And talk about a suffocating mother....YIKES! This book is mediocre at best."},{"Title":"Surrender Dorothy","review":"Wolitzer's book describes the changes in relationships caused by the death of a group of friends' close friend, Sara. The book follows the lives of four thirty-somethings and Sara's mother through a period of a month immediately following the death. In these trying times, there is a mass of sexual tension, sexual frustration, professional jealousy and general apathy to the world outside their own summer house. In relaying this interplay, however, Wolitzer fails to fully develop her characters. Everyone exists solely in relationship to someone else and does not have the presence to exist singly. While this does underscore their closeness to Sara and her former position as the nexus of their relationships, it leaves the characters flat and unfulfilling. Even the tensions within the group exist more academically than actually; Wolitzer fails to convey the deep emotions caused by Sara's death or the explosive emotions that (should have) followed. She also clutters the book by throwing in numerous other issues wholly unrelated to the central theme. Shawn's fear of AIDS, Nathalie's reunion with an old high school friend and Peter's guilt concerning his infidelity do more to add to the comic nature of the story and improve its likelihood of becoming a series of scenes for a soap opera than further along the central theme: coping with the loss of a loved one."},{"Title":"Surrender Dorothy","review":"I loved the first chapter of &quot;Surrender..&quot; and then the author killed off the most interesting character...

It's just too light and doesn't , as so many books seem not to, deliver on its initial promise... Yet, on the positive side, the scenes are vivid, memorable and ditto some of the characters..

This year the cast of characters is expanded: Maddy and Peter, long married, have added a baby to the mix, and Sara's closest friend Adam, now a successful playwright, has brought along his uncommonly handsome new boyfriend Shawn. Their first evening at the house this year, Sara and Adam make an ice cream run. On the way back, a tub of soft-serve vanilla successfully secured from the local Fro-Z-Cone, Sara is killed in a car accident.Surrender, Dorothy is the story of the effect of Sara's death on this circle of friends and on her mother Natalie, Sara's life-long confidante, who joins the party at the beach for a weeks-long immersion in collective grief. While her characters bicker and mourn in this sometimes oppressive atmosphere, Wolitzer explores the network of their relationships, with one another and with Sara. While the subject matter of the book is of course sad, the final product is not unbearably so. Readers like myself who shy away from depressing novels need not fear this one.Wolitzer, meanwhile, as I discovered also when reading her novel The Wife, is capable of some very fine prose, rich in detail. Very often her descriptions are spot on, depicting in few words the essence of some banal item, for example, such as the \\"cool, dented metal surface\\" of the Fro-Z-Cone counter. Every now and then, however, Wolitzer's descriptions go too far, and the reader is distracted by some improbable comparison: \\"Then, during pushing, that two-hour period of time during which Maddy began to hallucinate a roll of theater tickets unspooling from her [body] [okay, that's a bit improbable too, but not what I'm talking about].Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece"},{"Title":"Surrender Dorothy","review":"I enjoyed &quot;Surrender Dorothy&quot; very much.

The author really made you think about your own mortality and how we can touch and be touched by others people's lives...and the affect we have on each other.

I've liked all of Wolitzer's novels--she writes exquisitely and always cracks me up--but this novel about a young woman's early death and how it affects the people around her, especially her best friend (her mom) is one of her best. It is witty (puns aplenty) but so totally real. Everyone has to deal with a freak tragedy here in their own way, and Wolitzer carries us through her characters' transitions from shock to acceptance and transcendence beautifully. I hope the author is hard at work on her next novel. She's great company and I can't wait to see who she dreams up for me to hang out with next!"},{"Title":"Surrender Dorothy","review":"After plodding through a few chapters of these boring characters, I surrendered the book to the stack waiting to go back to the library."},{"Title":"Surrender Dorothy","review":"In a mustard-colored house in the Hamptons, four friends gather every August. They are thirty-something these days, and sometimes, they can scarcely bear to revisit the dilapidated and somewhat trashy house. But sentiment and habit draw them back every year.But this year will be a very different one for Peter, Maddy, Adam and Sara. In the first week of this, their summer retreat, Sara will die in a car accident.It happens when Sara and Adam are returning from buying ice cream at the Fro-Z-Cone shop. As the effects of this tragedy ripple through all their lives, the after shock also envelopes Sara's mother Natalie more than any of them. Natalie and Sara have been like a \\"twosome\\" of us against the world, ever since Natalie split from her husband many years before. They share many intimate deals of each other's lives in a way that suggests some boundary issues. They talk by phone almost every day, with a unique greeting--\\"Surrender, Dorothy.\\" Like a code, formed years before when they watched The Wizard of Oz over and over.So now in her grief, Natalie impulsively goes out to the little house on the beach, just to see where Sara was in her last moments. And the friends invite her to stay on.What unfolds in the weeks that follow will remind everyone of the fragility of life, the bonds that connect friends and family, and the boundaries that need to be rebuilt.Will Natalie learn how to live without Sara? What will Peter, Maddy, and Adam discover about themselves without their friend? And finally, will they all grow up at last and put an end to what now feels like an extended adolescence?Surrender, Dorothy: A Novelwas a very quick and poignant read. I had already seen a movie based on this book a few times, and couldn't read the book without envisioning Diane Keaton as Natalie (the mother). What I liked about the book that wasn't part of the movie was how the author shared bits and pieces of back story for the characters as we met them, or in moments when they were pondering their lives.Pleasant and enjoyable, and I would give it four stars...or 4.5."},{"Title":"Surrender Dorothy","review":"This absorbing story felt real as I went along, reading it pretty quickly over the course of a few nights. Meg Wolitzer's writing is all-American, a reflection of life here and now. I love it. She's just deep enough to be very interesting, and literary enough to pull you along, but in this book, every word counts. If only every women's author these days was so spare and so talented! It was such a relief to pick up this meaty but relatively short book - 240 pages - after having to plow through big, fat, 500-page, comment-on-every-color-and-nuance-of-thought \\"women's literature\\" books for my book club!"},{"Title":"Surrender Dorothy","review":"Meg Wolitzer accomplishes something astonishing here. She creates a compelling character in Sara Swerdlow even after her sudden death at the end of the first chapter. Surrender, Dorothy is, I think, about how each of us is the sum of our impact on others in our lives - and their collective perceptions of us. I eased through the story, as sad as it frequently is, quickly, and Wolitzer's style is similar to that of some of my favorite authors: Elinor Lipman, Anne Tyler and Stephen McCauley."},{"Title":"Surrender Dorothy","review":"Ms. Wolitzer has so much talent. This book is very moving. SaraSwerdlow, who seemed to be the protagonist, is killed in the last lineof the first chapter. Her mother and her friends, who are actually at a Long Island summer house, grieve for the remainder of the book. Ms. Wolitzer has wit and the incidents she selects to write about are interesting and well done. The book is very sad. Ms. Wolitzer's view of life is so grim. Marriage stinks. Friends and children are dangerous. Joy fades quickly. The combination of wit and talent with this grim view is striking and odd. But the book is moving and I recommend it."},{"Title":"Surrender Dorothy","review":"This is the first title I've read by this author and was enthralled by the tender passages. Having been a long time fan of Alice Adams, I surely thought that feeling of gentle familiarity with characters, beautiful on the outside and shattered and fragile inside, was a pleasure now gone. I'm pleased to say this book evoked the same feeling of honest haunting. Thank you, Meg Wolitzer for this gem of a read."},{"Title":"Surrender Dorothy","review":"How an author can create such great characters while writing a novel free from compelling circumstances is surprising. Ho hum, I can't believe she's dead, let's pour ourself another drink. I can't believe her mother showed up, ho-hum let's pour another drink and watch her clean the house. One big secret does surface, but it is rather mundane in it's telling. At the end everyone gets better, while the Mom who is easily the most exciting of the group, realizes life does go on after the loss of a child. Even if'ts is a miserable and shallow existence. Color this whole novel as grey and bland as a grief stricken day in the Hamptons. I was disappointed because I really looked forward to this book, and intead could barely muster the energy to finish it."},{"Title":"Surrender Dorothy","review":"Surrender Dorothy is filled with enjoyable moments. This is story of ordinary people facing the reality of life and death. As a reader you are able to relate to the insanity that accompanies death and the reality of how death effects you. Though the book focus is around Sara's death the book is really a tale of Sara's life, a life many can relate to. When you are not crying you will be laughing. Surrender Dorothy was an enjoyable quick read that I recommend to all that can relate to the transition of life from the carefree 20's to the responsible 30's where you and those around you not only realize you are an adult but expect you to act as an adult."},{"Title":"Surrender Dorothy","review":"I loved this book -- it's among Wolitzer's best.

Each is left with guilt and memories too large to be contained in the tiny, forlorn house they have rented. When Sara's mother, Natalie, arrives unexpectedly one afternoon, she sets into motion the undoing of the entire household.

I had already bought a used copy of the 1985 revision of that work, retitled _Goren's New Bridge Complete_, but it didn't include some things I'd encountered since I resumed play during the past year.When I spotted the book at hand, in a revised edition from 1994, I believed I had found what I was looking for.Initially I was pleased that Chapter 1 describes and illustrates the mechanics of play, from the moment one first sits down at the bridge table all the way through the play of the hand. Not that I needed that information myself, but for someone who has been invited to play for the first time the material could prove to be both instructive and calming.However, by Chapter 3 the bad news was upon me. The author recommends weak bids of one no-trump (i.e., 12-14 high card points, rather than the old-time 16-18 or the more modern 15-17). Even more perplexing, he recommends opening with only a four-card major suit. Even Goren, or his editorial board, relented to the trend toward minimum five-card major suit openings, and that was back in 1985.Because of the far-reaching implications of these two methods, the first 163 pages (the entire Part 1, on bidding) is largely worthless to me, as I think it would be to anyone who plays, or intends to play, what one might loosely call the \\"American Standard\\" bidding system.Perhaps I'll find something of value in Parts 2 and 3, dealing with the play of the hand. However, I already have the books by Watson and by Mollo & Gardener, as well as the two introductory books (on declarer play and defense, respectively) by Kaplan. I expect that this book will prove to be worthless to me.In that case, why do I give it three stars? Because the book seems at a quick glance to be complete and well-written. The chapters end with sections such as \\"Over Zia's Shoulder\\", \\"Summary\\" and \\"Frequently Asked Questions\\". In some cases this material adds perspective, while in others it provides useful repetition of essential material. I suspect that someone interested in adopting what I presume is a British-influence approach to bidding will find this book helpful."},{"Title":"Reflections of a Vampire","review":"What a great story line.

He is a beautiful young man, eternally youthful, killing indiscriminately. He is all-powerful, a shape changer as well as able to read the thoughts of others. Gerard Arnaud St. Laurue is a vampire. Getting ready for his millennium rest, he is looking for minions to help him. He must go underground for eighteen months to rejuvenate and he needs minions that he can trust to guard his grave. When four teenagers stalk him, he turns on them killing three but he likes the look of one sixteen-year-old named Fury and decides to cultivate him into one of his minions. Fury is delighted; he wants power for himself.Detective Solomon Wiese is looking for the murderer of the three teens as well as the beheaded local priest, Father Monahan. He and his partner comb the hot spots of the city looking for St. Laurue. Franny who works for the Daemonion Council is a shape changer and able to cloak herself so that she cannot be detected by the bloodsucker. She and her compatriots are trying to help the detective find St. Laurue who is not only killing people but also spreading disease throughout the city.St. Laurue decides to write his memoirs before he goes underground and going to the office of a local publisher, Bevan Preston, he forces him to agree to publish his book.Press is frightened for his life and that of his family so has no choice but to agree to work with the vampire. Needing a ghostwriter, he recruits his friend, Kyle, to do the honors for St. Laurue. Oddly enough, St. Laurue and Kyle find they are kindred spirits. St. Laurue is also having an on-going hate relationship with his powerful father. And this is just the beginning of the journey through REFLECTIONS OF A VAMPIRE and things are not always quite what they seem.Mr. Kirk writes a chilling story making it feel very real so that the reader will find himself looking over his shoulder making sure there are no creepy-crawlies of which he is unaware. It is a frightening tale of mayhem and murder and creatures of the night. There are numerous characters in the story but many of them are short-lived but fascinating all the same as they get their hearts ripped out of their bodies before they can blink an eye. Needless to say, there is a lot of blood and gore. One scene with two bellboys oversteps the line of gruesome! The reader can but hope for redress from Detective Wiese and Franny (Slim) but is everything really as it seems to be? With vampires and shape changers, anything and everything is a possibility.

When one of the humans fell prey, I thought 'so what'...when one of the vampires was being high and mighty, I thought 'whatever'. Having the vampires turn into a grotesque, ugly beast is orginal, but actually rather distasteful. It did have a lot of surprise twists to the plot, which saved it from being awful, but I won't read it again, and I won't keep the book.

In \\"Reflections of a Vampire\\", Damion has created a world just a little different from our own. What if you could live a very long time? What if you could literally fly to Washington DC ~ seduce, control and kill anyone you wanted, at any time? The only price that you pay is a little bit of guilt.What would it mean to be in a world where someone can completely control you? Forget about morality, it's all about power. In the Old Testament, Job was tested this way, but Job was dealing with an old-time Hebrew God who had more power than awareness. Damion's vampires on the other hand, are up to date. They're cool. You can't outsmart them. Your only hope is to get them to like you, and that is mostly up to them.In this book, Damion creates powerful images, slapstick humor, kinky sex and extreme terror in a world ten degrees off true. His book reminds us of every kind of human Vampire in our own lives: Desire for power over others, compulsion, masochism, denial of the obvious and fear of death. I couldn't help but see my self. Suppose we start catching on to the Vampires that are always hanging around us, what can we do about them? In \\"Reflections of a Vampire\\", the answer is \\"not much\\". This world is a lot like ours. If we try hard and get lucky, we might get the best of a Vampire or two. The next one we come up against may stick his tongue down our throats and out our spine. Sometimes we get caught.\\"Reflections of a Vampire\\" moves straight into our most difficult dilemmas, in a very bizarre way. I had a really good scary time.

St. Laurue is a vampire that shocks as much with his violence as his sudden outbursts of mercy.That Mr. Kirk has created such memorable characters is wonderful, that they share such a rich story is incredible. Reflections of a Vampire entices us on a wild romp from the back alleys and clubs of NYC, to the Holocaust Museum in DC.I'll put it this way - If you're looking for a great read; if you love horror, mystery or suspense -- buy one for yourself, and one for your best friend - so they don't keep yours.

Don't be fooled by any surface similarities. No flashbacks here. Mr. Kirk masterfully unfolds his own distinct real-time, tightly woven dark adventure.This is the story of vampires and humans and how little difference there is once you scratch the surface. A \\"Don't want to stop\\" and a \\"Don't want it to end\\" storyline. It gives nothing away to say that interesting things are happening as vampires tap into the modern blood supply. Clues are left, citizens can't help but notice that things are getting a bit gruesome, and something has to be done. The police are brought in as well as some other, more shadowy figures. Everyone is searching for something or someone and it all produces a maelstrom of love, death, and desire. No way to figure it out. You just gasp, along for the ride.The vampires are the coolest I've ever come across. There are many of them each with their own distinct personality. They are scary, clever, sometimes funny, and even tender. One is nothing short of masterful. There are many human characters, all of whom you care about, and some of whom manage to stay un-undead.The story is modern and opens up a new universe of plots and intrigues, some pointing to the past and others pointing to the future.

Excellent! *****Reviewed by Detra Fitch"},{"Title":"Reflections of a Vampire","review":"Gerard Arnaud St. Laurue, an ancient vampire, wants to publish his memoirs. If Damion Kirk writes a sequel, maybe he will reveal some of these adventures -- Reflections of a Vampire is not an interview filled with flashbacks. This book is pure action with people (both undead and alive) whom you care about.St. Laurue has not written this manuscript, but his deadline is less than one week, when he must take his millennium rest where he will sleep below the ground for 18 months. Also, he must have minions to keep him safe, but he has not found those to whom he must trust his existence either.These vampires have human qualities such as family ties -- a blood feud between St. Laurue, his sister Brigitte and their father the Marquis Antoine DeMalberet, who has ancient tricks to keep the kids in check. There is the Daemonion Council operatives with special powers who inadvertently get involved with the police who are searching for a serial killer.I do not want to reveal too many details, but there are so many characters and sub-plots that each page is filled with an adventure. Kirk's descriptions are vivid with images that are memorable and frightening. Some of the scenes you might not want to &quot;see,&quot; but you will. I shuddered, checked the closets for anything amiss -- such as a vampire hiding among my clothes, and came right back to reading. He is a master storyteller, and has written a true page-turner!By the way, as I write this review, I want to be sure the vampires know that I respect them... just in case... and hopefully that will get rid of the chill down my spine... that feeling that someone is looking over my shoulder...Though I do not normally mention the publisher, I am making an exception. The publishing company is RahuBooks. This is a new firm, and if this first book is any indication of future books, this is a winning company. The paper is heavier than other paperbacks with strong binding (for those of us who hate to have a book fall apart as we are reading it).I give five stars to this winner. Take a ride on a roller coaster; be scared, be tender, be drawn in, but when you open your door, do not invite a stranger into your house.Victoria Tarrani"},{"Title":"Reflections of a Vampire","review":"those are the adjectives that come to mind when I turned the last page of this incredible vampire novel!

Our rather \\"evil\\" hero's mission is jeopardize on two fronts: one is shadowy organization of shape-shifters called Daemonion Council who believe that St.Laurue is passing a deadly aids-like virus and the other is possessive vampire father who has his own agenda.Kirk's gruesome vampire saga has it all:characters like Brigitte, St.Laurue' sister who helps him and battle the council and their father.

In doing so, he opens our minds to our deepest fears and makes the vampire St. Larue a far more realistic threat to us than Dracula ever was. A reader will find in Kirk's words no lack of vivid mental images that will haunt the memory long after the reading. If you love a good vampire tale, you'll love Damion Kirk's \\"Reflections.\\""},{"Title":"Reflections of a Vampire","review":"This interesting, if somewhat quirky, tale is the story of Arnaud St. Larue, a vampire who is coming to the end of his first millennium and needs to take an eighteen month nap to revitalize. In not quite a week Larue must acquire some fledglings or minions who will guard and tend his nesting spot while he sleeps the long sleep of the dead. This is made a bit more complicated by the fact that he is pursued by agents of the Daemonion Council and by his vampire father, a sorcerer of considerable strength, and a perpetual meddler in the affairs of Arnaud and his beloved sister, Brigitte.St. Larue also has become entranced by the idea of writing his memoirs, causing a publisher and a ghostwriter endless grief, and greatly upsetting his fellow vampires. Finally, Arnaud has become infected by a strange form of aids, that exaggerates his normally gruesome feeding habits and predisposes him to careless violence. As a result, the police, in the person of Detective Solomon Wiese become aware of him, and adding further risk to St. Larue's continued survival.On the surface, this story reads a bit like a hybrid of 'Interview with a Vampire' and 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer.' Sexy French vampires who turn into horrific monsters when the hunger is upon them. Creatures with an array of powers awesome enough to make them virtually unconquerable. They fly, change shape, grow extra appendages, ride on the outside of airplanes, and write memoirs with the speed of summer lightning. In fact, the humans fare very poorly by comparison in this story, and the only thing that seems to be effective against Kirk's inventions is their own coquettish unpredictability.Damion Kirk does a fine job with his characters, who are uniformly interesting in novel ways. This is less a horror story than a comedy of terrors, made notable by the conversation and action that embellish what would otherwise be a straightforward plot. In this environment conversation and inner dialogue take on great importance, and Kirk seems as comfortable with this challenge as he is with the many intricacies of plot he introduces. Kirk has bent for taking an original viewpoint. He is, to date, the only writer in some time who noticed that it is humans, not vampires, who are unable to see vampire reflections.In the end, it will not be Kirk's skill or the amount of violence or romance that will decide the reader's reaction to 'Reflections of a Vampire,' but how one feels about his style of vampire. This is a problem, which plagues all writers in this genre. What powers, what vulnerabilities, are they forces of nature or spirit? These questions directly affect the believability of the plot and the atmospherics of the tale. Personally, I found St. Larue too powerful for the purposes of the story. The same is true of his father, who is an even more extreme variation on the same theme. When vampires approach invulnerability and have a vast number of powers to call on, the plot has no choice but to become whimsical with the vampire acting as deus ex machina. I found the story quite enjoyable despite this, and many will be far less bothered by it than I am. As such I think this is a tale worth pursuing."},{"Title":"Reflections of a Vampire","review":"I met Damion at a book signing at the World Horror Convention this year,April 2002.

Yes, I did pay him back.With some skepticism of a another new vampire book I started to read Reflections of a Vampire. From the first page to the last page this book grabbed my attention. Damion puts twists and turns to the vampire legend that makes Reflections a page turner. In the first chapter some fans of Anne Rice will think that Damion is just rehashing a old story line, but he is not. I do not want to give away what Damion does to put twists into the story line, because it will take away the element of suprise when you read it. By the end of the book you will want a sequal. You will want to learn about Gerard St. Laurue and his father. I cannot wait to see a follow up book to Reflections of a Vampire.

So, sometimes, quite by accident, I'll watch a scene or two of a rented video, or listen to a discussion of a book.I can honestly say there is no scary book or movie out today as good as REFLECTIONS OF A VAMPIRE. Make no mistake about it, this is a movie. The book reads like a script and is written in such rich language and lurid detail that the mind pictures every scene and every character on the big screen with all our modern cinema technology of morphing and flying and make-up making the unreal and unbelievable alarmingly real and believable. My son and I have already cast the movie and picked a director. A perceptive actor, director, or producer will surely discover this book and the world will see REFLECTIONS OF A VAMPIRE. It is too scary for me."},{"Title":"Reflections of a Vampire","review":"Reflections of a Vampire is a very good, fast paced, quite entertaining, at times gruesome, well written book. It's quite a bit more than Vampire fiction, since it has many of the elements of fantasy built in; invisibility, blink of an eye shape-shifting, and fire beams, to mention a few. I disagree with other reviewers that this is a book in the tradition of Anne Rice. It is not. People use this comparison to the point of making it a clich&eacute;, and basically having no meaning whatsoever.As a story, this book has everything; Vampires, a Daemonion Council, shapeshifters, a priest, a book publisher and ghost writer, policemen, minions, very graphic gore, AIDS, castles, and a host of other things to draw from. The book could easily have been twice as long with the amount of ground the author covers. Damion Kirk does do a superb job at keeping the readers interest with a quick moving story, unpredictable events, and quite a bit of action.The novel is dying for several sequels and I'm sure I'll read them if and when they are available. Unless you are a hard core Vampire reader, you may pass this book up since the cover price of the book is fairly high, especially for a first novel of an unknown author. It is done with quality paper and a very nice easy to read font, but still, I felt the price was out of line."},{"Title":"KODAK Photographic Filters Handbook (Kodak Publication)","review":"This book is designed for professional photographers, photo lab technicians and scientists who use filters. The book contains infomation on applications, physical, optical and transmission characteristics. This book is not suitable for amateur photographers wanting to learn about the use of filters to improve their photography. Contains no pictures, its all numbers and graphs."},{"Title":"KODAK Photographic Filters Handbook (Kodak Publication)","review":"The title says what it is - handbook on Kodak filters. I got this book because I was interested in creating anaglyphs (the red/cyan 3D images that require the funky glasses to view) and was looking for the best filter combination. Not only did this book provide what I was looking for, but it proved to be an interesting read in itself, and it broadened by understanding of filters.The primary limitation of the book is that it gives technical data only for Kodak-manufactured filters. It includes the colored filters, color correction filters, haze filters, UV filters, safelight filters and neutral density filters. The first part of the book is chapters on various types of filters, and 40+ pages in the back contain transmission vs. wavelength data, both in tabular and graphical form, for all of the Kodak filters. Other tables include spectral-transmittance bar charts, chromaticity diagrams and colorimetric data and a 4 page table to convert between density and percent transmittance.I knew I was buying a book of tables, but was pleasantly surprised by the 90+ pages on filter descriptions, application and technical information. Although a book such as Kodak's USING FILTERS may be an easier and more in-depth read, one can learn quite a bit about filters reading this handbook. Some of the topics discussed are filter manufacturing, storage and handling, filter stability, and color temperature.Although not for a beginning photographer, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book to an advanced amateur who wants to know more about filters and how to get the most from them. Of course, pros, labs and scientists definitely should consider having this around. I also felt that it was reasonably priced."},{"Title":"KODAK Photographic Filters Handbook (Kodak Publication)","review":"If you work as a professional color laboratory tech or studio photographer, this book has definitive information about the characteristics of the multitude of available filters.

I decided to compare definitions of a word in both books and Mosby's definition was impressive enough to have me make the purchase (amiodarone was the word, a cardiovascular drug). I used it while studying for a recertification examination and found it by my side as I went through several other books.This book was the single best resource I had after purchasing almost $1k worth of new books!The quantity of definitions may not exceed Dorlands, but the QUALITY of the definitions is SUPERB. You get not only a skeleton, minimalist definition but a mini-tutorial of each topic. Just the dermatology related definitions alone with pictures kept me from buying a dermatology book. Definition after definition I looked up - and this went well over a thousand words, perhaps 2 or 3k words - resulted in getting an excellent authoritative discussion of a topic, giving the most salient points in a concise and highly readable form. I had in excess of a 99% 'hit rate' of finding highly useful information with each lookup. Doing this with Dorland's gave me the most trivial definitions in comparison, often little more than the pronunciation of the word and a circular reference to another definition. I gave up after about 100 words as an exercise in time wasting.I put this book right up there with the Merck Manual as absolute must haves for any serious student of medicine - from the senior specialist to the beginning nursing student.

Matt Dodson and Tex Jarman are candidates for the position ofcadet in the Interplanetary Patrol. What is the InterplanetaryPatrol? It's not a military organization. What?! I said it's not amilitary organization. It's repository for weapons too dangerous to be entrusted to the military. Heinlein explainsit better than I can. He says: &quot;Sure you're trained to use weapons but the Patrol isn't a military organization....&quot; He then gets technical with Lieutenant Wong's explanation of the gravity well. The first two chapters are just orientation and the beginnings of the tests. The rest of the book is space-based with the exception of the trip to Venus. The description of Venus is a bit dated but it's still a good read.It would make a good movie."},{"Title":"Space Cadet (Ace SF, 77731)","review":"Space Cadet is the story of Matt Dodson's training in the Space Patrol, a kind of peacekeeping force which serves the solar system as a &quot;repository of weapons too dangerous to use.&quot; Heinlein cleverly points out the limitations of America's &quot;current&quot; (1949) military strategy, and shows how he would handle the disposition of weapons of mass destruction. Asked why he wants to become a Patrolman, Matt grudgingly admits that &quot;people look up to an officer of the Patrol.&quot; The Patrol is composed entirely of officers, all of them volunteers, all of whom go through the same rigorous and at times almost sadistic elimination process Matt does. Besides grueling physical tests, an extensive battery of psychological and intellectual exams are used to narrow down the pool of candidates. There is a strong emphasis on education, moral responsibility, and esprit de corps. Heinlein does a good job of describing the Patrol and its ideals, the painful rigors of training, and a cadet's first experiences with space flight, zero gravity, and spacesickness. Heinlein shows his open-mindedness when our heroes are stranded on Venus, where the natives are friendly, collie-like creatures (all of them female) with their own language, their own traditions and taboos, and a command of technology that is both radically different from and superior to our own. On the other hand, human females are almost totally ignored (there are none in the Patrol). Characters come and go, as is typical of the service, with no more development than might be expected within so short a time period, but the focus is on the process of training cadets, rather than on the cadets' growth as individuals. Matt himself is engaging enough, as is his friend Tex, whose tall tales provide a touch of folksy humor, but roommates Oscar and Pete come off as little more than stuffed shirts. There's not a lot of slam-bang excitement, either; the conflict is largely internal as the cadets struggle to be all they can be in a generally peaceful social order. Absent the rabid militarism of the better-known Starship Troopers, this book is a pleasant, enjoyable diversion for young readers, but offers little in the way of big surprises, spine-tingling adventure, or even abstruse science. In the final analysis, Heinlein takes so few risks with this story that it fails to reach the heights of adventure and speculation that we look for in such a book. Teenage boys should enjoy this novel, but it's doubtful that they'll remember it very long."},{"Title":"Space Cadet (Ace SF, 77731)","review":"I got this book for Christmas when I turned twenty.

That's Robert A. Heinlein's Interplanetary Patrol in the classic 1948 science fiction novel Space Cadet. It's the story of two prospective cadets. Matt Dodson and Tex Jarman meet on the way to the Patrol Academy, which like the Air Force Academy, is in Colorado. The other candidates, Girard Burke, Oscar Jensen, and Pierre Armand, are taken under the wings of various oldsters-- cadets who've graduated but haven't yet been commissioned.One of these oldsters, Cadet Sabatello, is the adviser for Matt, Tex, Oscar, and Pierre. Their tests range from the ridiculous to the sublime. The drop test is the hardest of all. They're soon graduated and go to the Academy's school ship, the P.R.S. Randolph, and they're later assigned to various ships. Burke resigns and turns up on Venus. There's trouble in the equatorial region of Venus and Burke's responsible for it. Matt, Tex, Oscar, and Lieutenant Thurlow, go to down to Venus to check it out. Their jeep lands in a sink hole and sinks. Oscar breaks his arm in the disaster, Matt and Tex take a comatose Lieutenant Thurlow through the Venerian jungles. Oscar summons the little people and they take them to their city underneath a Venerian lake. They finally return to the jungles of Venus and recommission the P.R.S. Astarte, a ship that was decommissioned over a hundred years earlier.

But there's less to it than in Starship Troopers. I don't like the characters. The only one that says anything other than the &quot;gee shucks, we're in the space patrol&quot; line is an utter creep and many of the scenes just drag along. I heard that kids have liked this book and it seems more written for teenagers than adults, but there's not a lot to recommend. Only in the last 30 pages does the book pick up and start doing things, but up until then it's training, training and more training.For better Heinlein books of this style try either Starship Troopers or Podkyne of Mars."},{"Title":"Space Cadet (Ace SF, 77731)","review":"I hadn't read this one of Heinlein's in many, many years when I picked it up and was leafing through it in search of an answer to a trivia question. Doing this with any Heinlein novel is dangerous; in short order I was snagged into re-reading the entirety of this one. Heinlein has often been cited by many of today's scientists and engineers as their inspiration for getting into the sciences, and this book is a prime example of why. As the story of Matt Dodson, young man in training to be a Space Patrol officer, it is a very typical adolescent-to-man portrayal. The first half of the book deals with his training, from the rigorous testing to eliminate those who don't have what it takes to descriptions of the myriad of subjects an officer is expected to know. The second half details his experiences and on-the-job training as a school graduate, from long boring hours in space transit, to the finding of a missing Patrol ship, to his experiences in the art of negotiation with Venusian natives. At no point does this book ever become boring; I fully believe Heinlein could have written a twenty page exposition on watching grass grow and kept his readers totally engrossed. Some of the details he presents on the art of astrogation and space flight may go over the heads of some younger readers of this book, but it is precisely such details that will get those readers interested in studying such subjects.This book was written in 1948, and some allowances must be made for that reason, such as the description of Venus as mainly a hot and very wet but habitable planet (at the time he wrote this, this was one of the main scientific suppositions about conditions on the this planet). At the same time, it is quite incredible just how accurate he was in describing everything from rocket ship design, fuels, space walks, space sickness, space habitats, eating utensils designed for space use, the utility of a global peace-keeping force (such as the U.N., which was just being formed when this was written), and even predicted the use of microwaves for cooking (this prediction is hidden in a throw away one-liner comment, typical for Heinlein, as he quite correctly portrays the inventions of the future as mere commonplaces of their time).Some have called this a watered-down version of Starship Troopers, and there is some validity to this point, as there is very little of the heavy philosophy that characterized Starship Troopers here (although, like all of his 'juvenile' novels, there are strong threads running throughout on the importance of honesty, duty, personal responsibility, and the proper role of government), but much of the same flavor regarding military organizations.Other than Matt himself, the characterizations are somewhat one-dimensional, in some cases near caricatures drawn with broad strokes. This is not necessarily bad in a book intended for young readers, who have not yet reached the sophistication to see the world in many shades of gray, but is a little grating for the adult readers. The depiction of Burke, supposedly good enough to survive all the testing and early training for the Space Patrol, but so dunderheaded as to effectively kidnap a local Venusian 'mother' and not see anything wrong with his actions is especially grating.This book was the basis for an attempt at a TV serial: Tom Corbett, Space Cadet in the early fifties, and is very well suited to this type of treatment. The book is a fun, fast read. Adult readers may be disappointed in its lack of meaty subjects and sketchy characters, but it is near perfect for its intended audience."},{"Title":"Space Cadet (Ace SF, 77731)","review":"I am a faculty member at a law school. When we considered revamping our curriculum, I gave the committee members passages from this book to read, where the Academy's approach is made clear. Universally, the response was: &quot;Yeah, that's how we should do things. But we have to pursue a feel-good approach now.&quot; Heinlein understands that character matters, and that institutions should encourage responsibility, not undermine it. That, I suppose, is why he was never an administrator.... Nonetheless, this is not only a terrific story, but one -- like all of Heinlein's juniors -- with a point."},{"Title":"Space Cadet (Ace SF, 77731)","review":"I have heard this book dismissed as \\"just another space cadet story.\\" Check the date of publication (1948), this is THE first space cadet story. It started the genre. I've also heard it dismissed as a \\"kid's book.\\" A \\"kid's book\\" would not have stuck in my memory for four decades now and provided me with inspiration and a model when I most needed it. A \\"kid's book\\" wouldn't have inspired me to stick out high school and college physics and mathematics instead of just throwing in the towel. It was remembering the example of this book, and _Starman Jones_, that got me through Calculus. I just wish the rest of the world would have lived up to the high ideals expressed in these books....I recently reread this tale after many years. I was amazed at how \\"nondated\\" it was. Heinlein has a perfect description of cell phones and cell towers. Something else finally hit me too- this is where Gene Roddenbury got most of his ideas for Star Trek. Heinlein actuallly uses the term \\"the Federation.\\" His Interplanetary Patrol is obviously the inspiration for Star Fleet with it's noble ideals, multi-cultural make-up (in 1948), it's commitment to keeping the peace, and it's 100 year record of keeping the peace (a phrase right out of Trek.) The importance of the Academy and its naval style of organization came from Heinlein, the Annapolis graduate. The way that the organization is entirely composed of officers and officers in training- that's also pure Star Trek. Heinlein wrote of all this almost 20 years before Star Trek aired...."},{"Title":"Space Cadet (Ace SF, 77731)","review":"One of my favorites by Heinlein, this book is a great one kids who are getting interested in Sci-Fi. It contains a pretty good adventure story, with enough military sci-fi flavoring to keep you interested throughout the portion of the book where our hero is being trained. I finished this, and I had to track down the short story &quot;The Long Watch&quot; by Heinlein, to read it again so I fully understood the references contained within Space Cadet. You may also wish to read it first, it can be found in &quot;The Past Through Tomorrow&quot; by Heinlein, as well as several other of his books, I'm sure."},{"Title":"Space Cadet (Ace SF, 77731)","review":"I am in my early twenties and didn't know about Heinlen until I turned 12. He was not on my recommended reading list as my parents knew my tendency, which began around my 8th year, to read everything by an author if I liked one of their titles. I think they were nervous about the compatibility of Stranger In a Strange Land for an 8 - 10 year old. I did not discover Heinlein's juvies until I was in my early twenties, which I still haven't left. I had read much of Heinlen's more mature material in my \`teens, some of it before I was ready for it. Therefore, when I read SPACE CADET, I approached it with a mind toward how it would have affected me if I had read it earlier in life. So doing, I was highly impressed with his work.There seems to be some contention concerning the relation of this book to his better-known STARSHIP TROOPERS. Regardless of other subject matter, I think that there is a legitimate connection between the principles that he was promoting in both. The main difference in the two books is the age group and the times he was writing for, since the adventures that entertained children and older youths in the nineteen-forties or fifties would probably not have held the attention or provided equal entertainment for those more advanced in years and less innocent in outlook.Heinlen rarely wrote anything without a point, and in SPACE CADET he promoted concepts of personal responsibility to society, spoke against racism (VERY progressive for 1948), warned of the practical disadvantages of drinking, congratulated honoring one's parents in the face of parental ignorance, advocated a strong military defense capability even as he pronounced the lofty goal of a lasting peace, and celebrated study and productive activity over immature destructive behaviors. He did all of this with very little moral grandstanding or preaching, and even the few speeches he included contained enough serious drama and ironic humor to keep almost anyone buried in the story.What Heinlen achieved, in short, is a remarkable work of juvenile fiction; active, adventurous, fanciful only in its dated depiction of a possible Venus, never slowing down, just utopian enough for those who retain some innocence, just worldly practical enough to encourage thinking and the abandonment of naivet&eacute;, as full of turmoil and new things and \\"what-do-I-want-to-do-with-my-life\\" questionings as will cause mental weight lifting and big dreams in most brains from 8 to 80. Maybe the story is somewhat old-fashioned, maybe a lot of people would rather watch something mindless than read something that is at all dated. However, I can honestly state my absolute opinion that if anyone picks up this book and, with an open mind, pays attention to it, it will demonstrate to them practical lessons that a lot of people, these days, seem to be in need of learning.Also, it's just a titanic chunk of fun for anyone who loves, or is being introduced to the love of hard sci-fi."},{"Title":"Space Cadet (Ace SF, 77731)","review":"A long time ago, when Space Cadet and it's companion, Tunnel in the Sky, were first published, chapters from both were read aloud to me (and my fellow classmates) in the sixth grade by a remarkable public school teacher. He understood that the underlying lessons in civic responsibility would remain with us...we just thought at the time these were ripping good stories. Over the years I've re-read both until my copies fell apart. He was right, the political lessons are as relevant today as they were when they were written. Not just for kids...."},{"Title":"Space Cadet (Ace SF, 77731)","review":"This may be the last Heinlein novella written in his 'young boys' Amazing-magazine era, or it may be the first book he wrote as he started aiming for a little older audience. I don't know how to judge - I read Stranger when I was 10 so my views are clouded. Needless to say, this is a truly great piece of science fiction. There is no gibson-esque drug use, no later-Heinlein gratuitous sex, no Neal Stephenson rock and roll... and yet, there is a true innocense to this book. It is like the fabled children's story written for adults, something like what Harry Potter almost accomplished. You read it, you watch Wennie-the-pooh, you listen to that one favorite piece of music... you can't help but smile, can't help but enjoy it. This is the quintessential story of Starship Troopers... except with people fighting with but their wits and their innate charm, not a bazooka and a jumpsuit. THIS IS NOT A BOOK FOR YOU BIG FLYING SHIP XWING FANS! This is for the Hari Seldon fans, the people who read Stranger in a Strange Land and like Jubal Harshaw the best. Ahhh, the innocense of youth!"},{"Title":"Space Cadet (Ace SF, 77731)","review":"Although Heinlein is now more well known, and will probably be remembered, for his later, more ambitious adult novels (Starship Troopers, Stranger In A Strange Land), his more important contribution to the field of science fiction may well have been his earlier novels intended for teens. These juvenile books - or \\"juvies\\", as they were then called - although notably less heavy on the dialogue and philosophy that would come to color later works (as well as being somewhat inevitably dated due to the fact that they were written half a century ago), are more than just your average run-of-the-mill youth fiction, and they have stood the test of time - and were, in fact, major contributions to the field of science fiction. You may well wonder why. The simple fact is that many scientists, engineers, and astronauts working today (just take a poll at NASA) were inspired to enter the field by these works of Robert A. Heinlein. It's no small wondert that NASA gave Heinlein a posthumous Distinguished Public Service Medal - their highest civilian honor. (They also helped pull the field of science fiction out of a mere genre niche into the mainstream: Heinlein, with these works, rose above the \\"pulp\\" market which most SF was relegated to, and cracked the \\"slicks\\" - the more respectable and well-known papers - the first science fiction writer to do so.) Although his later works may be more respectable as literature, these, indeed, serve to inspire. And they're still doing it today. If you want to get a younger person interested in science fiction, these are the perfect books - just as they always have been. They open the door to Heinlein's later works and the entire field of science fiction. The good thing about them, though, is that, though the books had teens as their target audience, they are just as good of a read for adults. This is because Heinlein knew the way to get teens to like books for teens: to write to them as if they weren't teens. Consequently, these books can be read and enjoyed by people of all ages. (It also works the other way: I read Stranger In A Strange Land at age 15, and my wife read it at 12.) They come very highly reccommended for younger readers, as they all teach many solemn virtues important for anyone - personal responsibility, loyalty, maturity, honesty - that may well make a permanent impression on younger readers. However, the books are also very enjoyable for adults because of the way Heinlein wrote. I decree, this man could make anything, literally anything, entertaining. His writing was always breezy and sardonically funny, and his dialogue among the best and cleverest ever written - as has been well said, \\"as witty as Oscar Wilde's.\\"This particular book, Space Cadet, though not the best of them, is another solid, action-packed romp. As with the best of his work of this type (Red Planet, Tunnel In The Sky) the book is exciting and action-packed, and there is never a dull moment. It is also very entertaining and a fun, fast read: the dialogue is great, and it's fun to read and moves along at a brisk, exciting pace. It also has several good moral points and instills some strong values in the reader. The plot of the book concerns a group of young men who are out the join the \\"Space Cadets\\", the peace keepers of the \\"Solar Federation\\" (sound familar? one begins to see just how influential Heinlein was.) The early part of the book has the characters going through the exams and trials required to join, and the latter half shows them in action. This book, such as it is, says a lot about how such military systems work (both practically and on a more personal, pragmatic level), and as such is kind of a watered-down version of Starship Troopers (although, of course, that book was written later.) I reccommend it very highly for younger readers, or for anyone who liked the basic idea of that book but was turned off by its heavy-handed approach. Another fine Heinlein juvie."},{"Title":"Space Cadet (Ace SF, 77731)","review":"It's too easy to dismiss Heinlein's juveniles as books for kids. Too easy, and too simplistic. As a kid, this was my favorite book about adventures in space. I just re-read it, and was amazed at the depth of presentation in a book easily enjoyed by children. The Venusian frame of mind is both alien and understandable. The ideas of boys becoming men, confused and excited by their new surroundings is real. And the approach to civic duty that a young officer learns, and his total inability to explain it to some civilians, is heart-breakingly real."},{"Title":"Space Cadet (Ace SF, 77731)","review":"Hard to rate this book.

A great place for the younger set to be introduced to the wonderful world of science fiction. Plus... unlike some of Heinlein's books, which are geared most decidedly towards a more mature audience, this is a book that I could give to my 8 year old cousin without worrying about what he'll find inside.

I hadn't read this one in many, many years, and it didn't hold up quite as well as the one in my memory. But at any rate, in today's world, a half-century after Heinlein first published this book, I really appreciate how Heinlein hammered in the need to look with respect at those who are different from ourselves, specifically in regard to Oz's work with the Venerians. The 360 on the \\"pie with fork\\" lesson was great.I also like how the book's protagonist, Matt, isn't necessarily the sharpest pencil in the box. He works hard, he tries hard, he makes mistakes, and he tries to do the right thing. But it's often other characters who take the stereotypical hero's spotlight. I think there's an important lesson in there that Heinlein tries to impart.As is often the case, Heinlein is pretty harsh on parents, especially mothers, but I made a decision long ago that this is simply part of Heinlein's baggage, and his many positives outweigh this negative theme."},{"Title":"Space Cadet (Ace SF, 77731)","review":"I think this one was actually written more for both kids and adults . . . it's sort of a watered down Starship Troopers, but while that book was harsh and brutal, this one is much more lighthearted . . . there's some seriousness to it but it's more of the &quot;aw gee whiz I hope we make it&quot; type of deal. It follows the tale of a group of young adults who wish to join the Space Patrol, a guardian force (the quote they use as a slogan is the Latin form of &quot;Who Watches the Watchmen&quot; for those who read Alan Moore) that's fairly hard to get into (harder than the Marines, even!) . . . and so we witness the truimph and tragedy of these three or four youngsters as they go through training and more training to get to where they want to be. Most of the characters aren't what you'd call well rounded, Matt Dodson is about the best, Tex is utterly annoying, a good ol' boy redneck who if he mentioned is &quot;Uncle Bodie&quot; one more blasted time I was going to throw the book across the room, while the other two mostly are ciphers, sort of there to help the plot move along. Needless to say, the adventures they sustain are highly interesting, Heinlein interjects a lot of stuff that adults can think about, stuff about the role of a peacekeeping force, whether you can atom bomb your hometown, meaty stuff like that. The &quot;golly gee whillickers&quot; factor is pretty high unfortunately, but remember we're talking SF written for kids in the fifties, we're lucky that we have the sophication it does and Heinlein was light years ahead of just about everyone but Asimov. It winds up on Venus (again, weren't we just here in Between Planets?) and the natives there turn out to be the most interestingly worked out part . . . and even they're just tossed off. The climax comes completely out of nowhere (they can synthesize liquid oxygen . . . come on, but it was a different time kids) but it all ends happily and you can't complain that it's not entertaining.

Then I found myself remembering my reading adventures when I was 11 or 12. I would have loved this book. Even now, years later, I briefly wished that I too could join the Interplanetary Patrol and zoom around the solar system.

I remember loving it when I was a teenager. Those years are long past, but when I recently reread the novel, I recaptured at least some of the sense of wonder I felt when I read it as a kid. Science fiction has become more sophisticated in the intervening years (at least some of it has), but the art of storytelling never grows old, and Heinlein was a master storyteller.Space Cadet has a tight, engaging plot that begins with Matt Dodson joining the Space Cadets and ends with an adventure on Venus. Dodson is a strong character who would be especially appealing to teens--he's able to overcome self-doubt, gains maturity, and learns (while making use of a leave to visit his parents) that \\"you can't go home again.\\" The only other character in the novel with any personality is Matt's fellow cadet Tex, who likes to repeat his Uncle Bodie's tall tales, adding some humor to the story. The aliens Heinlein envisions living on Venus are credible (at least by 1948 standards, and in any event more credible than most of the lizard-like aliens that dominate sf movies), and the novel has something useful to say about prejudice against those who are outwardly different.Space Cadet hasn't lost much of its charm in the six-plus decades since its first publication.

It is set several decades in the future when colonies have been established on the inner planets and the moons of Jupiter. It also occurs during a time of peace for humanity.In this novel, Matthew Brooks Dodson is a young man from Des Moines, Iowa. Matt has passed the field elimination tests and is reporting to Hayworth Hall -- Academy Headquarters -- for more tests.Tex Jarman is another candidate at Hayworth Hall. Naturally, he is from Texas. He has an Uncle Bodie who has been everywhere and done everything better than anyone else . . . or so Tex says.Oscar Jenson is a candidate from Venus. His version of Basic has been influenced by the Venerians, giving it a slight hiss.Pierre Armand is a candidate from Ganymede. It took Pete two years to reach Hayworth Hall from his home.In this story, on July 1, 2075, Matt meets Tex on the slidewalk to Hayworth Hall. After reaching the building, they discover that the atrium contains the USSF Rocket Ship Kilroy Was Here, the first ship to return from Mars. While they were admiring the exhibit, Oscar and Pete join them to discuss the history.At first, the candidates are assigned randomly to double rooms. Matt finds himself rooming with Girald Burke. Although he doesn't like the cynical youth, Matt vows to hold his temper until he can arrange more compatible company.Matt finds the environment to be unlike most of his experiences, although, as a scout, he has some familiarity with communal living. The dining halls are familiar. But Tex has a run-in with the passed cadet in charge of his table.After the current round of tests are completed, remaining candidates are sworn into the Patrol. They are issued their whites and a book of regulations. Then they are taken to the PRS Randolph, the ship that is the Interplanetary Patrol Academy.On the Randolph, Matt finds his days filled with studying, drills, labs, and occasional periods of sleep. He is having trouble with astrogation and considers a transfer to the Space Marines. Then he starts performing up to standard and gets the duty of guiding another class of cadets into the Randolph.Matt has temporary duty on a bomb-rocket, followed by his first leave. He finds his home smaller and his relatives and friends very ignorant about the Patrol. Matt discovers that he has outgrown his family.This tale takes Matt, Tex and Oscar into the Asteroid Belt and then to Venus. There they respond to a call for help from Venus. To their surprise, they encounter Girald Burke on Venus.The story has some incompatibilities with Between Planet, which also includes Venusian natives. Similar incongruities occur with the Mars natives in Red Planet and Between Planets. However, the Juvenile novels are not as well integrated as the Future History series.This novel is slower paced than others in the series. The first half is mostly about Matt's academic and technical training. But the action picks up in the second half.

Heinlein book, but it is more accurate. Matthew Dodson sounds like a plain, ordinary person, and that was Heinlein's intent. Heinlein's belief always was that the backbone of America was the everyday person doing their job.Matt Dodson has joined the elite Solar Patrol. Before Matt and his friends can be officers in the Patrol they must endure rigorous, multi-part training. They begin their training on Earth in a process that eliminates many would-be Space Patrol candidates. As their training continues, Matt and his friends become members of a small group of students that have passed one test after another. Finally, the remaining students leave Earth to continue their training on a school ship. The training on the school ship starts with the mundane and ends with the complexities of calculus and nuclear physics. At long last the students move on to an operational ship where their training will help them to overcome the challenges of an actual mission on Venus, where death awaits their first wrong step!Many people call Heinlein preachy in his books. While there is probably some truth in that comment, if you think Heinlein's viewpoints had merit, you probably like the supposed preachiness. Regardless of which side you fall on, this book has little of Heinlein's explanations of the woes of the world is focuses primarily on the story.The story in this book is excellent. There is practical science in this book, but Heinlein blended the science into the story so naturally that I hardly noticed it. Those who have been through basic training and technical school in the military will recognize features of both in this book. Robert A. Heinlein was a member of the U.S. Navy for a time, which I think must have helped him to create an extremely believable story regarding the training of the members of the Space Patrol.It has been many years since I first read \\"Space Cadet.\\" I wondered whether I would enjoy the story as much now as I did decades ago. The answer is yes. I must admit that some of my enjoyment is nostalgia, but part of my enjoyment was how much Heinlein got right. There are cell phone equivalents, flat screen monitors and more. The only thing Heinlein failed to predict was the increasing lack of enthusiasm for space exploration.Heinlein wrote many good books. This one is one of his best.

It was the era of Mercury and Gemini, and to a youngster enamored of the space era, the books were a glimpse of what might be in the future.Of course with age came reality. FIrst, even when Heinlein wrote the books, I believe enough was known about the planets that it would have to have been considered highly unlikely there would be intelligent species on Venus or the moon, as in this story. And inevitably, the future would turn out very different from Heinlein's vision; no one, even a science fiction writer, has any hope of accurately forecasting events 50+ years in the future.So here we are; with the internet and other inventions Heinlein didn't imagine, and with computing power beyond his estimation; but without colonies on the moon or Mars or Venus or Ganymede, and without a Space Patrol or any other significant presence in space. Or any strong reason to believe that will be changed any time soon.When you're a kid, you want the future Heinlein imagines. And when you grow up, you might re-read the old stories, perhaps being willing to take the occasional silliness (a spaceship called \\"Kilroy Was Here\\"?!) and the redundancy (stern officers or teachers lecturing the earnest but unfocused young protagonist on how he needs to bone up on \\"simple mathematics\\" such as tensor calculus, quantum geometry, or whatever -- a scene you'll find in almost every Heinlein juvenile) in order to escape back to the more innocent and carefree days when you could dream about someday being a space cadet yourself."},{"Title":"Space Cadet (Ace SF, 77731)","review":"This is an extremely dated, simplistic story...but, as with all Heinlein books, it's well worth the reading!"},{"Title":"Generalship: Its Diseases and Their cure: A Study of the Personal Factor in Command","review":"This brief but pungent book may have gotten Fuller retired ahead of his personal schedule.

A super little bilingual story on learning how to prioritize our duties."},{"Title":"Teams At the Top","review":"In one of his several brilliant studies of leadership, Organizing Genius, Warren Bennis examines high-performance teams such as those associated with the Disney studios (which created the first full-length animation film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs), the Manhattan Project, Xerox's PARC, and Lockheed's \\"Skunk Works.\\" But if your own organization has few (if any) geniuses, what are the best strategies for unleashing the potential of both collaborative teamwork and individual leadership? Katzenbach is himself the author or co-author of a number of brilliantly conceived and executed studies, notably The Wisdom of Teams and Real Change Leaders. In this book, his central thesis is that \\"an integrated balance of real team, individual, and single-leader working group performance is both possible and desirable at the top -- not that one mode is intrinsically better than the other.\\" The key phrase is \\"integrated balance.\\" Whatever the size and nature of your organization, Katzenbach offers \\"three major messages\\":1. The best senior leadership groups are rarely a true team at the top -- although they can and do function as real teams when major, unexpected events prompt that behavior.2. Most of the team members can optimize their performance as a group by consciously working to obtain a better balance between their team and non-team efforts -- rather than by trying to become an ongoing single team.3. The secret to better balance lies in learning to integrate the discipline required for team performance with the discipline of executive (single-leader) behavior -- not in replacing one with the other.This third \\"message\\" is especially relevant to smaller companies, probably privately-owned, in which the CEO (the archetypical single-leader) is either the founder or related to the founder. In such companies, the need for an \\"integrated balance\\" may be even greater than it is for much larger organizations. Katzenbach organizes his material within nine chapters. Rather than list their titles, I have selected a few key passages which, hopefully, will suggest the potential value of this book to you and your own organization's specific needs and interests.Executive Leadership Discipline requires an individual to \\"create and maintain urgency, resolve the critical strategic issues, enforce individual accountability, leverage executive time, make the tough decisions individually, pick the best individuals for the key jobs, and periodically raise the bar.\\" (Chapter One)\\"The notion of \`leadership capacity' implies a system of leadership, if you will, that can extract leadership wisdom, insight, and behaviors from many more individuals. [This is obviously essential to concensus-building.] Thus it fuels the continuing search for different kinds of leadership approaches, both individual and joint, at all levels of the organization.\\" (Chapter Three)Team Leadership Discipline requires members to \\"create a meaningful purpose, commit to a team performance goals, be mutually accountable (no member can fail... only the team fails), commit to real work, share decision among members, strive for the right skill mix, and establish the height of the bar.\\" (Chapter Four)\\"Integrating real team performance with executive leadership performance requires both a sharp understanding of the differences between the two two disciplines required and a relentless determination to integrate the two. It is hard work, counterintuitive, and outside the comfort zone of most senior executives. Nevertheless, it is well worth the effort.\\" (Chapter Nine)In Appendix B, Katzenbach offers this definition of a real team: \\"A small number of people with complementary skills who are committed to a common purpose, performance goals, and approach for which they hold themselves mutually accountable.\\" My own opinion is that unless an organization has the two disciplines (both executive leadership and team leadership) in appropriate balance, it will probably have neither. Hopefully, this brief commentary will encourage you to read and then re-read this important book. Also, to check out the other books authored or co-authored by Katzenbach."},{"Title":"Teams At the Top","review":"The author uses Enron as an example of what can happen if his strategies are implemented. Need I say more?"},{"Title":"Teams At the Top","review":"Like many others, I picked up this book hoping to get a kernel or two of wisdom on how to consult to those at the top of the leadership pyramid. What I got was disappointing, to say the least. At minimum, this book is mistitled, because the reader is led to expect a comprehensive description about how executive teams function and create the same kind of magic we find with teams elsewhere in the organization. Instead, we are treated to page after page of exhortation, warning against a) calling an executive team a \\"real team\\"; b) encouraging CEOs to create \\"real\\" executive \\"teams\\" and c) permitting \\"undisciplined\\" teamwork at the top, lest senior executives suddenly drink the kumbya-flavored Kool-Aid of too much collaborative behavior. There is little of value in this lightly-referenced and illogically-written tome. This is not the book to take on a long plane trip as your only reading, unless you are a big fan of command and control leadership styles."},{"Title":"Teams At the Top","review":"Companies all across the economic spectrum are making use of teams. They go by a variety of names and can be found at all levels. In fact, you are likely to find the group at the very top of an organization professing to be a team. But even in the best of companies, a so-called top team seldom functions as a real team. Jon Katzenbach, states that a team effort at the top can be essential to capturing the highest performance results possible -- when the conditions are right. Good leadership requires differentiating between team and nonteam opportunities, and then acting accordingly.Three litmus tests must be passed for a team at the top to be effective. First, the team must shape collective work products -- these are tangible performance results that the group can achieve working together that surpass what the team members could have achieved working on their own. Second, the leadership role must shift, depending on the task at hand. And third, the team's members must be mutually accountable for the group's results.When these criteria can be met, senior executives should come together to achieve real team performance. When the criteria cannot be met, they should rely on the individual leadership skills that they have honed over the years."},{"Title":"Teams At the Top","review":"I was hugely disappointed with this book. It held such promise of addressing one of the most important barriers to building collaborative behavior in organizations---the behavior of the senior people.Throughout the book the author seemed to defend the hierarchical behavior of senior executives and diminish team benefits. And it completely missed the essence of teams which is collaboration. Phrases such as &quot;amorphous groups with overlapping responsibilities,&quot; &quot;disrupt the natural order of things,&quot; &quot;seldom the best way to get normal work accomplished or routine problems solved,&quot; &quot;seldom the fastest way for a group with an experienced, capable leader to get where they are going,&quot; &quot;time-consuming 'forming, norming, and storming' stuff,&quot; had me wondering if the author really understands collaboration.This book may do more to maintain the traditional topdown, hierarchical decision making model than to foster real collaboration and teamwork."},{"Title":"Legislative Entrepreneurship in the U.S. House of Representatives (Michigan Studies in Political Analysis)","review":"Wawro's book studies a critical, and often overlooked, part of the legislative process: why do members draft and push bills through the legislature? While this might sound like a question with an obvious answer, Wawro points out that legislative entrepreneurship is costly and risky behavior. So why do legislators bear the costs and risks to draft and press bills?Wawro uses a combination of theoretical and empirical studies to test for four important possible factors which might lead legislators to become policy entrepreneurs: to gain support from their constitutents, to help campaign fundraising, to facilitate their position in the legislature, and partisan explanations. While I won't ruin the punchline for interested readers, I will promise that you'll be surprised at the answers which Wawro produces.If you want to understand contemporary American politics, you'll want to read Wawro's excellent book."},{"Title":"Recipes for a Small Planet","review":"A friend gave me this book (the spiral edition) in 1973, and it truly changed my life -- I became a vegetarian immediately.

This can be done because many of the recipes call for \\"cooked rice\\" or \\"cooked peas\\". I find that this also allows you to use leftovers up quickly, in new recipes.One note, though, is that this book is not Vegan by any means.

This one sneaks up on you as you slowly find yourself caught up in the emotions of the characters, all of whose lives have been forever shaped and scarred by their experiences in WWII. Masterfully told in partial flashback, the mystery of the suicide of a parlourmaid at an Australian sheep station turns out to have profound implications for everyone involved in her life. A deeply moving and haunting novel, Mr. Shute deftly shows us how \\"Like some infernal monster, still venemous in death, a war can go on killing people for a long time after it's all over.\\"This is a stunning novel by a master storyteller. Highly recommended.NOTE: This is also published as 'The Breaking Wave'"},{"Title":"Requiem for a Wren","review":"One of Nevil Shute's best stories, second only to Town Like Alice -his greatest book (and wonderful film!)

On the day before his return, the trusted parlour maid on the station, of whom his parents were very fond, died in her room unexpectedly, causing an awkward homecomingBeginning with the pursuit of a law degree at Oxford University, the years of Alan's absence from family and homeland taught him very much, very quickly. Not surprising, he is drawn into World War-II action as a fighter pilot, risking all he has in life, just like his younger brother Bill.Also like his brother, he is attracted to the same English girl, Janet Prentice, a WREN on active duty, assigned to maintenance of ordinance used in preparation of the D-Day invasion. The terrible war has left each one with terrible losses, of which the consequences carry the reader through Alan's quest to find Janet in the years that follow its ending in 1945.In London, Viola Dawson, Janet's friend, is Alan's greatest source of information to lead him through his search.

He wrote about 20 novels between 1930 and 1960, all of which are good and a few of which are great (\\"Trustee from the Toolroom, \\"A Town Like Alice\\" and \\"On the Beach\\"). Many of Shute's books, like \\"Requiem for a Wren,\\" revolve around individuals caught up in the trauma of World War II or the post-war world. Many take place in the wide open spaces of his beloved Australia. They blend romance, adventure, sacrifice and deep sentiment (a quality I miss in our era of irony and detachment). Shute creates compelling characters -- his women are as well-drawn as his men -- who endure a lot and whose journey to hard-won wisdom is always riveting. \\"Requiem\\" is no exception. As its title suggests, it is a sad story but told with compassion and eloquence. It made me think about the unknown heroism and quiet desperation of people's lives and also about the dignity of each person's life. \\"Requiem,\\" like all of Shute's work, is a good, thought-provoking reading experience."},{"Title":"Requiem for a Wren","review":"Suffering from overbearingly cheerful friends?

There were novels of England, both during and after the war. I have not read the novels from before the war. One of his wonderful wartime novels isMost Secret, which I have reviewed elsewhere. This novel has many similarities to that one as it involves wartime England and young people who must cope with the disastrous burden of war. Both novels have a story about a dog that ends in sadness. This novel continues after the war and is the first of his Australian stories. Alan, the older son and narrator, is an RAF pilot who is shot down after D-Day, which figures very large in this story, and loses his feet. He spends months of rehabilitation, then returns home to the family sheep station at Coombargana, in south Australia. He is restless and unhappy and soon returns to England to finish his studies at Oxford. Eventually, he returns to Australia, determined to live there and take over the station from his aging parents. On the day he arrives, which is the opening of the book, his father informs him that a parlour maid at home has taken her life. No one knows why.Most of the book is then told in flashback. He is puzzled about why the girl would end her life and he searches for information about her, finding her suitcase, which she has hidden in the attic. When he opens the suitcase, he learns that she is the girl his brother Bill would have married had he not been killed shortly before D-Day. Most of the book recounts their story and his own efforts to find her in England, and eventually in America, after the war. As he searches for her, he slowly comes to the conclusion that he was in love with her himself even though he had only met her once. His search has taught him much about her life and his determination to find her grows and becomes an obsession. Defeated at last, he returns to Australia only to learn that she has been caring for his parents while concealing her own identity. Why did she commit suicide the night before he arrives ?He reads her diary and learns how she was terribly harmed by the war, by his brother's death and by the life that remained for her as she became progressively more isolated. Finally, she travels to Australia on the advice of a friendly American physician she met in England. She finds peace and contentment in her anonymous service for Bill's parents. The prospect of Alan's return threatens her exposure and she chooses to end her life the day before the man who has been searching for her arrives.A Town Like Alicehas a similar story of a search after the war but with a happy ending.The Far Countryhas a story of an English girl who comes out to Australia to visit family in the same general area as this story. Both have roughly the same setting and there are similarities in the stories. My favorites are A Town Like Alice and No Highway but this novel is now in my top three. It has a somber, melancholy tone but so did Most Secret. Shute seems to do a good job with female characters and this is another example. If you like Neville Shute, this is one of his best."},{"Title":"Requiem for a Wren","review":"I have just discovered Nevil Shute and I love his works.

The most recent BkMk book to find its way to my desk is Trish Reeves' In the Knees of the Gods. And \\"small pleasure\\" defines it almost perfectly.In the Knees of the Gods seems to have multiple personality disorder. Blurbing on the back, David Ray says \\"...this poet seems to alternate between letting it all out and not spelling it out.\\" Indeed. One wonders, amused, why such a levelheaded critique would be considered a blurb. I'd fire my publisher, or force them to fire the person who let it through. But then, I'm not on BkMk. David Ray, however, is entirely correct, and it shouldn't surprise anyone that the book's strongest points are when Reeves doesn't spell anything out, letting the simplicity of the pieces be their own power, while the book's weakest passages (which are, thankfully, concentrated in one section) are when she spends far too much time spelling out, overwhelming the power of the words themselves with artificially imposed meaning and message. Poetry is like beef; the closer you get to organic, the better it's going to be. Reeves spends most of her time allowing the words to speak for themselves, and writing very good poetry because of it. When she does the poetry-as-therapy thing, though, the book falls apart. That, however, is only temporary. It gets back on track and stays there.Recommended.

Maria explains to the child that Yemaya wears another face of the Virgin Mary, with dark skin and kind eyes, so that people who look like her can recognize her and receive her blessings. Maria explains that by bringing the child to Yemaya in the ocean, she is showing her Our Lady in her full power.There was another kind of santeria on the south side of San Antonio, where i grew up. As a child, when I asked parents and Sunday school teachers about the celebrants' strange processions, the shrines in their yards, the unfathomable usages of Christian symbols, their exotic botanicas, I was told that theirs was a sort of backwards, superstitious version of Christianity. \\"Santeria Experience\\" makes me wish that I had looked more closely and asked more questions, before it was too late."},{"Title":"Santeria Experience","review":"This book is worth the money.

This book was very good, and I read it a few years ago during a class that I had to take. Everyone had read the Diary of Anne Frank, but although this includes excerpts of hers, I was interested to know what others thought. Whether or not they were as optimistic as she was. If you are looking for a read that will give you different perspectives on how teenagers thought about the Holocaust, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"We Are Witnesses: Five Diaries of Teenagers Who Died in the Holocaust","review":"I am not a big fan of non-fiction history books. I find them hard to concentrate on because there are so many facts that they become overwhelming. But We Are Witnesses is a non-fiction history book that I liked. First, I liked it because it was set during WWII, which is something I am interested in. Secondly, this book is about five teenagers, which I can relate to because I am in the same age group. Each of their diaries was found. They all were Jewish, they all died.In We Are Witnesses there are five main characters, David Rubinowicz, Yitzhak Rudashevski, Moshe Flinker, Eva Heyman, and Anne Frank. There is a whole chapter on each one of them. They all have the same big conflict, the Nazis. The Nazis forced the Jews to move into a ghetto, and each character had to do that. They all lived in different parts of Europe. They all had money issues. But each one was unique in their own way. For example, Yitzhak joined a club that would meet and do research projects, and learn a few new things. This was Yitzhak's favorite time of day. Eva Heyman admired her mother and wanted to be just like her. Each day was a struggle to live. There was barely enough food for any of them to eat. They all had to put their faith in God, that He would save them from the power of the Nazis.Each character had their own religious beliefs but Moshe Flinker's was the most unique of all. He believed that if the Germans kept on taking over more land and the Jews kept on being killed then, when it seemed like all hope was lost, God would save the Jews from the Nazis. Moshe Flinker's story also was one that stuck out in my mind because he almost made it to Vichy France, which was a part of France that was not taken over by the Germans. Another memorable story was when David Rubinowicz was forced to move from his house and into a ghetto, but he many times was able to walk to his old house. One of the times he witnessed a Jew getting shot right in front of him.From the very beginning of the book, the author tells that all of the characters die. They all did, but their life stories will be something that you never will forget. Overall I would recommend this book to anyone who likes non-fiction history books. There were very good parts to the book but also some bad parts. The bad parts were where it got confusing. For example, when the author got into too much detail about a character's life. Also when Moshe Flinker tried to explain his religious beliefs it got very confusing. Although I knew the deaths of all the characters were certain from the beginning, I wanted to read this book because these people had to live with fear every day. But each one was strong enough to not let that fear get to them, and tried to live their lives like you and me."},{"Title":"We Are Witnesses: Five Diaries of Teenagers Who Died in the Holocaust","review":"We Are Witnesses is a book containing the diaries of five young children that lived during the holocaust. The diaries tell of how these children dealt with all of the madness going on around them. Some of the diaries broke off early in the beginning of the story. Some diaries lasted quite a while. All of the stories told of how scared these poor children were during some points of time.

As you know, the person who was in charge of the holocaust was Hitler. All the teeangers talked about hope they always had the hope to live and to have their own family. They never talked about hate, they never said they hate hitler the only thing that they said was that he was responsible for what was happening. This was shocking to me because I would hate the person who had my family killed. Wouldn't you?"},{"Title":"We Are Witnesses: Five Diaries of Teenagers Who Died in the Holocaust","review":"Have you ever wondered what life for Jewish teens was like during the Holocaust? David, Yitzhak, Moshe, Eva, and Anne were five Jewish teens who lived and died during the Holocaust. Each of their lives and deaths are captured in this book, which uses factual information and chosen portions of their diary entries to compare their experiences. Boas efficiently chooses information to show what was happening at different times and places. His choice of entries, like Anne writing \\"...in spite of everything I still think people are really good at heart,\\" supports the main theme that it is in the human nature to never give up hope. This book is very informational and eye opening, although it does not develop the five individual stories, which would make it more interesting and understandable. This book is good for anyone, but young adult readers will probably get the most out of it beacuse the main characters are young adults. This book made me want to learn more and gave me a greater understanding of the Holocaust."},{"Title":"We Are Witnesses: Five Diaries of Teenagers Who Died in the Holocaust","review":"As a teenager I was a witness to the Holocaust.

The five teenagers represent me as a Holocaust survivor and they represent millions of other teenagers that perished in the Holocaust.

We are witnesses is a book of diaries of five jewish teenagers. The five diaries belong to David Rubinowicz, Yitzhak Rudashevski, Moshe Flinker, Eva Heyman, and Anne Frank. The book tells you what the teenagers thought and felt. The book takes you through the life of the teenagers during the Holocaust. All the teens were waiting for liberation from differnt country. Yitzhak was waiting for liberation from the Russian army and Anne was waiting for the D-Day team. Some of the teens had some one special who they cared about Moshe with his secret girl and Anne with Peter. Liberation never came for any of the teens. The liberation was only days after there death. The teens all died in a concetration camp, some were exterminated, others died of sickness or hunger. This book didn't really reach me like I thought that it would.

I was expecting lengthy \\"lifts\\" from the diaries of these victim young people, with minimal commentary and filling in by the author/editor. Instead, the book presents mostly disjointed and often helter skelter reconstruction by the author, with just snippets from the actual diaries.Possibly the \\"diaries\\" weren't lengthy enough to fill out a book.

I liked how Boas described their lives and events so well that I didn't feel I missed out anywhere. I also liked how he would compare the teenagers lives and choices with the others.

The concept of a school as a learning community with a focus on the students is wonderful. This is one of the best works on the powers of total staff collaboration that I have come across. You need to read this and talk through it in a discusion group to really grasp the power of its message. The only criticism that I have is how the work of Madeline Hunter was portrayed. I believe that parts of many programs should be integrated and adapted for benefits. Madeline Hunter strongly advocated reflection for improvement and did not intend her research to be the basis for staff evaluation. I also advocate the 'clinical model' be used as part of evaluation, and cognitive coaching is a wonderful component for everyone in education to keep growing!"},{"Title":"Cognitive Coaching: A Foundation for Renaissance Schools","review":"This book establishes the advantages of the nonjudgmental, empowering experience of cognitive coaching over that of the traditional behavioristic supervisory model in the mentoring process. The three major goals of cognitive coaching are establishing and maintaining trust, facilitating mutual learning, and enhancing growth toward holonomy (individuals acting autonomously while simultaneously acting interdependently within the group). Efficacy, flexibility, craftsmanship, consciousness, and interdependence are the five states of mind that combine to provide the actualization energy of holonomy. Trust in self, trust between individuals, and trust in the coaching process are all necessary characteristics in aiding the facilitation of mutual learning. This strategy is demonstrated at the individual level with teachers and students and at the school level with administrators and teachers working in conjunction. Costa and Garmston use the concept of renaissance to describe the rebirth and redefinition of schools and a greater understanding of how we learn. They view the renaissance school as a holonomous organization that embodies all of the above principles in a value-centered, idealistic environment. While this book details cognitive coaching in the educational environment it could easily translate into the corporate or government arena. It is rich with graphs, charts, tables, and other tools that can be used in the mentoring process. The layout is similar to a textbook, which may negatively effect reading continuity, but is written in an easy, conversational style. I would recommend it as a useful primer in understanding the mentoring process at multiple user levels of student, teacher, and schools. Although in many cases the coaching relationship is between a more experience mentor and a less experienced mentee the authors also discuss the merits of peer coaching."},{"Title":"Cognitive Coaching: A Foundation for Renaissance Schools","review":"This is a fantastic book for those who are in the position coaching other educators.

This collection of devotional poetry was translated into English verse byIsrael Zangwillfrom a critical text by Professor Israel Davidson who was an authority on Hebrew poetry and Jewish liturgy.In the Introduction, Davidson discusses the scant biographical information and the nature and impact of Gabirol's timeless work, as well as those of his contemporaries. Born in Malaga in 1021 or 1022, Solomon was a prominent philosopher and poet, and a contemporary of El Cid, Spain's national hero. He belonged to the third period of Hebrew poetry in Spain.Orphaned at a young age, Gabirol spent his formative years in Saragossa and began his literary career when at about sixteen. He was supported by patrons, first Yekutiel then Samuel HaNagid. His other literary works include Biblical exegesis, Hebrew grammar, philosophy & ethics. More than 300 poems survive, half secular and half religious. Written in Arabic, only two of his more than 20 books on ethics and philosophy have survived, one of which is the famous Fountain of Life (Fons Vitae).The influence of theSefer Yetzirahon his poetry is marked, and his lyrics have a permanent appeal to the emotions, aspirations and yearning of mankind. Davidson quotes from Moses ben Ezra and Harizi, two medieval critics who appreciated his work. He concludes by affirming that Gabirol's words are a sanctuary to which the weary in heart turn for consolation, the troubled in mind for guidance and all lovers of beauty for partaking in exuberant joy.A chapter on the translation by Israel Zangwill comes next. The poems in this volume were all incorporated or designed for the liturgy of the synagogue. In them, one encounters the devotional spirit rooting itself more in individual expression than in tradition. There is a strong personal quality about them. Gabirol was the first Hebrew poet to use secular images and philosophy in his verse and also the first really great Hebrew poet to employ rhyme and meter.Before Gabirol, rhyme or meter was not used much. Biblical poetry has parallelism but it is mainly the accent that counts; in other words, it was free verse. The English translations are in rhyme in order to preserve the singing element, except for the magnificent Keter Malkut (The Royal Crown) which takes up 41 pages. The original Hebrew rhymes but has no fixed metre. A long philosophical poem, its exquisite beauty of expression complements its profundity of thought.There are 50 poems, from At The Dawn to The Royal Crown. The English versions are on the left page and the Hebrew on the right. They are most moving and spiritually uplifting, especially those dealing with the wounded heart of Israel. They are like a melody of eternal hope which brings the reader closer to God. All of them are stirring and memorable, but those I remember well after the first reading include The Messiah, Before My King, My Refuge, Ecstasy, The Redemption, God and Israel, My Lord and King, Lord of the World and Lord of Heaven.The book concludes with Notes on the Introduction, Notes on the Text (on the poems - mainly references to scripture and grammatical explanations), a Hebrew version of the previous and a short section titled Technical Payyetanic Terms in this Collection. These appear to be liturgical elements preceding prayers and benedictions, probably the same as what is called \\"antiphons\\" in Christian devotional music, for example the work ofHildegard von Bingen.For those interested in Jewish devotional music from around the world, I recommend the CDKabbalah Music: Songs of the Jewish Mysticsby Laura Wetzler. It includes three tracks from the Spanish Sephardi tradition: Kol Haneshama Meditation, Respondemos and Yom Zeh L'Yisrael.Youthby Matisyahu is a splendid example of a more contemporary and popular type of spiritual music in the Jewish tradition.Complete list of poems:At the DawnMy Soul Shall DeclareThe MessiahInvitationThree Things ConspireBefore My KingOpen the GatePour Out Thy HeartSix Years Were Decreed\`Tis Joy to MeMy RefugeEcstasyI Have Sought Thee DailyHumble of SpiritFor a MarriageThe SunThe RedemptionGod and IsraelReassuranceDuologueEstablish PeaceJudgmentPrayer for the HazzanTwo Things Have MetFor New Year's DayMy Lord and KingBlow Ye the TrumpetLet the Isles RejoiceFor the Day of MemorialGod Dwelleth HighFor Atonement EveLord of the WorldLord, What is Man?The Day of JudgmentLamentationThe Dwellers in Clay"},{"Title":"Selected religious poems of Solomon Ibn Gabirol (The Jewish Classics) (English and Hebrew Edition)","review":"Solomon Ibn Gabirol was born in Malaga, around the year 1021. When he was sixteen, he began a poem, \\"I am the Master, and Song is my slave.\\" At twenty, he composed an alphabetical, acrostic Hebrew grammar of over four hundred rhyming verses. He wrote books of moral maxims, and a philosophical treatise that married Neoplatonism to Judaism. His longest poem, \\"The Royal Crown\\", incorporates the most current knowledge of the heavens, describing the qualities and dimensions of the planets. Many of his poems have been incorporated into Jewish liturgy.It is said that, after years of wandering through Spain, he was murdered by a jealous Muslim poet, who buried him beneath the roots of a fig tree, the fruit of which became incredibly sweet. Others say he was trampled to death by a Moorish knight.The poems in this particular collection vary greatly in quality, and much of this can be laid at the feet of the translator, Israel Zangwill, whose desire to make the translations rhyme is often fatal. In spite of this, many of the poems are quite remarkable, particularly \\"The Royal Crown\\". Progressing from the Earth and outward through the solar system, Ibn Gabirol describes the successive crystal spheres, beginning each section with a phrase along the lines of \\"Who can comprehend God's greatness? For Thou hast encompassed sphere X with sphere Y.\\" Some of this is a little tedious, but as the poem progresses it contrasts the mind's power to understand the external universe with its powerlessness in understanding God and life. Some of these passages are quite effective, and are often interlaced with actual scriptural text. It's only a shame that Zangwill's language is unequal to Ibn Gabirol's ideas."},{"Title":"Selected religious poems of Solomon Ibn Gabirol (The Jewish Classics) (English and Hebrew Edition)","review":"Solomon ibn Gabirol was the greatest of the Jewish medieval poets who flourished in the golden age of Spanish-Jewish culture.

He concludes by affirming that Gabirol's words are a sanctuary to which the weary in heart turn for consolation, the troubled in mind for guidance and all lovers of beauty for partaking in exuberant joy.Then follows a chapter on the translation byIsrael Zangwill. The poems in this volume were all incorporated or designed for the liturgy of the synagogue. In them, one encounters the devotional spirit rooting itself more in individual expression than in tradition. There is a strong personal quality about them. Gabirol was the first Hebrew poet to use secular images and philosophy in his verse and also the first really great Hebrew poet to employ rhyme and metre.Before Gabirol, rhyme or metre was not used much. Biblical poetry has parallelism but it is mainly the accent that counts; in other words, it was free verse. The English translations are in rhyme in order to preserve the singing element, except for the magnificent Keter Malkut (The Royal Crown) on pp. 82 to 123. The original Hebrew rhymes but has no fixed metre. A long philosophical poem, its exquisite beauty of expression complements its profundity of thought.There are 50 poems, from At The Dawn to The Royal Crown. The English versions are on the left page and the Hebrew on the right. They are most moving and spiritually uplifting, especially those dealing with the wounded heart of Israel. They are like a melody of eternal hope which brings the reader closer to God. All of them are stirring and memorable, but those I remember well after the first reading include The Messiah, Before My King, My Refuge, Ecstasy, The Redemption, God and Israel, My Lord and King, Lord of the World and Lord of Heaven.The book concludes with Notes on the Introduction, Notes on the Text (on the poems - mainly references to scripture and grammatical explanations), a Hebrew version of the previous and a short section titled Technical Payyetanic Terms in this Collection. These appear to be liturgical elements preceding prayers and benedictions, probably the same as what is called \\"antiphons\\" in Christian devotional music, for example the work ofHildegard von Bingen.For those interested in Jewish devotional music from around the world, I recommend the CDKabbalah Music: Songs of the Jewish Mysticsby Laura Wetzler. It includes three tracks from the Spanish Sephardi tradition: Kol Haneshama Meditation, Respondemos and Yom Zeh L'Yisrael.Complete list of poems:At the DawnMy Soul Shall DeclareThe MessiahInvitationThree Things ConspireBefore My KingOpen the GatePour Out Thy HeartSix Years Were Decreed\`Tis Joy to MeMy RefugeEcstasyI Have Sought Thee DailyHumble of SpiritFor a MarriageThe SunThe RedemptionGod and IsraelReassuranceDuologueEstablish PeaceJudgmentPrayer for the HazzanTwo Things Have MetFor New Year's DayMy Lord and KingBlow Ye the TrumpetLet the Isles RejoiceFor the Day of MemorialGod Dwelleth HighFor Atonement EveLord of the WorldLord, What is Man?The Day of JudgmentLamentationThe Dwellers in ClayAlmighty GodThe Lord of HeavenAsk of MeForget Thy AfflictionTo My SoulLook up to Thy MakerInvocationBenedictionMy Heart ClamoursArise, O My RapturePassover PsalmO God, My SunThe Love of GodThe Royal Crown"},{"Title":"Selected religious poems of Solomon Ibn Gabirol (The Jewish Classics) (English and Hebrew Edition)","review":"I found it interesting.

She had my attention from that moment on. Most of us know how to lose weight, it's our attitudes that need adjusting. This book is easy to read, with helpful information on every page. I read it with a Magic Marker in my hand, marking passages to read again. It was pretty well marked up by the time I finished the book. AND, it's got to be the FIRST weight loss book I've ever read cover to cover. I highly recommend it. It's written with compassion."},{"Title":"Fattitudes: Beat Self-Defeat and Win Your War With Weight","review":"Thank you Dr. and Mrs. Wilbert for sharing your expertise and personal experience with Fattitudes! Following the process of self discovery defined by Dr. Wilbert has literally changed my life. I was at the end of my dieting rope when I joined the Fattitudes support group. I tried every fad diet, weight loss group, comercial diet center, starvation and bulemia. I measured my self worth by my body size. I had many temporary successes, but each time I regained the weight, it left me looking for the next quick fix. I felt out of control of my eating and was frustrated by my lack of will power. I grew to hate my body and myself. after a few years of doing nothing at all, I discovered the Fattitudes support group. With the help of Dr. Wilbert and fellow group members, I discovered that the war I was batteling with food actually had very little at all to do with food. I am in the process of discovering and addressing the issues which had for years led me to self defeating behaviors and attitudes. It isn't easy, it isn't fast, and my progress cannot solely be measured on a scale. I am facing my problems head on instead of medicating my heartaches with food.I highly recommend Dr. Wilbert's approach to healthy weight management. I am excited that many people with stories such as mine will find that there is hope beyond the struggle."},{"Title":"Fattitudes: Beat Self-Defeat and Win Your War With Weight","review":"The authors of the book are two practicing psychologist. They decided to write a book about what makes people tick when it comes to controlling their food intake and in turn what can you do to manage it. I am an avid reader and I also have had ups and downs with my weight so I have read a lot of health and diet books trying to find the solution that would work for me. There is nothing wrong, misleading or contradictory to any info they impart.A lot of time is spent giving short, one page or less, case studies of people who fit a particular type of problem they find causes people to turn to food. Later on in the book, they provide short exercises for you to do to help identify your specific issues. I can find nothing wrong with this particular approach to weight management as they are trying to attack the root of the problem not the results. It's another way to go so you won't find any recipes in here. They quote the standard eat right and exercise motto everyone else does.The short coming of the book is there is not enough problem solving info. I already knew why and when I eat. So parts I and II aren't going to buy me a lot. I suspect other women my age who want to get a handle on their eating are in the same boat as myself. How to effectively deal with the specific problems is not given enough effort.If you are not sure about the underlying reasons people turn to food and which of those reasons is applicable to you then this book will certainly help you identify them. If you have that already figured out and want detailed solutions on how to overcome these reasons for eating then you may not be so happy with this book."},{"Title":"Fattitudes: Beat Self-Defeat and Win Your War With Weight","review":"Finally, a book that gets to the truth of why we(professional dieters) can't get to our healthy goal weight and stay there. I always said, &quot;I want to be thin but I eat like I want to be fat.&quot; I never imagined I could have so many &quot;Fattitudes&quot; that made me want to stay fat! I know this will take some work. I don't mind this time.This is the LAST book I&quot;ll ever need for weight loss and maintenance. That is why I have HOPE in my life now."},{"Title":"Fattitudes: Beat Self-Defeat and Win Your War With Weight","review":"Have you been struggling to lose weight for a long time? Do you feel like you have it all together when suddenly you begin to sabotage yourself all over again? Do you lose and gain back the same 5 pounds over and over again? If this sounds like you, then Fattitudes may be the one diet book you need to read. Let's face it, there are literally hundreds of diet programs and books out there and most of them are effective IF you follow them. But for so many of us, dieting just doesn't work because we learn to defeat ourselves over and over again. Fattitudes doesn't tell you what to eat and how much. Instead it tells you to think about why we eat and to examine the reasons we overeat and defeat ourselves again and again. There are many exercises to do in the book, and all are thought provoking and beneficial. Before you change your body, you have to change your mind first. So I would recommend that before you buy any new diet book, Atkins, Body for Life, Sugar Busters, the Zone whichever you choose, buy this one first because it will help you to succeed."},{"Title":"Fattitudes: Beat Self-Defeat and Win Your War With Weight","review":"Finally, someone writes a comprehensive explanation of the problems compulsive overeaters face. Thanks to this book, I get it now, after reading about it for YEARS! There is a lot of work to do... and Dr. Wilbert makes you understand that the issues you face are real and buried deep within the psyche. The only magic bullet is patience and persistence. The Wilberts guide you through the work... give you direction, but the solutions are up to you to find. Believe me, this takes plenty of work, unearthing all these issues. If you have this problem, buy this book. You do the work, you get the results!"},{"Title":"Fattitudes: Beat Self-Defeat and Win Your War With Weight","review":"I've read a lot of diet books, but this is the only one that I saw myself on just about every page. It's filled with big and little insights about why we use food the way we do. I've at last come to understand the obstacles I've run into every time I've tried to lose weight in the past. It's a real eye-opener! I recommend it for anyone who has had a long term battle with weight."},{"Title":"Fattitudes: Beat Self-Defeat and Win Your War With Weight","review":"Finally a book that is written in every day language that nonprofessional people can understand. After struggling with my weight for about 10 years now, it was refreshing to read a book that MAKES SENSE! While some of the excercises are not easy, just keep with it and you too will begin to understand why you over-eat. I am not saying that I agree with all of the Wilbert's reason, but they made me look deep inside myself. (And you know, it is much easier to pass by those cookies that they have at business meetings because I now believe in me. I can do it, I can overcome.) I have combined the book with a comercial lifesytle and use elements of each to help me loose weight. I am truley grateful for the Wilbert's for writing this book."},{"Title":"Fattitudes: Beat Self-Defeat and Win Your War With Weight","review":"This book goes right to the heart of the matter - answering the question so often asked: Why do so many fail at weight loss when they know what to do? The narrative is authentic, ringing true from personal experience and case histories. Developing a new way of thinking is challenging and these authors, while providing encouragement, are realistic about the difficult road one must travel to change thought patterns. I found it very valuable."},{"Title":"Fattitudes: Beat Self-Defeat and Win Your War With Weight","review":"I've struggled for years with ups and downs with my weight and never realized how I was sabotaging myself at every step of the way. This book hit me like no other book. If you're an emotional eater like me, this is the book you need to read."},{"Title":"Fattitudes: Beat Self-Defeat and Win Your War With Weight","review":"I checked this book out of the library last summer, and while it offers a certain sort sympathy for the plight of the overweight, it really ends up at the same bottom line most eating/diet books do: Shape up and be thin like all the normal people, fatty!Parts of the book were interesting, especially when they identified that fat people who've been picked on by loved ones may not (subconsciously) want to lose weight, specifically to keep from giving their tormentors the thing that would make them happy: you don't want to reward the people who hurt you. It's a rare insight for books of this ilk.But the advice near the end of the book for keeping yourself motivated to stay on your diet contained a typical number from Self-Loathing 101: buy a great outfit in a smaller size and keep it in your closet so you'll have something to look forward to wearing. Riiiiight. Because you don't deserve to wear anything you look good in now--oh wait, you couldn't POSSIBLY look good in anything now, you big fat ugly disgusting pig. They don't come out and say this and probably aren't even consciously thinking it, but they don't need to; the desperation inherent in such an act outlines this attitude already.And a visit to the Wilberts' website reveals that they think weight-loss surgery is, in fact, a viable option--IF you have a capable surgeon and know what you're doing and have already overcome all your emotional eating issues. Oh, OK. Emotionally healthy people are very prone to having their entire digestive tracts rerouted, I hear; but personally I'm one of those unstable nutjobs who wouldn't let a doctor near my small intestine for anything stronger than a firm handshake, no matter how big the rest of me gets. (And for the record, the rest of me is quite substantial.)If you want something that will help you deal with emotional eating issues, I suggest Geneen Roth's &quot;Breaking Free From Compulsive Eating&quot; or &quot;When Women Stop Hating Their Bodies&quot; by Jane R. Hirschmann and Carol H. Munter, both of which are intensely sympathetic and neither of which have, even faintly, the admonition to lose weight and be like all the pretty people that hangs over this book like a rancid Slim Fast miasma."},{"Title":"Fattitudes: Beat Self-Defeat and Win Your War With Weight","review":"I think a great many people are aware of WHY they overeat. It's the action of changing that behavior that is the problem, and I found the solutions in this book simplistic and inadequate."},{"Title":"Airedale Terriers (KW Dog)","review":"This book's first chapter was good. It explained the complete history of Airedales. However, past page 32, they did not even mention &quot;Airedale&quot; (it was only written in the captions). There were Airedale pictures throughout, but they ended in the middle of the book. The rest seemed like an advertisement for Nylabone. In conclusion, if you are looking for a breed specific book about Airedales, I would not suggest buying this book."},{"Title":"Airedale Terriers (KW Dog)","review":"I have two Airedale Terriers,male and female.

I have bought other books on the dog that gives extra information,but this one is a must buy for anyone who owns a Airdale,or any dog.It gives all dog owners helpfull information about caring for your pet,and problems we all experience."},{"Title":"Michelin Great Lakes Regional Atlas & Travel Guide (Michelin Regional Atlas & Travel Guide Great Lakes)","review":"The layout of the book is very confusing. I studied the book 4 times before leaving home and still could not figure out the relationship of the information to the maps. The written details are in the front and the maps are in the back. The book is broken down in \\"Tours\\" of each area, but does not tell you which State or Province each tour is in. For example, Tour 2 begins with Wasaga Beach, but did not state where Wasaga Beach was. I had to use another map to locate it. And each Tour gives very few interesting places to visit. One example is Amnicon Falls in Wisconsin, just east of Duluth. They are absolutely beautiful, yet I could not find any information about them in the book. They are, however, noted on the map in the back of the book. I was interested in some of the lighthouses around the Great Lakes, and none were identified in the Tour information as places to visit. Some lighthouses were noted on the maps in the back of the book, yet Split Rock Lighthouse in Minnesota is on the cover of the book!"},{"Title":"New American Standard Gift & Award Bible; Black Imitation Leather","review":"Perfect size, nice and simple, great translation, nice concordance in the back.

It combines the most reliable ancient transcripts with the historical integrity of the Hebrew and Greek languages while maintaining the beauty of the Psalms and Songs within."},{"Title":"New American Standard Gift & Award Bible; Black Imitation Leather","review":"I actually prefer the King James because it is more referred to (more quoted and used in studies), but the New American Standard Bible is also a word for word translation, completed in 1971 by a team of over 50 evangelical scholars with doctorates in Bible languages. I sought out this version as a supplement. Sometimes I find it refreshing to read other translations of the Bible to keep my interest fresh. Other good translations also make excellent cross references.For many perhaps the King James Version is rather hard to understand. Translated in 1611, many of its words are not used in today's modern English or have changed meaning. I feel more modern translations (New American Standard Bible, New King James, New International Version...) to be great versions especially for new readers. It is also good to research your choice of translation on how true it is to the original text (word for word?, sentence for sentence? paragraph for paragraph?) and how many were involved in the translation as to keep true to the meaning of the scripture vs. one persons point of view."},{"Title":"New American Standard Gift & Award Bible; Black Imitation Leather","review":"This Bible is the new updated NASB translation. The translation is accurate, but this particular Bible has only the basics. The print is fairly cramped, and as far as extra perks go, there are a few B&amp;W maps and a small concordance.

Onto the subject at hand. The NASB is widely praised as the most literally accurate version. It does not contain the Apocrypha. But being that this is a Protestant Bible, we can't really hold that against it. The NASB is widely accepted in Protestant churches. For the most part, it is carefully literal. I consider it an interesting cross between the \\"Revised Standard\\" and the \\"New King James.\\" My one slight complaint is that it is not quite as beautifully written as the \\"Revised Standard.\\" But that said, the \\"New American Standard\\" is excellent."},{"Title":"New American Standard Gift & Award Bible; Black Imitation Leather","review":"The Bible that I purchesed is a great buy.

It's held up very nicely to a lot of usage. A very good value for the money."},{"Title":"New American Standard Gift & Award Bible; Black Imitation Leather","review":"I have noted some professional reviews on the Updated NASB. I thought it interesting that it still claims to be the most literal translation used commonly in churches. I will have to disagree. I compared the UNASB with the NKJV, the latter being, in my opinion, more literal than the UNASB, though not maybe moreso than the NASB of the 60's and 70's.Both the UNASB and NKJV provide column referencing for more literal translation when the translators were less formal in the actual text. But what I found is that the UNASB had to do this far more often than the NKJV (I became fatigued with having to look over at the reference column). And I found that in more cases, the less literal translation was less supported by the original language and more interpreted by the translators. If I was to return to NASB use, it would have to be the earlier version. I never found it difficult to read or stilted in its flow. In fact, back in the 70's and 80's when I and many believers were using the NASB, I never heard a complaint about it being a stiff translation (I think the issue points more accurately to a lessening of literacy in our country).I feet the update was not justified, for readability and certainly not for accuracy. And the earlier was certainly more accurate. For translations using Greek outside of the Received Text or Majority Text, certainly the UNASB would be the most literal, 2nd to its predecessor. But compared translation for translation, the NKJV is more literal and less interpreted in the text itself.Finally, it sometimes takes on the words and phrasing of the NIV, which is dynamic equivalence (i.e., interpreted, not translated) in a high percentage of passages."},{"Title":"New American Standard Gift & Award Bible; Black Imitation Leather","review":"The structure of the text is messed up, because they started every verse on its own new line. Sure, paragraphs are marked by bolding the verse number, but it would be ideal to be able to simply look at the page and see the flow of the text, where the pericopes and paragraphs lay, etc. I don't know why they did this; i would think it would save space to start the next verse right after the previous one, if that is indeed the way it runs in the original (as the structure has been approximated and passed down).Also I think there are some errors in Nathaniel's review above; in Gen. 4:1 the text does not literally say \\"even Yahweh\\"; the word before \\"Yahweh\\" is \\"et,\\" which can be a direct object marker OR a preposition meaning \\"with\\"! Also, the Septuagint (Greek translation of OT) has \\"dia tou theou\\" (\\"through God\\"), which is support (from tradition anyway) for taking the \\"et\\" as a preposition, not a direct object marker here. And the Greek present tense does not always denote a progressive action, especially in non-indicative moods. The english translation \\"Knock,\\" \\"seek,\\" etc. can even be understood in english as *implying* a continual action.That's what is good about the NAS; they don't force a certain view of the Greek, but will translate it literally in all its vagueness, allowing for one to see better what the different exegetical options are. E.g., NAS may render \\"body of glory\\" (Phil. 3:21) while NIV \\"glorious body,\\" forcing the relationship between \\"body\\" and \\"glory\\" in the Greek to be adjectival, whereas that is just one of many options open in looking at the Greek. \\"body of glory\\" for instance could also mean that the body is a \\"glory-body,\\" something constituted in a sense by \\"glorified substance.\\" One doesn't need to know Greek to figure out these options either; whatever relations one can think of could apply between two words joined with \\"of\\" could probably work.I gave this a one-star rating because this one issue makes this IMO not worth using, not because all the other aspects of the product are bad (they aren't); I'll try and get a new NAS that looks like an actual text and not a disjointed list of proverbs."},{"Title":"New American Standard Gift & Award Bible; Black Imitation Leather","review":"The product showed up at my door step ahead of schedule and was brand new!

For my daily bible reading I use the ESV for no other reason but just because of its easiness to read. But I would disagree that the NASB is difficult to read as I have heard from many people on the internet. I actually find my self picking up this NASB bible almost every day and reading from it. Sometimes I will read a passage from the ESV And then pick up this NASB and compare translations just out of curiosity and never do I find doctrinal or meaning differences between the two translations.This bible comes with a very nice incrimination leather cover that has glossy look to it with golden edge pages and the paper inside is not bright white which is nice because it gives it more of a classic bible feel to it. It may feel a bit stiff at first but just like a baseball glove start braking it in by bending it around your thighs every 100 pages or so and eventually the book will bend and open like real leather.For $9 bucks you can't go wrong if it falls apart for another $9 bucks you can buy another bible. I have never bought an expensive bible and never paid no more than $20 for a bible except for the MacArthur Study Bible and at the end all that matters to me is that all the words are in the bible and that they are accurately translated from the original text which is what the NASB does very well."},{"Title":"New American Standard Gift & Award Bible; Black Imitation Leather","review":"I bought 4 of these Bibles (same ISBN) at a local Christian bookstore.

It's Black, it has gold edged pages, it says Bible and the version on the cover. Now that may not be important to everyone, but as there are so many Bibles these days that could fit in a shelf next to a novel and blend in I found these features very important. Its authoritative.Also, I believe that all of the words in the Bible are divinely inspired so a Bible having the words of Jesus in Red (this one doesn't) give less importance to the other words. The first few pages allows for a giver, and receivers name,and a date. I highly reccommend it."},{"Title":"New American Standard Gift & Award Bible; Black Imitation Leather","review":"Most readers come to the Bible for the first time with high expectations. People naturally assume that any book written by God must be a good one. Maybe explain the meaning of life. The nature of good and evil. The mystery of death. The path to finding true love, or hope for the future, or elevated self-esteem, maybe even a successful weight-loss plan. Whatever. Then they start reading ... and they always quit about halfway through the second book, aptly named Exodus. If you have never read the third book, Leviticus, which you probably haven't, go ahead, give it a try, it's a cure for insomnia. No one but a rabbi, or a Levite, has ever made it through the book of Leviticus without major skimming.The New Testament is a volume that everyone should read, once, but talk about a bad case of sequelitis! Ouch! The less said about the New Testament, the better. Half the books therein were dictated by the holy Ghost to the apostle Paul, a.k.a. Saint Knucklehead, who was the most boring windbag I have ever known, except maybe Fidel Castro. I would rather read a year's worth of C-Span transcripts than to slog once more through Saint Paul's thirteen tedious epistles. Paul was not without talent and drive. But if the holy Ghost ever exhibited any real promise as a writer of prose nonfiction, he was ruined by the apostle Paul.Surprising fact: the Holy Bible, Old and New, remains the best-selling book of all time. In some places, especially in the United States, the Bible still outsells J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter books. In America, God has sold more copies of His two-volume book than McDonald's has sold of its Big 'N' Tasty double cheeseburger. According to statistics supplied by Wycliffe International, the Society of Gideons, and the International Bible Society, nearly a quarter million new Bibles are sold or given as gifts in the United States every day. Which goes far toward explaining what happened to the Earth's rain forest. But your typical Holy Bible is purchased for a carry-to-church item, or for coffee-table decor. No one ever actually reads it, not even in the United States of America.Am I wrong? Okay, perhaps you have read it. If so, you're an exceptional human being. It's not impossible: your average reader can get through both Testaments, without skimming, in about seventy hours. But truthfully, almost no one ever has ever read the Word of God from cover to cover except elderly nuns, and the occasional Christian adolescent who reads it through for sheer penance, to punish himself for having downloaded erotic pictures from the Internet, and ... but never mind."},{"Title":"Birthing Ways - Healing Ways","review":"The tips for first time mom and dad are very helpful.I followed them all and our birth is a breeze."},{"Title":"Birthing Ways - Healing Ways","review":"This book is a must for first time mothers.

There is just enough soccer to make it exciting and just enough love to make it real and personal. The soccer games never got boring, and the love was never sappy. Mr. Ozturk's expertise on soccer and excellent writing come through strongly in every page. I strongly recommend this book to the hardcore soccer fan, the young athlete, the emotional reader, and everyone in between."},{"Title":"Three Lions Roar: A Novel Of World Cup 2006","review":"I just finished to read Three Lions Roar.It is amazing!

Narrated by a young author, Vanya, who has just released his first novel (which bears an obvious resemblance to Dostoevsky's own first novel, Poor Folk, making me wonder how much of the story might be autobiographical), it consists of two gradually converging subplots. One deals with Vanya's close friend and former love object, Natasha, who has left her family to live with her new lover, Alyosha. Alyosha is the saintly but dimwitted son of Prince Valkovsky, who hopes to gain financially by marrying Alyosha off to an heiress, Katya. Valkovsky's cruel machinations to break up Alyosha and Natasha make him one of the most memorable &quot;predatory types&quot; (a la Stavrogin in The Possessed) that Dostoevsky created. The other branch of the plot deals with the approximately 13-year old orphan Nellie, whom Vanya saves from an abusive household by taking her into his apartment, and whose deceased mother's story in some ways parallels that of Natasha. It's unusual to see a well-developed character as young as Nellie in a Dostoevsky novel, but Nellie may be one of his most moving creations, and she in particular shows the influence of Dickens (whom Dostoevsky is known to have read during the Siberian exile near the end of which this novel was conceived).The Insulted and Injured could justly be criticized for melodrama, as the characters' behavior is a bit too extreme to be believed. There's not even a hint of jealousy anywhere in the love quadrilateral between Vanya, Natasha, Alyosha, and Katya, as none of them want anything other than the happiness of their beloved--whether that happiness is with someone else is utterly (and unrealistically) immaterial to them. Also, at the other end of the spectrum, Prince Valkovsky is rather implausibly evil, especially toward his own son, who though not exactly brilliant has done nothing to justify Valkovsky's cruelty. However, these extreme charcters make the novel very emotionally involving and didn't realy bother me while I was reading it, though of course your mileage may vary.One of the most important themes throughout Dostoevsky's work is the expiative value of suffering, and The Insulted and Injured, with its tragically moving plot and characters, develops that theme splendidly. At this writing, unfortunately, Amazon lists it as unavailable; hopefully that will change soon. (Also, although at present the out-of-print search service isn't offered for this translation, it is available for a translation under the title &quot;The Insulted and Humiliated,&quot; so you might try searching under that title.)"},{"Title":"The Insulted and Injured","review":"Disregarding the literary merits of Dostoevsky's novel, the editing of this book is dreadful, to say the least. From the bizarre blurb (\\"Vanya has a crush on Natasha\\"...\\"probably literally an homage to Dickens\\"...\\"Anyway, Vanya saves from an abusive household\\") the editors demonstrate a disconnected grasp of grammatical and linguistic structure, which disintegrates further throughout the text.A typical example of this blatant lack of proofreading reads as follows:\\"How is Natalya Nikolaevna? Is she at home I inquired of the anxious lady.(The quotation never reaches a conclusion). Similarly, there are several instances of typographical punctuation errors (\\"I less than any,.\\") as well as a general lack of grammatical syntax.For a so-called classic, the editors of this book have either lazily failed to do the text justice by omitting neccessary linguistic features, or the editing has in fact been completed by a panel of inebriated armadillos."},{"Title":"Reflections on Grief and Spiritual Growth","review":"The Scriptures tells us that loss and grief are universal human experiences and the process of mourning is often prolonged, painful, and emotionally complex. The writer of Ecclesiastes reminds us that grief comes to all of us: \\"There is a time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance\\" (Eccl. 3:4). In the letter to the Romans, we are instructed to \\"Mourn with those who mourn\\" (Romans 12:15).Annually over 2.4 million people die in the United States. There are over 800,000 new widows and widowers each year. Other losses triggering grief include divorce, separation, retirement, miscarriage, sudden job loss, and serious illness (such as Alzheimer's disease) that results in the loss of a person long before physical death occurs. For every individual who dies or departs mentally, many are left behind to grieve. Millions of these sorrowing people seek spiritual guidance in dealing with their loss.Religious faith can help us deal with the death of a loved one. Several studies in diverse populations have shown a positive relationship between religious involvement and a successful response to the loss of a family member or close friend. Researchers discovered that there is a strong link between positive psychological adjustment to a death and one's ability to make sense of the loss through one's faith and religious practices. Religious faith helps those who are mourning make sense of the death and the experience of mourning.Reflections on Grief and Spiritual Growth -- offers a three-way conversation between the reader's experiences of loss, a living relationship with God, and the reflections of 19 Protestant and Catholic writers who make sense of their own grief in light of their faith. The contributors include Herbert Anderson, Paschal Baumstein, Duane R. Bidwell, Mary Louise Bringle, Joseph R. Jeter, Jr., Charles Merrick, Donald E. Messer, Rebecca Miles, Bonnie J. Miller-McLemore, R. Esteban Montilla, Basil Pennington, Donna Schaper, Don Shelby, Karen Stone, David Switzer, James M. Wall, Hal Weidner.They respond to such questions as: What happened to you and your spiritual life when death visited you and your family? What lessons and wisdom can be shared about your personal experiences with grief? In what ways did these losses shape your life? What counsel does our Christian heritage offer as we grieve the loss of a parent, spouse, child, marriage, job or health? Have spiritual resources been helpful in addressing the anger, guilt and depression that is often a part of the grieving process? Have you experienced spiritual growth or transformation from these losses? How has faith been an asset as you face the increasing and cumulative losses of growing older?The writers are reflective and personal, wise and full of passion. They offer original and insightful lessons about the changes and challenges of grieving. The results are a blessing."},{"Title":"The new industrial state / Galbraith, John Kenneth","review":"If only the present Federal Reserve Chairman as well as the past and Furture Chairpersons could read and understand this book, the economic turmoils could be muted.

Eighteen-year-old Tyrone Larson is a high school senior with a passion for science. Having grown up with a not-so-hot home life, he's armed with a cynical personality and smart-mouth attitude.Tyrone's story focuses on the events that lead up to the death of his friend, Sammy. With everything from school, friends, and girls, to his own involvement in Sammy's death, Tyrone must sort through life to discover who he is and what life is really about.I definitely enjoyed this book. It was probably my favorite part of the series, probably because of Tyrone's love for science.

They love the Degrees of Guilt series! It touches their world. I highly reccommed it for any teenager. This book is my favorite of the three. It touches what it feels like to not fit in and to have your life a mess. It also shows how easily you can fall into wrong choices that lead to severe consequences.I think any teen would like it and relate to it. I liked it myself as an adult. It is very true to the teen world."},{"Title":"Degrees of Guilt: Tyrone's Story","review":"This book is about a person named Tyrone who a friend from school has named Sammy who supposedly died from being hit by a car at a party. The story follows Tyrone as the police question him, who thinks that he had something to do with the death of Sammy. Tyrone's friend or now ex- friend fled after Sammy's death, back to Hazard County Kentucky, where a life long of criminal relatives live. The police also think Hale, the friend from Hazard County, also had something to do with the death. There on, you find out if a car really hit Sammy and see if Tyrone and hale maybe were involved.What I liked about this book is how you wonder and how it makes you think about if something really did happen to Sammy. If a car did not hit him, then what really happened? I also like how it also tells about Tyrone's life, because Tyrone's life kind of fits into the story in a way. It is not all about Sammy and it is not all about Tyrone. Some things I disliked about the book is how Tyrone talks so much about since and some of it didn't make much sense. In addition, they somewhat over loaded it a little bit. Another thing I do like in the book is it talks about god a little bit every once in awhile and I thought that was great.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a little mystery and who likes to think when he or she read books, such as trying to figure out what really happened."},{"Title":"Introductory Circuits for Electrical and Computer Engineering","review":"I'm sorry to say this but this book is absolutely horrible.

The only possible explanation I can think of that would explain the use of this book, is if the class is intended to 'weed out' 90 percent of the students. This is by far the most terrible excuse for a textbook I have ever seen. It teaches the most basic concepts of circuits, but yet it practically assumes you already know them, because it doesn't bother to work any examples out. If these authors were teaching nuclear physics, they would give you an intimidating equation, hand you a chunk of uranium, and expect you to build a power plant without hurting yourself. I have found countless typos (I might mention that I own the 6th edition), several problems that even my professor claims are incorrect, and most of all, I cannot follow the logic presented whatsoever. I have taken many classes that were extremely difficult, and for the most part, I have done well. However, this book presents material that is trivial in comparison, but the book goes right over my head. Only after the professor 'decodes' the text can I understand what the authors intended to say. I will also add that I took 4 semesters of calculus through a distance learning class where I had no instructor at all and got As in all of those classes. I am perfectly capable of understanding a well written book. This book is truly so poor, I would be impressed if Einstein himself didn't scratch his eyebrows off after reading it.Please, for the love of all things sacred, complain to everyone you know about this textbook so it can disappear from the shelves of University bookstores."},{"Title":"Introductory Circuits for Electrical and Computer Engineering","review":"I'm a second year EE engineering student with 20 years of electronics background in repairing, circuit analysis, and troubleshooting.

It is essential not only for electrical and computer engineers. Electrical models describe many mechanical and biological systems and the skills of solving linear time invariant electronic circuits are similar to the skills required to solve any linear time invariant system, which is an essential skill for any engineer and rigorous scientists.This is currently the ultimate textbook about basic electronic circuits.It starts from the beginning, describes the basic circuits variables and elements, i.e., Voltage, Current sources and resistors and then shows the basic circuits analysis techniques and the general ones (Nodes and Mesh analysis). First only resistive circuits are used in order to establish the basic circuits analysis techniques and then Inductors and Capacitors are introduced with description of the transient step response and the steady state response with Phasors. Other chapters describe the op-amp and Laplace transform.Unfortunately the authors had chosen to sacrifice some important issues for the sake of simplicity: (1) Matrix notation is avoided and therefore one had to use tricks such as super-node in a section called \\"some special cases\\". The general methods with matrix notation (as developed in the good old texts of Desoer and Kuh) are important for computer implementation and moreover to prove the network theorems (Superposition Thevenin-Norton, Tellegen). (2) It is advisable to stress upfront that Kirchhoff's laws hold for lamped circuits and explain this notion. This is most important since modern electronic circuits work in high frequencies and in such cases the methods described in this book may not hold. (3) In the same way, many practical circuits are not linear and it should be clearly stated which method and technique hold also for nonlinear circuits. In the leading universities the instructors rigorously refer to the three points above and I hope that future editions of this text would include them either in the main text or as appendixes.This textbook is well pedagogically written with practical perspective at the beginning of each chapter to motivate the reader. It also includes exercises with Pspice and Matlab and problems with some partial numerical solutions.Altogether, this is a concise textbook, which is recommended as a one-semester textbook to achieve a basic appreciation of circuit theory and learn the essential skills required for any engineer and rigorous scientists."},{"Title":"Introductory Circuits for Electrical and Computer Engineering","review":"This is the best book for an introdutory course on electric circuits.

People with sexual addictions are not going to be helped by such bible-thumping judgments. So much talk of sin will only lead to more shame, not less. As Schaumburg recognizes that shame is such a large part of sexual addiction, you would think he would have avoided such heavy-handednessBesides, one has to assume that anyone bothering to read such a book already knows he/she has a problem. If they don't know, this will probably not convince them - it will only make them tune Shaumburg out as a throw-back to the '50s. It really is too bad, because the section concerning how to prevent sexual addiction in their child is very good."},{"Title":"False Intimacy: Understanding the Struggle of Sexual Addiction (LifeChange)","review":"This book was a complete turnoff. Instead of relating to scientific, psycological explanations of sexual addiction, the author blames everything on lack of closeness with God and not being saved by Jesus Christ.

What a waste of time and money. Pure garbage. Now I need to buy another book to find out about my sexual addiction (psycologically) not spiritually."},{"Title":"False Intimacy: Understanding the Struggle of Sexual Addiction (LifeChange)","review":"Sexuality is a charged subject and when you add religion into the mix it gets interesting, but add Fundamentalism, legalism, and a perverted view of God given sex, and you get a witches brew. While the Bible and the N.T. has a healthy view of sex for the most part, it didn't take long for self-righteous holier-than-thou legalists to make a hatred for sex and sexuality a merit badge for &quot;real&quot; Christianity. Some of the early church fathers taught that all sex was evil. [They themselves were doctrinal heretic perverts] Others encouraged men to cut of their testicles and in some cases their penises. &quot;Chastity&quot; became a hallmark of &quot;holiness&quot; [a word that simply means 'dedication to a god'] but many forgot that the temple prostitutes were also considered holy or dedicated to their god. Late &quot;fathers&quot; like Augustine made any sexual aspect of life a horrible crime. While early Roman Catholic priests were married, the heresy of celibacy took hold and like a cancer conquered a whole belief system. The modern Christian church has also had a huge hangup over sexuality, with some misanthrope Fundamentalists very recently teaching that oral sex in marriage was &quot;immoral.&quot; The denominations with the biggest anti-sex theologies turn out the worst violators, witness the AG (Assembly of God) which gave us the tasteless HYPOCRITE degenerate Jimmy &quot;anti-Jesus rock&quot; Swaggert and Jim Baker. Swaggert was exposed by a preacher he had &quot;outted&quot; for sexual immorality. Ah isn't justice sweet. This book is supposed to deal with sexual addiction, which the author tells us is that which controls one's life. Obsession, in actions or thoughts, is wrong. But there is much more here. A quick reading of the thesis showed me many inconsistencies. This book is by a religious author, on a religious imprint, for a religious readership. Yet he blames sexual sin &quot;as a refusal to depend on God as the only source of true fulfillment...&quot; (!) [p.60] While he is right that all 'sin' [Gk. missing the mark] in essence is autonomy from God, many of the subjects/sinners are supposedly Christian. The author, like many sex-hating fundamentalists lays a guilt trip, no matter what a person does or doesn't do."},{"Title":"False Intimacy: Understanding the Struggle of Sexual Addiction (LifeChange)","review":"I have been denying my problem with sexual addiction for 35 years. False Intimacy has not only shown me my denial, but pointed me toward true intimacy with God as the starting point for having close relationships with other people.

If you are an addict, think you might be, or are just unsure about what it means to have a close/intimate relationship with God and with your spouse, you need to get this book."},{"Title":"False Intimacy: Understanding the Struggle of Sexual Addiction (LifeChange)","review":"I've been reading various books and Internet resources about sexual sin and addiction -- this one demonstrates far more appreciation of the deep complexities and mysteries of the spiritual aspects of this issue. There's not even a hint of the kind of cheap, quick fix that some other books claim. Along with that, Schaumberg's emphasis on our willingness and ability to accept the nature of this world earned my respect. I highly recommend it to those who are looking for understanding in a spiritual context. For obvious reasons, I'm posting this anonymously, but I want readers of this review to recognize that they probably already know people who are quietly struggling too, so I'll identify myself as a successful high-tech executive, often speaking in public and in the news.

I read Harry's first book after being confronted with an act of voyeurism. I was especially struck to the core of my heart and conscience by his profound, yet quite simple, approach to bringing the addict to the point of compliance with God and His design for redeemed men. It was on a Sunday afternoon in October, 1995, that I was reading this book. In the back of False Intimacy, I noticed Harry's counseling advertisements. I was desperate and needed help, not only for my own sanity, but for the saving of my marriage. Just 2 weeks later, I went with my wife to a 5-day Intensive Counseling course at Harry's offices in Colorado Springs, CO. &quot; Very intense&quot; is hardly the phrase to describe it. Harry made me realize that I was a very shallow and ho! llow person. The bottom line is that we Christian men have a reluctance to initiate and maintain an intimate relationship with God. I had a lot to work out, and I am still working my way out of sexual addiction and experiencing increasing sobriety from this sinful lifestye. Harry is a talented, qualified professional, whose writings get to the core of the problem, from a spiritual perspective, because that is wherein the problem lies--sex addicts have a sin problem, which only God, according to Harry, can rectify. I recommend this book to men in the Church, especially, who struggle with this area. Thanks, Harry, I am hanging in there."},{"Title":"False Intimacy: Understanding the Struggle of Sexual Addiction (LifeChange)","review":"You don't have to be sexually &quot;addicted&quot; to benefit from this book. Most of the men that I know, (including myself) struggle with sexual fantasies, temptations to lust, etc. but do not fit the clinical definition of being sexually &quot;addicted.&quot; Yet our sexual struggles serve a function in a dysfunctional way. We long for intimacy and deep meaninguful connection, yet we tend to be terrified of it at the same time. Real connection makes us too vulnerable! So it becomes easy to retreat to the safe world of sexual fantasy. Harry's book calls us to face into the heart of our sexual problems, which is our own hearts. Real intimacy (including sexual intimacy) is wonderful, frightening, scary, confusing and frustratingly fleeting at times, but it is worth it. Harry's book should be required reading in all church men's groups and seminaries."},{"Title":"False Intimacy: Understanding the Struggle of Sexual Addiction (LifeChange)","review":"After reading some of the responses, it becomes obvious that few people understand the point of reference Harry Schaumburg begins with. First, he is a Christian. So, if you are not a Christian, you will not appreciate the spiritual understanding and depth into addiction he describes. One reviewer states that the author is a fundamentalist hater of sex. Ha! I have actually met Harry and that is sooooooooo far from the truth. Harry Schaumburg presents a healthy view of sex. Period. And the healthiest view stems from the Bible itself. Man...Woman...Monogomy. Period. If you go into the book expecting some &quot;I'm okay, you're okay.&quot; Then you will hate it. To fully appreciate sex, one has to understand more deeply the created order and its implications. Harry addresses this and does not assume some feel-good pop psychology stance. Harry addresses the implications of deviating from the created order and purposes. Anyone looking for some type of affirmation for their sexual deviance, or looking for some explanation outside of scripture, needs to save their money and instead sign up for a pop culture feel-good seminar given by...perhaps, a sex therapist who is divorced, miserable, but fully competent in telling you how to conduct your sex life."},{"Title":"False Intimacy: Understanding the Struggle of Sexual Addiction (LifeChange)","review":"The author holds a strongly Christian-based approach to treatment of sex addiction. In many ways, this perspective is not wholly incompatible with 12-step approaches, although he makes only passing, and not entirely favorable reference to SA, SLAA, etc. He speaks from an obviously seasoned vantage point as an experienced clinician, and his work seems particularly geared toward members of the ministry who present themselves for treament of sexually compulsive behaviors. He holds most Christians to task for faulty beliefs, and he's not afraid to pull punches: &quot;Ron admitted his adultery........'And you deserve to die for this!' I added.&quot; This was said in a calculated manner to remove all ego defenses from an addict and co-addict spouse, and in lesser hands such a style could lead to devastating results. Schaumberg obviously knows what he's doing, although his logic is not carried convincingly in places, (&quot;Human remorse is actually subtle rebellion against God&quot;) and seems poorly applicable to non-Christians. But for those to whom it's directed, this book will serve where more secular readings (Carnes, et. al.) won't reach. Christian sex addicts will also find the various books of Doug Weiss to be useful."},{"Title":"False Intimacy: Understanding the Struggle of Sexual Addiction (LifeChange)","review":"I recommend \\"False Intimacy\\" more than other books to those men who are battling the behavior of sexual addiction, but who also desperately want change at the source of the struggle and not just in the expression of the struggle (although that is critical). Dr. Schaumburg does the best job that I've seen of exploring the actual motivational power of sexual addiction, which in the end is not essentially sexual. He also has an excellent chapter for the spouse of the sex addict and another regarding marriage in this context. Few books on this subject adequately expose what is really going on below the behavioral and psychological patterns, but there will be no meaningful freedom at a heart level without facing what ultimately fuels the shame and acting-out cycle. Clearly this is a more complex and less popular approach (that's probably why so few books go there), but any other approach to this problem seems to me like \\"bringing a knife to a gun fight.\\" I recommend this book and the journey it invites the reader to take in their soul - whether a sex addict or not."},{"Title":"False Intimacy: Understanding the Struggle of Sexual Addiction (LifeChange)","review":"This book is for all who want to know about sexual addictions and how to deal with it. If you have a sexual addiction, this book will help you understand the addiction and get the help you need. If you have been hurt by a spouse who has a sexual addiction, this book will help also. But this book will help all people because all of us have been decieved by false intimacy, married or not. The best part of this book is the fact that the author tells it like it is. Sexual addiction comes from the heart of all people, which the Word of God tells us that it's evil. This book is biblical in it's understanding of humans, and it's persecptives on this issue. He points people to come to the Lord, and that he is the only one that can cure the root of all evil, the human heart. The gospel is preached and the misconceptions in the Christian church is addressed. The only problem with this book, is theolocially he errs in one line. When he siad that God became sin for us, while I understand what he was getting at. He use the wrong choices of worlds, for Jesus didn't become sin, he was the sin bearer, not sin itself. Thus, every Christian who is involed in ministry for this stuff, like Christian counselors etc. should read this book. Lay person as well. All who desire real intimacy with anyone, husband with wife, father and son, etc. Great book I plan to read it again and in the future..If you want your marriage to step to the next level, even if you don't have a sexual addiction, you still may be living in a false intimacy, even if you been married 20 years.

You may notice that it seldom gives compact, concise definition for its concepts -- instead you have to read the whole thing and think it through. If you do, you will likely find reading this book a life-changing and valuable experience.I'll add that I later went to a 10 day intensive counseling session with Dr. Schaumburg, and my experiences there confirmed my impression from the book: that he knows exactly what he's talking about from both the psychological and spiritual standpoints, and can cut straight to the real issues.I highly recommend this book, whether you fit any particular label or not."},{"Title":"False Intimacy: Understanding the Struggle of Sexual Addiction (LifeChange)","review":"This is a very comprehensive book about Sexual Addiction.

What I appreciated the most about this book in particular is the fact that it maintains a high degree of dignity towards the 'spouse' of the sexually addicted person.

How sad and how long is the church going to stick its head in the sand and act like this problem doesn't exist in our fellowships? This is the reason so many people suffer (addicts and their spouses) because clergy, doctors, and counselors are choosing to stay ignorant on this rapidly growing addiction. I applaud Dr. Schaumburg for his research and honesty in the help of understanding this baffling (disease,sin,addiction....)and how it is destroying our marriages. There is hope, my husband is proof of that and this book helped both of us understand and seek out professional help with specialized SA therapy."},{"Title":"False Intimacy: Understanding the Struggle of Sexual Addiction (LifeChange)","review":"This is a book, not only for those who have a sexual addiction, but any addiction.

For those suffering from sexual addiction or for their partners who are looking for some peace, please do not invest in this propaganda. This book is not based on the science of either psychology or sexual health and is nothing more than the worst aspect of religious dogma and will ultimately result in further suffering. This type of hate mongering, intolerant, uneducated mindset is what has led to many of history's most devastating atrocities, done in the name of \\"God.\\" A basic ethic of psychology and counseling is that that counselor or professional does not impose his or her own values upon their patients.

He doesn't approach the subject deeply and gives only a glimpse about the problem and ways of solution (in a espiritual councelor view), then he asks us to go to a councelor. So i think it is better idea to go directly to the councelor instead of spending money with this book. Chapter 7 (about sexual addiction in the church) is really an exception because it presents the matter in a deep and intelligent way."},{"Title":"False Intimacy: Understanding the Struggle of Sexual Addiction (LifeChange)","review":"Ave read several good books on sex addiction and one thing I can say is that this book is loaded with prayers! It has a penetrating effect that only the Spirit of God can bring forth. Harry focuses on the one neglected aspect of the problem, namely it is essentially a spiritual problem and that treating the behaviour doesn't heal the cause.The cause is sin as Harry says, man's desire for autonomy from God. There are other aspects to consider, like the body addiction to the chemical released at orgasm, the psychological wounds that we try to medicate with the addiction and of course the forces of evil.It is an excellent book, I have it marked all over the place which I almost never do to any of the books I buy. But this has such nuggets of truth, that you can't help but mark it 'cos you know you will read the book again. This book is loaded with prayers and with your own prayers, a healing will begin.

This book is painfully honest and not for the faint of heart. The author has a profound understanding of this affliction and strips it down to the ugly truth of how lost souls lose hope and how precious lives are destroyed. If you are searching for insight about sexual addiction, I highly recommend this book. It broke my heart and gave me deep compassion for the people in my life who struggle with false intimacy issues. For the sex addict searching for honesty and hope, this should be required reading.The subject matter being what it is, I found it hard to read this book without feeling filthy and even more wounded. Wives of sex addicts will not find healing within these pages (only God can heal something so painful). However, they will find answers. Several chapters address strategies that might help affected loved ones. For the wives of sex addicts, I also recommend Lord Heal My Hurts by Kay Arthur or Every Heart Restored by Stephen Arterburn."},{"Title":"False Intimacy: Understanding the Struggle of Sexual Addiction (LifeChange)","review":"The book, False Intimacy, arrived in excellent condition and it's content is truly amazing and informative.

This 1979 book, \\"America Revised,\\" turns her analytical capabilities on the manner in which we have understood our own history. She traces the evolution of the development of history textbooks and the debates over them through the years. The result is a fascinating portrait of the manner in which we define ourselves by what we teach our children about our past.What FitzGerald finds is that for most people the history taught in secondary, and even universities, was consciously constructed to enhance the citizenship of the populace. The definition of enhanced citizenship might differ in time and space, but fundamentally it has emphasized a traditional vision of the American past in which a consensus interpretation--a one nation, one people emphasis--has been the norm rather than a story that is filled with conflict and counter narratives.The fierceness of the debate over what is contained in history textbooks, and therefore what is taught in school, results from the need to redefine national identity and a concern that the bulwarks of traditional conceptions may be crumbling. This has recast historical inquiry as an intellectual battleground where the casualties are no longer theories about the past that matter mostly to historians but the overall \\"weltanschauung\\" of society in a post-modern, multicultural, anti-hierarchical age.Since the 1960s, as FitzGerald makes clear, Americans have been seeking to understand an identity that is more multicultural, less hierarchical, and decidedly partisan. It was a coordinated effort. The author highlights the work of one group of reformers known as \\"The New Social Studies Movement,\\" which urged the teaching of a more varied form of history in which race, ethnicity, class, and gender emerged as core areas of analysis. This represented, according to FitzGerald, \\"the most dramatic rewriting of history ever to take place\\" in America (p. 58).In contrast, throughout most of American history, albeit with some challenge over time, most Americans have viewed their past as exceptionalistic, nationalistic, and triumphant. This consensus interpretation celebrated the long tradition of shared American ideals and values while de-emphasizing conflict, and that made the United States and the people that made it up somehow better. Its advocates questioned the ideas and people who challenged those cherished principles, seeing in many of them strains of authoritarianism, anarchy, and narrow- and simple-mindedness of all varieties.\\"America Revised\\" is a powerful exploration of the politics of history textbook writing, publishing, and adoption. It also helps to show how the politics of history affect our children and educational system. Quintessential historian C. Vann Woodward commented on this important book in \\"The New York Review of Books\\": \\"Her major contribution has been to shed light on the reasons why generation after generation of Americans have been deprived...of any real sense of history, or their place or the place of their country in history.\\""},{"Title":"America Revised","review":"The reviews here don't do this book justice. It's not \\"conspiracy theories\\" about \\"the truth.\\" It is a nuanced book based on Fitzgerald's New Yorker articles in the late 1970s, drawing on her extensive, thoughtful reading of the broad collection of historic textbooks at Columbia Teacher's College. Fitzgerald offers a surprising historiography about the range of textbooks in the 1930s, the cracks in the supposedly-consensus history of the 1950s, and the 1960s and 70s shifts from social movements of the right as well as left, as well as the business pressures of textbook publishing. Smart and incredibly well-written, this book is better than more recently-written books about America's textbook controversies. Anyone interested in the teaching of U.S. history or public memory in America should read this book."},{"Title":"America Revised","review":"This book raises questions of conspiracy with its story of how history is altered according to the times and whims (?) of the few.

It goes a long way in demonstrating both the depth and breadth of this newest of visual mediums; treating it with the respect it deserves. There is a lot of work that goes into creating the dazzling visuals many gamers may take for granted, or worse, criticize in ignorance of the technological limits game artists work with.I must confess I am biased as I am one of those artists toiling in the game development business. One of my images and a substantial quote of mine is used in the text of the book. Sadly however, credit is not given to me or any of the nameless, faceless artists whose work is so lovingly showcased. As a game artist, I would love to know who created this work both for my personal edification as well as for reference for future hiring potential. Obviously, some images represent the work of many artists and programmers, however, a large amount of the work included in this book was created by individuals who deserve credit. What crediting there is, is given only to the marketing executives and companies who delivered the work to the author. For all of its effort to showcase the artistic merit of video games, this book fails to recognize those who create the art, only crediting the corporate entities who paid for it.Still, a worth while buy."},{"Title":"Video Game Art","review":"The trouble starts early. There is an apologetic preamble which states that the author(s) would not dedicate precious space to titles that which are well known and well documented beyond the gaming community. This is an enormous assumption about the general public's knowledge - both of video games and more-so it's history of design. Many people that have heard of these games or have seen their children watch the TV-spinoffs, most likely would not be able to identify what the games actually look(ed) like.Even though Mario, Zelda, Pokemon, Donkey Kong, Defender, Asteroids, Missile Command, Frogger, etc. are mentioned briefly there are no images of these classic games for us to (a) review and recognize, and (b) learn from. If this is supposed to be a sort of retrospective of the graphic art of game design (this is not about studies of techniques for rendering) then why not show some of these all-time classics as well as the 'new-time' classics? The latter are better represented but some of the choices and omissions are rather questionable. The brief smattering of 'classics' that are shown tend to represent more human and figurative character styles in games rather than 'iconic' which to me lacks in breadth of representation.Beyond this, much of the work - but not all - feels and looks rather 'same-y' to me. Lots of brooding dark scenes and characters inspired by countless horror/goth/fantasy masters. When there is mention of games that are actually considered contemporary-art on display at world-famous museums, such as \\"Rez,\\" -- we are not shown ANY images of these because space was taken up by two nearly identical renderings of Lara Croft in the same spread. At this point one has to ask oneself: what was the author/picture editor thinking?For all the long-winded talk in the intro there is little to show us where the industry came from versus where we are now. And from what I can tell, there is absolutely no mention of the explosion of games and unique designs being done in FLASH - arguably one of the largest and least expensive environments for making accessible games and game 'art'. Furthermore, all the games covered and discussed (that I can tell) are from large corporations and studios. What of independent developers?My biggest problem with this book was the editing - particularly with regard to choices of art. Far too many examples if things that look similar versus examples of unique design concepts and forms. Very nice printing, some nice layouts, and even some interesting topics are raised with relation to character concept, versus form, versus environment - but I would not recommend this for critical graphic design, \\"art\\" analysis, or a balanced representation."},{"Title":"Video Game Art","review":"Nearly every single piece of art in this entire book is from XBOX or XBOX 360. Plus, most of the art really isn't all that good. As the other 2-star reviewer said, where's Frogger? Where's Zelda? More importantly, where are the Gamecube games with great graphics? Twilight Princess & Super Mario Sunshine had amazing graphics. I do not recommend this to any non-XBOX fanboys."},{"Title":"Middle Eastern mythology (Pelican books)","review":"This book provided a fascinating review of early Middle Eastern mythology starting from Mesopotamian culture and proceeding through to Judaism and early Christianity. It also includes a discussion of the importance of myth and ritual as a basis for religious and socialogical structure. The area I found most interesting was the discussion of the influence of the mythology of early civilizations on Judeo-Christian belief and scripture."},{"Title":"Middle Eastern mythology (Pelican books)","review":"I am so glad I found out about this book. Reading it was a major eye opener for me in understanding the early myths from the area where my own (former) religion originated. S. H. Hooke is an expert in mythology, and he does a fantastic job of showing the connections between the myths of the Middle East. For me personally, this helped me see how the roots of Christianity (particularly with ancient Hebrew religions) was inspired greatly by earlier myths. Whether it was the author's intention or not, it also helped me realize that the religion I once thought was real was, in fact, nothing more than a myth that was not unlike so many similar myths of the time and place.Jeff Mark, author ofChristian No More"},{"Title":"Middle Eastern mythology (Pelican books)","review":"This book has been republished a number of times now and that is probably due to its addressing of a subject that is bound to repeatedly be of interest to a number of people. In a nutshell this brief book discusses a range of myths from the Middle East. It does not claim to be an encyclopaedia of that areas mythology and deities nor does it claim to contain every story of each of the cultures that have come and gone over the years in the region in question. Nor does it set out to any form of historical work in a chronological sense though perforce there is some discussion of the chronology of different cultures in order to discuss their influence on each other.What the book does do is to present a number of salient stories in readable laymans prose from a range of early cultures of the area. What we also get is a look at how many of the stories many would think of as being from the Christian Bible were quite obviously drawn from earlier works. I'm guessing that might ruffle a few feathers but the author does not dally about with looking too deeply into that aspect of things, he merely draws parallels and leaves it at that.This isn't a bad book for your history bookshelf though there are undoubtedly far more brightly presented and illustrated works on Middle Eastern pantheons and the like and certainly many of them probably benefit from more recent archaeological work that has been done since its inception and some that will look more thoroughly at individual cultures rather than this broader based work."},{"Title":"Middle Eastern mythology (Pelican books)","review":"This book was written more than 45 years ago and it shows; there have been much new data on middle eastern mythology, particularly concerning Judeo-Christian mythology.Hooke, unlike Joseph Campbell in his books, shows his obvious pro-Christian bias: \\"we have in the birth narratives of the gospels an extension of the function of myth as a vehicle for CONVEYING TRUTHS which lie outside the range of historical evidence\\" (p172-3). This is a contradictory statement, truths have evidence, otherwise they are just dogma (a religious doctrine that is proclaimed as true without proof); this statement is based on Christian dogma, not fact. The new testament was written by Hebrews/Early Christians after Jesus had been dead awhile to elevate him to god-like status; there is no written documentation on the life of Jesus from anyone who lived while Jesus lived; however, Hooke seemed to think the new testament writings were actually done by people who personally knew Jesus.If you want mythology overviews that are objective and up-to-date, look for it elsewhere; preferably one written within the last decade or so."},{"Title":"The Collector's Edition of the Lost Erotic Novels","review":"It certainly seems to me that some of the best erotic literature was written in Victorian times when, absent TV's, DVD's and pay per view porn and erotica, most people had to find thewir erotic enjoyment with friends, family, neighbours, and, most importantantly in their own minds.This wonderful book of four full erotic novels certainly brings that point home.In 'The Instruments of Passion' a young man decides to join a very much monastery with only seven members that practiced some, what would appear to be strange, rituals of bondage and the whipping of a very young girl, also a resident, named Daisy. The young writer is astonished by her beauty and her willingness to submit to the torture and pain of the monks daily ritual. Everything seems so normal, so traditional and so important in their search for inner peace that our innocent observer very quickly accepts all .... That is until a certain day when there is a 'graduation' of sorts and our young innocent's world and his unrequited love for Daisy comes to a crashing end ....In 'The Misfortunes of Mary' we find another very much Victorian novel where a mature Colonel Barrington agrees to a secretarial contract with a very and beautifull young girl, Mary. Although all appears normal, our young secretary, now contractually bound, finds that she is in an impossible postion and the jaded colonel immediately starts to play mind games demanding her total submission to those yummie yummie whims.The author takes the reader along a meandering erotica path making all seem rather 'normal' and of course understandable .... A great book for those that appreciate Victorian erotica..In 'White Stains', the third novel by Naais Nin we are treated to four very short mini stories that are the hallmark of a very eclectic author whose works many people have grown to love.Finally, in 'Innocence' by Harrier Daimler a young and very sickly Adrian is confined to bed on the very edge of death when finally his mother and father decide to hire a nurse to care for their son in his last days. Again, in this contemporary erotica, all is not what it seems. While the world around him sees Adrian as a poor sickly boy, the reader is treated to the real secret life of Adrian where he is able to use his weakness and intelligence to get 'everthing' he wants from the nursemaid, Rose, while pretty well controlling everyone else around him ....A great mind bending and deliciously naughty work by this author .... I loved it!"},{"Title":"The Collector's Edition of the Lost Erotic Novels","review":"I have been reading Victorian erotica for a very long time. I realize that spanking and whipping are frequent themes in Victorian erotica. Also, it's common for men in these novels to more or less force themselves on women. I expect some of that, and usually overlook those parts figuring that's part of the historical context. However, this book contains way too much rape and sexual violence for my taste, and very little that is erotic.The first book is The Instruments of Passion. A young girl is a prisoner in a \\"monastary\\" of sorts. She is beaten by the monks each night. When she reaches a milestone birthday each monk rapes her while she is tied up and struggling. I didn't finish this book. It was all ugly to me. However, if you like S&M; or have gang rape fantasies you might like it.The second book is The Misfortunes of Mary. In this one a Madam lures a young innocent girl into her house by placing a fake ad for a secretary. The young lady finds herself locked into a room with a retired Colonel who rapes and beats her. Unbeknownst to both the colonel and the victim, three men are paying to watch the rape. After the colonel leaves those three men also rape and beat the poor girl. However, one girl was not enough for them, so they have the daughter of one of the three men brought in, and she is also raped and beaten. Not at all erotic to me, but it may be to some.The third book is a collection of stories listed as being by Anais Nin \\"and friends.\\" These are better. There is one very lovely story about a soldier who spend the night in an attic with his ladylove. It is her first time with a man. No rape, no beating. I really liked that story, but it is not worth the price of the whole bookThe final book is Innocence. This one is very strange, and only partly about sex. A young girl is confined to bed. She and her parents know she will eventually die. Although her parents are concerned and caring, she hates them. She is filed with dark, secret thoughts of hatred. She is extremely spoiled and unsympathetic. As her condition worsens a nursemaid is brought in. The girl and the nursemaid have some lesbian sex, even though the girl dislikes the nursemaid and thinks of her only as a servant. The girl wants to know about male female sex. She forces the nursemaid to seduce her father. The girl pretends to be asleep, while the nursemaid seduces him to have sex right in the same bed with his invalid daughter. The second part of the book is told from the point of view of a young male cousin who arrives from France. He knows the girl is dying. His goal is to set himself up as the heir to the family fortune. He and his father use women and sex for financial gain. He is a nasty piece of work, as bad as his sickly cousin. The sex scenes in this book are not especially explicit or well described, which is fine because none of the characters were inspiring anyway. You might read this last book because it is oddly interesting, but it is in no way erotic.I think there is a good reason that most of these books are \\"lost\\" as the anthology title states."},{"Title":"The Collector's Edition of the Lost Erotic Novels","review":"I just bought the book \\"The Collector's Edition of Victorian Lesbian Erotica\\" and \\"The Collector's Edition of Victorian Lesbian Erotica\\" from Amazon. I find there's some question in edition of the two books. As anthologies, the books include many novels, but they do not have bibliography and I can not firnd authors' names of these novels,we even want to know more about these authors' information. Anyway, the books should indicate which novles are full and others are excerpts(we should know the excerpt from which chapter of the original novel ).I have no idea of them. So I am not very satisfactory of the two books."},{"Title":"Torture And Modernity: Self, Society, And State In Modern Iran (Institutional Structures of Feeling)","review":"This is an important book for Persians. It examines the role that torture has played in the political system of Iran. It is important that we understand this issue if we are to eliminate the use of such instruments in the future."},{"Title":"Torture And Modernity: Self, Society, And State In Modern Iran (Institutional Structures of Feeling)","review":"Before I looked at this book, I expected to find that changes in punishment would mirror changes in state, that is I expected to find during the constitutional revolution (1905-1909) punishments were more humane in contrast to Qajar punishments. That during the reign of Reza shah the great (1925-1941) punishments would be more disciplinary or after the formation of SAVAK in 1957 under British and CIA directions, that punishment would be more psychological and \\"western\\" and after the mullah revolution (1979-1981) that punishments, including torture, to conform more closely to Islamic law. this however appears not to be the case. Changes in punishment precede changes in the state by a couple of decades. Changes in punishment seem to occur in periods of political stability, not instability. It occurs when public officials are not preoccupied with political survival and private citizens are relieved of the constraints of daily survival.The author seems to have deep knowledge of communist theories, and pre-revolutionary \\"classics\\" such as garbzadegi. He has tried to bite his lips hard and avoid needlessly throwing too much mud at Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and taking academic neutrality to issues of torture, incarceration etc. and it's rational over this last century.There is also coverage of different rationalities of Iranians towards the world such as disciplinary, Tutelary, Carceral, Capitalist (he omitted Islamic). The author mentions that despite on numerous occasions politicians being over thrown, institutions purged, and even classes violently ousted, sooner or later the same state institutions were reinstated by some group or other, as these institutions are rooted firmly in the habits of Iranians. The irony here is that revolutionaries are constrained by the modes of power that enabled them to seize the state in the first place.The conclusion, chapter 11, is the only part I believe is worth reading, unless you enjoy feeling sick. It discusses torture from the Humanist, develop-mentalist, state terrorist (mullah republic) and Foucaultian approach.In weakening the position of the Development theorist who believe as societies economically modernize, there is a decrease in the corporal severity of punishments. This decrease does not necessarily occur because people become more enlightened, rather as individuals are introduced to civic and labor discipline, they learn to regulate themselves according to their consciences, the author doesn't mention how, then, can these governments expand the scope of political participation while in a potentially violent and unstable situation?Modern torture, it seems, rationalizes state power and is here to stay (for now at least).."},{"Title":"If a Man Answers (Thorndike Large Print Silhouette Series)","review":"Molly Duncan has left behind a bossy, meddlesome fianc&eacute; - even her apartment and furniture in Boston - to move to Las Vegas and start over on her own. She loves her new job as a linguist and representative for the Las Vegas Visitors and Convention Bureau, her new home (though somewhat bare of furniture), and her new life. The only thing to upset this happy picture is Molly's new neighbor, Major Sam Henderson, USAF. He drives her to pin scolding notes on his door about trash cans left in the middle of her driveway, to make angry phone calls to complain about the loud country western music blaring from his house, and to threaten legal action if he uproots the hot pink oleander bushes that she lovingly planted along their disputed property line, just so that he can install a swimming pool in his backyard.One night following a particularly long and loud bout of ear splitting music, Molly called her neighbor to complain - yet again. However, Molly mistakenly dialed the wrong number and instead of talking to her neighbor, she listened in horror while the man who answered the phone was interrupted by a \\"visitor\\" who then shot him to death. Still not realizing that she had reached the wrong number, Molly called 911 to report that her neighbor, Sam Henderson, had been shot. The police arrive, wake up her perfectly fine (though royally miffed) neighbor, and the story takes off from there.Unknown to Molly, Sam is recovering from an accident that occurred when he ejected from an F15 and his head hit the faulty canopy. As a result of his injury, Sam experiences severe headaches that prevent him from flying and threaten to end his career. Refusing to take any of the variety of pain medications that he has been given, Sam deals with the pain by working out until he is exhausted while listening to his favorite country western music. Following Molly's ill-fated wrong number telephone call, she and Sam seem to be thrown together, literally, and their attraction to each other and growing admiration for each other overcome their previous, instantaneous dislike. They seem ill suited to one another, but as you read through the story it's really difficult to imagine them apart or with anyone else. Other characters in the book like Molly's boss, Davinia, and Antonio, her boyfriend and husband in training number 4, provide the perfect contrast to the two main characters as they attempt to solve a murder and prevent Molly from becoming the next victim.The book was a great, entertaining read, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"If a Man Answers (Thorndike Large Print Silhouette Series)","review":"I picked up If A Man Answers partly because of the author and partly on a whim because it sounded as if it might be interesting.

I used a large variety of materials pulled from various sources, but I was really frustrated by the lack of a book that would be directly accessible to kids as well as adults. I discussed my frustrations on LUGNET and was *thrilled* to find out that Ben Erwin was in the final stages of just such a book. I used a pre-press version of the book with my team in the late stages of the competition and they all loved it and wished they'd had access to it earlier. When it finally got through the publication process, I snapped it up immediately!All I can say is WOW! The pre-press was pretty nice, but the final book is absolutely *gorgeous*.While there are lots of great mindstorms books out there (most notably Dave Baum's) this is the *only* one that covers ROBOLAB, the standard for RCX programming in educational scenarios as well as the standard LEGO-provided programming environment.If you're an adult needing inspiration for your own robots, or if you have kids who like mindstorms, this book belongs in your collection!"},{"Title":"Creative Projects with LEGO Mindstorms","review":"I've read both this book and Dave Baum's Definitive Guide and both are excellent. I enjoyed Baum's book more because it caters to an older audience: Baum seems to be writing to an older reader, there's an emphasis on the programming aspect of Mindstorms, and there are more semi-advanced projects.Erwin's book is a thousand times better for children. The brilliant full-color pictures blow away Baum's black and white book. Erwin is a genuinely interesting author and obviously loves teaching.. Anyone who wants to teach a class with Mindstorms should take a look at the book, because it's full of great &quot;this didn't work, but THIS did&quot; anecdotes.Ultimately, this never really goes above that level. Teachers and younger students should purchase this book, because it's a beautiful guide and will inspire quite a few youngsters. For the robotics engineers, programmers, and older geeks who wish that they'd had Mindstorms as a child, check out Baum's Definitive Guide - it's definitely more of what I was looking for."},{"Title":"Creative Projects with LEGO Mindstorms","review":"I am a teacher in the Midwest and I run an after school robotics team for around 20 5th &amp; 6th graders. We use the Lego Mindstorm RIS kits in our club. After using the ideas from the Constructopedia that comes with each Mindstorm kit, I started looking to other areas for inspiration and ideas. What Ben Erwin's book offers is more than just a &quot;How to&quot; synopsis of each creation. Instead, he includes introductions, inspirations, building designs, programming [in multiple languages], and extension ideas for each project. I've bought a few of the other available Mindstorm robotic books in the past and most were either 'way over my head' or 'very simplistic'. This is definitely the perfect book for any teacher or professor who uses the Mindstorms kits in their class instruction. It is also perfect for any parent or family who creates using the Mindstorm kit in their home! As a bonus, I also believe that it is the first Mindstorm book that is printed in full color!"},{"Title":"Creative Projects with LEGO Mindstorms","review":"This book is a great introduction to the world of LEGO Mindstorms robots. I've been working with the LEGO Mindstorms kits for about 6 months, and I've often been frustrated by the lack of detail in the manuals for the kits. This book provides quite a bit of the missing information. For instance, it explains that you lose your firmware if you take your batteries out of your RCX for more than a minute or two (I wish that I'd seen that in a manual somewhere!). It provides a broad overview of alternatives to programming in RCX code, together with examples from each alternative mentioned for comparison. These coding examples are discussed in the text and they are also included on the accompanying CD. In addition to the coding examples, the CD also includes videos and stills of the robots described in the book. The book includes descriptions of a broad range of robots, from the very simple Acrobot robot featured in the Constructopedia, to robots designed by school kids, to robots designed by parent-kid teams, to advanced robots using IR communication and data logging. In each case, Erwin provides the details of the development process, how the robot was first conceived, how it was developed, and how the design problems were identified and solved. This approach makes the book much more than a simple code cookbook- -it explains to parents, teachers, and older kids how robots actually come about. Scattered throughout the book are \\"Asides\\" that explain various topics such as LEGO geometry, how to calculate gear ratios, understanding compound gear trains, programming decisions, etc. The book includes appendices of useful information, a bibliography, an excellent glossary, and an index."},{"Title":"Creative Projects with LEGO Mindstorms","review":"In the fall semester of 2003, I taught a special topics course in robotics at Mount Mercy College with two students. A Lego Mindstorms kit was purchased and in the first segment of the class, the students built a robot and programmed it to move around the halls. We then moved on and used a more advanced robot in the remainder of the class, because I did not consider the Lego kit to be sophisticated enough. From some of my professional communications, I learned that entire college classes are being taught using only Lego Mindstorms kits.After reading this book and evaluating the projects, I am now completely convinced that Mindstorms kits are all you need to teach a robotics class. Some of the projects in the book are a giraffe that simulates feeding, a flashlight follower, a robot painter, robots that communicate with each other, a machine that makes bubbles in response to stimulation, an infrared fax machine and even a submarine. To get these projects to work, it is necessary to solve some of the standard problems in Artificial Intelligence (AI). For example, the giraffe and all other animals require that the standard problem of getting a robot to walk be solved. The flashlight follower requires that the robot be able to dynamically process sensor input, using it to make decisions. Standard problems in machine-to-machine communication must be solved when the actions of a robot are in response to what another has told it.The robots can be programmed using visual basic, robolab or NQC (Not Quite C). Robolab is a visual development environment where many of the actions are coded by connecting icons. The visual basic and NQC languages have many differences from their true counterparts, basically, they are stripped down versions with altered syntax.Legos are one of the most mind-expanding toys that children can use. Applying some of the concepts in this book, they can be used as learning tools for some of the most complicated tasks that we can try to do, making a machine do intelligent tasks."},{"Title":"Creative Projects with LEGO Mindstorms","review":"One of the best Lego books out.

But with all the talk of Legends of the five rings and about how good it is meant to be. It can become hard to find an alternative.But there is an alternative to the corperate heavy and rigid L5R. And that alternative offers you something that L5R does not...choice.Sengoku is all about choice. It gives pages and pages about the Sengoku era. It gives you the choice of playing Ninja characters. Something L5R treats with distain. It gives you the choice of realistic to flying through the air styles of game. It talks about having a mixed party of Samurai and Ninja and how each style of game is different with that in mind.The information is very well defined and laid out. Some of the rules are a little harder to understand. A little more clarity would not have gone astray here and there. But that does not ruin how good a game this is. This game is all about role play and not about having to fit within the designers idea of what is good.Of them all I strongly recommend Sengoku. And if you find that you just can't tear yourself away from L5R then you will even find converstion notes in the back of the Sengoku book. This book is worth the money."},{"Title":"Sengoku: Character Sheets","review":"This is a role-playing game but the depth of the background material is such that it could nearly be a history book on ancient and medieval Japan.

I own dozens of RPGs and this volume is among the best in my collection."},{"Title":"Sengoku: Character Sheets","review":"Well, I expected this to contain a bunch of character sheets customized for the different occupations. Instead all it is is a few character sheets that have the picture from the main book of the different drawings of the different occupations and then a bunch of blank character sheets that you can download from the website for free. Also they are bound in the book so you can't take them out to photo copy them without tearing them out, or you just leave them in there but there is no customization at all. They're all the same. Really not worth buying. Just go to www.sengoku.com and download the character sheet for free and if you really want a picture in the blank space just photocopy it from the main book and paste it in."},{"Title":"Sengoku: Character Sheets","review":"Somewhere in this great history book there's a game. The authors have definitely done their homework in studying the culture of late 16th century Japan. They've also got a great filmography and bibliography at the back. As far as content is concerned, Sengoku sets the bar quite high for historical RPGs. The actual conversion of this historical information into a playable game is, however, a bit awkward. The book is also seriously hampered by the amateurish artwork and layout reminiscent of RPGs of 30 years ago. Still, I've worn the cover off my copy of the book so its obviously a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Daybreak of Freedom: The Montgomery Bus Boycott","review":"I take issue with the reviewer who criticizes Burns for his scholarship. This work has a clear, succinct purpose: To let the boycott participants on all sides of the issue tell the story themselves. Burns never intended for this work to be definitive, only elucidating, and it is that, and more.This publication arose out of Burns' work editing the King papers at Stanford, spurred by a suggestion from senior editor Clayborne Carson. Burns masterfully edits and assembles the letters, interviews, transcripts of court actions, newspaper clippings, and other materials, adds just enough gloss for clear understanding, and gets out of the way. It takes skill, judgment, and respect for the sources to strike such a balance, and he gets it just right.I'll take this approach any day over a tome by some windbag scholar who has digested the sources and wants to tell me what to think about this important, complex, seminal event in American history. Read the materials yourself, and do your own thinking. That's what Burns set out to accomplish, and in my opinion, he's hit the mark admirably. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Daybreak of Freedom: The Montgomery Bus Boycott","review":"This book is another example of \\"hands-off\\" scholarship in that it appears as if the editor never visited Montgomery but rather relied on secondary sources. Though there are numerous excerpts, the editor did not perform the necessary research which would have revealed (a) that the Boycott had its roots within the American labor movement and, more specfically, events which happened in Birmingham, Alabama, during the 1930s and (b) there probably still exists in the archives of the Montgomery Improvement Association or in at least one other place financial and other records not taken to the King Center which would have told an in-depth story using primary sources.

This book is presented with wise counsel from ministers who have been there. Much of the advice you receive first hand on this subject is less than adequate because it is not thorough. When you study all of these essays together they are sincere, simple, and complete. This is a must read for those who are stuggling with the choice to move.

More detail should be given to the decision making process."},{"Title":"When It's Time to Move, a Guide to Changing Churches","review":"Paul Robbins is the editor of this book, but each chapter is actually written by a different person.

By the way, I disagree with one of the reviewers that stated that this book is not appropriate for young adults, come on it's just a book for crying out loud, give people a little credit for knowing the difference. The very fact that it touches on taboo themes is the whole appeal. And, it's creepy and gripping to boot. I was never able to find another book by Paula Trachtman and I never was able to find this book again until the internet came along ! The fact is, it's 18 years later and I still remember the author of this book and still remember that great feeling that comes along when you're lucky enough to come across a book you don't want to put down! That's the best kind of recommendation you can get and I'm a reader of every genre fiction and nonfiction. For Stephen King fans, you'll dig this book. While this is not really similar to any of his novels (well, it is about a very strange house and disturbing events that take place within), it's horror and macabre that doesn't follow the same tired storylines endemic to most horror-type novels.

This is a very well written book. It has some graphic violence in it that could be disturbing along with quite a bit of sex, which unfortunately includes incest -- not appropriate for a young adult audience. The book grabs you immediately and doesn't let you go until the grinding conclusion. One major flaw of this well written book -- all the characters were basically selfish individuals who were not likeable in the least, so unfortunately this writer didn't manage to create characters you care about or even like. You might well wonder, if the characters aren't likeable (not even one of them was), then why would anyone continue to read this book -- through out your reading you not only constantly wonder what will happen next, but you also wonder how this story could wind up to its inevitable conclusion. I'm not entirely sure I would recommend this book because of the subject matter and graphic nature of it, but I did enjoy the suspense of it."},{"Title":"Disturb Not The Dream","review":"I was another young reader of this book-I believe I was about thirteen. (My mom should have known better then to leave it around where I would find it.) I remember having nightmares for nearly a year over this book, yet I read it so often that I had it practically memorized. Years later, I went back and re-read it, and while it wasn't quite the soul chilling horror fest it had once been, it still gave me the creeps. I don't know if I would read it again now. It definitely did make me sad. I read the one review where it said no one in the book is likable, and I agree to a certain degree. There is the fact however, that much of the scariest scenes are centered around two five year girls, one in the past and one in the current time period of the book, who witness unimaginable horrors and it's impossible to not have one's heart break for them.The story takes place in the Hamptons, when an entire family is brutally murdered except for five year old, Jessica, who is found hiding and catatonic by rescuers. Jessica never regains her sanity, and newspapers report that she died in a hospital approximately a year later.Approximately thirty five years later, a new family, who also has a five year daughter and many other similiarites to the first family, rent the home for a summer that becomes unbelievably horrific. All along as one is reading, you know that the family is headed towards a terrible fate but as the father investigates, hopes rise that he will be able to thwart a repeat of the same tragedy.

Mr. Wilde's son provides and excellent preface describing the limitations and dangers of this exercise and a wonderful insight to his amazing father. The editor then sums up his strategy in meeting the challenges to this enterprise, specifically the need to check the veracity of people claiming Mr. Wilde said such and such in conversation (many of these similar books have tepid sayings claimed to have been heard in conversation. Joyce suffered similarly with Frank Budgeon, and of course Mark Twain had EVERYTHING ascribed to him including the weather). They also address the difficulty of taking lines from Mr. Wilde's plays and novel, in which a CHARACTER while IN CHARACTER says a certain thing which some later call a saying of Mr. WIlde. Mr. Wilde in his own voice may have said it differently, but let the character with all their defects faults and characteristics speak such eccentric foolishness as a character development device. THe editor and Mr. Wilde's son wonderfully explore all the pitfalls of this project and then deliver the most perfect and comprehensive collection possible, ever, possibly the motherlode for all the later fashionable and dubious and cutely illustrated and superficial later throwaways.An excellent collection, substantial and worth keeping for re-reading and reflection.

Though his dealings with the opening creation stories do at first seem to be too heavily focused upon, Wenham does manage to bring some simplicity to this otherwise complicated work.

The series is uneven, and occasionally goes overboard in literary/source criticism. But one up-to-date, critical commentary on Genesis should be on our shelves, and this is about the best."},{"Title":"Word Biblical Commentary, Vol. 1: Genesis 1-15","review":"Very Technical and writes as such. Spends alot of time on JDEP he obviously buys the hypothesis of it..yet he uses no real archaeology or any such to make the case. His presupposition seems to be that Moses definitely didnt write it so you see absolutely no comparisons on other terminology or useages by the author to clarify different hypothesis. You dont see a whole lot of actual getting into the Hebrew terminology but we do see alot of so and so thinks this and he said this ...and modern commentators think this. Which really doesnt give me sound evidence as to why commentators have moved away from traditional interpretatons that flow better w/t he text. I guess the wrong thinking of \\"newer\\" is better...yet no one can be a great theologian unless they seem to bring something new to the table. If your looking for a commentary that seeks to flow with the rest of the Bible and actually believes plenary inspiration of the Bible...which apparently is passe to modern commentators I think you will be disappointed. This certainly isnt a Mounce , Morris, Packer, Gill or Calvin for sure!"},{"Title":"Music in Latin American Culture: Regional Traditions","review":"There has long been a need for a scholarly, comprehensive, affordable english language text addressing Latin American music. &quot;Music in Latin American Culture Regional Traditions&quot; provides a schoarly look at the diverse musical cultures of Mexico, Central America, South America and the Caribbean. Each chapter is written by an expert in the field who has first hand experiences with the culture they are discussing. The text covers music rituals, instrument manufacturing, improvisation techniques and culural/social history of the topic under discussion. The bibliography/discography at the end of each chapter is extensive. This text is geared towards the undergraduate student and is similar in context to Jeff Todd Titon's &quot;Worlds of Music: An Introduction to the Music of the World's Peoples&quot; by the same publisher. My only criticism of the book that the Cuban and Puerto Rican contributions to Latin American Music are not covered as thoroughly as they deserve. I believe that although each is mentioned in the text that they, too, deserve an entired chapter in the text.....maybe in the next edition. With the exception of this perceived oversight, the &quot;Music in Latin American Culture Regional Traditions&quot; is an excellent book, filling a much needed gap in scholarly writing on Latin American Music and is a wonderful introduction for those seeking to study the musics of Latin America."},{"Title":"Music in Latin American Culture: Regional Traditions","review":"The sender mailed it quick, I received it quick, and the book/CD was in perfect condition...nothing else matters!thanks!"},{"Title":"4 Zinas: A Story of Mothers and Daughters on the Mormon Frontier","review":"Four Zinas: A Story Of Mothers And Daughters On The Mormon Frontier is the story of a four-generation family of women who shared many things in common, foremost of which was the name Zina. Zina Baker Huntington converted to Mormonism in New York in 1835. Her daughter, Zina Huntington Young married Joseph Smith, and upon his death, married Brigham Young and served as the Mormon Church's general Relief Society President. Then her daughter, Zina Young Card assisted her husband, Charles Ora Card, in founding Cardston, Alberta, Canada. And in time, her daughter, Zina Card Brown married future Mormon church apostle Hugh B. Brown. Four Zinas is the fascinating story of how this extended family helped to shape their respected eras within the Mormon community. Zina Young and Zina Card worked tirelessly for woman's suffrage, encouraging women to study nursing and become involved in industry. All of the women promoted drama and literature, inspiring others through their speeches and expressions of spirituality (including the Mormon custom of &quot;speaking in tongues&quot;. These were women who enabled Mormon women to feel good about themselves, and in the process, made their frontier worlds welcome places to establish families and enjoy life. Four Zinas is very highly recommended for women's studies, American frontier studies, and Mormon history studies reading lists."},{"Title":"4 Zinas: A Story of Mothers and Daughters on the Mormon Frontier","review":"I loved this book. It has a great historical content to the founding of our nation, as well as the beginning of the LDS church. It has photos and letters spanning four generations, and amazing stories throughout.

These cousins are a hoot!Judith is off to the hospital for hip surgery. Renie is having rotator cuff repair. Unfortunately right before they are admitted, they learn that two recent well-known patients didn't make it after they had routine surgery.Then while they are in the hospital recuperating, the ex-pro quarterback in the next room dies after minor knee surgery. Was he killed?The cousins begin to look into the deaths at Good Cheer Hospital. This is not easily done. Judith is pretty much bed-bound, so Renie ends up doing a lot of the leg work. Most of the staff won't talk, but they do find a few who will give them a little information. But then most of them mysteriously go on vacation or are transferred.Plus Renie is not the best patient. She is constantly finding a way to order in better food. Their neighbor across the hall, assists in this activity on a few occasions. Then a snow storm brings the town to an almost standstill. This also means that their husbands can't visit.The husband of the first woman to die is a reporter. He stops in and chats with the cousins. A few minutes later Renie observes him being hit by a car in the hospital parking lot.They know someone is up to no good and hope that they can survive while working to uncover everything!I love this series. These cousins always make me laugh. They get into some of the wildest situations! Judith's husband and her mother are not as prominent in this book. They really add to this series as well. I like how the author can weave the various characters in and out depending on the setting. They still play a part, but maybe not as big.The author has a real winner!

The largest problem is the location, as you might guess: it's difficult to have three murders on your floor, have the various characters wander in your room and confess, and observe the hit and run from your hospital window. It just doesn't work. And the humor that Daheim usually exhibits doesn't work either: it's strained and artificial, filled with weak puns and plays on words.I'm saddened to see Daheim turn out such a weak product: this is a formulaic novel based on her past work but, unlike the hospital in which it is set, the novel is sterile and lacking in credibility and color."},{"Title":"Suture Self (Bed-And-Breakfast Mysteries)","review":"I read both series written by Mary Daheim and I have to say, right away, that I prefer the Alpine Mysteries to this series, Bed-and-Breakfast. This series tends toward too much silliness at times and there also tends to be too many deaths in each one (Snow Place to Die, for example, was right up there on par with a slasher movie). As well, some of the guests in this series lean toward stereotypical cartoons rather than characters. That being said, this book falls right in line with the others of the series, perhaps a little worse than most of the previous ones. Both Judith and her cousin Renie are in the hospital for operations when a murder occurs, following two suspicious deaths having already taken place. The mystery in this one is fairly easy to solve and the pacing is slow - it would take a really strong writer to make a full-length novel that takes place almost entirely in one hospital room seem exciting. I found myself more interested in the personal progress of Judith's life - will Mike finally find out that Joe is his father, not Dan? How is Gertrude's progress into senility?I rate this one 2 stars as it is less than average for this series. Have to say that I am more looking forward to the next Alpine mystery much more than the the next one in this series, \\"Silver Scream.\\""},{"Title":"Suture Self (Bed-And-Breakfast Mysteries)","review":"This series is starting to lose its charm.Renie, who I usually find mildly amusing, comes off as totally overbearing and obnoxious, to the point you hope the nurses will just smother her with a pillow. Judith, who I usually find enjoyable but stuffy, comes off as totally dippy. Gertrude, who's usually the highlight of the series for me, is barely seen.People wander into the cousins' hospital room to spill their guts. Bill breaks his professional ethics as a psychologist to tell them confidential patient information &quot;to get their minds off Joe.&quot; Though the hospital staff doesn't seem to like them very much, particularly Renie, they still give them whatever information they're seeking. The whole thing is just totally unrealistic, in addition to the fact that a story which takes place in the confines of a hospital comes off as stifling.Maybe it's time for this author to choose between this and her &quot;Alpine&quot; series and devote her full time to one or the other, where she can put more effort into the stories."},{"Title":"Suture Self (Bed-And-Breakfast Mysteries)","review":"An anemic effort from someone who is touted on the cover as a best-selling author. I'd go back and check out the titles that gave her that status instead of reading this book.Very weak characters, an obvious mystery, too-convenient plot devices every other page, cheap shocks that make you feel stupid when you find out what they are, characters that literally fall into the hospital room so they can spill their guts -- or confessions -- to our bed-ridden mystery solver... And someone has the gall to compare her to Miss Marple. (She blushes modestly when they do so.)Search a little farther on Amazon and I'm sure you'll find something that is worth your time.

In a strange coincidence, Judith's cousin Rennie needs an operation on her shoulder. Thus, the two best friends check into the Good Cheer Hospital, managing to share a room.Before the duo actually enters the hospital, a famous athlete and a locally known actress die while recovering from successful surgery. The police report that both of them died from an overdose of drugs. Judith learns from a gossiping nurse that neither of the deceased were users. When a third person dies under suspicious circumstances, Judith, who has solved previous homicides, decides to investigate without knowing how close the killer is to her.This long running series makes its hard cover debut with a tale that proves Mary Daheim deserves the status. SUTURE SELF is the best novel in a well-written series as the precious interludes between Judith and Rennie appear poignant and dramatic, yet humorous. The investigative techniques used by Judith while recovering from surgery is unique or at least along the lines of Rear Window. Ms. Daheim is at the top of her game as she provides her fans with a wonderful cozy.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Suture Self (Bed-And-Breakfast Mysteries)","review":"Suture Self begins with two sleuthing cousins scheduled for surgery at Good Cheer Hospital. Two famous people have already ended up dead and a third expires as the cousins recuperate. There were so many weakneses in this story that when I put the book down it was hard to pick up again. First, it's unlikely that strangers would stream into their room to fill them in on things that were none of their business. Second, the drug and homeless angles were flimsy nonsense. Third, and most annoying, was that Renie person. Why would a writer, having the power to create likeable characters in prominent positions in a story spawn something like Renie Jones? The cursing, screaming, unsympathetic attitude, etc. was WAY over the top and detracted from the weak plot. Lastly, there was no element of surprise at the end. Who didn't figure out that Jim was the killer half way through the book?This was my introduction to this B&amp;B series.

They are a little apprehensive about their admission to Good Cheer Hospital, because there seems to be a rash of deaths of basically healthy people who have recently had surgery at the hospital. There is a rumor of a takeover of Good Cheer and there are plenty of quirky hospital employees as well as relatives of the deceased which gives Judith a long list of suspects. Her husband is working on a case dealing with homeless people and Judith suspects that there is a connection to the case she's working on.

I kept hoping that Mary Daheim might get back into her groove. Not so. Somewhere along the line, the books have lost their charm. Renie has developed a severe overbite, with prominent front teeth, which is heavily focused on in the last few books. She has also gotten quite an attitude, making it difficult to get along with anyone. Added to that is Renie and Bill's ridiculous storyline of dressing their pet bunny, and in other books, being obsessed with their stuffed gorilla. They even go so far as to have Oscar the gorilla held hostage and have to negotiate for him! PLEASE!Gertrude's acided tongue has never entertained me, as realistically no one would put up with the verbal abuse heaped on throughout the years.

It apparently takes place before the passing of the Health Information Portability Protection Act, which is the law that can cost treatment professionals - like nurses and psychologists - their license if they are so casual with tossing around privileged information about their patients. I read the reference to the nurse's starched uniform and cap, and figured it must be before the eighties when they all started wearing scrubs. Then I read the warning by one of the antagonists about \\"snoopy reporters\\" and figured it must be from the Scooby Doo era. Then I read about Mirror Twins and how twins that face each other in the womb wind up as a mirror image of each other, and decided it must be from the early 1900s.The dialog (Torchy McGee??) told me it was an old Lucy and Ethel episode from the 60s, but then the references to Nike and hip replacement surgery confused me yet again.Finally, the literary cliches caused me to give up on it altogether; I no longer cared who killed the celebrities or why.

The one plus is it is a nice book for someone who would prefer not to slog through a lot of useless, gratuitous sex and vulgar language.

There are several out there, proprietary or free. Here, Hatch explains in depth the free PostNuke system. It's a spinoff from PHP-Nuke, an earlier free CMS. (Though the book doesn't really go into any comparisons between the two.)PostNuke uses PHP and the MySQL database. If you like, you might consider PostNuke to be a very \\"webby\\" way of accessing MySQL. It is laid out in an explicitly modular fashion, with each component describing a block of functionality. Hatch shows how this partitioning is in no small part responsible for a lot of its success. Many independent developers have been able to easily put together modules specific to their websites. Several chapters are devoted to examples of these modules. A chapter each on user interaction, communities, online gaming and money making. Within these chapters are numerous case studies.It would certainly help you if you were already cognisant of PHP and HTML. Knowledge of MySQL is also good, though not as important. The module coding is in PHP, and that is where most of your time will be spent."},{"Title":"PostNuke Content Management","review":"It was nice to have a PostNuke book to use as a reference guide since there are no others out there (as of 12/2007).

Like any other technology book, they do become outdated, and this one is getting there.

This is Heindel's own unique Rosicrucian philosophy; it is not the Rosicrucianism of the AMORC or any other group currently labeling themselves Rosicrucians. One must eventually put aside the pointless quibbling as to which group harbors the &quot;real&quot; Rosicrucianism (because every group will give a differing viewpoint) and ask a much more relevant question: does the philosophy WORK? Heindel's philosophy has worked for a great many people, and this book is considered by many to be his magnum opus. Heindel's brand of Christian Rosicrucianism doesn't work well with traditional mainstream Christianity. He introduces into basic Christian theology various occult concepts, not to mention a strong dose of astrology. These viewpoints will be interesting to students of esoteric Christianity, but will doubtless seem like heresy to the average Fundamentalist Christian. This book outlines Heindel's worldview, and it's very complex. This is not easy reading. People accustomed to fluffy pop occultism and &quot;how-to&quot; texts that can be devoured in a single sitting will be disappointed. This is rather intense, intellectually engaging material. Some readers will find many of Heindel's assertions hard to believe. Others will delight in his complex views of humanity and the various worlds through which mankind travels. This book contains material on the visible and invisible worlds, human evolution, rebirth, nutrition, the mission of Christ, occult analysis of Biblical texts, the fall of man, the law of consequence, animal spirits, esoteric training, and a great many other topics. There is SO much to study here, in fact, that it seems almost daunting. Still, many people do study this book, and many have reported benefiting from it. The book isn't for everyone. It's not a quick, easy self-help book. The dryness of the text can be a bit of a problem for some. Remember, though, that the first edition was printed in 1909 and has changed little (if any) since then. Some of the science will seem outmoded and some of the social commentary (for instance, on matters of race) may seem hopelessly dated, as well. Still, it's an interesting book, on the whole, and if you can stick with it, you might end up learning something."},{"Title":"Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception or Mystic Christianity an Elementary Treatise Upon Man's Past Evolution, Present Constitution and Future Development","review":"This book has an answer to those souls who haven't find it whether in physical sciences or in traditional religions. Max Heindel shows to the world, as he received them from The Rosicrucian Order's Elder Brothers, the teachings of a higher philosophy; teachings that speak to us of our relationship with God, our human fellows, and the meaning of our existence in Earth. I personally found this book a precious help to understand how my destiny is a result of my own acts, since the &quot;Law of cause and effect&quot; taught by The Rosicrucian Fellowship, and how we can change our destiny, changing our lives and the way we approach it.

It is not an exaggeration for me to say that the concepts in this book have truly changed my life, although at times it has not made life especially easy. Max Heindel presents a &quot;grown-up&quot; version of Christianity that takes much thought to grasp, but is well worth the effort.In the centuries to come, Max Heindel will be recognized as one of the giants of the 20th century, along with Einstein and Martin Luther King, and it will be sad commentary upon the benighted nature of the last century that so few have thus far reaped the rewards of his written legacy.If religion were equated with mathematics, church Christianity may be likened to basic arithmetic, and Rosicrucian Christianity may be likened to advanced calculus.Reading the &quot;Cosmo&quot; for the first time is one of the most intellectually exhilarating experiences life has to offer."},{"Title":"Soul, Sweat and Survival on the Pacific Crest Trail","review":"I'm one of those vicarious PCT thru-hikers who merely has section hiked portions of the grand trail.

Each participant said a few words about themselves during the orientation meeting. Bob intrigued me when he said that he had run the entire Pacific Coast Trail. He said that he had a couple of books (Soul, Sweat & Survival on the Pacific Crest Trail) if anyone was interested in reading about his adventure. He only brought a couple of them and luckily I bought one the first night. As I started reading it and watching him run ahead of all the other participants in the daily hikes, I began to realize how lucky I was to be with such a dedicated, knowledgeable hiker/runner. At breakfasts I did my best to sit at the same table as Bob to pick his brain and to get him talking about his Pacific Coast Trail run.On the third day, I asked Bob whether he would pick a few parts of his book that he valued the most and read them to me. He read two small sections to me at breakfast. I then asked him to read to me the same two sections after we had arduously climbed Observation Point overlooking Angels Landing on our last hike (Bob's run) of the five-day program. I video-taped him reading the sections with Zion National Park Canyon in the background! (At the end of this review, I have written what he read with exuberance.) At the end of that days hike/run, I took a picture of Bob totally submerged in the Virgin River after his run so that he could prevent overuse injuries by using cold therapy, and a picture of his left foot because his second toe is permanently bent over his big toe because New Balance had inadvertently sent him a set of shoes with the left shoe a full-size smaller than the right shoe. Bob had no choice but to run with that too-small left shoe because the shoes were shipped to a remote post office and his other shoes were worn out and he was going to run over sharp, volcanic rock on the next leg of his run.I also took many other pictures capturing this very unique person. I had been having some pretty serious tennis injuries (I was 62 years old, and Bob was 76 years old) and I asked for some preventive advice. He suggested that I go see the most experienced, most knowledgeable Physical Therapist available. I did and now about nine months later I am starting to play tennis with much fewer injuries!Yesterday, November 15, 2007, I called Bob to thank him for his advice and he told me that he is planning on running the Pacific Coast Trail again - this time from North to South in two summers. He will be 80 years old when he crosses the finish line in Mexico.After experiencing Bob Holtel at Zion National Park and reading his book, I contacted Etta Clark who wrote Growing Old Is Not for Sissies and suggested that she include Bob in her upcoming third book in the series. Bob was in his mid-fifties when he ran in three summers the Pacific Coast Trail from the Mexico to Canada. This is a great read. But if you want to experience Bob first hand, you could sign up for the active Elderhostel hiking event during the first week in March, 2008. He will be there!The quotes that Bob read for me as I video-taped him on Observation Point, Zion National Park.Page 67, \\"This primitive form of running, that propels one through open space on timberline routes, allows me to view life from a new perspective.

I feel like modified Henry Thoreau on the move.\\"Page 155, \\"Almost anyone can be a hero for a day; it's hanging in there that counts. I believe God rewards faithfulness.

This becomes painfully obvious in the first few pages of the book. The book is basically a day by day journal of his runs. Every day's entry reads pretty much the same - difficult hills, rocky descents, etc. He does little, if anything, to describe the beauty surrounding him, the people he encounters, or even a brief history of the trail.The story:The author likes to say that he \\"ran the Pacific Crest Trail\\". While this is technically true he did not cover it in one stretch - as I think most people would assume from this statement. It took him over three summers to cover the distance. This undoubtedly was a great way to spend three summers but in my book it doesn't make him out to be the great hero he would like to be.He also likes to repeatedly tell about how difficult it was and how amazed everyone he met on the way was when he told them what he was doing. This gets very tiresome very fast."},{"Title":"Soul, Sweat and Survival on the Pacific Crest Trail","review":"I was so inspired by this book that I called Bob Holtel and left a message on his answering machine, thanking him for giving the world such a wonderful gift. It's not the narrative, which as the disappointed reviewer said, is primarily a trail diary--though a terrifically good one, especially if you're a trailie or trail ultrarunner. No, what's deeply inspiring is Holtel's spirit, which is unique. I swear, there's a wonderful, pure spiritual vibration in the writing. I felt better for having read the book, smiled often while reading it, and have recommended it to many friends who've found the same inspiration in it."},{"Title":"Soul, Sweat and Survival on the Pacific Crest Trail","review":"The ability of a long distance runner is nothing short of inspiring.

The book made great armchair reading for anyone slightly interested in the subject.Now Alessandro Levorato has published a more scholarly study of the famous fairy tale in 12 versions published over the past 300 years. She takes the seldom used linguistics approach to studying the tale, breaking down each tale into word choices and meanings, as well as other nuances of grammar and language usage. This is not easy reading, but it is meaningful. Levorato's study is divided into six main sections with a final section summarizing the conclusions drawn from the entire study. The texts of the twelve versions show how society has changed, especially concerning gender issues. The book is recommended for anyone interested in any of the primary subjects of fairy tales, linguistics, or gender issues in literature. It should be made available in any reputable university library, too.For anyone wondering which versions of the tale are analyzed, here is a list of the authors and titles:1. Oral version: 'The Story of Grandmother' (l5th-l6th c., French)2. J. Perrault: 'Little Red Riding Hood' (1697, French)3. Brothers Grimm: 'Little Red Cap' (1812, German)4.

When we found that it is virtually impossible to get a copy of the movie (it never came out on DVD and I no longer own a VHS player), I explored the option of reading the book. I was intrigued when I realized that the book was written in the 60's - a bit of a cultural leap from the 70's, when the movie was produced - so I decided to give it a read. Although I didn't grow up in the priveleged classes of Manhattan, I was a teenager throughout the 60's and I could relate to the times. It seemed a little milder in some respects from what I remember of the movie (and my memory is not the greatest), but it was a thoroughly enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Diary of a Mad Housewife","review":"Great insight into the mentality and treatment of women in the late 60s.

Her husband ignores her and has become a snob with success. Her children are involved in their own social lives. She has many phobias which I can relate to."},{"Title":"Diary of a Mad Housewife","review":"This book is out of print, sadly, which is a crying shame. Story of an upper class woman with two snotty daughters, a weary loyal maid, and an insufferable social climbing lawyer husband, all living in Manhattan. The woman begins an affair with a possibly dangerous man, a famous author. The middle aged crazy emotions our heroine rollercoasts through are familiar stuff, but so well written. And the details of their lives, the wonderful descriptions of apartments and dinners and fashions, of a New York City that is sadly no more (late '60's, when it was affordable for people other than Donald Trump to live there) - just one of the best novels I've ever read. Funny/sad, often maddening, you might look at a real life example of this well-dressed, well -off woman and wonder (as someone states in the movie version, at a group therapy meeting at the end) - just what does this woman have to be unhappy about? You read about this woman's life, the material things, the parties, the life in the middle of the greatest city on earth, and you wonder why she is unhappy, just what the hell does she WANT? Well, she's not sure, but something isn't right in her life. The affair is bad, wrong, and inevitable and as necessary as air to breathe. So just what do women want? I'm not really sure. But here's an insight - &quot;money does not buy happiness&quot;. If you ever run across this book, I recommend it highly, it was one of my favorites years ago and time has not diminished it at all."},{"Title":"Diary of a Mad Housewife","review":"I recently saw this on my bookshelf and decided to read it again after a hiatus of many years. Well, time has not diminished the power of this book to engage the reader. Humorous and thought provoking, it allows the reader a glimpse into the mind of Bettina Balser, an upper middle class woman, living in Manhattan somewhere in the late nineteen sixties, who feels that she is losing her mind. Consequently, she begins to keep a diary, because she finds it cathartic. Through her diary, the reader sees a dawning awareness of self, a self that she has long repressed.Bettina married her husband Jonathan, when he was an idealistic up and coming Assistant District Attorney. When his political aspirations did not bear fruit, he left public service and became an insufferable, materialistic, social climbing corporate attorney. He is also a total control freak, planning every aspect of their lives and disparaging his wife at every opportunity. The sad thing is that he is totally unaware of what he is doing to his wife, so self-absorbed is he. They have two equally insufferable little girls, who seem to emulate their father at every turn. It is no wonder that Bettina feels that she is sinking into an abyss. It is as if she were a displaced person with no place to go, no place to run, no place to hide. Where has her self gone?The author takes the reader into the inner workings of Bettina's mind. The reader sees how she copes with her struggle to find the woman within the shell she has become. In its time, this book was viewed as being feminist in nature. What else would one call it, when the book is clearly about a woman's struggle with the hand that fate has dealt her simply by virtue of her gender? Although some of the references seem a little dated, such as the cost of certain things or the fact that everyone seemed to smoke cigarettes, it is simply reflective of its time and quite fitting. Full of humor, wit, and discreet social commentary, this is a book that has become a modern day classic."},{"Title":"Diary of a Mad Housewife","review":"I first read this book back in the mid-1980s, and I just loved it! It's funny, heartbreaking, insightful and, above all, entertaining. I may not be anybody's wife or mother, but as a woman living in a big city I feel I can still relate to Tina. How many times have I had to deal with overbearing snobs like her husband Jonathan, bratty kids (I'm an aunt to 8 nieces and nephews) like Sylvie and Liz, and heartless, unfeeling men like playwright George Prager. I highly recommend this novel, but it's too bad it's out of print. ENJOY!"},{"Title":"Diary of a Mad Housewife","review":"I first read this book, by the late Sue Kaufman, in the 70s, and from that moment, I loved it. I read it so many times that I had to buy another one because it fell apart, (the paperback).Then it was out of print, and now it's been re-printed and I'm so glad that it can be re-enjoyed by a whole lot more readers.The story of a bored housewife, whose husband suddenly gets much richer than they'd ever believed he could, but also gets more snobbish and silly than she could ever believe, strikes an answering chord in many women's minds.He starts to order all the family to do everything he wants, while people are laughing at him for his ridiculous attitude.Tina is so embarrassed and she turns to an affair with a completely unsuitable man.The humour and the descriptions of her life with her two daughters and this overbearing husband are very clever indeed, and I really recommend it.I wish I was reading it for the first time!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Diary of a Mad Housewife","review":"I bought this book because I was attracted by its title, but I was a little bit afraid it would turn out a heavy feminist type of book. It was a pleasant surprise instead. The main character, Bettina,is well characterised and with all the problems that anybody, any woman sooner or later in her life might experience. But it's not just about identification. The style is dazzling, and it flows impeccably right to the end of the novel as if you were drinking fresh water, full of irony and witticism, with no flaws or standstills. I will suggest this reading to any one of my friends!"},{"Title":"Diary of a Mad Housewife","review":"This is one of the life-affirming books I have to re-read every year because I enjoy it so much. While written in a highly entertaining confessional style, what keeps the story from being just another blog is the wonderfully tight construction, pace, and timing, plus a healthy dose of humor. The writer obviously is steeped in great literature (Great Literature) as Bettina Balser would say, and these influences can be seen in the tight plotting, symbolism and illuminating descriptions. This book also opens a unique window into a time and place, Manhattan in the 60s, and is filled with energy on many levels. It is almost an Anna Karenina for the new millenium, one in which the adultress emerges whole and triumphant, and no one is destroyed. Each time I read it though, I find myself rooting a little more for the George Praeger character. One wishes Sue Kauffman might produce more novels exploring the topics of love, sexual passion, marriage and divorce."},{"Title":"Diary of a Mad Housewife","review":"This is the story of Bettina \\"Tina\\" Balser: her husband is convinced she's losing her mind and needs help, her daughters are growing older and surly, her affair with an arrogant, foul-mouthed playwright is hardly the redemptive experience she needs, so she starts to keep a diary, which she keeps hidden from everyone and records her feelings so that she can feel some sort of connection. Sue Kaufman's novel (which spawned a movie that, at this writing, is frustratingly unavailable on home video) written at the cusp of the emerging women's movement of the late sixties feels just as fresh and important to this contemporary reader as it must have when it was originally published.Despite the situation of Tina feeling trapped in her marriage and in her life, Kaufman does a nifty case of gender reversal in this book. For a change, it is the husband who \\"roosterpecks\\" his spouse mercilessly, is vain and materialistic, is a social climber of embarrassingly blatant proportions -- who wouldn't feel nuts with a husband like Jonathan Balser? By making Jonathan the way he is, Kaufman calls into question the entire concept of women and inborne madness. Are women really prone to hysteria, or are there also outside factors than can cause a woman to go mad? Also, what was once called madness can now be called \\"depression\\" but \\"Diary of a Depressed Housewife\\" doesn't have the same zing.Some people may shy away from this book if they hear it's a feminist novel, but that's assigning a very narrow definition to the term \\"feminist.\\" I would agree with anybody who labels this a \\"feminist novel\\" and would wholeheartedly approve of it being put on any curriculum, whether women's studies or just a general survey course. It's a complementary work to novels such as \\"The Women's Room\\" and, more importantly, \\"The Yellow Wallpaper.\\" I would also say that this book is the urban sister of Richard Yates' \\"Revolutionary Road\\" and a cousin of, yes, I'm saying it, \\"Valley of the Dolls.\\" Like all these books, \\"Diary of a Mad Housewife\\" is funny, sad, always sharp, never didactic, and most of all, inspiring."},{"Title":"Diary of a Mad Housewife","review":"Diary of a Mad Housewife is a really enjoyable read.

Russ's Powerful Self-Talk CD describes the essential ingredients for understanding and unleashing the universal power of positive, intentional, and supportive self-talk. Russ identifies unsupportive, negative self-talk that reduces confidence, dampens self-esteem, and defeats personal performances. He provides dynamic visual and auditoryimages and specific examples of purposeful, responsible, and pro-active self-talk behavior. Russ prescribes a six-step model that focuses on increased awareness of self-defeatingthoughts and linkages to overt behavior. He wants each concerned individual to capture these thoughts and remake them into 'here and now' opportunities for alternative choicesand verbally assertive statements that start &quot;I am __________. I can do ___________.I will __________.&quot;Powerful Self-Talk potentially enables one to consciously plan, produce, direct, and perform valued self-talk scripts and roles applicable to daily life and problematic situations. First, youcan rehearse what you clearly want to do. Second, you can through practice and repetition come to value and claim your thoughts. Third your thoughts can become more focused and consistent with desired paths to behavioral objectives. Finally, by owning more consistent thoughts, you canempower behavior into new habits for any given situation or set of challenging circumstances.

When a too structured and career-driven yet refined and scholarly Dr. Margaret Ford, psychiatrist and author of the best-selling self-help book, Driven, is duped into helping Billy Hahn, a young man with a gambling addiction, she gets more than what is bargained for. She is led into the seedy underworld of the con man and all the baggage associated with him: drinking, unabashed gambling, lasciviousness, intricately woven lies, extremity upon extremity. But it is all cleaverly camouflaged by the many defrauders whom she encounters as exciting danger, rebellion against the smothering laws that only \\"good\\" citizens adhere to and being on the outer fringes of decency, good breeding and highbrowism. Ford, who gravely lacks any form of enjoyment in her life, is immediately drawn to the pulsating raw truth and \\"think quick\\" lifestyle of the brazen swindlers, for they gradually convince her-through a series of cons-that all humanity are imbued-one way or the other-with absolute cold indifference, for if you get bamboozled, it's your own fault and you probably deserved it. Dr. Margaret Ford exemplifies that for everybody. But she does not merely epitomize as a victim, she typifies it, through her own unsettling metamorphosis, as a kleptomaniac, murderess, and ultimately, a con woman. She evolves from good, introverted intellectual and respectable doctor to a cunning, manipulative, vindictive killer with a proclivity for thievery. So then the question is posed: Was Dr. Ford inherently a repressed criminal or was she the product of the sleezy environment and those in it? As Ford penetrates to what she genuinely believes is the psychological core of the sharpie personality, she is led by the leader, Mike, into a smoothly orchestrated plot that eventually bilks her out of $80,000; soon after, the scheme goes terribly awry when Mike holds a mirror to Dr. Ford's face, a mirror that she long avoided looking into.Mike: I \\"used\\" you. I did. I'm sorry. And you learned some things about yourself that you'd rather not know. I'm sorry for that, too. You say I acted atrociously. Yes. I did. I do it for a living. (He gives her a salute and starts for the door.)Ford: You sit down.Mike: I'd love to, but I've got some things to do.She cocks the gun.(Of gun:) You can't bluff someone who's not paying attention.Ford shoots him. He falls.Mike: Are you nuts? What are you...nuts...?Ford: I want you to beg me.A radical turnabout occurs whereby the aloof victimizer becomes the casuality of his own folly, only to be replaced by Ford, who progresses onward to hone and define his criminal teachings, meticulously making them more her own. Ford's criminality is even more severe, for she turns into one of the criminally addicted patients that she (by her medical practice) is designated to help; her overall presence is refined, classy, learned, delicate, vulnerable, unsuspecting. Those are the worst kinds of lawbreakers: A friendy face on the outside, and something entirely different on the inside."},{"Title":"House of Games","review":"This is the script for the stage play, which has been updated for modern times.

It is an easy read and will encourage those who are struggling with trusting God."},{"Title":"A retrospect","review":"First published in 1894 this book is compiled from the journals and letters of J. Hudson Taylor, the 19th century missionary to China. Taylor spent 51 years as a pioneering missionary in China and changed the way many view missions today.This short book covers from Taylor's conversion in 1849 to the beginning of his second voyage to China in 1866. During this period he hears and heeds his call to missions, spends seven years in China, resigns from his mission society, returns to England, forms his own mission society and returns to China. The true beauty of this book is that these pivotal and influential years are documented in Taylor's own words.In the second half of the 19th century Hudson Taylor completely bucked conventional wisdom in the world of missions. Many of his peers spent much of their time bringing \\"civilized\\" culture to other countries ahead of the gospel. Taylor, on the other hand, immersed himself in the Chinese culture. He lived, talked, dressed, ate and traveled like those he came to serve. Other missionaries and many senders viewed him as too radical and denounced his efforts. Taylor was revolutionary in the way he financed missions, treated female missionaries and addressed the spiritual needs of the Chinese people.This book provides an honest and insightful look into the thought process of one of the most successful and significant missionaries in modern history. The sincere words of this transparent man are a benefit to goers and senders alike. He displays his fears, self-doubt, uncertainty and unflappable faith in Christ for all to see.While this is not the most popular book on Hudson Taylor it is the most honest. It is a rare and precious glimpse into the heart of one of God's greatest missionaries."},{"Title":"A retrospect","review":"I read this in paperback form when I was a teen and really liked it. When I saw it on the Kindle, I wanted to read it again. The book is very interesting because it is in J. Hudson Taylor's own words. It tells about the struggles he went through to get to the mission field. It also shows the power of prayer to supply all his needs in China. The part about founding China Inland Mission is more of an overview. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"A retrospect","review":"Awesome book, written many years ago but still is relevant to us today in 2012! Hudson Taylor was a man of Godly wisdom!

As a person with a deep and sincere love for Christ, it's really humbling to read Hudson's determination to go after the people in China to proclaim the gospel and to wipe away the \\"ignorance way of life\\". It's something that in my life I have not come across to see in anyone so it's really special and even more so because of the steep price pioneers like Hudson had to pay.

Very Well Done!!"},{"Title":"Here On The Way To There: A Catholic Perspective On Dying And What Follows","review":"Shannon, a priest and professor emeritus in the religions studies department at a Nazareth College, makes an important point in his introduction that informs much of what follows. He offers dictionary definitions for \\"death\\" and \\"dying,\\" each dealing with endings. He then gives the Christian definitions: \\"Death is the beginning of life, life at its best, at its most real\\" and dying is \\"to start living in a most wondrous way.\\" He also takes care to explore death and dying as two different experiences that reflect continuity (existence continues after death) and discontinuity (existence after death is radically different from existence before death.)Against that background, Shannon addresses the form of life after death, comparing it to resurrection (Jesus) not resuscitation (Lazarus) and posits that the \\"the resurrection of the body and life everlasting\\" expressed in the Creed are experienced at the end of each person's mortal experience, \\"which, for that person, is the end of time.\\"These are but a few examples of the richness Shannon brings to this imminently readable and thought-provoking work. Other topics include funeral rites and organ donation, diminishments of old age with practical advice on living wills, hospice care, and medical decisions. As one would expect, the author also looks at questions of hell, and purgatory, limbo, and reincarnation. The final section, What We Believe about Heaven, tackles questions about heaven as a family reunion, a garden of delight, the Garden of Eden, and the Glorious Royal City. The book closes with answers to frequently asked questions about heaven, nearly 100 notes, and an index."},{"Title":"Here On The Way To There: A Catholic Perspective On Dying And What Follows","review":"I sat down on Friday night, figuring to spend most of the weekend \\"working through\\" Here on the Way to There. I finished before I had lunch on Saturday. It was not exactly in one sitting, but i read the book through in one \\"go\\" as it were, following its points and even anticipating some of it, but most of all, appreciating, deeply feeling the truth and gentility in what it said.This book is so very much like Shannon's other writings and his public addresses in tone and pace that you can actually hear his voice in the words. The same mix of deep intellect, and easy understanding, putting next to each other Milton, Joyce, the Doctors of the Church, and quotes from your aunt! and they all fit and flow and create a \\"seamless garment\\" that fits so comfortably.I was very impressed ,and very moved by many of the things that Shannon said. Let me refer to some of them.The idea of passion as something that is endured, or suffered. Yes, that is exactly what passion is, in any of its forms, and to think of dying as a passion is something that never occurred to me, no matter how many times \\"The Passion of Jesus\\" ran through my ears (page 7).The necessity of \\"the person... to forgive himself or herself and open the depths of his or her heart to God\\" is something that I have seen in those I have seen die (page 9).It never occurred to me that \\"death is ....something that we do....an action.\\" (page 13) but of course it is. It is something that takes all our concentration. And that is why death is often precedes by more than a week the cessation of biological functions.Shannon says \\"In death we at last cease to live the illusion of a separate, self-centered existence and realize that our life is -- and always has been -- lived with God in Christ and without sisters and brothers ( page 14).\\" And that is precisely why suicide is not an option, it seems to me, because suicide is a self-centered, self-absorbed act. What we want, what we think we need, a kind of ultimate self-centered existence.The fact that \\"you cannot see your own face.... The reflection of your face is not your face.....\\" (page 15) is very much like that painting of a pipe by Magritte that is labeled \\"This is not a pipe.\\" It never occurred to me. And so, the \\"Beatific\\" vision is not only seeing and recognizing the face of God, it is also seeing and recognizing our own face! As the Rabbi you tell of did not at first recognize his name when it was read at the gate of Heaven.And so on, and so on, there are just too many things I want to say about the book, too many passages I want to talk about for me to go over them all here.Fr. Shannon's book is a comfort and a blessing, beyond words."},{"Title":"Here On The Way To There: A Catholic Perspective On Dying And What Follows","review":"Thoughtful, easy to understand, relevant to today's everyday life in America.

I found this book in a near by bookstore convinced that my friend had herself gifted me with it. Because her passing was very sudden and shocking, the first part of the book did not call out to me but the parts on what happens afterward were immensely consoling.

I own everything of hers that I've been able to find, and I read them all on at least a yearly basis, sometimes even more frequently. The Dagger and The Cross continues the story of Aidan and Morgiana, who met in Alamut. Aidan is a prince from the West, and a Crusader; Morgiana is a Muslim, and a former Assassin. One of Ms. Tarr's most marvelous gifts is the ability to weave basic human conflicts into the fabric of history and fantasy, creating an incredible tapestry of wonder and truth. Aidan and Morgiana's problem, the difficulty of reconciling their enormously different belief systems and moral codes, despite their love for one another, lies at the heart of all relationships. This is historical fantasy par excellence; a book not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Dagger and the Cross: A Novel of the Crusades","review":"Judith Tarr transports the reader back to the time of the Crusader States, in a riveting tale of love, betrayal, and magic. Towering characterizations of historical figures such as the Muslim general Saladin, King Baldwin III, his sister Sybilla, her feckless husband Guy de Lusignan, all in a slightly alternate universe wherein the Jinni are real, with terrible power, and offset by Tolkien-like Elves on the side of the Crusaders. The interwoven history is real, and Ms Tarr will have the reader believing in the fantasy as well, before this novel is half read."},{"Title":"The Dagger and the Cross: A Novel of the Crusades","review":"I bought this book and Alamut when was in high school and lost them years ago.

And, for the price, the information the Rosbergs provide is priceless."},{"Title":"From the Swamp to the Keys: A Paddle through Florida History","review":"This is the telling of a personal adventure story. It is a mix of Florida history in bits and pieces, some personal history (how Johnny Molloy got into outdoor writing--to make a living enjoying the outdoors), and some personal philosophy: \\"I had come to believe, as I still do, that time, not money, is the most valuable commodity on earth.\\" It is NOT a \\"how to\\" book. Perhaps, with his 4 other books on hiking, camping, and paddling in Florida, he felt no need to elaborate on how to prepare and execute such a trip. It is a book about what he saw along the way, of his conversations with locals and travelers he met, of his love for the outdoors and dissatisfaction with urban life. His writing is somewhat routine as he paddles down the Suwannee River and out onto the Gulf coast, then to Cedar Key, and past Tampa (where he encounters the most dangerous conditions of the trip as he crosses the mouth of Tampa Bay). He seems to relish paddling by \\"the seat of his pants.\\" He goes up/down rivers against the tide--a tough paddle. He arrives at Graveyard campsite in the Everglades after dark and swarms of no-see-ums threaten to eat him alive. After donning protective clothes and a head net, he finds the head net is for mosquitoes but no defense against the much smaller no-see-ums. It is clear you will never see Johnny Molloy use a modern convenience like a GPS. Johnny's writing becomes much more interesting the further south he travels and reaches its best in the Everglades, an area which he has paddled and written about extensively. If you enjoy the outdoors and paddling, it is a good read."},{"Title":"From the Swamp to the Keys: A Paddle through Florida History","review":"This is a great book for anyone wishing a glimpse of what Florida was really like a generation ago. The descriptions of the trip down the Suwannee River in the book match the vivid memories I have of my childhood playgrounds....don't miss it!"},{"Title":"From the Swamp to the Keys: A Paddle through Florida History","review":"This is a fun read. Anyone interested in the history of Florida's waterways or paddling (canoe or kayak) will enjoy this book. Mr. Molloy captures the essence of solo paddling and the adventure of long distance travel in small muscle-powered vessels. Day paddling a canoe or kayak is one thing; Johnny colorfully tells of the ups and (sometimes upside-) downs of traveling through one of Florida's oldest routes of travel, the Suwannee River and the west coast, and camping in undeveloped areas and camp sites. Visit the wilds of Florida's coast and the historic Suwannee River without leaving your chair (or dealing with mud flats, storms, mosquitoes, no-seeums, etc.)."},{"Title":"From the Swamp to the Keys: A Paddle through Florida History","review":"this was a terrific adventure as you take the turns of the river, ride the currents, buck the winds, weather the storms and sense the beauty of Fla. as you cast eyes on development only to imagine what parts of it would have looked like back 50 years ago.

Some of the worst bread in the world is to be found in Britain, and some of the best in France. Upon reading this book, however, you might get the opposite impression. The attitude of the authors to non-British breads is rather pedestrian. The suggestion to hollow out savory brioche and stuff it with mushrooms or grilled peppers is not one of &quot;the most delicious ways of using&quot; it, but a rather horrid suggestion (the book is full of such marginal serving suggestions). It also criticizes Pain Poilane because it can be &quot;disappointing&quot;, as if British bread were any better.The first 3 dozen pages have a history and primer on bread making. The section on forming breads is too short to be of any help; you will need to consult a more detailed explanation in another bread book. The next hundred pages is an atlas with 2 dozen or so countries and the breads therein. In spite of the fact that each bread description has a chatty entry, the descriptions of the individual breads do not always describe what the ingredients are or what it tastes like. Not all encyclopedia entries have a picture, although many of them do (all of the recipes do). The last section has roughly 100 bread recipes of varying quality. Many are very interesting, using such things like all purpose flour or employing a second dough kneading after the initial proof. On the whole, I liked the recipe section but thought that the encyclopedia section was kind of a waste of time. The only real problem is the small size of the text (you'll need reading glasses for this one) to go along with the small 7 x 9 size of the page.The authors are British; on the good side, it means that all of the flour measurements in the recipes are listed by weight (halleluiah!), but it also means that some of the terminology is confusing to Americans. The ingredients are those of a British grocery store, so you will have to make substitutions for American ingredients (equivalents are not supplied).The procedures are mostly very detailed and easy to follow, although steps describing the proper dough textures or doneness while baking breads are not detailed enough (for example, if you follow their instructions for baking croissants, you will under bake them) Some of the procedures are difficult to understand or execute, and often lacking in sufficient detail. Also, the hydration levels of some of the doughs were apparently not correct, and the recipe instructions do not always describe the proper dough texture. The proofing times were often too short. The procedures listed for some of the sourdough breads may or may not work as specified.It is an interesting, useful, and wide-ranging collection of European bread recipes not often found here in the US (there are a dozen or so American bread recipes). They have interesting flavors, but not all of them are good. It is a good collection of bread recipes to have, and many are worth trying at least once. In spite of the incompleteness and unreliability, it is a useful and enlightening guide."},{"Title":"The World Encyclopedia of Bread and Bread Making","review":"This book starts with the usual 'bread book' introduction--explaining different grains, various methods of making bread,equipment etc. Then half of the book is devoted on introducing breads in different regions of the world.

I saved myself time looking up the gluten content of oats and quinoa flour because it's in the book along with information on other exotic flours like rye and stone ground. The pictures of the effects of different glazes, ie; sugar versus flour are great and oh so useful.The pain ordinaire has become a regular for me. I even feel confident enough in my breadmaking to try out a wild grape starter recipe I found on Allrecipes and have incorporated it into the recipes in this book. I would never have done that before, because bread seemed so difficult and mysterious. As if only professional bakers (and the Orowheat) factory could make bread. But here I am, churning out oatmeal bread and pain ordinaire with a salt crust for Sunday dinner!I have tried four of the recipes in the book and three turned out perfect (not sure about the whole grain-seed rolls). In my mind, any recipe book that has at least three recipes that turn out and are tasty enough to be made again, well, that's a good cookbook.I can't tell you the number of times I have picked up a recipe book, flipped through it and found that, in the entire book there was only one, maybe two recipes I would be interested in trying."},{"Title":"Night In Eden (Random House Large Print)","review":"Bryony Wentworth, once a wealthy, privileged English landowner, is convicted of murdering her cheating husband.

I don't think there was enough from his point-of-view for me. I didn't always know what he was feeling or thinking. The author would touch on it, but not elaborate as she did with the heroine.The sexual tension was good, but I was expecting more from the rave reviews. There wasn't much of a build up. It was just all of a sudden \\"I want her\\". I wasn't ever sure if the hero ever really *loved* her.Overall, this was a good book.

However, Night in Eden is probably the most heart-wrenching, touching, sometimes sad, sometimes happy love story I've read, maybe ever. She is such a wonderful writer that she makes you feel as if you're there, experiencing everything they're experiencing. I was brought to tears more than once and I'm rarely ever brought to tears reading a fictional story.Bryony Wentworth is convicted for killing her husband and sent to Australia. I don't know how she ever survived the things she was forced to endure but I'm sure even though she was a fictional character there were women who suffered the same things back in those days. Hayden St. John is the man who takes her from the prison to be his servant. At first he treats her like the thieving harlot he assumes her to be but then, slowly, they grow to know one another. It's incredibly touching and, as I said, sometimes terribly sad and other times happy and I don't even know really how to describe it but it's amazingly passionate, such as Proctor's Whispers of Heaven. All her work is similar, not the usual simpering heroine and arrogant hero. Her stories are different and I wish more authors would write the different storylines."},{"Title":"Night In Eden (Random House Large Print)","review":"I would have given this book five stars but I feel it had a really slow start.

I would definitely recommend this book - you will not be sorry that you bought it!"},{"Title":"Night In Eden (Random House Large Print)","review":"Incredibly good, that's what this debut novel by Candice Proctor is...incredibly good. Proctor is the younger sister of one of my absolute favorite authors, Penelope Williamson; with talent that good, I can only say it must run in the genes.NIGHT IN EDEN tells the story of Bryony Wentworth, who was transported to New South Wales in 1808 as punishment for the accidental death of her cheating husband. And in telling us her story, Proctor has told the story of so many other women prisoners, some of whom for minor crimes were torn from their homes in England and sent on prison ships to become the slaves and involuntary whores for hard men in Australia. Byrony was torn from her 3-year-old daughter when she is sent there and spared rape only because she was pregnant with her second child, a boy who dies soon after his birth. While still mourning his death, she is forced to become the servant of Captain Hayden St. John, a war hero whose aristocratic wife has died leaving him a baby son who must be nursed. So, Byrony becomes his wet nurse. She also expects to be raped, and though St. John certainly wants her in his bed, even asks her to be his convict mistress, he is a better master than most and will not take her unwilling. So she sticks to her \\"pride and principles,\\" all she has left; and though she longs for him, too, she tells him no--at least initially.Proctor vividly brings to the forefront life in Australia in the early 19th century away from Sydney Town. It's a new view of the Regency. And she shows how badly those brought to the colony there as prisoners often fared. How they were treated badly and looked down upon by crude free men even after serving their time and became free themselves. And Proctor has done an amazing job.There is great suspense as we encounter the Aborigines, great sadness as the frontier \\"swallows up\\" children who wander away, and great passion between a man and a woman who, under other circumstances, might have courted and married in the normal way. Proctor once was quoted as saying \\"I like to write about strong women, women who sometimes aren't even aware of their own strength but discover it when tested by life. And I make certain my heroines end up with the kind of men they deserve-- honorable men, men who can be both gentle and strong, who never lose their sense of humor and don't feel threatened by a strong woman.\\" Such are Bryony and Hayden.I loved this story and highly recommend it.

With the tragic events in her life, Bryony, has little to live for however she endures in hopes of returning to England for her daughter. The attraction and sexual tension between Bryony and Hayden are equal on both sides, but her pride refuses to give in. From there you go through several events of their tug of war of wills. It gets to the point where you say to yourself, \\"Can you just do the deed already?\\" However when Bryony does give herself to him, it's hot and it's sexy and you forget the repetitive tug of war of wills.It's a wonderful story where you sympathize for the heroine, but you also admire her for the strength to go on and envy her for the handsome hero wanting/lusting and eventually loving her.It's the first book I've read by Candice Proctor and definitely not my last."},{"Title":"Night In Eden (Random House Large Print)","review":"Wow!

Bryony Wentworth has been transported to New South Wales after being convicted of manslaughter. Pregnant during her journey, she gives birth but her son dies after only a few months. Imprisoned in the &quot;Female Factory&quot; the distraught Bryony is &quot;bought&quot; by Hayden St. John as a wet nurse for his own infant son - his wife dying in childbirth and his previous wet nurse's milk having dried up. Bryony is grieving not only for the baby she lost, but for the young daughter she was forced to leave behind in England.Bryony naturally assumes she is not only going to be a wet nurse but a victim of her master's sexual desires as well. However Hayden St. John, although he desires Bryony, is too much of a gentleman to act on those desires. He feels guilty for having these feelings so soon after his beloved wife's death.They travel to Hayden's land, a few days' ride from the large town where Bryony becomes cook, housekeeper, as well as wet nurse, staying in the room previous belonging to Hayden's deceased wife, Laura.The book is full of great secondary characters including Gideon - the young Irishman whose wife and children he longs to bring to be near him, Quincy the young boy who is wise beyond his years, and Louisa the common-law wife of an adjacent landowner who has buried four of her five children.As I am writing this, I am struck by how difficult it is to convey how truly wonderful this book is without giving away too much of the story -- the characters were so real, the setting so vividly described, the writing seamless, the sexual tension almost palpable. But what can I say to convince those reading this to run out and get this book ASAP??? Should I tell you it's going on my keeper shelf immediately? Or should I tell you I was so sorry for it to end that I've actually considered re-reading it right away? Or can I say that I hope the next book might be a sequel (perhaps with Quincy as the hero) so I can visit these characters/this setting again?NIGHT IN EDEN is one of the best historical romances I've read.

As soon as Hayden comes into the picture, you will instantly fall in love with him. Although he appears a little rough around the edges, you learn that he is a kind, thoughtful person as his character is further developed in the story. The sexual tension between the couple is enjoyable to read.Night in Eden is a novel that I find myself reading over and over again. The setting in historical Australia was unique and interesting. The characters are likable, and the story is well written. Someone commented on the grammar in an earlier review, however it was written like that on purpose to show the area's dialect.All in all, if you enjoy a good romance story, with lots of passion and intrigue, then you will enjoy this book. It's definitely a keeper by a talented author. The story of Bryony and Hayden is beautiful and unforgettable."},{"Title":"Night In Eden (Random House Large Print)","review":"Everything about this book is fabulous - the plot, the characters, the romance, the history.... How an author can come out with a debut book this phenomenal is beyond imagination. The only drawback in reading &quot;Night in Eden&quot; is that it ruined my interest for other romance books for days. You will need to put this book aside and let the story and writing fade before you will be able to pick up another romance. Every other book I picked up after &quot;Night in Eden&quot; just fell short. I have loved the work of Penelope Williamson and cannot believe my luck in finding another great writer in the family. Please tell me there are more sisters with writing talent!"},{"Title":"Night In Eden (Random House Large Print)","review":"This has got to be one of my favorite romances! I am an avid reader of romances, mainly historical, and having read through such phrases as \\"his throbbing manroot\\" and \\"she opened herself up to him as a flower opens itself to the sun\\" - let's just say I normally scan over the sex scenes or skip them completely. But not the case with this story!!! This story holds some serious sexual tension up until the moment that the two finally find themselves in one another's arms and when they did...I wanted to stand up and cheer. *laughThis story is beautifully written. It tells the story of Bryony, who is accused of murdering her cheating spouse and sentenced to a life of servitude in the Australian colonies. She is purchased by Hayden who is in need of a wetnurse for his newborn infant after the child's mother passed away during childbirth. Bryony grieves for the child that was taken from her before she was sent away...and the one she lost along the way. Hayden is bitter and struggles with feelings of guilt over the loss of his wife. The author portrays the hardships that the people faced living in such a harsh land and you're drawn into the lives of all the characters. This story is simply wonderful!!! I can't say enough about it.I've recommended it many times and anyone I've shared it with express the same sentiments regarding this true \\"love story\\". Definitely a keeper."},{"Title":"Night In Eden (Random House Large Print)","review":"Night in Eden is a truly beautiful and touching story of passion, struggle, and survival. It's so rich and complex in characterization and historical detail that it stands above the best of the rest in the historical romance genre.The journey of two like souls (Bryony and Hayden) coming together under tragic circumstances in brutal conditions was so compelling I read it through in a single sitting and will re-read it soon. I've rarely ever been so immersed in a book.As soon as I finished it I ordered all the rest of Candice Proctor's books. I can hardly wait to read them."},{"Title":"Night In Eden (Random House Large Print)","review":"Let me say, I love the way Penelope Williamson writes. Since she doesn't have that many romance novels, and I've already read most of them, I decided to check out her sister's work, and I was not disappointed. Candice Proctor did a tremendous job with a \\"Night in Eden,\\" (although the title doesn't really fit the book)I was drawn into this novel from the first sentence. That's the sign of a good author.This story was very well written. I loved the first 3/4 of this book. However, there is an unexpected plot twist in the ending that I thought was a bit contrived/far-fetched. The ending was also somewhat abrupt, it was almost as if Ms. Proctor got tired of writing and needed a quick ending.Even though I was disappointed with the ending, I enjoyed this book and will be reading other Candice Proctor books."},{"Title":"Night In Eden (Random House Large Print)","review":"What can I say about Byrony and Hayden? They simply sizzle together! I had a hard time putting this book down. The more books I read by Candice Proctor the more I am convinced that she has become my favorite romance author. Make yourself a hot cup of tea or coffee and sit back and enjoy a sappy romance! What Fun!!"},{"Title":"Night In Eden (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book is perfect in every way. The characters are so real. I borrowed it from a friend and now i have been looking for it in my local book stores. When reading this story you will not be able to to put it down. This book will entice your senses. If you are like me after you read it you will want to read it again right after you finished it the 1st time. I insist that you go out and buy this book right away!!"},{"Title":"Night In Eden (Random House Large Print)","review":"Now I've read hundreads of romance novels and I was at the point where I thought of giving them up because none could keep my interest let alone inspire much feeling. But then I read &quot;Night in Eden.&quot; This was the novel that put me back on the reading horse. It was so bitter-sweet and I was right there with Bryony and the Captain. I don't want to say any more about what goes on in the story than what has already been written because I don't want to deprive the reader of one ounce of reading pleasure, but if you don't pick this book up you have NO IDEA what a wonderful book you'll be missing. By the way, if any of you out there have found a ook that is anything like this let me know!"},{"Title":"Night In Eden (Random House Large Print)","review":"NIGHT IN EDEN is Candice Proctor's debut romance novel and she packs a punch with her setting in the penal colony of what-will-be-called Australia. This was a hard review for me because I was tempted to stop reading after our hero Hayden St. John entered the picture. He was a brisk, rude, and a someone-to-loath type of man. He acted like a jerk with a capital J. Yet I am sure someone like he existed back then.Oh, and did I tell you that I changed my mind but it took awhile? I continued to read because Ms. Proctor did such a good job of making me feel as if I was there. Sweltering heat, mud, filthy clothes, the introduction to Aborigines, living without many basics....OK, OK, I am going to get to the meat of the story.Hayden St. John lost his young wife, Laura, after she gave birth to their son, Simon. It had been four months and he needed a wet nurse. There were others but none of them worked out. Hayden was a desperate man.Bryony Wentworth just lost her infant son, Philip. She was in her early stages of pregnancy when she was found guilty and shipped away. She had been sent to Parramatta prison because of manslaughter. Upon buying her, Hayden treats her like a dog. No, a dog would probably have been treated better.Bryony will put up with anything as long as she can fulfill her dream of serving her time and return to her three year old daughter that she had to leave behind. Her only living child, Madeline, becomes her mantra. She HAS to get back somehow. So she nurses Simon and cares for him in which time he fills the void of having lost her own baby. When she finally arrives at Hayden's homestead, she tiptoes around everything that was Laura's.Meanwhile Hayden slowly changes his mind on how he feels about Bryony. Laura was as different as night is to day compared to this woman. He wants her. He lusts for her. He needs her. And I wouldn't have respected Ms. Proctor if she made things too fast or easy for him. I wanted him to grovel and he did. She resists. And he groveled again. She endures. And he grovels again. He deserved to after treating her so unfairly.The tension and chemistry between the two was very good. Hayden and Bryony were both damaged from things that happened in their past. Where as Hayden came on as an uber-Alpha from the start you will learn that Bryony is the uber-Alpha. Many others would have seen their personalities break; she has the strength to continue. She hangs on. She learns to thrive and he depends on her. He builds up hope and finally learns to love again."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland;: A play in two acts,","review":"This play is considered one of the most successful stage adaptations of Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass for good reason! It is very very true to the original story, down to the order of scenes and phrasing of every line. The cast is versatile and variable (from just a few actors to as many as 50 including the chorus). I am very pleased with my copy and plan to use it at my school in the near future."},{"Title":"Mathematics Encyclopedia (Made Simple Books (Doubleday))","review":"This book is difficult to find (published 1977), but it is a good resource for the middle school and high school math student. My professor recommended it when I was in graduate school (MEd in Math Ed). It explains mathematical terms in a manner that most high school students can understand."},{"Title":"Astrology and Meditation","review":"If you want to know how astrological interpretation really works, if you desire to be able to read a chart in depth, then you must read this book, as it is one of the best books ever written about astrology.I have practiced astrology for many years, and really don't read lots of books on it anymore. Most of them are written for beginners, or are sun sign books, which really don't explain this discipline at all. Some are poorly written, or are extremely judgmental, or they repeat what others have already said, none of which I am interested in.Yet a few out there are jewels. There are the great teachings of Rudhyar, perhaps the greatest astrologer since Ptolemy; he has transformed astrology forever. I still refer to Astrological Mandala, especially when trying to unravel a tough planetary symbol. And there are others that I am not going to discuss here. Believe me, Astrology & Meditation deserves to be on that must-read list. It was introduced quietly into the world (in 2002, I believe), and it is still almost unknown. Some books are born that way. Someday everyone will know about it, because excellence always rises to the top.Greg Bogart is a philosopher, a psychotherapist, a psychologist, a university professor, a practitioner of many spiritual esoteric disciplines, including astrology. He pours all of his knowledge, acquired from years of study and practice, into this book. Moreover, he pours his heart into it too. That means that it is an experiential book: If you read and study its chapters, I mean really live in it as one must do with any profound book, then you will come to know more about astrology than ever before, and you will, if reading charts, see far deeper into any chart that you examine. You will give better readings than ever gave in your life. When books of heart fill our soul, that's just how it works.If you are just beginning to study astrology, I recommend that you purchase this book, and read it. Even if you do not understand some of the technical terms like solar arcs, or progressions, or yods, extended definitions are just a few clicks away on the internet. If I discovered a book like Astrology & Meditation, when I was beginning my study of astrology, it would have saved me years of having to plough through bad books, faulty interpretations, erroneous judgments that I would later have to eradicate, often painfully.Even as an advanced astrologer, I find it a wonderful read. Sometimes it is the quotes from high spiritual teachers to which I return repeatedly to study, for these passages are filled with wisdom; at other times I like to re-read his interpretations--they are extremely valuable, and I find that I agree with them almost always, and they give me a different way of seeing things.If you are employing astrology for healing, for growth, for counseling, or just studying it out of a general philosophical interest, you should get this book, read it, and absorb it. Then read it again, and keep it with you for the rest of your life."},{"Title":"Astrology and Meditation","review":"Many of the astrology titles on my shelves are reference-type works that I've only read selected parts of, but \\"Astrology and Meditation\\" can easily be read from cover to cover. Not only is it relatively short, but there is a single thread or theme running throughout, which is the attempt to demonstrate an approach to astrology that focuses on the higher purpose, intention, or meaning behind a certain planetary position, aspect, progression, or transit. Another reason it's such a readable book is that the general observations and discussions are continually interspersed with specific examples from the author's many clients. Greg Bogart writes in a simple and clear style, focusing mainly on the ten planets, and the book's forty-five displayed charts often show as few as one, two, or three natal planets, along with the particular transiting planet(s) to illustrate his point.Not only is it a very readable book, but it's one that should be read. The idea that we can try to understand the higher purpose or lesson to be learned, rather than worrying about the possible negative consequences from an upcoming transit by Uranus or Pluto, is a very important one that people like me particularly, whose outlook tends to be more fatalistic than humanistic, need to fully appreciate- even if putting the book's advice into practice turns out to be a lot more difficult than agreeing with it in principle.Incidentally, my copy says that it was published in 2002."},{"Title":"Astrology and Meditation","review":"I have another favorite here and I am not one to meditate, fact is I barely have time to think lately. I found this book extremely important to me. Once I started reading it- I could barely put it down. The book showed me the importance of stopping to see the meaning of each symbol in Astrology, to value each meaning and see the positive in chart analysis. Its not just informative its enlightening. I love this book, Its a keeper!"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Skeleton Crew","review":"Excellent service. I love the Alfred Hitchcock's and have been trying to complete my collection.

The flat page lacks the beauty of the oral tale, and some of these stories may have been a little weak in the telling; but on the page they reveal a great deal about Haiti, and are a fascinating read besides.Folk tales reveal a great deal about a culture-what it values, how members of the society relate, what their beliefs are. These tales do exactly that. While they aren't as clear-cut, with a defined beginning, middle, and end, as American readers have become accustomed to, they do give away a great detail about Haiti. Life is unfinished; hardship is to be embraced and studied; the spirit world is right here at hand, not a million miles away above the clouds.Even on their own, they stand as a monument to the creative act and the power of the human intellect. These stories will infect your head like a virus, spreading and replicating, until you have to pass them on. Read them casually, and you will be enlightened. Study them seriously, and you may be transformed."},{"Title":"The Magic Orange Tree and Other Haitian Folktales","review":"If you're looking for stories with pat, solid endings, this is not the book for you.

Imagine my surprise, then, to discover that I was being treated to a marvelously tightly integrated ethnographic study-cum-anecdote chrestomathy. In addition to some uniquely Haitian elements, there are, of course, the to-be-expected plethora of archetypal folkloric motifs as catalogued by Aarne and Thomson. The stories were generally brief and worked quite well, and Wolkstein's detailed notes about the physical setting and orator of each tale make the reader feel as if he's actually taking part in a rural Haitian storytelling session under the full moon in the sweltering sugar cane fields. Bravo, Dr. Wolkstein!"},{"Title":"Opera as drama","review":"Why does opera exist as a form? Why do people attend operas, and listen to them? Why should you do so? This classic, brilliant book by Kerman makes the case clearly and strongly.Opera is drama; beyond the staged spectacles and emblambed warhorses that seem to draw the biggest audiences, opera exists to convey drama, especially the drama of interior actions, emotions and existence. This is why characters are singing, not merely speaking.Kerman uses the examples, in case study form, of arguably histories greatest operas to point out why the form exists and thrives, and also what makes a work good, and what makes one fail. He begins with Monteverdi and ends with 20th century works like \\"Wozzeck\\" and \\"The Rakes Progress,\\" while also covering Verdi, Wagner, Mozart. His chapter on Mozart's operas is one of the greatest pieces of musical critical thinking that has been written, it explains the greatness of Mozart as an opera composer and also the near-greatness, and flaws, of \\"Don Giovanni\\" and \\"Cosi fan tutte.\\" Kerman also points out what some popular works fail as drama, and thus as opera.This is the single best work to introduce listeners to the form. Highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Opera as drama","review":"The comon view of opera is recitative=drama, arias=music, and therefore not drama. Kerman makes a different (and therefore genuine) claim. he says that in opera the music IS the drama. To illustrate this, he enters a thorough venture in the world of opera, from the first masterpiece - Monteverdi's &quot;orfeo&quot; to wagner and modern operas. The work includes a discussion of the works of such giants as verdi and mozart, and also a critical look at the Leitmotive technics. Kerman is imaginative, provocative, write in a clear language. altough the book demands a background in opera appreciation. It does not demands a musical background. To some it is almost &quot;the bible&quot; of opera understanding. A master achievement."},{"Title":"Opera as drama","review":"Welcome to the nonsensical ramblings of the Trofim Lysenko of US musicology, Joseph Kerman. The bilious opinions of Kerman, a conformist snob whose lack of depth, judgment or taste is meant to be obscured by relentless aggression and malevolence, are best ignored, or even used as a reverse guide. The opera lover does not need to care about what this intellectual dwarf has to say. But I pity those for whom Kerman's opinion has ever mattered professionally."},{"Title":"Opera as drama","review":"This is one of the most thought-provoking books on music I have read. While you may not always agree with him, Kerman makes you think through your attitudes and ideas. I gained much insight from him and recommend this book highly to those who want to delve deeply into opera."},{"Title":"Opera as drama","review":"Hard read.Thanks to Haifa reviewer, I will persist since I share the same view with the the author. Opera can be deadly boring without the hope and fear of 'will he win?' 'will he fail?' of drama. Deadly.Da Ponte spent a lot of time on Cherubino popping in and out of that chair. The other guys cannot just stand around and sing about different things with him lurking back there.Even if the roulette wheel may be fixed, it is the only wheel in town. This is all there is out there on opera as drama.The author may often be obscure but once you penetrate the foliage, he is dramatic."},{"Title":"Peregrine Falcon: Stories of the Blue Meanie (Corrie Herring Hooks Series)","review":"There have been many books on peregrine falcons over the years, including some very good ones. I have read most of them. Jim Enderson's new book is probably the best book on peregrines I have ever seen, especially if one includes the peregrine/human interface. Jim Enderson not only knows peregrine falcons intimately, but he is intimately acquainted with most or all of the major peregrine falcon biologists in the world, not to mention falconers who train and fly both wild caught and captive bred peregrines. Many of Enderson's generation of peregrine biologists were and are falconers, and the unique and substantive insights of these people, including Enderson, are what make this book so special.This book includes a lot of low-key humor by the author, which perhaps one would expect of a former Iowa farm boy. Adventures to the four corners of the world in places from Scotland to Zimbabwe to Greenland are among the highlights of the book. Tales of perilous climbs by rope to visit cliffside peregrine nests place the reader on edge. There is even a tiny amount of sexual innuendo among a few of the stories to titillate those who are not merely satisfied with reading about duck hawks.Enderson also is brutally honest in revealing some of his opinions and foibles. He talks of \\"robbing\\" peregrine nests, with the end justifying the means. The reader is left to wonder if Enderson took some peregrine young illegally (without legal authorization by appropriate government permits) or was he robbing the nests only from the perspective of the parents.Some of the science/policy/conservation views expressed by Enderson are subject to question, such as his apparent view that \\"floaters\\" are not a major part of robust, healthy populations, or that subspecific status is not important in recovery/management efforts. History has shown that peregrine subspecies' status was used in listing the birds at the beginning of the DDT era, but Enderson appears to be saying that subspecies considerations are useful in determining status, but not in management.Any person who loves peregrine falcons or who knows some of the history of peregrine falcon research and recovery will love this book. It is a hard book to put down once you start reading it!Many of us would die to have the chance at a life like Enderson chronicles in this book. This book is a memoir that gives us a peek into a fabulous, productive, exciting human life in close interaction with a truly charasmatic wildlife species. One comes away with a feeling of: \\"Damn. I wish I could have been there, done that.\\""},{"Title":"Peregrine Falcon: Stories of the Blue Meanie (Corrie Herring Hooks Series)","review":"If you didn't want to take the time to read the review by Stan Moore, take my word for it...This book is a truly wonderful look at the plight of the peregrine as a species. Jim Enderson is without a doubt one of the top peregrine biologists in the world, and has created a memoir that is an absolute gem. Buy this book!"},{"Title":"Logic of Images Essays & Conversations","review":"This slim, but fascinating book, is not entirely only accessible to fans of the cinema of Wim Wenders. It certainly fills that requirement with a number of essays detailing the making of a number of his films, his inspirations and the industrial and creative difficulties befalling an artist in the 1970's and 1980's, the most fascinating of which is the trials and tribulations endured with the troubled production and distribution of \\"Paris, Texas.\\" But the book is at its strongest when Wenders commits his philosophy of cinema to the page. This is a philosophy in which image is all important and in which narrative and the story-telling process is seen to hijack the purity and truthfulness of said images - an attitude he shares with his colleague Werner Herzog. What comes across strongest is Wenders love affair with cinema, often reflected in his films overriding pre-occupation with imported Hollywood forms and images. Importantly though Wenders regularly subverts and challenges such images/attitude, as in films such as \\"Kings of the Road\\" and \\"The American Friend.\\" Rather than write with the pretension one would expect of an \`auteur' Wenders in fact writes in a very simplistic, understandable and down to earth prose style, which takes \\"The Logic of Images\\" away from the stuffy, incomprehensible world of academic film theory. Overall there is a feeling of lamentation and nostalgia both in Wenders writing and his cinema, which permanently gives the sense that something great and good has been irretrievably lost."},{"Title":"Love Song (You're the One!

In this book he describes his role, along with his geologist colleagues, during the Apollo explorations of the Moon. In addition, he presents a brief history of the theories associated with the origin of the moon and its craters, the people and problems involved in the section of the Apollo landing sites, a discussion of the geological results obtained from each of the Apollo landing sites, and finally a summary of the findings from the Apollo missions and the development of a theory to explain the formation of the moon.The book opens with several chapters that describe the early telescopic observations of the moon and the competing theories explaining the moon origins. Specifically, there was the cold formation/capture theory and the hot formation/formed with Earth theory. After this thorough explanation of the development of these theories, the author covers the early robotic exploration of the moon conducted by the Ranger, Surveyor and Lunar Orbiter probes. From these missions, it was determined that the majority of the Moon's craters were probably created by meteoroid impact. Within these sections, the author also describes the landing site selection process.Except for the concluding section and appendices, the remainder of the book (approximately 50%) covers in detail, the geological exploration conducted by the astronauts at each landing site and the results obtained. Since the early flights to the moon, Apollos 11, 12 and 14, were shorts stay, the book emphasizes the extensive geological exploration conducted by the Apollos 15, 16 and 17 missions. These missions included an electrically powered car, which greatly extended the areas of the moon that the astronauts could explore. These final missions were also supported in real time by a scientific support room staffed with many highly skilled geologists that helped to direct the astronauts during sample collection.I found this book to be highly enjoyable and its covers an aspect of the Apollo program that is usually not covered in great detail. That is, the people behind the scenes who helped make this project the great success that it was. On the flip side, some readers may find the book a bit too technical, especially with all the geological terms and the small amount of the supporting diagrams and figures."},{"Title":"To a Rocky Moon: A Geologist's History of Lunar Exploration","review":"With the recently aired HBO series &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, interest in the Apollo program has intensified. The series was inspired and based, in part on Andy Chaikin's excellent &quot;A Man on the Moon&quot;. Don Wilhelms, a retired USGS planetary geologist, has written a complementary history of Apollo from the viewpoint of the scientist. He gives wonderful background to how our lunar ideas have evolved, and how Apollo cemented our view of the moon. He presents great sketches of the important characters such as Gene Shoemaker. He presents the science warts and all. His discussion of the science of the various missions nicely complements Chaikin's historical accounts. He is honest in his appraisal of the scientific talents of the various astronauts.If you are interested in lunar science or Apollo, this book is an excellent choice."},{"Title":"To a Rocky Moon: A Geologist's History of Lunar Exploration","review":"This lengthy and detailed account of lunar exploration and science strikes a balance between personal memoir and history. As history it provides a detailed and contextual account of lunar geology during the 1960s and 1970s, and a less detailed but informative account for the rest of the century. As memoir it provides an engaging story of the scientific exploration of the Moon as seen by one of the field's more important behind-the-scenes scientists who worked on Apollo.This is certainly the most detailed personal account of lunar science during the Apollo program, and should be read in tandem with Donald A. Beattie's \\"Taking Science to the Moon: Lunar Experiments and the Apollo Program\\" (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001)."},{"Title":"To a Rocky Moon: A Geologist's History of Lunar Exploration","review":"I must confess that I came to this book not out of a previously existing interest in geology or solar system science, but rather from a fascination with the Apollo program with its engineering and medical challenges. However, this led to wondering what ultimately was discovered on the moon. I then read this fine book and found it very interesting. At the time it was published, there was almost no material available in popular form on the scientific findings of Apollo and the other unmanned spaceflights to the moon so this was a pioneering work. In recent years, other books have appeared that also deal with the lunar discoveries, most notably Paul Spudis' \\"The Once and Future Moon\\" and David M Harland's \\"Exploring the Moon\\". I would have appreciated this book more if I had first read one or both of these other books because Wilhelms assumes the reader has some background in geology which was not the case with me. Once the reader gets up to speed on the basic geology which is provided in those other books, one can appreciate more the historical perspective that the author gives on how our current understanding of the Moon's past and present have developed over the last couple hundred years. In addition to the science, Wilhelms gives colorful descriptions of the major figures in lunar science including Nobel Prize Winner Harold Urey, Ralph Baldwin, Gene Shoemaker, Hal Masursky, \\"Mr Moondust\\" Thomas Gold, as well as the various astronauts who were recruited (sometimes unwillingly) into the lunar science fraternity. I believe that in order to understand any branch of science, it is important to see the evolution of ideas leading to our current knowledge and this book is an excellent source of information on the development of lunar science for the scientifically educated layman."},{"Title":"To a Rocky Moon: A Geologist's History of Lunar Exploration","review":"Whew!...You almost need to take a geology class before tackling this. Wilhems goes into great detail describing the moon from a geologists standpoint, so be prepared for that, but, the things that I took from this is that he also describes the early history of the un-manned program of lunar exploration (Ranger and Surveyor programs) in excellent detail as well as the geology history of the manned program, training and all. Obviously, the later (Apollo 15 through 17) missions are covered in more detail than the early ones, but there is something here for everyone interested in the Apollo program...just be prepared to be inundated with geology-speak."},{"Title":"To a Rocky Moon: A Geologist's History of Lunar Exploration","review":"This is a good book and you'll find no better account about the geology of the Moon. My only bone to pick with the author is as follows: on the subject of tektites--those odd-shaped, natural glass stones which show evidence of having entered the Earth's atmosphere at angles which have their starting points on the Moon's surface--Wilhelms displays his conservative bias in favor of the safe diagnosis which chants that tektites are fancy forms of impactites and crater glass. The author fails to report that micro-tektites were indeed discovered on the Moon in several Apollo samples as well as in a sample from the Russian Luna 16 sample return mission! And for at least one Apollo sample, the tektitic material is IDENTICAL to Earth's tektites; had this rock been found in Antarctica, say, according to retired NASA scientist J.A. O'Keefe, it would have been identified as a tektite! The ghostly mantra of old Harold Urey--that tektites are terrestrial--keeps rearing its head on this topic. When you begin to look at impact structures and tektites, you begin to realize that tektites are not there because of the craters, but vice versa. So, the debate about tektites and their origins is far from settled as Wilhelms, et al, would lead us to believe.!"},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"This is my favorite Ann Rinaldi book. It was the most mysterious and had so many different themes. I also learned a lot about what America was like just after the Civil War."},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"Hello! In am reading this story for a 6th grade class book. When I first picked it up I thought our teacher made a terribele mistake in the pick. But after reading the first couple chapters it really started to make me wonder! I don't know why, but this seems like a historical time that I want to learn more about! This story is great the way it is written in 1st person! I think that authors should write in 1st person more often, because in many stories just like this one it brings you into the story and you feel like your the main character! This is a great story and I think you should read it!"},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"My gosh! This was fantastic. I mean, for goodness sakes, tears were welling up in my eyes with frustration at the end. However, as I was scanning other reviews, some people did not even realize how hippocritical they were being in their opinions of the book. Some readers were complaining how rotten it was because the characters irritated them, acted irrationally, or said angry things that they didn't understand. This, dear frustrated reader, is what makes this book one of the greats. It wasn't being awful literature, it was bringing buried emotions out of you. That is a writer's purpose, the reason why they spend hours banging out these words. If something makes you angry, frustrated, depressed, sorrowful, or anything else, it is a treasure. These readers didn't like it because the book brought out an emotion that didn't make them feel like they were walking on sunshine. If you look at it like this, you'll find you like more books than you think you do."},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"I recently had to read An Aqaintance ith darkness for a book report.

I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"A young girl named Emily that lives in Washington. Her Mother is sick with a cough that can kill her. Her Father died in the Civil war. She misses her Father so much because they were so close. The book only starts like this but it is a really good book. I like the book because I has sapience and horror, like the part when Abraham Lincoln dies and they blame it on... So it is one of the greatest books and you should read it."},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"This is one of my favorite books by Anne Rinaldi. While you read this novel your learning about the hard times during the Civil War, ... You should read this book if you like hitorical fiction or are looking for a good book to read."},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"You've heard about the body snatching. Gross right? While I still consider it gross and wrong, I have a new appretiation for the cause in which doctors dug up graves. Dont get me wrong, the purpose of this book isn't to convince you that doctors should dig up dead people, it is merely to inform you of the history of medicine and briefly discuss Lincoln's assassination. Give this book a try, I think you'll like it."},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"I really liked this book! It is a Classic &quot;Rinaldi&quot;. I really like Ann Rinaldi style of writing and it is filled with all sorts of excitement. One thing that was a bit different than most of her books is that is was sort of &quot;dark&quot;. It is not a real &quot;happy&quot; book to read although it is very good."},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"This book, is so amazing. You feel as if you were right there with Emily, feeling her grief, seeing what she saw, hearing what she heard. It was great. This is the first book I've read by Ann Rinaldi, and I'm making a promise to read all of her material. She's a wonderful author! A definite page turner. Keeps you wondering."},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"If you like suspense and historical fiction, then this is the book for you! Emily is a girl who lives in Washington D.C. during a time when the whole country is in turmoil about the assassination of President Lincoln.As if that isn't enough, Emily has even more to deal with.

She is forced to stay with the uncle her mother had not trusted nor liked. Emily struggles with the change and her suspicions only grow stronger about her uncle's secret life as the days go by.

When President Linclon is assasinated, tensions run high, and people are scared out of their minds. Even more so for Emily when her best friend's mother Mrs. Surrat is arrested in the conspiracy. Emily is even more confused when she has to go live with her Uncle Valentine, and finds out he's not typical doctor, and likes to play around with things you would find very odd. I loved this book and I think you will too."},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"Ann Rinaldi has written a great book involving two interesting plots. The first sixty pages or so are a little slow, but keep reading!! It gets a lot better!!! After accommplishing those first pages I was hooked for the rest of the book! This was the first book by Ann Rinaldi that I have read before and can't wait to read another!"},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"I love all of Ann Rinaldi's books, but this is surely one of my favorite. It has a very interesting plot that moves along at a good pace, and many characters that bring a lot to the story. The main character, Emily, sees things in an interesting and informative perspective, as many of Rinaldi's narrators do. Due to her circumstances, she is living with her Uncle Valentine and learning for herself what all his medical practice consists of. She is witnessing what happened to Washington upon Lincoln's assasination, and she conveys this all to the reader very well. Rinaldi works in a love story, making Emily's interest one of the main characters, as she normally does, without taking away the true meaning and grit of the story, as many other authors do. The book also has a lot of action and a lot of facts. Though I don't normally read historical fiction, Ann Rinaldi writes so well that she has become my favorite author. I would recommend this along with all of her other books to anyone who asked."},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"This takes place around the Lincoln assisination and involves the stealing of bodies for medical purposes. The book was suprisingly predictable, which made me frustrated with Emily and her inability to see what was going on. A very good historical book, but contains no illustrations. I would recommend this one to students from the 6th grade up."},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"If you're looking for an enjoyable book, I would recommend An Acquaintance with Darkness by Ann Rinaldi. It's set in Washington, D.C. during the assassination of Lincoln. It covers the turmoil that happens in the city and how people reacted. The main character of this book is Emily Pigbush, a teenage girl whose mother just died. Now an orphan, Emily is planning to move in with her best friend who lives two houses down. However, once Lincoln is shot, suspicion is everywhere and Emily's friend's mother is arrested on suspicion of being an accomplice in the assassination of the president. Emily is forced to live with her mysterious Uncle Valentine, a well-respected surgeon, whom her mother, for no apparent reason, deeply mistrusted. Soon Emily discovers Uncle Valentine is rumored to be enveloped in unlawful doings with his medical research. At last, the truth comes out and it's beyond Emily's imagination! With mystery and imagination, Ann Rinaldi spins a magnificent tale that happened during a time history can never forget."},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The story was easy to follow, but very interesting. I enjoyed the detail put into the historical facts and character descriptions very much. It was nice to have the author describe in detail at the end where the actual fact ended and where the fiction began. You really understood why Emily was confused and felt for the country at the loss of the President. I would highly recommend this book for everyone from middle school age thru adult!"},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"\\"An Acquaintance With Darkness\\" is suspenseful the whole way through.

Ann Rinaldi has done it again! This was a wonderful book, not only because Ann Rinaldi wrote it but because the characters seemed to come alive. The author made it seem like you were in the book by her wonderful descriptions and development of characters. Also, she researches her topics so well it is obvious she knows her what she is writing about, which adds to the authenticity of the book. The plot is also very engrossing and suspenseful which makes for a very good book. I found myself very mad when the book ended,though, because I was not ready for it to be over."},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"Rinaldi incorporates an incredible amount of historical fact into her novel of a young girl living in Washington D.C. at the time of President Lincoln's assassination. Emily, our protagonist, claims Annie Surratt, daughter of the first woman ever hanged by the United States Government, as her best friend. Because of this, Emily is witness to some extremely important events in our nation's history, and Rinaldi employs this strategy to make these events come alive for a young reader. Never once does Emily's involvement in the action feel forced, as some historical novels tend to, and her presence at Mary Surratt's hanging seems neither inappropriate or extraneous.Rinaldi has also managed to include a secondary plotline that is just as entertaining and informative. Emily's uncle, whom she lives with is a physician struggling to advance his field. In order to do this, he may or may not be engaging in illegal methods to procure cadavers for his medical school.Emily is a very realistic protagonist, who is definitely a product of her upbringing and her era. There is quite a bit of the 'southern belle' in her character, but also a delightful amount of spunk. I wavered back and forth while reading this book about whether or not I liked her. I still am not sure, but I certainly got to know and understand her, as well as watch her learn and grow. Which is what a coming of age tale is all about."},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"If you love mystery, then An Acquaintance with Darkness is the perfect book for you. This book not only puts you on the edge of your seat, but it also teaches you a little history lesson without the boring facts. I loved this book cause the author was soooo good at making history, in this case Lincoln's asassination, fun and interesting to read about by using fiction. I also liked the way the book had a little bit of everything, romance, mystery, horror, and anything else you could possibly think of. This book did have its slow molasses parts, but all in all I give Ann Rinaldi an A++! I hope she continues to write."},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"When I first picked up An Aquaintance With Darkness I thought it was going to be just another girl comming of age type historical novel. An Aquaintance With Darkness was so much more. This novel not only vividly described the turmoil in Washington surrounding the end of the American Civil War and the assasination of President Lincoln, but also brought up a pressing moral issue of that time: is it wrong to snatch bodies for medical research? It was interesting to read Emily's veiw point and see her inner struggle to sort out right from wrong. It was exciting to see the focus of the story change from a story of a girl growing up as an orphan to a story of a girl who must choose between what she beleives is right and being loyal to her family and friends. Over all I would say the book was a pleasent surprise."},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"Emily Bransbury's mom just died a week ago,her best friends mom was arrested for haelping the assasanation of Aberaham Lincoln.

After a week of reading it I was sick of it. Plus it was way to slow.I wouldnt reccomend this book because in some spots its hard to tell whats happening.

For people my age i read it a long time in advance."},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"This book was one of Ann Ranildi's best. It is very emotinal, a some points I was so mad at the girl and a some points I was afraid. The book weaves 2 problums into one so ther's always something you have to look out for, and you don't know what charater to trust. The book takes a historal moment know one will forget and turns it into a book in the eyes of a 14 year old girl, who has no family left but her uncle that betrays her."},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"It was a great story. It felt as if you were Emily and your mother had died and you were orphaned. You also felt the craziness that everyone was feeling after Lincon was assainated. You felt scared of what her Uncle Valentine was doing. You also felt for her best friend who had trouble (I won't say what to give it away!) It was one of those books you never wanted to end. I reccomend this book highly!"},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"Well, to be really honest with you, I didn't like this book. Personally, I though Ann Rinaldi could've done a little better. Some parts are interesting and maybe even suspensful, but the rest is kind of dull. At some points in the book, Emily, the main character, is lying so much to her Uncle Valentine and is being so selfish, it's like, &quot;okay, so when's she going to tell the truth or at least realize what she has done?&quot;"},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"This book is really exciting;from the first chapter only. I am going to be honest with you, because if I raved about how wonderful and exciting this book was, it would be a lie. It was written with appropreate remarks and English grammer, but sometimes storys just don't get you in the heart. This perticular one didn't. But there are her other books, which I would say, are a masterpiece!"},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"An Acquaintance with Darkness is one of Rinaldi's finest works yet. I got it off Amazon.com about a few months ago, and it has joined my collection of &quot;my fav books&quot;, which includes more Rinaldi books. Rinaldi describes the scenes like you are actually there in Emily's time."},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read!

Emily Bransby Pigbush is an independent fourteen year old girl taking care of her diseased mother in Washington DC, 1865. Since her father died, Emily is left with no relatives except her Uncle Valentine. Oddly, Emily's mother had begged her not live with Valentine after her passing, but under strong circumstances, Emily is forced to move into Valentine's mansion, where she finds some interesting people who seem to play an important role in Valentine's career. While living with Valentine Emily realizes that he may be more than a caring doctor, but a criminal. Maybe going to far with his career...and putting his niece in extreme danger with the law.Furthermore, President Lincoln has just been assassinated, and the people are hungry for justice. Anyone could be a suspect, and it seems the people closest to Emily's heart are most at risk with the law.Pros: Rinaldi did an amazing job making the reader feel in the 18th century. The characters are very well described, the nature of each and every character complex. There was obviously a lot of thought put in to them.Cons: Rinaldi sometimes went off from the subject. I would be reading a page which included a tense moment, and at those moments my eyes would be huge scanning the page trying to figure out what would happen next. In the middle of those moments, Rinaldi would suddenly stop. Either the next two pages would be filled only with Emily's thoughts, while i would be dying trying not to skip a few pages. I understand that you would want the reader to be held in suspense, but Emily would think so much that the tense moment would be forgotten.All in all this was a great book, but not if you are looking for a fast-moving adventure. This is more of a-day-in-the-life-of rather than an adventure. Read if you are looking for a suspenseful mystery."},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"Fourteen-year-old Emily Pigbush is living through the harrowing aftermath of the Civil War. Her father died during the Conflict, and her mother dies not long after. A self-absorbed and spoiled Southern belle, she never forgave her husband for not giving her what she felt she had deserved. Now, in her death bed, she has one wish, that Emily does not end up with her uncle, a respected doctor in Washington DC. Uncle Valentine is soft spoken and kind. He also loves President Lincoln. So why does Emily's mother loathe him so much? She gets her answers when she is forced to live with her uncle after her mother dies. It's bad enough that her best friend's family seems to have had a close acquaintance with John Wilkes Booth, the president's assassin, and whose mother and brother (the latter of whom is on the run) may end up in prison and executed, but her uncle is involved in some clandestine activity. What is body snatching, and why is her uncle doing this? Nothing is the way it seems to Emily, and she might have to grow up sooner than expected.This is a wonderful Civil War novel that showcases some true historical facts with a fast-paced story. Emily is curious about the stuff that goes on around her, like most fourteen-year-olds, but shows a great deal of wisdom and perception at the same time. She soon learns not to judge everything that goes on around her and discovers just how damaging ill-intended gossip could be. An Acquaintance with Darkness is a great novel to read if you want to learn more about President Lincoln's assassination and some other historical information regarding science and medicine. I recommend this quick and pleasant read."},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"A young girl named Emily lives in Washington with her mom.

It immersed you into the characters. You felt totally attached to them. It let me in to a new aspect of the Civil War that I had never seen before...it was interesting and definitely not boring.

The charatcters and the story were very well-written and woven into real history that I felt like i was relly there. The medical aspcet of it was interesting as well. I was also intrigued by all the body-snatchers and read more about them . The author presents a fair argument as to whether the bodies should have been left alone or used for mediacl science and I thought that her un-biased nature was commendable.

She does not want to go live with Uncle Valentine, her mother's brother, after her mother dies. Family friends, the Surratts, have offered her a place to stay after her mother's death, but before Emily can move in with them, President Lincoln is assassinated and Mrs. Surratt and her daughter Annie are arrested and interrogated because they are suspected of being part of the assassination conspiracy. At this point, Emily has no choice but to move in with her Uncle Valentine. He is a noted and highly respected physician, but something very strange is going on at his house.

She goes with her uncle instead of to her friend's (Annie) house like her mother and she had planned. After all of this she decides to stay in control of her life. By doing this she betrays her uncle's trust and loses her friend Annie. Annie, in Emily's eyes, has grown cold and heartless since they found evidence that her mother was involved with President Lincoln's assassnation. But since this is after the civil war they wouldn't hang a woman, would they? I thought this book was very discriptive and mysterious, so in my eyes it was a good book. I like it also because it was based on the truth and I like how the book ended, I guess you could say it was a different ending."},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"I think this is probably the best book I have ever read. Ann Rinaldi really gets into the eyes of the people after Abe's death. The book is very suspenseful and you won't want to put it down. You should read it!"},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"This book taught me a lot. Grave robbing seemed like a terrible crime to me at the beginning of this story, but by the end Rinaldi had made me stop to consider it again. Even if something is illegal, if it is being done for the benifit of others is it really all that bad? Emily realizes this as well--what she has to deal with is not nearly so terrible as what her friend Annie has to deal with. Emily learns a bunch and matures quite a bit in this book but after all her experiences she &quot;wishes she was Miss Muffet again&quot;. I think I can understand that. This book was quite a thriller and gave me shivers a few times--it wasn't a bit what I was expecting. Historical tidbits are present as well and they made the book very interesting. I'd definately recommend this book to historical fiction fans who want a little something out of the ordinary."},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"I am a big fan of Ann Rinaldi, and I definatly think this is one of her best. It is a great book to curl up with, and once you start reading, it's hard to stop. Is is about a young girl who is confused and frightened after the assination of Abraham Lincoln. The story is very intriguing and, as with most of her books, a small and not overdone love story is taking place between two of the characters. It is worth reading, whether you buy it or not."},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"An easier to read and understand Ann Rinaldi historical creation. Lacked the romance I love so much in her other historical fictions, but pretty good. Written at a much more different and hidden angle, a book Rinaldi followers would prefer."},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"This book by Ann Rinaldi is a book hard to miss next to the other books by her. This one we just got in this June. I recomend all of her books especialy In my fathers house, which I read twice. This is a book you don't want to pass up. she is brillant."},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"I am an Ann Rinaldi fan, and have been for a long time. I found An Acquaintance with Darkness and knew right off the bat that this book was for me.What I didn't expect however was a suspenseful romance regarding the state of chaos in Washington D.C. right after Lincoln's assasination. Emily Bransbury went through a tough few months. First, her mother dies after a long illness. Emily was supposed to move in with family friends ,but then Emily Bransbury learns the news; President Lincoln is dead and her neighbors are involved with the assasination. Thus she tumbles down another path, living with her eccentric Uncle Valentine. The next few weeks in Emily's life bring about swift swift changes and Emily, herself, is forced to change her views of her uncle and her life.

It shows the emotions of two teenagers and how priorities change when you are forced to grow up quickly. The friendship between Emily and Annie, and the struggles that they endure, are heart warming to say the least. It is not only about the assassination of President Lincoln and what effect that had on the country, but also about the unorthodox ways that the medical profession had to learn about the human body. I recommend this book very highly. All ages will enjoy reading An Acquaintance With Darkness."},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"I liked this book, but some of her others were better. I was very surprised at the way doctors found there information at that time. I have never heard of grave robbing before this. This style of writing was different from how she usually writes. I also recommend one of her new ones, The Second Bend in the River."},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"This was the first book I had read by Ann Rinaldi and I loved it! I have read many other books by her since then. At first I thought I would not like this book because it takes place over 100 years ago, but I was wrong. Rinaldi draws you into the book. The main character, Emily, is very likable. She's not perfect. She has some flaws, like when she thinks her problem with her uncle is worse then when her friend's mother is arrested and may be put to death. The novel is also very historically accurate. Before I never knew grave robbing had been a problem in the 1800's. I highly reccomend this book"},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"All the dark themes and the mystery is a pleasant change from her normal style.

Finally, Emily must make a decision that will have a very big impact on her life"},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"This is a stellar book. It will keep you on edge in typical Rinaldi fashion, and it will explore the ethics of gravestealing and what not. It wouldn't be a Rinaldi without a complex romance either.

Read it, or you're missingout on a great book!"},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"An Acquaintance with Darkness is a very well written novel. It's a novel of historical fiction and takes place right around Lincoln's assassination. The main character, Emily, tells the story. Emily's life is a mess, like most people during that time. Her dad just died in the Civil War. Her mother is dying, of 'failing' as they say. Her mother's death wish is for Emily's uncle, Uncle Valentine, to stay away from her once she dies. Emily's mother knows something about Uncle Valentine that she feels is not right, but Emily does not know what. After her mother passes away, Uncle Valentine, unknown to Emily, goes to court and gains full custody over her. Lincoln is assassinated and Washington is going insane. Anyone associated with Booth, Lincoln's killer, was arrested. Unfortunately Emily's best friend, Annie's, mother was of close association with Booth. Mrs. Mary, Annie's mother is arrested, in prison, and condemned to be hung. this only gives Emily more confusion, not to mention the fact that her secret crush, Annie's brother Johnny, has run away and has not been heard from, plus Emily is living with her uncle. At first this seemed a fine arrangement until Emily learns that there is more to her uncle's profession as a doctor. With the city in an uproar, Emily doesn't know what to do, where to go, who to talk to, or even who she can trust. Emily is left alone and confused. This is such a great, involved novel. Some of it is fictional, but much of the basis for the story is factual. The book is so good that you would have never known that it wasn't entirely true if you didn't read the Author's note."},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"Emily Pigbush is an orphan. In the first few chapters of the book, she loses her mother, and her father is long gone from the war.She is left to live with her best friend Annie, the daughter of Mary Surratt.That night, there is a great outcry in the city of Washington, where Emily lives. Mr. Lincoln, the president, has been shot dead. Emily is even more stunned when she hears who had done it-- the man who had been staying with the Surratt's, John Wilkes Booth. The Surratts are thrust into investigation for connection to the murder. Emily is sent to stay with her rich uncle instead, Valentine. She gets along well there, until she uncovers a sinister secret from a woman staying in the house -- her uncle could be a bodysnatcher. She pursues the idea, quietly, until she is confronted at school by a reporter's daughter. Her fears are confirmed when she sees the proof with her own eyes. She loses herself in her own emotions; love for Robert, a man Valentine saved, hate for all of them.A very good illustration of the Civil War and the unjustly accused."},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"A fan of Rinaldi, I was looking forward to reading this book. The original plot was set up well, but as I read on it became more gruesome and frightening with every page. Its title says it all: the book is just plain dark. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone not in for a horror story. Dead bodies, detailed accounts of hangings, nightmares, and assasinations are not what I look forward to in Ann Rinaldi's books."},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"This book was an awesome book by Ann Rinaldi. This story takes place during the time right after Lincoln was assinated. A girl named Emily has a mother who is deadly ill. Her mother knew that she was about to die and she told Emily that she needed to live wih someone. Emily wants to live wiht her aunt in Philidelphia, but her om wants her to live with her good friend next door. Emily's uncle Valintine comes into town to see Emily's mother. Valintine tries to tell Emily that she needs to come live with him. emily's mother doesn't want Emily to go live with him. Emily decides to go visit her uncle. While she is there she meets an old crazy black lady that lives upstairs. She tells Emily that her uncle has a big secert and that Emily needs to help get the old lady out. Emily is told that the big seceret is in her uncle's shed where NO ONE is allowed. To find out the secert you have to read this awesome book!!!"},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"This was one of my favorite Rinaldi books, out of all 12 that I've read. Emily Pigbush's mother dies in the beginning, and she has to choose between living with Annie Suratt, Mary Suratt's daughter, and her Uncle Valentine, a very good doctor. When she ends up unwillingly staying with her Uncle, she learns something terrible about him, that forces her to run away. When his assistant finds her and brings her home, Emily discovers that the crime her uncle commits is for the good of everyone. I don't want to give it away, but this book is fascinating, and I forgot to say that it is during the time of Lincoln's assassination. I would reccommend ALL of Rinaldi's books, even though I haven't read them all. I just know they're good anyways!"},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"Ann Rinaldi perfectly captured the scene of President Lincoln's assassinaqtion and focusing on the troubles that followed the event. &quot;An Acquatiance with Darkness,&quot; was an extremely entertaining historical novel with a twist of evil. As someone who never found an interest in a historical novel before, this book, based around Lincoln's assassination left me turning pages eagrly. His assassination lead to many problems in the life of Ms. Emily Pigbush. Rinaldi leads you day by day through her life and explains her feelsings towards the trials of her friend's mother, the search for her beloved friend who disappeared, and the secrets that she uncovers about her highly respected uncle, Dr. Valentine. As much as the story seems plainly laid before you,you later find out that it is not as simple as it seems. This book is filled with hate, love, evil, and an all over feeling of jealousy. Even though thi book is a historical, Rinaldi did not dwell on the actual assassination, but its effects. The time peroid was very vividly described giving you a feeling that you are actually there when the4 soldiers return home from fighting the Civil War. Even though it is mostly about Emily, that doesn't mean in any way that the story is girlish or based on her adolescent problems. The book is perfectly appropriate for a girl or a boy. This book may not be for everyone, but I strongly encourage anyone looking for a book about a very important time in history with a twist of lies and evil I would suggest, &quot;An Acquaintance with Darkness.&quot; Another plus to this book would be that knowing that it is a historical novel, the events did take place. AT the very end of the book, the author wrote a little section about what really happened to all the characters after she stopped writing. She also explained more about what was going on at the time period in detail. This book was very enjoyable and I would suggest it to anyone at any age level."},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"I have read many of Ann Rinaldi's books and I think they are wonderful! She puts so much detail into them, it is unbelievable! Forteen-year-old Emily lives in Washington D.C. during the Civil War. Her mother has died and she is going to live with the Surratt's. But the son, Johnny, has been accused of being in on the assasination of the president. Her uncle takes her to live with him because the Surratt's house is under suspicion, which is against her mother's wishes. She had always hated Uncle Valentine for what reason, Emily does not know. But she has no choice. Then she finds out that her uncle may be in on body snatching! He uses the bodies for research. Can Emily confront her uncle or does she have to bear the guilt of going against her mother's wishes?"},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"This book was my first Ann Rinaldi book. I was stunned by it. It was just absolutly wonderful- filled with everything and just about anything you could want, (at least what I wanted). It was my favorite book. If you're a great historical fiction lover and/or Ann Rinaldi story lover this would be an extrememly nice addition for your reading buds.The book's main character (whom you've probably already found out) is fourteen year old Emily Pigbrush, who experiences through many tragic events. First her widow mother dies and she decides to live with her best friend, Annie Surratts. But on the night before she moves out the greatest of all misfortunes happen - President Lincoln gets shot and suspicion falls on the Surratts. Forced to go and live with Uncle Valentine, Emily finds out more as to why her mother hated her brother so much. As to the rest, you really should find out yourself. In the end the story leaves you a strange feeling. One that signals the end but it leaves you kind of sad. Over all it's a great book."},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"Emily Bransby Pigbush finds herself in the midst of turmoil in Washington DC at the end of the Civil War. For a poverty-stricken girl nursing a mother dying of tuberculosis, she is very much in the thick of events. Everything starts to go wrong for Emily. Her proud, genteel mother scorns family and friends, so Emily is the sole caretaker in the end. Emily's mother was an assistant to Mrs. Lincoln's dressmaker, and Emily's friend, Johnny is conspiring for the Confederacy with John Wilkes Booth.When Emily is orphaned, she goes to live in luxury with her uncle (whom her mother always hated). This uncle is a prominent doctor and medical researcher with extensive war experience and a scientific mind. To further medical science, he must supply his medical students with cadavers-which are mainly available through grave robbery.Emily is characterized with a nice blend of strength and naivete, appropriate for her age as a child about to blossom into womanhood. The relationships to her friends-both the fierce loyalty for one and an extreme antipathy for another-are not well fleshed out, which is a failing, since the friends and enemies are so influential to the life paths she takes.The story is a good one, but it really needed to be either longer, or shorter. Emily seems to be connected by only 1 or 2 degrees of separation to all the important events of the day, rather than the usual 6 or so. Everything seems to touch her life-John Wilkes Booth and the theater, confederate soldiers and spies, science and superstition, recently freed slaves and former slave owners, jails, executions, herbal lore, night blooming plants, etc. Rinaldi packs too many historical threads in the book without fleshing them out sufficiently with characters and stories.An Acquaintance with Darkness is a good book for leisure reading. It would also be well placed as assignment to provoke curiosity about the end of the Civil War. There are certainly enough topics to springboard into many different research projects, and each student could pick up the thread that interested them most. Rinaldi supplies a bibliography and historical note which students could use to segue into those topics."},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"I loved An Aquaintance With Darkness! It was one of those books that when most of the mysteries have been solved another mystery pops up. One of the things I liked about it was that it is a historical novel, but not one of those historical novels that were too educacating. It was spooky and mysterious. The book was so well writen you'd actully think you were living in the time after the Cival War. I hope many people will read and enjoy this book."},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"An Acquaintance With Darkness is a thirlling, exciting and forshadowing book.Ann Rinaldi really makes this historical fiction novel, fun and exciting to read.We really enjoyed reading the book, we also recommend it to all students."},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"An Acquaintance With Darkness is a thirlling, exciting and forshadowing book.Ann Rinaldi really makes this historical fiction novel, fun and exciting to read.We really enjoyed reading the book, we also recommend it to all students."},{"Title":"An Acquaintance with Darkness","review":"I picked this book for my history book report and at first I didn't think I'de like it, but once I read the first page, I feel in love with it.

I am currently a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin. I originally used this book, in unpublished form, as a freshman in Dr. Siska's course. As a senior I helped to teach from this book by holding extra help session for Dr. Siska. Since then, I have had the opportunity to teach from two other general chemistry books. Dr. Siska's University Chemistry is the most physically oriented general chemistry book you are likely to come by. His general approach allows for any budding young chemist to gain an impeccable understanding of the physical foundation of chemistry. Additionally, this text does not read like most introductory texts. Dr. Siska's humor and love for the history of science shine through. I looked back at the unpublished versions of this text many times during my undergraduate education and obtained a hard cover version as soon as I could. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"University Chemistry.","review":"I was a student in Dr. Siska's Honors Chemistry course in 2003-2004. Although this book was not yet professionally published, I used Dr. Siska's self-published version. I can honestly say that I learned more from this text than any other chemistry text. The difference is that Dr. Siska forces students to solve basic Physical Chemistry problems in this book, which requires an intrinsic understanding of General Chemistry. If you can solve (and more importantly, explain) the solutions to the problems in this text, then it is more than likely that you have mastered the underlying concepts in General Chemistry I and II. I'm a huge fan and I give this book two thumbs up."},{"Title":"University Chemistry.","review":"There was a lot of detail and information in this book, but not enough examples and the quantum mechanics section was not covered very well. probably since it would be beyond the scope of the book otherwise."},{"Title":"Jazz and Blues: Play-Along Solos","review":"I am a professional player and teacher with students ranging from beginner to adult.First the good things: the book has songs that not represented on prior play-alongs, including &quot;Harlem Nocturne&quot; ,&quot;Opus One&quot; and &quot;Bernie's Tune&quot;. Plus, the players involved are quite good. This book could be useful for helping a beginner (to jazz) develop feel, at least in playing melodies.However, the flaws are pretty severe. Most songs have only 1 chorus of improvisation, some less. On &quot;Harlem Nocturne&quot; and &quot;Desafinado&quot;, the solos are less than 12 bars TOTAL. Next, some arrangements are poor. &quot;A Night In Tunisia&quot; does not include the interlude before the break. &quot;Harlem Nocturne&quot; does not include the interval pattern at the end of the bridge.Again, this title might have a little value for a beginning jazz player to follow the melodies in an appropriate style.

Anyone who has enjoyed the unabashed romanticism of Alfred Noyes's poem &quot;The Highwayman&quot; won't be disapointed in this fleshing out of both story and characters. From the quickly drawn sketches of the innkeeper (whose daughter Bess falls in love with the young highwayman) to the portrait of mercurial Abel Gant (mentor, philosopher and friend of the young bandit, Jason Quick) the cast is believeably human. And the love story between Bess and Jason draws the reader right into their world. A delightful read with some substance as well."},{"Title":"Watch by Moonlight: Library Edition","review":"When I found out this book was based on my favorite poem, I just had to read it. I'm glad I did. It's a rich, masterful rendering of &quot;The Highwayman&quot; by Noyes, with complex characters. Hawks brought the poem alive, made me feel for the characters, root them along. Even though I knew the ending from the poem, I cried anyway. Beautiful!This is a must read for any who love &quot;The Highwayman&quot; by Noyes."},{"Title":"Watch by Moonlight: Library Edition","review":"I know the poem, and I knew it before Lorena McKennit's rendering. Even though I used to listen to that CD incessantly, for some reason it didn't click with me, until the very end - I mean the END, when I turned the page and found the poem. But it was too late because I was absolutely depressed by the ending and then I read the poem and then I got this huge lump in my throat and then I wished I hadn't stayed up to finish the book.It was riveting. I don't agree with the two reviews below - the person who apparently doesn't realize Lorena McKennit didn't write the words, just put them to music, or the reader who felt the characters weren't fleshed out. In my opinion, the story was well developed, both the plot and the characters had depth, and the foundation for the finality of the story/the poem was superbly done.It took me a while to get to sleep, and that's unusual for me. I don't know if I'd read it again. I know the ending and it was too sad. I love West Side Story and Romeo and Juliet, but I won't read or watch either one of them again either.And to think I almost didn't check it out of the library. Despite the heartbreaking ending, I'd have missed a real treat."},{"Title":"Watch by Moonlight: Library Edition","review":"I know the much loved Poem written ALFRED NOYES.

The characters, mostly Bess, were somewhat superficial and shallow, but this got better as the book progressed. As far as I am concerned, the only problem was the author's tendency to write page-long narratives of Bess's slightly maundering thoughts, which were fairly uninteresting and repetitive. But, as I said, it got much better by the end, and the final conclusion was very emotionally moving (I cried), even though anyone who's read Alfred Noyes' &quot;The Highwayman&quot; knew what would happen.The author is excellent at writing dark, emotional endings, and she used this ability to the full in this book. While there are the aforementioned problems, it's most definitely a page-turner, and if you like &quot;The Highwayman&quot; at all, you're pretty much guaranteed to like &quot;Watch by Moonlight&quot;. It's not the sort of book you keep under your pillow and memorize, but it's a very good read even the second and third time."},{"Title":"Watch by Moonlight: Library Edition","review":"I'm assuming the quote from &quot;The Highway Man&quot; that's used in the title comes from the poem of the same name by Alfred Noyes, which existed long before Ms.MeKenna's song of that title."},{"Title":"Watch by Moonlight: Library Edition","review":"This was both good and bad.

An excellent introduction to Asian religions for college-level students, superbly supplemented by essays in the volumes from which these essays were excerpted."},{"Title":"Asian Religions in Practice: An Introduction (Princeton Readings in Religions)","review":"The following was written as a sort of \\"after the discussion of the book response\\" to the professor. Through seeing what responses I had, and the issues I picked up on especially you can gain a better understanding of the book. In general, it's good point is that it covers a lot of ground, and it covers \\"practice\\" not \\"philosophy\\" or \\"history\\". It's low points... the Japan chapter was particularly poorly synthesized, the two chapters by Lopez ignored Korea (and it's major contribution to Buddhism), the typographical errors, and the short length for such a major topic. It's about \\"Asian\\" religions, but entirely focused on Indian religions, almost entirely Mahayana Buddhism, no mention of SE Asian religiosity or changes to practices there, no mention of newer religions in for example Vietnam or the interesting interpretation of Islam in Indonesia. To improve, rewrite the Japan chapter, fix the typos, add a chapter on Korea and a chapter on Vietnam, and SE Asian Buddhism and SE Asian Islam. On the other hand, this book is a collection of the introductory essays for five other books, and you can just buy the five and get lots more details, I'm sure.In fact, I felt disappointed by this book. Throughout the book, Lopez, the primary author, neglects the impact of Korea on Buddhism, and the books seems to imply that in Korean religions; in shamanism, Buddhism and Korea's interpretation of Zhu Xi Neo-Confucianism there is nothing new to say, or original or different. The message of the book is that yet again, if you know China and Japan, you've got Korean covered. Perhaps just on an emotional level is makes me angry to no end when Korea is unreasonably ignored, and I felt like a scholar of Lopez's repute should never have done so. Furthermore, as I own his \\"Buddhism in Practice\\" and am waiting for the delivery of \\"Tibetan Religions\\", I sure hope that his other books exhibit more attention to typographical errors than this one. I find it extremely unprofessional and generally disappointing to find words where letters have been reversed or a letter is missing from the beginning of the word and so on.I found issue with the repeated use of the term \\"syncretic\\". Even now, as I check the dictionary definition of the word to see if I am understanding it correctly (Syncretic: Reconciliation or fusion of differing systems of belief, as in philosophy or religion, especially when success is partial or the result is heterogeneous.) I don't like what it says, I don't like the idea of \\"success is partial or the result is heterogeneous\\". This means that by calling a religion syncretic you are calling it something less than whole, complete, perfected. Whether you call Sikkhism or Sufism which I have no real emotional attachment to, or Tibetan Buddhism, which I do, syncretic I can't help but find this word coming from a western scholar to be at least slightly derogatory. Though I can certainly see the point in talking about syncretism in the period of foundation of a religion, once that religion can stand on its own, this term should be used only to refer to history. Interestingly on one internet website discussing \\"Religious Syncretism\\" they listed Caodai, Rastafari and Konkokyo as syncretic religions but the only mention of the ones given that appellation in the book was as religions that were syncretized into religions like Caodai (in the case of Buddhism, certainly). Perhaps I am mincing words here and should abandon this entire argument before I offend the entire history of scholarship in religious studies with my strange semantic bullheadedness. (Last gasp, my MS Word spell check thinks syncretic is a misspelling, but Sufism is not.)One of the things that I was interested in was the idea of the incarnate lamas of Tibet. To be straight here, of course I believe in incarnate lamas. I believe that the Dalai Lama has been around fourteen times. I believe in souls that have more knowledge of how to live than I myself do. I truly do believe that the entire concept of incarnate lamas is a natural outgrowth of the belief in reincarnation, that they must be the physical representation of the bodhisattvas that stay to help the rest of us attain a higher level of understanding and that it's stranger to wonder why other Buddhist traditions did not develop a concept of a succession of lamas in the way the Tibetans did. A non-believer may find the idea of incarnate lamas unbelievable, and pass it off with musings such as it being a form of succession or that Tibetan Buddhism is corrupt \`lamaism' but I don't feel that way myself. To me, it just seems natural.I have a particular interest in nationalism and national identity, perhaps because in Korean studies it has been such a widely discussed topic. Naturally I've looked at the issue from many different sides, and overall the aspect of national identity that is most interesting to me is the ways in which people actively seek to form national identity around specific images and stories. We've seen that in Korea with Dangun, and in the book they related a story about a specific politician creating a patriotic feeling around Ganesh. This may say much more about politicians and the pragmatic value in uniting people under one banner than it does the truth in the myths surrounding either Dangun or Ganesh (in this sense I am also taking Dangun as a religious leader, as he has been even sometimes is perceived in this way, but was resurrected from relative obscurity to show national origins independent of China (Ganesh showing Indianness separated from Britain). I suppose it's not worth going into much detail here, but I wished that the book has actually explored the theme of how religions in Asia are often used for political purposes, and as a political platform almost.Despite being in general unimpressed with this book, I enjoyed the section of this book that gave an overview of the religions of India. India-understanding the historical time period that gave birth to Buddhism-is important for any student of Buddhism. However, I still feel that my knowledge in this respect is somewhat spotty. This chapter of the book did a really great job explaining the intertwined religions of the Indian subcontinent so that at least their relationships to each other and their similarities became rather clearer than before I read the book.Though I could continue on and on, the last salient point I would like to make is that reading the book I was struck, yet again, with what an enlightening effect Buddhism had on East Asia. Buddhism spurred literacy, printing and amazing artistic and architectural endeavors. No matter the religion of the people in the region today, they must acknowledge the tremendous debt that their ancestors have to the intellectual awakening which Buddhism brought."},{"Title":"A Beka A Handbook for Reading The New Blue-Backed Speller","review":"My director has been disappointed that the Hooked on Phonics series isn't more exciting, but it looks like this would be more of same.

This book is not cumbersome, visually appealing, and easy to use.So far, I haven't seen anything this book lacks that a writer needs.

Other books I have say 1/3 of the way down. Of course not many people can translate that. Here, this manual was more clear -- 6 lines down.

As the author of an online grammar resource, I get hundreds of questions about writing every week, and I find myself reaching for GRM over and over again to help me define a grammatical point or resolve an issue of English usage. I find GRM very easy to use (unlike an earlier reviewer on this page); its index is enormous and you don't waste time being bounced from one cross-reference to another. The organization is admirably simple: the section on letter-writing, for example, begins with an extensive section on formatting, and then proceeds to the business of what you put on the envelope, how to use return addresses, etc., right down to the letter's closing. The book contains an abundance of examples, complete with acceptable ranges of formality (with a tip of the hat to what is still acceptable but somewhat too formal by today's tastes). All of this information is nicely, thoroughly indexed with references to paragraph numbers and pages where appropriate. GRM also contains up-to-date advice on altering templates in today's software packages (for stationery, etc.) to individual and corporate needs. William Sabin's even-handed style is ideal for this kind of text; he will state a grammatical rule concisely and then give just enough illustrations to make the rule stick in the mind. Where there is disagreement among other style books, Sabin provides for those differences and often suggests a commonsense resolution of disputes. But GRM is more than just a compilation of rules: Sabin gets into the nitty-gritty of writing, of style, and all users, at whatever level, will write with more economy and energy --whether they're writing a memo to the boss or an academic research paper -- if they keep GRM handy.

First, this is not just some handbook that secretaries can use to look up how to format a letter. It is an authoritative reference for all aspects of writing English. It should be next to the dictionary and thesaurus on the shelf of everyone who needs to write at work, from clerks to executives. Second, if your boss or anyone else argues with you about any rule of writing, you only have to point to the relevant entry in this book. All arguments stop there. Third, the size of the book is deceptive. It uses small font and thin paper. With normal font and paper, it would be the size of two or three large dictionaries. That's how much useful stuff is packed in this book.It takes a while to get used to how the information in the book is formatted, but it is well worth the effort. All entries in the index include page numbers as well as topic numbers, which they call &quot;rules.&quot; The book is logically structured around these rules, and it makes related topics easy to find.I rated this book 5 stars because I think it is superior in all categories for a reference book: comprehensive content, abundant examples, thorough index, authoritative author, and reasonable price."},{"Title":"The Gregg Reference Manual","review":"I've used this book for years, and I think it's terrific. Why? Four reasons: First, the information about grammar and usage is so mainstream, so consistent with the majority of other important references (The Chicago Manual of Style, for one). Second, it is accurate and reliable. Third, the outstanding index makes it wonderfully easy to use; you can look something up, in everyday terms, and readily find a reference. Fourth, the rules are short and the examples clear; once you've found the rule you need, you can read it, grasp it, and 30 seconds later be on your way.As a full-time trainer of writers and editors, I have used this book with everyone from grammar-challenged support staff to highly educated professional editors.

I have written three books, and in the final editing process I've gone through the Gregg Manual page by page, testing each rule on my manuscript, invariably finding numerous things needing correction or improvement. I have learned more about proper English from this book than from any other single source.One thing to keep in mind is that this reference manual focuses on business writing, not fiction. There are sections that don't apply to novel writers. Nevertheless, most of the information applies to all writing. This book is an easy recommendation to anyone serious about quality writing.
