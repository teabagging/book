The way Mr. David shows how savage humans must seem to wolves and the idea that animals must feel we are of a lower order seems funny and yet sadly true. It was suprising to learn that a certin film company passed on the rights to this story since as I read I easly this adapted to the bid screen.I have always loved Peter David's comics and sci-fi novels. His sense of humor and creativity have always made the most interesting stories. In fact when people ask me to list my favorite authors I always have Peter David high on the list. While I read his &quot;borrowed universe&quot; work in a matter of days &quot;Howling Mad&quot; makes me wish he would do more original work.It's a shame that so few people refuse to read Peter David's work simply because he writes comics and sci-fi spin-offs. There snobbary will cost them the chance to enjoy his stories.If the job of a story teller is to create a story you want to read to the end than Mr. David has succeded 100%"},{"Title":"Howling Mad","review":"Everyone knows what a werewolf is right? A man bitten by a werewolf becomes a wolf during the full moon each month. Classic, dependable, predictable and boring. So that happens to a man, but what if a wolf is bitten by a werewolf? Well he becomes a man three nights a month that's what happens!A completely different twist to the story with predictably hilarious results. HOWLING MAD delves into uncharted territory here with a short lighthearted tale of the poor wolf laden with the curse of becoming a man each months.Although not exceptionally well written, it could be tighter and the characters shortcuts in learning language and human customs are a little too contrived, it is funny and fun to read.A little light reading to wile away an hour or two. Don't expect too much and I think you will enjoy the ride.It's pretty average but I still RECOMMEND it."},{"Title":"Howling Mad","review":"I purchased this book partly because of the other reviews of this book posted on Amazon. I am glad to say that the great reviews are well deserved. I have been slowing trying to read all of Peter David's less recent books. Howling Mad, has been one of the most entertaining. Not only does David show great awarness of the classic Werewolf myth, but he also makes good choices in the modifications he makes on it. A wonderful blend of action and wit I am sure it will provide Peter David readers with a welcomed change, without straying far from the work we have come to expect from him. Even considering his following I still hope some new readers pick this one up and find out what all the fuss is about. A quick read worth the cost by far."},{"Title":"Howling Mad","review":"&quot;Howling Mad&quot; has a wonderful premise, but falls short of its potential....about a werewolf let loose in New York City who turns into a man once a month.

However, I have a problem with this paperback edition. In the back of the book is a diagram of a sailing ship with all the rigging described -- an important featrue, as the names of the various components of the rigging are constantly refered to in the text.But the diagram is blurred to the point that it is difficult to impossible to read the descriptions of the components.Amazon should not offer this publisher's product because of this defect."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"If you have harbor a fantasy of life aboard a pioneer vessel, read this book.

Yes, indeed it is...if you have the attention span of a gnat. I first read this book 15 years ago, back when I was 11 years old. Together with National Geographic Magazine, it prompted me to pursue a life of world travel and adventure--and service to my country. But I agree: If you need the flashing images of MTV, look for another book. Better yet, look for a comic book. On the other hand, if you want to read about a guy who actually got off his duff and put to sea for two years and experienced high and low adventures, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"Not even joking. Even now, six or eight months after reading this book I think back on it, sigh and gaze smiling off into the distance. This is a book you'll stay up too late to finish, and when you do shut the book and turn off the flashlight around 2 or 3 in the morning it'll be like saying goodbye to a dear friend you've just realized has been dead for 130 years. So much of the past is lost to us, so many good people drowned in oblivion. How fine it is that Dana's voice survives, how lucky I feel to have gotten to hear it in my head."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"This was the first realistic account of what it was like to be a sailor. The author does not spare the reader any of the details of the boat, using all of the terminology of the time. The parts when Dana describes the changes in the sails/rigging tend to lose me. The strongest parts are when Dana turns his observation on the territory of California."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"I've sailed most of my life so my view of what Dana relates is particularly poignant mostly for the fact that his observations are as relevant now as they were in his time and likely centuries before. He captures well the sense of unity and purpose that binds sailors on a ship at sea which is remarkable in view of the fact that they were mostly strangers to each other and made up of people from wildly divergent origins.Some reviewers have commented on the frustration of following the terminology of the bits and pieces used on the ships of those times. If it's any comfort I too couldn't follow exactly what they were doing at any one time as the wind and seas rose and fell but it really isn't necessary to know anything about sailhandling since whatever he's describing always boils down to either putting more sail up to maintain speed as the wind lightens or removing it to avoid breaking things as the wind increases. The rest of the time is taken up with staying busy taking care of the ships of those times which required constant attention. In any event the story Dana relates is not about ships at sea or wild coasts but really about the men who sailed these ships and the places they visited made relevant since they are places that most of us not only know of but have probably visited.Of Dana's acount of his two year journey the part that was most compelling to me dealt with the moment his thoughts turned to going home and how that feeling takes hold of one and drives them until home is in view whereupon inexplicable and conflicted feelings about being home arise with the realization that the adventure is at an end."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"My wife and I read this book aloud to one another as we traveled about the United States in our Chevy Van camper. Since we were on an adventure ourselves which I was recording for my future book \\"Hobo-ing America\\" we felt it to be a perfect fit - and it was.Being from the Boston area, I was very familiar with Lowell - the destination for the hides bought in California. There were shoe shops there in Lowell and Lawrence when I was growing up. I can still remember the smell of the leather being worked in those shops. We eventually traveled up the coast of California and could then visualize the seamen trudging along and up the cliffs lugging their hides.I have never forgotten reading this book. Mr. Dana being the son of a ship owner was very reserved in his criticisms. But that is exactly what gave his book its credibility and most likely lead to the improved conditions for the seamen.Since then I have read \\"Mutiny on the Bounty\\" and \\"Pages from a Workers Life\\" by William Z. Foster. Foster paints a much harsher picture of life before the mast and his book was written many generations later. So I guess all the accolades for the changes made for the seamen given to Mr. Dana were premature. Things didn't improve all that much or maybe they were reversed as time sailed by.In any case, I liked Mr. Dana's dignified style and his prose. It was a great adventure even with the abuse and hardships of the sailors minimalized.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:\\"Hobo-ing America: A Workingman's Tour of the U.S.A..\\""},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"Teachers miss a great opportunity to create good readers when they don't introduce young people to this book. Perfect for males age 12 to 99."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"I was very pleasantly surprised at how readable this book was, considering it is 165 years old. It is a remarkable first person account! Since I live in Los Angeles and am also familiar with Boston, I found the descriptions of these two locations to be particularly interesting. It's difficult to imagine how wild and undeveloped SoCal was so (relatively) recently. There is a lot of technical jargon related to old sailing vessels but glossing over these terms in comparative ignorance did nothing to significantly diminish my enjoyment. Recommended!"},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"Dana's chronicle is utterly remarkable for its force, its clarity and its authenticity. This is no hammed up memoir but a straightforward account of early nineteenth century sea and frontier life, couched in some of the best American writing ever."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"Why should you read this book? Yes, it is a classic. Yes, it documents the wonderful, adventurous time of the clipper ship. But that's not why you should read it.Richard Henry Dana must have been a most extraordinary man. While attending Harvard as a young man, his eyesight became weak and his health declined. He decided that the austere prescription of salt air and plain hard work would be the cure. Not many would give up comfort and privelege, but for two years, Dana served as a common sailor, given no special treatment as the gentleman he was, and lived in the forecastle of the Alert, eating the mess of salt beef and common hardtack, risking his life and serving under a captain crueler than most.Dana was able to write in such a way as to re-create the life on board a sailing ship, down to the smallest details and that's what makes this book so real and touching. You can feel the cold of Tierra del Fuego, taste the salt beef, and feel the wind and damp. What's more amazing is that Dana's carefully-kept journal was lost along with his other mementos of his voyage when he landed back on shore in Boston, due to some tragic carelessness of someone he entrusted with his chest of belongings. Yet he was able to recreate his voyage in loving detail and in some very excellent writing.Dana's later life as a lawyer was far from happy, though he made some critical contributions to maritime law. He died a poor and disappointed man, but left us the richer with his book. I just re-read it again for the tenth time, and it is fresher than ever. Read it along side of Moby Dick. It's American literature and American history and culture at its very best."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"This book is a great in many ways - as history, as narrative, as travelogue, as social documentary and as Adventure, but I feel that it's probably fair to caution the modern reader that it's written in a style that he or she may not be used to - not flowery, but not spare either. You do get the sense that you're not reading a modern work.Aside from its other merits, it's great background reading for fans of the Aubrey/Maturin series by Patrick O'Brian, even though it takes place about 20 years after their last published exploits.Faults? Well, for my taste, there was perhaps a little more sailor jargon than I could take in (the version of the book I read, not this edition, had no diagrams). When he was going into great detail on sails and ropes, I skimmed past some material, but not too much, and was able to pick up the sense of what he was writing about, without necessarily being able to determine the precise difference between two types of sails on the same mast (call me Maturin). Overall, you get the sense that he spent two years in almost unceasing toil, and that life as a sailor in those days was not one that anyone today would envy.Also, since this was a recount of an actual two year voyage, there was perhaps one or two too many recounts of cruises up and down the coast for those seeking &quot;adventure&quot; reading, but this is an actual historical account, and can't be faulted for some slow pacing - I have no doubt it WAS awfully tedious at times (which the book is not).However, it has SO many other merits that any patient reader will gain much from it, particularly an authentic, well documented perspective from another time.So, read the book, but don't think you'll knock it off in one night, or that it'll read like Tom Clancy, or even Mark Twain. Nevertheless, read it anyway, it's well worth it."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"I waited 58 years to read Two Years Before the Mast! It was always on my list of books to read, but I had never reached it until recently, when my interest was sparked by a comment made by David McCullough (the author of the great biography of Truman) that this book greatly influenced him when he read it as a very young man. It is a a beautifully written book --- prose as good as any I have ever read. Dana's accurate and detailed narrative of his own life at sea on sailing ships in the 1830's, and his time spent on the coast of California,when it was true wilderness, is an unforgettable reading experience. The book has a personal intimate quality about; it is as if the author is a friend writing to you from abroad about his extraordinary adventure. This book deserves its esteemed place in American and world literature."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"Just finished reading this book today and thought that it was really good. Myself, being from the San Francisco Bay Area, I was thrilled to hear Dana describe areas that I am well familiar with. The book was a history lesson for me of early California. My book, the Penguin Classic edition, had an extra chapter at the end written by Dana called &quot;Twenty-four Years After&quot;. In this chapter he returns to California 24 yrs later and writes about all the changes that have occurred since he was last there, a lot due to the fact of the gold rush. He also goes into some detail on the whereabouts of his former crewmates and the two ships that he sailed on while on his adventure. I have to say that this book probably would have more appeal to someone who is familiar with California as I am. I'm not sure if the book centered on Oregon lets say, that I would have enjoyed it as much as I did. I picked this book up at a second-hand store and am glad I decided to give it a try. I would suggest the same for anyone else that may have an interest in how it was to work and live on ships in the 1800's and early California before statehood."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"This book should have a much higher spot on the list of defining American works than it presently occupies.Why beat kids up with Moby Dick when this book exists? This book is a great read, but also ties in with many historical concepts.Always look for the version that includes Dana's essay on his return to California after the gold rush. The change is mind blowing.What is most remarkable about this book is that it has aged so little. Dana provides very modern humanistic views in this book, and most remarkably, after returning to Boston actually becomes an activist for sailor's rights."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"Let me start out by stating that Dana was a born story teller.The two years before the mast tells the story of Henry Dana's two years as a sailor during a journey from the America East Coast to the distant land of California via Cape Horn. Book portrays a fascinating insight into the life of a sailor during the years of sail upon a merchant ship - both the incredible hardships to be endured, the tangible moments of joy like rounding the cape and heading for home in a good wind with all sails set to the everyday relationships between crew and officers . Also it provides a truly interesting picture of California before the gold rush, a wild uninhabited place more Spanish than American, vast unspoilt stretches of coasts, with small settlements with familiar names such as San Francisco and San Diego.As an officer worker, I also founded Dana's portrayal of his Capitan to be a equally telling study of the failed middle manager you know the guy who is competent but not truly experienced, who is aware of his failure and is aware that his competence is questioned by others. An insecure man forced to take his insecurities out on his underlings. The more things change the one thing that remains the same is human nature.Also found myself sympathising with the sailors, far from home life. Men who at least while isolated are sailors first and American or French or English second.A great adventure tale and a picture of a world long gone."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"After finishing this book, I am amazed that this book is not more prominent in famous literature. Much of US and Sailing history can be learned through this true firsthand account of a Harvard student gone temporary salty dog. I am not from California or even the west coast but still found the stories contained throughout the book fascinating. Dana did an excellent job of describing the life at sea in the early 1800's without a moment of boring reading. I would recommend (and have been recommending) this book to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"Dana has a keen eye for detail and character, and tells his tale in a straightforward way that makes you feel that you are there with him experiencing what he does. I like to imagine what it was like to read this in 1840, when California was a distant and exotic land not much more accessible than the far side of the moon is to us.What seems almost inconceivable to us is the danger, discomfort and indignities the common sailors of the 1830s. They were often swept off the deck in high seas or fell from the rigging at night. Dana describes having to climb out on icy spars to struggle bare-handed with frozen ropes during a storm tossed winter crossing of Cape. And for that they were legally not much better than slaves who could be whipped at the masters whim.Of course there is Dana. While this autobiographical tale is not in the least self-serving, he unconsciously paints a picture of himself as an adventurous but sensitive young man, who, despite his education and class, which in most cases would have put him far over the master of the ship, never thinks himself above his mates or his duty."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"As a college student, Dana was probably uniqely qualified to write this book. Surely few of his fellow sailors were as articulate as he was. This book reads almost like two; a book about early California surrounded by a \\"life at sea\\" book. Both at sea and on land Dana found fascinating characters, places and events. His interest in them make the book a fun adventure to read.As a native San Diegan I also get the pleasure of walking in Dana's footsteps; through the house of Don Juan Bandini and the Mission Dana and his friend Stimson visited. Many of the landmarks Dana described are still here.Lastly, my father told about reading TYBtM as a young man and wanting to see San Diego. He came as an adult and the rest of his life was lived here so it's fair to say that his love of this book profoundly shaped my life. The only regret I have after reading this book is not getting to it sooner so we could have talked about it together."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"This book is utterly fascinating. It represents the first lengthy account of a sea voyage ever published by a sailor, and is thus a must have for all interested in maritime history.Two Years at the Mast was written and is narrated by Charles Henry Dana. He was a rather naive young man who at slightly past twenty years in age contracted a sickness, measles to be precise. During the mid nineteenth century this was quite serious, and he accordingly decided to go to sea for a period of some months in the hope that the weather would improve his health. Little did he know what he was in for. The work of a sailor was and is one of the most difficult, punishing and dangerous jobs in the history of mankind. The Captain of Dana's ship believed it was bad for discipline to have any man idle at any time of day save for a brief period on Sunday. As a result the crew was kept constantly at work, all day, every day.This book can be appreciated on two different levels. The first is for the fascinating historical insights it gives. It is the most complete and accurate account of the nineteenth century shipping industry ever written. As it is a first-hand narrative the events are presented far more vividly than even the best of historical writing can hope to match.The second factor to be taken into account is the literary quality of the book. Although it may seem rather dry at first glance incredibly compelling. It reads like a novel, and is far more rewarding in the amount of historical knowledge gained. It is a must-have for readers interested in history and for those who simply enjoy a good yarn."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"Dana's classic work is a must-read for any serious student of 19th century nautical history, and also for anyone interested in the early history of California. Dana, who after returning from his two-year voyage became a celebrated lawyer and politician, considered this work to be a boyish story. To historians, however, it stands as his most enduring work. I am now reading it for the third time, and it delights as it did during the first reading."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"I read this book after reading some poetry by Pablo Neruda, in which he sparked a renewed love for the sea and its mysteries within me. This story is about a boy reaching manhood and the battle that he fights within himself, and the battle without against man and the unrelenting power of nature. At points it is difficult reading if one is not familiar with ships of the 1830's and 1840's, but that is part of it. He too had to learn and adapt to his situation; he was entering into a world new and unknown. It is concurrent with London's stories of struggle because it is not crowded with the survival of the fittest motif but rather it paints this very struggle without the preaching. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and the full circle ending. He returns to the world he once conquered to find that it is no longer the same place that he left it and he is now on a different journey."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"Dana is a young Harvard man on two year sabbatical in his junior year, 1835. What to do? He signs on as a hand on a California bound trader. This is the stuff of a real Hollywood movie. Dana was like d'Tocqueville, but for the West. Read it and relive real life of the time."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"The book descriprion on this page is good and I enjoyed this edition of the book with the help of the glossary provided in this edition which contains definitions of sailing terms and and few archaic usages that are in this book. It made it much more enjoyable and understandable.I liked the grueling portarit of life at sea, reading some first written observations of early California, a fine and admiring description of a very able-bodied seaman that Dana encountered and many other points.I think to that this challenging adventure for Mr. Dana restulted in restored vision for his failing eyes after he removed himself from life perhaps largely behind a desk. Could the neccessity of challenge and needed to see have contributed?There are many facets and admirable points in this book. I think you would enjoy it."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"This book is dry, but then life on a boat is probably not all that exciting. You do have time to watch paint dry, and wood rot, and canvas sag while waiting for a breeze. What I liked about this book was the description of California before it became \\"civilized\\".If you are looking for close calls with pirates, and lots of rambo action, look elsewhere. If you like history books that tell it like it was, then this is for you. Moby Dick is a good litnus test, if you liked Moby Dick, you'll like this, if not skip on to something else."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"I was going to read Walden by HD Thoreau, when I read a critical review of it, which said that RH Dana was closer to nature by far. I saw this book (yes this version too) and decided to pick it up. For less than $10, this book is a steal. I can see why it's a classic, and it is very close to nature. I'll never look at water or the wind quite the same way. Nor will I look at work and life quite the same way. Those sailors then definetely had it rougher than a lot of us could ever imagine. Dana does amazing in painting a clear picture of the people and the life. I was depressed and sleeping until noon every day before I read this, now I have found some peace in life again and get up at 6 am every morning. There is more to this book than the reader of it might even realize, it could possibly even save depressed lives. Being a 6th generation Californian, it was nice to know the history of my area as well. In 1835 when Dana visited, this state probably had less than 1,000 people or so, amazing. I agree with the other reviewers who said the nautical lingo is not necessary to be familiar with to appreciate and understand this eternal classic."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"It took me quite a while to read this book; I wouldn't call it a page turner. But I'm quite sure I will remember it as vividly as almost any book I've ever read. It is a very detailed, true description of an exceptional, very-well-educated young man's two year stint on a trading ship which sailed from Boston around Cape Horn to a very primitive, pre-Gold-Rush, California and back. There isn't a whole lot of suspense because we know, since it's a true story, that the author makes it back. And there isn't a great deal of concern about his shipmates and the other people he meets in his amazing travels, because their characters are never consistently developed. Rather, Dana may spend a page on a specific person and then never refer much to that person again. But I believe that this is the way Dana intended it -- as a story of the sea, and merchant seamen as a class of people, and the incredible dangers and hardships they face on a daily basis. In that regard, the main character of the story becomes this universal seaman, sometimes Dana, sometimes an unnamed or named crew member (but often named just as Mr. S______ or the like), sometimes spoken of as a composite (\\"Jack\\"). This gives the tale a transcendent, universal feel and makes it all the more powerful -- rather than the typical bad-guy, good-guy approach. The details of how the ship and crew function and the operation of the sails, etc. are explained in great and loving detail in nautical/technical terms that were, in the beginning, often incomprehensible and boring to me -- but for which I gained a taste for reading as the story progressed, even if I still didn't know quite what was actually happening or what exactly he was describing. Especially memorable was his ship's return trip around unpredictable, fierce Cape Horn with an exhausted, ailing, too-small crew. The afterword that was written 24 years later when Dana returned to a post-Gold-Rush California and reviews the places where he had his adventure as a young man, including reacquaintance with some of the characters of the main story, was one of the best parts of the book; quite poignant. If you want to experience a completely different way of life in a very different time, this may be the book for you..."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"I am rereading this book for the third time and now realise why - it is a great way to escape today's world and relive a time which will never be repeated when plains mountains and valleys were mysterious places full of adventure because they were totally unknown uncharted and uninhabited. The wold has changed to the extent that we seldom enjoy our natural environment and are locked into the digital revolution with all its quick fixes.

My husbnd has reread several interesting passages."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"Bought this book as required reading about ten years ago without a lot of interest in either the US in the 1830s or life on a sailing ship. Rediscovered it on the shelf recently and was simply delighted by reading it.If you are a sailor, you will be fascinated by Dana's minute descriptions of the practical sailing; if you are not, these descriptions might tempt you to learn it.Dana wrote in the 1840s, i.e. he is refreshingly politically in-correct without being racist. He draws masterful portraits of his fellow sailors and a lot of people he met in his more than two years before the mast. His descriptions of Mexican California in the 1830s are lively and colorful, and while reading you will learn alot about the social and economic conditions in the US, in Mexico and on the high seas at that time."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"This is an American classic. In its day was one of the most widely read, and important, books ever published. It recounts a young Harvard mans decision to take time off school and \\"cut his teeth\\" aboard a merchant sailing vessel on a 2-year tour to California between 1834-1836. He lived \\"before the mast\\", meaning his quarters were up forward with the lowly grunts, where he had no special privileges, the captains and mates quarters behind the mast. Dana set out to live just like a line sailor, but also secretly document the poor conditions sailors lived under - he would go on to become a famous Boston lawyer who fought for sailors rights.What makes the book so important is that Danas book is the first to describe California, very few Americans had ever been to California. He went from port to port and details a lot about specific places like San Diego, San Francisco, Monterey, etc.. in the 1830s these \\"ports\\", at the largest, were settlements of a few hundred Mexicans and Indians and utter wilderness around. San Francisco had one American, and one building. When gold was found the 49ers went west and Danas book was the bible for what California was like. When Dana returned to San Francisco in 1856, it was a city of over 100,000 and he was famous, just about everyone in the city had read it. The descriptions of places just before the mass migrations began, while it was still wilderness, are fascinating. The last chapter fast forwards 24 years later as a postscript when Dana returns to California and describes his own astonishment at the modern changes, and recounts what happened to all the people he knew along the way."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"I sailed the seven seas in the 60s, after joining the merchant navy at the tender age of 15 years and 6 months, twenty five years later and many books later this book lives and breaths the life on board a merchant ship of the day, I loved it , I lived the life on board the pilgrim as I read the book . one book you should read before you die."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"I delayed reading this book for many years due mainly to my lack of interest in sailing. To prepare for the read, I extracted and defined the sailing and rigging terms in order to become familiar with events as they unfolded. This is a story about a young college drop out whom, with no sailing experience, decided to forgo college in order to work as a crewman onboard a ship bound to California, Mexico from Boston in 1834.As they sailed from Boston around Cape Horn, his detailed descriptions of disparate crew members, a hostile captain and the experiences of violent weather patterns, throughout the voyage, made for an eventful journey. The theme of the book focused on teamwork, courage, and coordination as each hour created new challenges from Mother Nature.What made this book so interesting to read over the years? It provided insight into seamanship and the knowledge required to forecast weather conditions; it showcased the desires of one man's quest to serve as a seafarer; it highlighted the emotional temperament of the crew as discussions of mutiny surfaced and, it revealed the authority of the ship's captain on the open seas.This is a wonderful book. I learned a great deal about sailing and the adventures of seamanship. I highly recommend it to others."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"Richard Henry Dana catured the spirit of humans and the majesty of the sea. The rounding of icy waters off South America to watching swimming dolphins was a descriptive marvel to us who have seen it all on PBS. Mr. Dana's observations of the South Sea natives hired in their special boats to 'surf' cargo ashore in the waves of mid-California foretold of a phenomenon that was utterly impossible to predict. From going to the (then) vapid student halls of Harvard Univ. to swaying 100 ft over the raging waves of the ocean, this book might be good as required reading for those students entertaining a different course in life."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"This book might be the standard by which I measure all non-fiction narratives. The gist is that Dana, an Oxford educated twenty-year old whose sight is failing, is recommended by the doctor to get away from his studies for a while. He spends the next two years as a regular waterdog aboard a merchant ship off the coast of California. Based in the 1830's, the picture Dana creates of the life on the Western shore is both exotic, romantic, and yet realistically full of true sailor drudgery. Not every moment is as gripping as when the mad captain unleashed his wrath on an unfortunate mate, but to see an accurate, elegant description of that period, especially having been to most of the locations mentioned, was captivating. The motif itself is memorable, but I'll leave that to the reader."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"This book has two distinct appeals--it is a compelling account of \\"the sailor's life\\" in 19th Century America as well as a historical account of 19th Century California. At the same time, this book is a classic and a thoroughly interesting narrative--one that influenced Herman Melville. It is also amazing to read the accounts of California before it was settled and became a state. It's pretty ironic that although the California coast is considered today to be one of the most beautiful parts of the country, the author and his crew thought of California as a wholly undesirable place. For those with an interest in the days of sail and/or the early history of California, you can't go wrong with this book."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"1. \\"The first half of the book was great\\" makes the book worth three stars, not one. \\"If for whatever reason, you wish to find out exactly how a sailor lived, then go ahead, its a great book.\\" makes it a 4 star book.2. The second half is even better than the first. It's the ONLY account of Mexican California by an American, but the descriptions couldn't be better written or more interesting, and not just because I'm a \\"Californico\\" (Spanish for resident of old California). I'm also a history and geography buff. History and geography doesn't get better than this, with wonderful action and extraordinary description of the locations and people in Mexican California.

He defended seamen in court pro bono for his entire long career, and was instrumental in getting the first laws passed giving merchant seamen legal rights and protections.\\"Two Years\\" is must reading for anybody who loves a good story, true adventure, good narrative writing, or who loves California and America and wants to know more about who we are and how we got this way."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"This is a good read for anyone who loves adventure and a great read for anyone interested in Californian history. More to the point, this book was *THE* book on California for Americans living between 1840 and 1860. Dana's insights into the culture, customs, and early history of California are fantastic, as are his predictions (one of which is that California would one day become an economic powerhouse).This book was listed by National Geographic as one of the 100 best adventure books written. The adventure portions are definitely interesting (clinging to life ropes 100 feet above deck during a blizzard at Cape Horn is hard to beat for a real-life experience), but the nautical jargon is a bit pedantic at times. It is the small pauses between the sailing that hold the most interest, at least to this reader. And the final, bittersweet return to California in 1859 holds perhaps the most interesting passages. It is here we see Dana come to grips with a common theme - the reconciliation of nostalgia with progress. (And what a quick progress it is - from a single shanty in 1835 to 100,000 citizens in San Fransisco in 1859!)My personal favorite passage is a comment that is probably as true today as it was in his time - the difficulty in understanding a life other than your own if you fail to adventure once in a while. \\"His is one of those cases which are more numerous than those suppose who have never lived anywhere but in their own homes and never walked but in one line from their cradles to their graves.\\""},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"I had heard about this book quite a bit from my book club. It is one of their favorites and they refer to it frequently in talking about other books. Being a Californian as well, I knew about Data Point and wanted to read something about early Californian from the view of an American, and pre Gold Rush. This did not disappoint! He has a very engaging style, colorful, and knows how to tell a great story. I was caught up in the drama of being on a ship. He has a great vantage as a new person to sailing, and being so literate. Th descriptions are great, and the social interactions on the ship are also good. I am reading the version that he didnt' rewrite as an older man. As compared to other stoires, such as the Bounty and Horatio Hornblower, this is a powerfully good book and I heartily recommend it.

Maybe I started the book with the wrong mindset. Maybe I didn't pay as much attention to the book as I should have, but I honestly don't see much in this book worth reading. In real life, I'm sure Dana's life at sea was somewhat exciting, but I found very little excitement in this book. It didn't help that I knew almost nothing about sailing- for example, the names of the different ropes and masts. Dana spent so much time describing the process of preparing a ship and working the ropes. I still don't know what to \\"well\\" a rope means after reading the book. I also didn't realize that the main character was the author until half way through the book, since there was hardly any dialogue, and they never said his name. That's probably the thing that did it for me the most. There are pages on end with NO dialogue, and, to me at least, dialogue usually keeps a book more interesting. I did, however, learn more about life at sea and in California in the 1800s. The parts where he is in California tanning hides were somewhat interesting.I had to read Two Years Before the Mast for school. If this is also your fate, I sympathize. However, if you MUST read it, let it be known that you CAN do it. It's not impossible, as much as it may seem at times. If you are considering reading this for fun, go ahead and try, but don't feel bad if you don't finish it. I and others like me understand.

I expected the original version with decent adult illustrations, not an abridged copy for 7 year olds. I returned it."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"In 1835, an ailing New Englander named Richard Henry Dana thought he might improve his health by taking a break from Harvard law school to voyage to California as a common sailor. In those days before the Panama Canal, that meant sailing 14,000 miles around the tip of South America at Cape Horn, and ending up in a foreign country, since Mexico still owned California then. When Dana came back, he wrote a book about his experiences, called Two Years Before the Mast. When the huge crowd of gold seekers rolled West in 1849, it happened that Two Years Before the Mast was just about the only available book in English that described California, and it owes its status as an American classic to the resulting wave of sales. Certainly it wasn't the writing.As a rule, I enjoy the classic literature of the Age of Sail: Stevenson's Treasure Island, Sabatini's The Sea Hawk and Captain Blood, and Forester's Horatio Hornblower series are favorites of mine. I've even dabbled in writing stories and a novel about pirates. And yet, although I should be an ideal target audience for the book, I didn't like it. A more typical reader would be even less likely to enjoy it.Dana's essential problem is plain poor style. His book overflows with run-on sentences and dangling modifiers. He has a poor sense of consistency; for example, he opens the book by saying that he had determined to save his eyes by abstaining completely from reading, yet later on he is reading voraciously, and we are left wondering at what point he abandoned his no-reading plan.Dana's use of nautical language is so cursory that I was able to learn very little new about shipboard life - and I actually know what yards, jibs, topgallants, mizzenmasts, studdingsails, backstays and fore braces are. To the uninitiated, large portions of Dana's book will simply be gobbledygook.Bernard Mayse's reading doesn't help matters. His tired, raspy voiceg is completely inappropriate for the narrative of a very young man, and only in a few scenes does he manage to convey any emotion. He is also defeated by the pronunciation of both nautical and Spanish words: he can't say \\"keelson\\" or \\"studdingsail\\" correctly, and mispronounces the Spanish \\"gente\\" as \\"jenn-tay.\\"There are some moments when the drama of the subject matter is so palpable that Dana can't help but create a memorable scene. Certainly the terrible moment when Captain Thompson flogs a sailor is unforgettable; the effect on the captain is in some ways scarier than the effect on the victim. Likewise, you can't help but share Dana's shock and alarm when he is abruptly informed that he must find a substitute worker or be abandoned on the California coast.If you want to, or have to, read this book, I suggest a hardcopy with good annotations, rather than this inferior recording. Even then, it will probably take a saltier sea dog than myself to enjoy it."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"This was a POD book that was full of asci characters, it was not formatted, not even chapter page breaks.

He has painted a remarkably true picture of that coast still recognizable. Jackson was president when Dana sailed in 1833. It was also the age of the Mountain Men some of whom were seen in CA while Dana was there. In San Diego Dana met professor Nuttal who taught at Cambridge and was known to Dana. Nuttal crossed the continent the hard way, as a naturalist, then made his way to CA, and eventually returned on the same ship with Dana to Boston. Both Dana and Nuttal, and their respective pursuits, were precursors to Manifest Destiny. Their trips also were descriptive of the times. Two years after his leaving Boston, Dana returned as an accepted 'foc'sle' sailor, a man cured of whatever ailed him when he left home. His exploits are remarkable for their daring. He never shirked his duty as a shipmate. His is a remarkable tale which could only have been told by one of his character. If read in conjunction with the landed history of the time, 'Across the Wide Missouri,' by DeVoto, it becomes a historical masterpiece significant for its truth, sadness, and moments of supreme beauty of expression."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"Sailing out of Boston to reach the California coast in 1834 proved a daunting proposition even for seasoned sailors, but young Richard Henry Dana felt up to the challenge and signed on the PILGRIM all the same. Not because he was passionate for life on the sea, but as a result of his doctor?s orders. Prolonged study at Harvard has damaged his eyes, so the brave young men undertook a two-year odyssey which included two trips around deadly Cape Horn. One of the first lessons he learned was that a sailor?s work is Never done. Now a captain?s authority is a absolute on shipboard, but few of this captain?s decisions and actions were perceived as just or humane.This readable edition provides an excellent introduction for elementary students to the glories of American classics; this version offers generous amounts of dialogue with little of the introspection of the original. The onboard action moves along at clipper-ship pace. Dana even enjoys a cross-cultural experience as he learns to speak Spanish and observes the customs of the natives of Alta California under Mexican rule.Enhanced by excellent brown and white illustrations of Dennis Dierks, this book will interest young readers, who will barely be aware that they are learning about the difficult cow hide trade in the declining days of the California missions. Dana realized the importance of trust between the officers and crew on a ship, as well as the camaraderie between ships on two mighty oceans. Surviving both natural and human disasters Dana returns home able to recall in vivid detail the events of his transformation from a Green Hand into a true Salt!"},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"As a sailor myself I found it amazing that the on-board jargon and terminology is the same today as it was back in Dana's day. This account gives a very real feel for what it is like to be on board any large sailing ship, the sheer physical grind, how you compete with your mates to climb the rigging just to break the boredom, the unreasonable delight with getting a stodgy suet pudding and molasses which you would turn your nose up to on land. The other half of this book is the historical perspective on california when San Francisco was a station and when all of the West was Spanish. It is a unique account of California before the arrival of the railroad. It is pure serendipity that a man of Dana's education served as an ordinary seaman and was able to pen this unique account of life at sea. A must for all students of sail trading and for a view of early california."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"Richard Henry Dana suffered from measles while a student at Harvard in 1834. Rather than suffer a slow recovery from weakened eyesight, he shipped out as a common sailor, rather than as a passenger, on a long sea voyage. After becoming a lawyer, he published his recollection of his voyage in 1840; it was an immediate success. He became an active member of the Free Soil Party, and represented fugitive slaves. This first and greatest book shows his sympathy for the suffering and the oppressed, and his courage, unselfishness, and fair-mindedness that characterized his life. This important book describes California before statehood and the gold rush, and life in those times. RHD hoped this book would promote religion and moral improvement for seamen, and diminish their hardships.Chapter IV tells of being chased by a black hulled ship that flew no colors. They were able to outrun this ship, then lost it in the dark. Chapter V tells of the bad weather while rounding Cape Horn. They passed a whaler from Poughkeepsie NY. Chapter XIII gives his impressions of the Californians. RHD knew that local officials were appointed from the capital, but didn't ask if they controlled the local economy as a colony: produce raw material, buy finished goods. Chapter XVII tells how their captain, known for his flogging, could not hire any new seamen. Chapter XVIII tells of Easter celebration in California. The crews of Catholic vessels get about three more weeks of vacation in a year, and \\"Yankees don't keep Christmas\\". Chapter XXI tells more about California politics. Since the independence of Mexico the missions and their lands became the prey of administradores, and became diminished and decayed. RHD describes the lack of common law, and the private morality. It was a rich country waiting to be exploited.Chapter XXIII tells of the advantages of a bigger ship over a smaller ship: more hands make lighter work. But a smaller lighter ship can catch a slight breeze that becalms a bigger ship. Chapter XXV tells how the heavy import taxes of Mexico are handled. A vessel puts in to declare a moderate cargo, then sells a large part. It then sails to another port; but on the way it gets other goods to replenish its cargo. RHD describes his visit to a whaleship, whose crew resembled fishermen and farmers. [Whalers got a share of the profits, not a wage.] The chapter ends with a description of a 3-day gale. Chapter XXIX tells of preparations to sail home: ballast is dumped, the ship sealed and fumigated to kill vermin. Then the hides are loaded, then steeved to pack in more. This hard work was fueled by a constant diet of fresh beef. Chapter XXX tells of the return trip by a shorthanded and inexperienced crew; they would round Cape Horn in the dead of winter, the worst possible time. Chapter XXXI tells of the sailor's need for rum or hot coffee in wintertime; and what it is like to have a tooth-ache at sea. Chapter XXXII describes the terrible times in the iceberg fields. Chapter XXXV tells of the haste to get home by keeping sails aloft. Scurvy had broken out on the ship due to no fresh provisions. They met a brig and got potatoes and onions for a cure.The Concluding Chapter tells that drudgery and hardship is a sailor's life, not romantic fantasies. The captain must control everything, and be responsible for everything (mistreatment of seamen). Passengers on board (independent witnesses) result in better treatment of seamen. The lives of merchant seamen are shortened by a lack of sleep. RHD would not abolish flogging: most seamen are foreigners, the cast-offs of war vessels, and unknown to the captains. Force is needed to control them. Gradual improvement will correct this, he claims. RHD strongly objects to the practice of granting leniency to a convicted captain or officer because of previous good character, or a family to support. First, they don't know what it was like there, and this excuse is never granted to seamen! It is just a reward for class differences. Moral improvement is the seamen's best friend. RHD visited California 24 years later and writes about this in the last chapter."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"The truth about life as a common sailor in the merchant marine in the early 1800's.

He tells a good story."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"I'm working in a lab this summer. I've had all manner of jobs, but this is the first where I do nothing but think, and I feel ambivalent about it. When I go on lunch breaks, I bring TWO YEARS BEFORE THE MAST.I've never found a non-fiction book quite like it before, though I own many in this genre. You may find other sea stories with more excitment (the O'Brien series is excellent), more daring (Joshua Slocum's account SAILING ALONE AROUND THE WORLD is a classic), or a more contemporary feeling (Robin Lee Grahm's DOVE has an optimistic 60's sensibility), but you will NOT find the sheer thoughtfulness that makes this book so much worth reading.Dana is a remarkable observer. He is farsighted, identifying San Francisco as the likely center of California's future prosperity, yet he is clearly affected by many of the prejudices of his era. He is always honest about his thoughts and feelings and he never lets his education or his background spoil his intercourse with the fascinating and often raw characters that he meets. Still, Dana wavers in his original objective. Though he intends to lay bare the iniquities of sea life to the landlubber, he ends up seducing his readers with the sheer adventure of his life.This book will take you away (in the best of &quot;Reading Rainbow&quot; fashion) whenever you read it. For that extra touch of authenticity, bring it along on a cruise, or better yet, read it in a hammock."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"First, Richard Henry Dana was the sole author of Two Years Before the Mast. There are currently a half dozen books in print in which co-authors attempt to share credit for Dana's work. Dana dropped out of Harvard and signed up for a two year voyage as a common deckhand. This class of sailor sleeps in a communal room forward of the main mast called the forecastle, or \\"focsle,\\" thus the \\"...before the mast\\" in the title. Showing the attention to detail which would eventually get him through Harvard and make him a Boston attorney, he kept excruciatingly detailed notes, which he appears to have resisted editing.At first the reader wonders why Dana wants us to know what ropes are used to hoist, trim, tack, reef, and lower each sail. Moreover why we need to know how to do it in fair weather and in foul. And at night as well as day. We wonder why he wants us to know the monotony of the stale food and the pauper's lifestyle the sailor lives.We start to get an inkling of the purpose if the realism when Dana describes the brutal and dictatorial regime under which the sailor is governed. The editorialism which creeps gradually into the book shows the brutality with which the sailor is treated. By the end, Dana has evolved into a persuasive advocate for reform. He is not a radical by any means; sailors who act more or less as animals must be handled more or less as animals. Dana's prescriptions are relatively modest, incremental, and thoroughly considered.We are left with one man's version of Junior Year Abroad, and it shames the frivolity of the contemporary academic traveler. There may be easier ways of learning the handling of square-rigged ships, and there may be more adventurous sabbaticals, but none come with prose approaching photographic realism. And it is Dana's alone, and \\"co-authors\\" should be ashamed."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"This book is a great tale of both adventure and daily life both on land and sea, if you can make it through the sections full of nautical lingo. For example: \\"We were going along with studding-sails set on both sides, when, as we came round the point, we had to haul our wind, and took in the lee studding-sails. As the brig came more upon the wind, she felt it more, and we doused the sky-sails, but kept the weather studding-sails on her, bracing the yards forward so that the swinging-boom nearly touched the sprit-sail yard.\\" (page 75).The book has many pages full of such very detailed description, which I eventually just skimmed, or skipped, with no loss of enjoyment of the rest of the narrative. If the reader can find their own way to navigate the sailing terminology, the rest of the book is fascinating. The author describes daily life on a sailing ship in that age as a mixture of wonderful and horrible experiences. Likewise, he describes, in fascinating detail, what life was like in coastal villages like San Diego and San Francisco when they were just hamlets with a few houses and a church.Reading this book will give you appreciation for what early settlers and mariners had to endure, and will probably make you appreciate little things like toilets, clean water, dry and warm clothing, and decent food a whole lot more that before you read it. The adventure of \\"doubling\\" the Cape Horn crossing is, simply, incredable and it is worth reading the book for this alone."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"Another classic called so with reason. Surprisingly, Dana was a lawyer; the surprise is because his prose is as clear and simple as can be. Every word is in place, nothing rings false or more complex than it need, as he tells the story of something over two years he spent, after Harvard, on a hide ship going from Boston to California and back. The majority of the time was spent up and down the coast of California, gathering some forty thousand hides ~ cattle, as i understand it ~ for the leather trade back in New England. As Dana tells this part of his tale one begins to feel the boredom he felt, the drag of doing the same thing, day after day after day; but also, the excitement of a liberty day, the pleasure of the break in routine when the hides are processed and the ship has not returned with more. The more exciting parrt of the story is, naturally, the descriptions of sailing, around the Horn, through storms, furling, reefing, climbing riggings, standing on yardarms, and all the duties a sail sailor had. In this day of fuel oil, steam, and nuclear power it would be nice to see a publisher re-issue this book with a diagram of a fully rigged sailing ship and a glossary that explains the difference between a reef and a double reef, and just what an hermaphrodite brig is. There are those who still know, but they are specialists nowadays; that information used to be as common knowledge as the difference between a bus and a truck is now. Still, a wonderful experience is hidden between the covers of this book."},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea","review":"FOR HISTORY AND EARLY LIFE SAILOR LOVERS THIS IS A MUST.

I wasn't going to pick it up ~~ but when I started reading the first paragraph, I couldn't put it down. Weldon's writing is gripping, brutally honest and so true ~~ and it hit home so close to the dark secrets in your heart.I wasn't in an abusive relationship/marriage for very long but reading this book helps reaffirm my decision to leave my husband ~~ she writes of how bad things were before she finally decided to leave. I left before it got worse and before there were innocent children involved. And after reading this book, I am glad that I left as soon as I did.It is encouraging to read about one woman's trials, fears as it helped me realize that I am not the only one. I too came from a loving stable family ~~ my relationship with my dad mirrors Weldon's. We both love our fathers deeply and they are good men. We both searched for men like our fathers and in the process, got hurt. Weldon's reasons for staying in the marriage mirrors mine. We didn't stay because of low self-esteem, but because we believed in our husbands and encouraged them to be the men we thought we knew they could be. We stayed till there were no reasons left to stay. We can still say to this day that we did everything we could to make our marriages work. We are not failures even though we may feel like that.As for me, seeing the struggles she had with her three sons hit home. I wanted to have children, but something deep inside me told me to wait. I am so glad that I listened to this inner voice because I cannot imagine how much harder it would be for me to leave if I had children with my husband. Reading about Weldon's struggles reaffirmed my decisions to wait. I find myself saying about her husband ~~ what a jerk!If you or anyone you know is in an abusive relationship, I urge you to pick up this book. Though in the midsts of struggles, where you feel the deepest and darkest despairs and fears, there is a glimmer of hope that life will get better. It does ~~ even if it means changing your whole life to escape from the batterer. But once you're outside and &quot;free&quot; you will begin to heal though the scars will always be there. Picking up this book is such a uplifter for me ~~ knowing that I am not the only one who struggled with domestic violence. I also know that I am not alone in my fears and despair. I, who is a professional worker and from a good family, am not the failure. He is. He can change himself but I can't. When I left him, I did feel a sense of relief. There's no more worrying and fears of what he might do next. It's a hard long road leaving someone you love, but when one comes to the realization that he will never change, there's a freedom in knowing that you still have your life left. And thanks to Weldon, I now know that I am not alone in this struggle."},{"Title":"I Closed My Eyes: Revelations of a Battered Woman","review":"Michele Weldon does an amazing job of grabbing the reader with her story. It takes an incredible amount of courage to tell the world that your picture perfect life and marriage was a charade -- that you were abused for years by a man who appeared to be &quot;the loving husband.&quot; What really touched me most was the ability I felt to relate to the author, as the life she describes is not too far from my own real-life experience.Warning for those of you are presently in an abusive relationship or recently leaving one -- this is so well-written and hits so close to home that it may trigger flashbacks. Nevertheless, it is a must-read for not just victims of domestic violence, but for all women."},{"Title":"I Closed My Eyes: Revelations of a Battered Woman","review":"Overall, this book is very well written, and it is an important book in terms of understanding domestic violence because it is true. I read this right after reading Black &amp; Blue by Anna Quindlen, and I have to say that this was much better -- the writing was more vibrant and, although I don't know what it's like to be in an abusive relationship, it seemed more real -- her fear was so much more real than Frannie's fear in Black &amp; Blue -- Frannie who moved away and seemed to forget so quickly about the intense fear she had felt for so long. Michele's account is so honest and compelling, so much so that you feel you're there with her painting the walls and going to Sarah's Inn, realizing that the fear doesn't just go away and that it takes an awful lot of work to feel comfortable in yourself again.Toward the end of the book her writing focused more on what she was thinking than what was happening, and at times I wanted to know more about what was happening -- on the one hand, I applaud Michele for moving on and discussing what was going on in her mind and life -- but on the other hand, and I hate to admit this, I wanted to know more about the ex and what was going on with him. I continually felt shock and anger after hearing about his abusive acts, and in a way I wanted to hold onto that anger a little bit more, although I think that overall, it probably was better for this book to end on the more positive note.I loved the way each chapter started with a letter from him. The only thing that frustrated me, though, was that the letters seemed like such a huge red flag -- I thought the guy sounded pretty screwey right from the start, when he seemed to want to cut her off from her family and have her all to himself -- his words in the letters seemed so calculated -- like he read a book about how to cast a spell over women and make them powerless to resist his manly charms, and he wrote these letters with that in mind. I think the letters are there to show a contrast between these supposedly beautiful things he said and how horribly he acted, but I really think that the letters are just creepy. I can understand, though, how easy it is to get caught up in a new relationship with a slick, attractive man, and how easy it is to brush aside any concerns that maybe he's not as wonderful as he seems at first glance.Concerns aside, this is a wonderful book. I read it over the course of one evening and the next day -- I read all day, hardly stopping at all, because I got so sucked into this book I really couldn't put it down. And when I finally did, I wasn't depressed -- I felt good."},{"Title":"I Closed My Eyes: Revelations of a Battered Woman","review":"When I saw the title of this book in the library, I immediately put it back as I did not want to read about myself. But the title echoed home and it called out to me. Once starting this book, I could not put it down and finished it in the wee hours of the morning. I then cried.This is an EXCELLENT book for all women, but especially for those of you who have been abused or are being abused and DO NOT want to look at reality in the eye. If your eyes are closed, like mine were, this book will compassionately and lovinging open them up and empower you. It took me so long to get out of an abusive situation with 3 children, and like Michele's the abuse still continues, even though the divorce is final. Michele portrays in her story that abuse knows no &quot;class&quot; boundaries - it strikes everyone. Yet, why do we wait so long to remove ourselves from these situations? I guess it is an individual answer.I felt many of the emotions and pain and situations that Michele felt and could just relate so very much to her situation.I cannot thank her enough for being brave and bold enough to share her story with women. This is a MUST read for all people involved with helping women in domestic violence situations.This book will OPEN your eyes if they are shut and I encourage you to read this book for your sake or for those of you who know women who are being abused and for some reason cannot or are unable to leave.This book will DEFINITELY help you heal and/or start you on the path of healing.Thank you Michele - I applaud and commend you."},{"Title":"I Closed My Eyes: Revelations of a Battered Woman","review":"This personal account of an abusive marital relationship and the healing, transforming journeying out of it is beautifully written and deeply moving. It is all at once heart-wrenching, inspiring, and empowering, and it offers a message of courage, hope, faith, and love. Michele Weldon effectively puts to rest the many fallacies surrounding domestic violence in our culture, and her story illustrates the fact that willingness/ability to respond to domestic violence and abuse continues to be a major challenge for the church in 2000. I CLOSED MY EYES is an invaluable resource for a variety of contexts today, e.g., in seminary pastoral care &amp; counseling courses, clinical social work degree programs. It should be on the bookshelves of our churches and synagogues, domestic abuse shelters, and public libraries. It would be an enormously good read for medical students and interns in our teaching hospitals across the country who, sadly, get little education and training regarding the complex family and societal issues surrounding domestic violence and abuse. All who minister to or care for people caught in the cycle of domestic violence and abuse will learn from this book."},{"Title":"I Closed My Eyes: Revelations of a Battered Woman","review":"Ms. Weldon wrote a column for a number of years. I remember thinking how this woman had it all: a loving husband, three adorable boys and a neat career.Life is stranger than fiction. I applaud the courage it took for Michele to finally say enough is enough.I have never been abused - but it doesn't stop me from feeling the anger that's directed at us women. I hope fervently, that God willing, Michele meets someone who will cherish her and her boys. Then it would be a storybook ending.Thank you Michele for sharing your life and your courage to stop it. I pity your ex."},{"Title":"I Closed My Eyes: Revelations of a Battered Woman","review":"This book needs to be on the shelves of every battered women's program in America. Weldon has done what other authors have tried to do, and has done it better. This book touches the reader, and hurts where it touches, but not without a clear message of hope and deliverance. This book is a gift to all battered women everywhere. Read it."},{"Title":"I Closed My Eyes: Revelations of a Battered Woman","review":"Michele Weldon does a magnificent job describing her harrowing journey through domestic violence, and she does so with clarity and unflinching honesty. Domestic violence crosses all socio-economic and cultural boundaries. Just as no two women are alike, no two violent marriages are identical; Ms. Weldon explains her own experience in such a way that anyone living through this hell will see some element of her own situation.The cyclical nature of abuse, the cliche questions (&quot;What did you do to make him mad?&quot; &quot;Why did you stay so long,&quot; etc.), the cliche assumptions (she suffers from low self-esteem, HE suffers from low self-esteem, etc.)are all carefully addressed.By telling her story, Ms. Weldon has undoubtedly opened a door--even if it is just a crack!--for someone who really needs to know that there is hope for starting over. Michele did it...I did it...YOU CAN DO IT TOO."},{"Title":"I Closed My Eyes: Revelations of a Battered Woman","review":"WARNING: Don't start reading this incredibly compelling story without first setting aside some uninterrupted time, because once you pick it up you won't want to put it down. (I set my alarm for 6:10 AM, just to be sure I could finish it before waking the kids for school.) I will never think about domestic violence in the same way again. I Closed My Eyes revealed so many myths about DV, the abuser and the abused. I am not a victim of DV, yet I found the book incredibly moving and thought provoking. I highly recommend it to all women, regardless of their marital status or situation."},{"Title":"I Closed My Eyes: Revelations of a Battered Woman","review":"This is a beautifully written book. Particularly if you are an abused person, or if you know someone who is trying to find the courage to leave an abusive relationship, Weldon's book may tread where words cannot. She is neither vindictive or cruel. She tells a tale of a marriage that was picture perfect on the outside and violent on the inside. Weldon writes of her Attorney husband, a Sunday school teacher and pillar of the community who secretly and violently abuses her. It took Weldon years to find the courage to escape the violence and tell her story. Her writing is clear, beautiful and heartbreaking. Yet in the telling of her wrenching story one feels her strength and courage. I didn't feel sorry for Weldon in the end. I was sorry she had to experience such violence in her and her children's lives. What comes through in her story is her courage and her strength. An excellent memoir."},{"Title":"I Closed My Eyes: Revelations of a Battered Woman","review":"This book was ok. The author talked about her abuse and how she stayed with the abuser, husband for some time before she actually left him for good. However, the book was kind of redundant and she repeated the same thing over and over. I was waiting for the book to develop over each chapter but each chapter seemed to just repeat what she had already said. Maybe, it was just me, but it was not all that good to me."},{"Title":"I Closed My Eyes: Revelations of a Battered Woman","review":"I read this book for a class on family violence. I have to say I did not like it. The author comes across as a spoiled rich girl who married a man for superficial reasons and then stayed with him because she wanted to keep up appearances. It's not heartfelt or emotional. She needs to always be a victim. She sells her late father's gold chains to get money despite the fact that she has $10,000 from her mother set aside. She then tells her husband that she sold the chains to make him feel guilty about it. She plays mind games like this with him and says and does questionable things with her children like dressing up as a dead Nicole Brown Simpson, slathering herself with fake blood, making her kids cry, and leaving the babysitter to explain the situation. She also tells the kids Daddy hit her. Why would you heap your huge adult problems on little children? I can't help but feel that she exaggerated and flat out lied in some parts of the book to make a more compelling story. This book is crap. Don't read it."},{"Title":"I Closed My Eyes: Revelations of a Battered Woman","review":"I am not an abused wife or battered woman, but I can still appreciate what the author went through. She gives the reader a mostly detailed journey through her personal hell. Having said that I find it puzzling that she would choose to go to a costume party as Nicole Brown and OJ Simpson, complete with ketchup on her neck. It was in terrible taste and the author tries to explain it by saying &quot;the reality behind the charade was too important for me to abandon&quot;. Then she goes to tell that others at the party thought it was in bad taste and her italicized comments are &quot;that they missed the point.&quot; Not surprisingly they did, didn't they. Apparently, she thought they would immediately realize she was abused? She also admits her two youngest children were quite disturbed seeing her dressed like that and she told them it was a game and left it to the babysitter to explain. I, for one, don't look for hidden meanings in Halloween costumes and since Ms. Weldon stressed her love and devotion to her children and how she didn't want them affected by the abuse, I find her attitude about the costumes and her children very strange to say the least.When she finally exposed her husband and divorce proceedings began, she lamented that hers would be the only children at the Xmas plays and school events without a father. What planet is she from? Does she not know the divorce statistics? I found some of these comments rather whiney and self serving.She complains in the book of the duties of a single parent, oops, sorry, Double Parent. Ms. Weldon wants to make sure we understand her trials and tribulations. I understand that more falls on the shoulder of the custodial parent, but she certainly isn't the only Double Parent either. She has many family members and friends close by and her family stepped in to help her financially.I understand that it is difficult for women to leave an abusive relationship and she writes that she is glad she stayed 9 years. Once again, I am puzzled that as devoted a mother as she is, she finds it okay to have put her three children at risk in this situation.I'm sure I am going to be chastised for my criticims of Ms Weldon's book and I certainly don't mean to trivialize what she and other women have gone through. These are simply my observations."},{"Title":"I Closed My Eyes: Revelations of a Battered Woman","review":"This memoir dives deep into the author's thoughts, weaving past and present through letters and flashbacks along the way. What is lacking, after the initial chapters, is adequate narrative of actual events. After reading this book, I know what the author feels but not who she is. The switch between past and present gets confusing, and the introspection wears thin toward the middle of the book. I wish Michelle had described more vividly some of the incidents she brushes over, the black eye in Dallas, the bite on the arm. The book has heart but lacks soul."},{"Title":"I Closed My Eyes: Revelations of a Battered Woman","review":"The author writes in the preface, \\"I can pray someday I will understand why he did what he did.\\" A decade after the publication of her book, Ms. Weldon may know that she may never make sense of the insanity that caused her husband to nearly kill her.Michele Weldon is an award-winning journalist, and her skills as a writer are demonstrated in this true-story about domestic violence. The book is divided into three parts. With each part, Michele inserts private notes and cards her husband wrote to her, each \\"love letter\\" meant to be endearing, carefully crafted with all the right words, but somehow lacking in sincerity.Part One: Getting There, explores an enviable childhood and optimistic young adulthood. In her childhood, she takes us to an ice-cream shop. Michele falls in love, and with few warning signs of an abusive personality, she is married to a man who is enraged and disengaged. In a subsequent chapter, she takes the reader to a pawn shop. The reader gets the disconnect, and how denial serves for survival.Part Two: Getting Out, explains how scary it is to stay in an abusive marriage, and how scary it is to leave. Although Michele has multiple support systems, it appears that these do not make the emotional aspects of divorcing a sabotaging tyrant any easier. He continues to batter her psychologically, often using their children as a weapon. Throughout part two, Michele writes about crying on a continuum; crying is a measure of healing and hope. The thread of tears is worth reading again.Part Three: Getting Better, offers gem-filled vignettes, such as an exploration of color, hands, growth, grief, sorrow, joy, celebrations. Michele writes about healing, how it feels and how it sounds \\"I was no longer spending my nights dreading his key turning in the lock.\\"This isn't only a story about domestic violence. It is also a book about an empowered woman, separate from a man who possessed her, as she reclaimed her true self.Michele Weldon is the author of Everyman News: The Changing American Front PageEveryman News: The Changing American Front Pageand Writing to Save Your Life: How to Honor Your Story Through JournalingWriting to Save Your Life: How to Honor Your Story Through JournalingReview completed by Lynn C.

Her determination to tell the simple truth from the very beginning is obvious and unflinching. The resulting book is a legacy to her sons, who lived with her through horrific abuse, and a light in the storm for women trying to get through situations much like hers.The writing is engaging, the style clear and simple. Instead of telling her story largely in hindsight, she takes the reader by the hand and tells how she came to be married to a monster who was disguised as a Nice Guy, how she freed herself and her children, and lastly how she made a determined effort to recover from a dozen years of torture and make a new life for herself."},{"Title":"I Closed My Eyes: Revelations of a Battered Woman","review":"I first read Michele's short story essay on this topic in 1997 and was immediately drawn into her life.

When I first received the manuscript last year over the 4th of July, I spent the whole weekend reading instead of celebrating. I was so moved by her words, that I cried and laughed and got angry. I felt her pain. Even though I have not been physically abused, I have felt emotionally abused in my life.

This is what abuse victims need to read. They need to have their perceptions, observations and feelings validated. For so long, they have heard that they are imagining things or over-reacting. When you hear that long enough, you begin to doubt everything.This is a wonderful book and I am recommending it to my group.

We care about this not only from a scientific perspective, but even a political one, since our view of human nature is one of the foundations of political philosophy as well.The evolutionary psychology (EP) approach is here. Rather than adding yet another field to the growing list of social psychology, personality psychology, biological psychology, depth psychology, behavioral psychology, cognitive psychology, gestalt psychology, narrative psychology, transpersonal psychology, and so on endlessly, EP comes with the slogan that it can unify the whole mess.Simply put, by understanding the process nature uses to design organisms, and applying that to human evolution, we discover what the mind is designed to do and how. It's the scientific equivalent of asking God for our original blueprints. Except that we have to infer the design from very imperfect information.There have been several other good introductory EP texts, such as the excellent one by David Buss, a specialist in human mating patterns. There is also one by Cosmides and Tooby, authors of a landmark scholarly text in the field which contains a manifesto for distinguishing evolutionary psychology from the social sciences. There is even a reasonably good cartoon version of an overview of the field, by Evans and Zarate.What is very special about *this* new text by Gaulin and McBurney is that they have NOT just issued another manifesto against social science or another highly focused text on human mating and explanations for altruism. They seem to have actually begun a new era in the field, its implied agenda all along, to provide a unified framework for studying all of psychology, from sensation and perception to cognition, social behavior, and culture. As if all of human behavioral variety can be explained from the start in terms of where we came from.How does this potentially change psychology in general ? That's the main strength of this book. The authors make very clear that thinking in terms of the history of our species and the history of life in general; rather than isolated findings from loosely related experimental conditions; leads to very different conclusions at times. Like other fields, EP gives us a specific set of tools and protocols for investigating patterns in nature. But unlike other fields, it gives us a pegboard for hanging all those experimental results and investigating their relationship and what it tells us about ourselves and even our relationship to the rest of nature.The question is of course whether it succeeds. Is evolutionary psychology really to the point yet where it is no longer a protoscience, but a central way to understand human behavior ? There remain some dedicated opponents of the field, like Richard Lewontin, Stephen Jay Gould, and Steve Rose (&quot;Alas, Poor Darwin.&quot;) Their main and strongest objection seems to remain that it is too seductively easy to tell evolutionary stories about human behavior, stories that can't be tested empirically. Do the authors address this sufficiently to offer EP as a &quot;new psychology ?&quot;Surprisingly, yes, I think they do. Gaulin and McBurney address the real technical issues raised by the youthful status of the field. They don't offer a strongly deterministic account of human beings blindly following the programming of their genes, they clearly communicate a biologically informed perspective on human behavior. Our behavior not only has a very real and explorable relationship to animal behavior, but it has a discernable relationship to evolutionary process.Most importantly of all, the authors make clear that EP does not have to, and does not, stand on its own from vague untestable evolutionary theories, or &quot;just so stories.&quot; It truly does provide a new way of making sense of what we already know from existing psychological experiments, and shedding new light on them with additional testable predictions.This is not only a milestone text in psychology teaching, but also an exemplary text in general. It is exceptionally clearly written, with crisp prose with outstandingly good organization.I had one quibble with the text, which is the annoying tradition, seemingly taken from Cosmides and Tooby's maifesto &quot;The Adapted Mind,&quot; of spending a lot of time attacking the &quot;standard social science model&quot; of infinitely mutable human nature. The &quot;SSSM&quot; probably seems more a worthy target for its political implications than its role in social science. If human nature is infinitely mutable, it is also infinitely perfectable, and therefore suggests &quot;utopian&quot; goals and certain kinds of solutions to social problems. This is where tempers really flare, and we start getting the usual accusations of people being fascists or marxists or racists or supporters of eugenics or supporters of unrealistic social engineering. I think the tradition of attacking the &quot;SSSM&quot; it just a more veiled way of playing politics the way Wilson, Lewontin, and Gould did in the early days of sociobiology.Since leading figures in most other fields have also attacked the blank slate view of human nature, this casts such rhetoric as a bit of a strawman rather than really distinguishing EP from realistic portrayals of modern social scientists and anthropologists. I suppose this sort of rhetoric is attributable somewhat to the followers of the field trying to create its niche in academia. But it is a distraction that for me takes away from an otherwise wonderful text. It's time to &quot;just say no&quot; to the silly idea of suppressing evolutionary thinking, the most important principle in life sciences, just to keep extremists happy. It's time to take the implications of a wondrous evolving natural world more seriously and begin a new era of learning about ourselves from those implications. It's time to start teaching psychology as if we took our own biological science seriously, and begin to study human nature in earnest. This is an exceptional first step."},{"Title":"Kenilworth (Waverly novels)","review":"Being a fan of Scott and his writings, I expected much more from this book than it was able to offer. Although the actual writing of the book is excellent, conveying wonderfully the flavor and character of the times as well as the vanity of the monarchs and suitors, the plot ends abruptly with a tragic ending. Aside from altogether disliking tragedies, I found this ending a surprising disappointment because the book gave very little indication of the horrific climax which was to come. After finishing the last page, I almost felt as though I had finished reading two separate books - a romance and a tragedy"},{"Title":"Kenilworth (Waverly novels)","review":"Kenilworth is set in 1575 during the reign of Elizabeth I. It is the story of Amy Robsart who has secretly married Robert Dudley Earl of Leicester. But Leicester is the Queen's favourite and fearful that he would lose his status if his marriage became public he keeps Amy secluded in Cumnor Hall. However, such secrets are hard to keep in an Elizabethan England full of plots and intrigues between factions vying for Elizabeth's favour and as Leicester entertains the Queen at Kenilworth castle the truth will out.As usual Scott tells a good story in Kenilworth. He takes as his point of departure the known incidents of history and weaves his plot around them. He is not always faithful to the historical record, but he captures the mood of the time. His characterisation of Elizabeth is particularly fine, showing her fair and just but swift to take offence and with a devastating temper. Scott builds great tension into his plot, because it is a story rooted in a period where one false step can bring instant downfall, where the highest can be brought to the block in an instant, if Elizabeth's capricious mood turns angry.Kenilworth is quite a difficult read. Scott's scholarship was such that he often uses the language of Elizabethan times and continually refers to historical events and literary texts which are now obscure. It is for this reason that it is important to read an edition of Scott which uses the best modern experts to clarify and explain the text. The Edinburgh Edition of the Waverley Novels, published by Edinburgh and Columbia University Press, is the definitive edition of Scott and is a stunning example of modern scholarship. The glossary is full and the notes are detailed and useful. The editor, J.H. Alexander, has gone back to Scott's original manuscript and first edition to provide a text of Kenilworth which is in a number of crucial respects different from that which has been commonly read since 1831. In the end the most important thing is that this edition makes Scott easier to read and easier to enjoy. Scott ought to be enjoyed. He was one of the most popular novelists of his day and with a little practice, reading him becomes a great pleasure. Kenilworth is quite a good place to begin an acquaintance with Scott's writing. Being set in England, it has no dialogue in the old Scots dialect, which can be difficult nowadays even for Scottish people to understand. Moreover it has a fine story with many interesting characters both virtuous and villainous. It may not be one of Scott's very greatest novels, but it is a good one and well worth reading even if at times it may be something of a struggle."},{"Title":"Kenilworth (Waverly novels)","review":"Don't read any of the following reviews unless you've already read Kenilworth. Scott deliberately withholds from the reader key facts (facts which all of the following reviews reveal) until well after the plot has started. Anyway, I've been on a Sir Walter Scott binge recently and, of the three Scott novels I've read -- Ivanhoe, Quentin Durward and this -- I'd place this book well above Ivanhoe but equal to Quentin Durward. It takes place in Elizabethan England; it has some sword fights; it's fairly funny in parts; the plot creaks only occasionally. Still, well worth reading."},{"Title":"Kenilworth (Waverly novels)","review":"As a ardent reader of medieval England stories, this is one book which I found as entertaining and romantic as any other book I have read. It has everything from castles and Knights in horses to damsels in distress. Scott is magnificent in the portrayal of Amy as well as Sir Walter Raleigh and Elizabeth is the crown of his characterisation. A book worth reading.."},{"Title":"Kenilworth (Waverly novels)","review":"Readers of Scott know not to read for plot, for even his most highly regarded novels meander and stray wilfully from the strict path of story-telling. Kenilworth, in addition to being a typically marvelous example of Scott's allusive narrative power, also happens to be the tightest and best contrived of his plots, one of the very few of his novels where all the ends are tied together convincingly. The novel has a gloriously conveyed Elizabethan atmosphere, which it is not timid about evoking at all levels and types: there is peasant comedy, taproom humor, stately politics, an aritocratic love story, villainous alchemists, and a sort of self-taught, lesser artisan hero whom its easy to root for (Wayland Smith).If you're familiar with the movie Elizabeth, you'll recognize some of the situations in this novel. But Scott isn't particularly historically accurate here, nor is he trying to be. His source is an Elizabethan ballad, and he tries to convey that world in all its Shakespearian complexity.Overall, one of the best, one of my favorite, of the Waverley novels, finally available in a dependable, well-edited edition. Bravo Scott, bravo Penguin Classics! More please!"},{"Title":"Kenilworth (Waverly novels)","review":"In Sir Walter Scott's 1821 novel KENILWORTH, very young Amy Robsart of the English country gentry had once been engaged to marry a serious young scholar of Cornwall, Edmund Tressilian. But the handsome, rich, powerful Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, comes between them. Tressilian and Amy's father, Sir Hugh, know that Amy has either eloped or been carried off by someone. But they suspect ungainly Richard Varney, not the handsome, vastly wealthy Earl of Leicester. Richard Varney, as it happens, is the hugely influential right hand man of Dudley. And one of Varney's jobs is to scout out pretty women for his Puritan master to seduce.To this end Varney systematically ingratiates himself with Sir Hugh Robsart and brings his master and Miss Robsart together in clandestine meetings. Amy loves Dudley as woman has never loved man before but will not, like his other conquests, willingly go to bed with him unless and until they are married. The Earl, for his part, is smitten by Amy and impulsively weds her, over Varney's objections that he is ruining his political career. But the great Earl remains ambitious and prudent enough to keep the wedding secret until he can find a time and a way to make it known without doing harm to his rising status with his old childhood friend and onetime fellow prisoner of the Tower of London, Elizabeth Tudor.Dudley has Varney fit up splendidly as Amy's closely guarded residence a ruined abbey which Varney has been given as spoils from Henry VIII's dissolution of the monasteries. It pertains to the village of Cumnor near Oxford. The Earl hides his new wife in Cumnor Hall, where, after a search at novel's beginning, Tressilian finds her but cannot persuade her to return to her father.From that point on, the plot becomes more and more complex and the secret marriage harder to keep secret or, once discovered, to explain. Varney assures the inquisitive Queen that Amy is his wife, not Leicester's and Leicester takes his good time telling the truth. Meanwhile Varney convinces the already great Earl to do his best to win Elizabeth's hand and become King of England. The pious Earl trusts the villainous Varney to find a way to make this happen that is both effective and compatible with the Earl's Puritan conscience.Without revealing precisely what happens to love-smitten Amy Robarts, who remains devoted to Leicester through betrayal upon betrayal, let me quote her keeper's comment to Varney in the final pages of KENILWORTH on how Amy's love of her unworthy husband has scalded her: \\"It is a seething of the kid in the mother's milk\\" (Ch. 41).There are twenty or more other rounded, energetic characters whom readers will enjoy seeing pass across the stage of KENILWORTH. They include Sir Walter Raleigh and his legendary muddied cloak. There is Will Shakespeare, whose rhymes the Queen can't get out of her mind. There are other memorable real and fictional minor characters of both sexes.Walter Scott is famous for his descriptions of costumes, armor, jewelry and clothing. When the Queen visits Dudley's castle at KENILWORTH, her ladies must moderate their dresses lest they eclipse the vain monarch. But Elizabeth likes her men young and well turned out and the Earl of Leicester outdoes them all in dazzling white: \\"his shoes being of white velvet ... his stockings of knit silk, lined with cloth of silver ... the scabbard of his sword of white velvet with golden buckles\\" and on and on (Ch. 31).This is a rich fable of a Lord who did his devious best to have his cake and eat it too. Its dramatic possibilities led into almost as many Walter Scott operas as did IVANHOE. KENILWORTH inspired Auber, Klein, de Lara, Donizetti, among others, to set the story to music.Finally: a friend of mine grew up in affluent Kenilworth Village, north of Chicago. She says that street names there are daily reminders of characters from Sir Walter Scot's novel of the same name. My friend cites Amy Robsart as the prime example. An American town created as a monument to Sir Walter Scott! And why not? Sir Walter Scott's great historical, almost gothic, novel of 1821, KENILWORTH, deserves celebrating and is more exciting and heart-stopping fiction than plodding, minutely accurate history. Thank you, Illinois!-OOO-"},{"Title":"Kenilworth (Waverly novels)","review":"As the book opens, Amy Robsart has left her family home and has secretly married Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester. Amy's father, Sir Hugh and the man her father intended her to marry, Edmund Tressilian, have no knowledge of Amy's whereabouts and suspect foul play at the hands of Dudley's sneaky master of the horse, Richard Varney, and Tressilian goes in search of Amy at an old manor house, Cumnor Place. As Elizabeth I's attraction to Dudley grows, so does Dudley's ambitions to reach for the stars and a greater place at court than he ever dared for, and Amy becomes a bit of a liability -- especially to Varney who hopes to rise in power alongside his master--and thus the game is on.This is the first Walter Scott that I have read, with the exception of Ivanhoe and that was many years ago when I was a young child. I admit to almost giving up a couple of times, as the vernacular used by the characters was hard to follow at times, but it's worth slugging through the first 50 or so pages until the story starts cooking along as Scott takes the reader on a grand ride through the court of Elizabeth Tudor. Even Walter Raleigh makes a wonderful secondary character, his characterization of Elizabeth I was spot on, and I loved the way Scott worked Dudley's famous fete of Elizabeth at his castle at Kenilworth into Amy's story.Although Scott based this tale on an old English Ballad (which is printed in the back of the book) and not known history, it's still a jolly good yarn peopled with interesting characters, poison, astrology, treachery and all the well known intrigues of the Court of Elizabeth I. Those of you who are well versed in Tudor history already know the fate of Amy Robsart and I will have to warn those potential readers who are picky about historical accuracy that Scott definitely diddles with history in this tale. But for those readers who are willing to forget what's in the history books and ready to enjoy a jolly good yarn by a master storyteller about Elizabethan England, this is one book worth checking out, and I intend to read other books by this author. Five stars."},{"Title":"Kenilworth (Waverly novels)","review":"Sir Walter Scott (1771-1832) is Scotland's greatest novelist. The poet and lawyer turned to fiction after Lord Byron's poetic star ascended while his declined. Scott is the father of the historical novel. In his Waverly novels he revolutionized the novel and won glowing immortality in English literature.Kenilworth (1821) shows Scott moving south of the border to Great Britain. Tne book is set in 1575 during the reign of Queen Elizabeth. Historical figures such as Sir Walter Scott and Shakespeare (fleetingly) appear in the excitingly melodramatic tale of intrigue, murder and court politics at Elizabeth's court.The plot: Amy Robsart is secretly married to Dudley Lord Leicester. Leicester wishes the marriage to remain secret as he is courting Queen Elizabeth. Dudley dreams of becoming King of England. Amy is also loved by the Cornishman Tresillian who seeks to help her escape from Cumnor Place where she has been forced into seclusion by her husband. Scott is good at imprisonment images: Amy is often described as a bird in a cage.Leicester and his chief henchamn Richard Varney want it believed that Amy is wed to Varney. Elizabeth learns the truth. Amy is murdered by Varney and the thughs who are in his employ (this is a fictional account; historians are divided as to what led to Amy's early death). Richard Varney is the most interesting figure in the novel. He is an amoral overachiever whose Machiavellian plotting leads him to disaster. He is one of the most dastardly villains in all of English literature.The novel is divided into three parts:Part One-Set in Cumnor Place and a local inn. Part II-The Elizabethean court in London. Part III-The estate of Kenilworth, owned by Leicester, where he is holding a magnificent reception in honor of his guest Queen Elizabeth.Scott adds humor in his minor characters such as innkeeper Giles Gosling and Flbbertigibbet. Kenilworth is free of the Scotch dialect of most of his novels but is still a formidable read for 21st century eyes. The book is filled with excerpts of poetry and quotes from literary works. Scott is an acquired taste since his style is convoluted, formal and difficult to decipher.As a fan of Scott I love the new Penguin Revised edition of his works based on the Edinburgh Edition. The Penguin edition includes a glossary of words used by Scott and over 50 pages of footnotes explaining the many arcane references.Scott committed many literary crimes! Among them:a. Difficult sentence structure hard to understand on a first reading.b. Implausible plots based on coincidencec. Wooden characters who are one dimensional. They are puppets.4. Intrusive authorial comments on the plot development and characters.5. Creaking plot manipulation.6. Unrealistic dialogue. The characters talk as if they are on stage declaiming and revealing themselves to the audience. At times I thought I was watching a Shakespearean drama.7. Too many words! The books needed better editing.With all these failing Scott excells in the primary fictional requirement of an author. The author of Waverly knew how to tell a story! His tales will long be remembered by readers who soldier through the prose to reach their final page. Great Scott! What a genius was this father of the historical romance novel!"},{"Title":"Kenilworth (Waverly novels)","review":"Sir Walter Scott (1771 - 1832): Kenilworth. A Romance. Edited and with an Introduction by J. H. Alexander. London and New York: Penguin Books, 1999. xlvi and 467 pages.Scott started his literary life as a poet and only later turned to novel-writing. Perhaps that is why his plots are not always as brilliantly conceived as his descriptions of the life and times about which he writes. \\"Kenilworth\\" was his second novel, after \\"Ivanhoe\\", in which England and not Scotland stood in the centre of attention. Unlike \\"Ivanhoe\\", however, \\"Kenilworth\\" is set in the Renaissance, during the long reign of Elizabeth I (the year 1575 is mentioned at one point). And I suspect that it is Scott's description of Elizabeth and her court which remains in most Englishmen's common memory of this period until today. The story Scott tells is based, as is usual with him, on historical reality, which he has, using his incredibly full antiquarian knowledge of the period, described and expanded to cover a large canvas with some of the most colourful scenes and characters to be found in any historical novel. Next to the wonderfully evocative descriptions of Elizabethan pageantry I would name the profoundly skilful dialogues between the Earl of Leicester and Elizabeth or between the Earl and Varney, his master of horse, as the high points of the novel. These are reported in such detail that, inevitably, the story-line or plot only develops comparatively slowly, although this, of course, builds up enormous tension towards the end of the book until the whole is tragically resolved. The detailed descriptions and reports of conversations also create character, and Scott has here very ably created some of literature's most fascinating characters. Other reviewers have pointed to Elizabeth herself, here most wittily characterized, but personally I found equal pleasure in the power-hungry, wavering Earl of Leicester, in the cringing, miserly Forster, in the hypocritical astrologer Alasco, in his former assistant Wayland and in the grimassing, inquisitive boy known generally as \\"Flibbertigibbet\\". The villain Varney is painted in very black colours, almost too black to be true; the tragic heroine, Amy Robsart, has, interestingly enough, been compared with Lucy in \\"The Bride of Lammermoor\\", but for my taste Amy seems a little too passive and submissive. If there is a \\"hero\\" to the story, I suppose it is Tressilian, who is, however, lost sight of during considerable chunks of the story.Reading Scott is always something of a daunting task because of his immense vocabulary and his constant use of antique or antiquarian terms. The Penguin Edition of \\"Kenilworth\\" makes this task somewhat easier by providing copious notes and an extended glossary, although these practically entail one in reading with two fingers in different places at the back of the book and constantly turning the pages back and forth. Scott's unbounded delight in quotes from the Bible, from Chaucer, from Shakespeare, from Webster and from Ben Johnson as well as from more obscure literary and historical works is perfectly documented in the notes. The \\"introduction\\" should only be read after studying the novel, not before, and should really have been printed at the end, not before the text. There are various other aids to understanding here, too, including a comparison of the novel with the known historical facts, and some 16th century maps and charts of Kenilworth Castle where the majority of the \\"action\\" in the second half of the book takes place.\\"Kenilworth\\" is definitely one of Scott's major novels, although I would recommend that novices start with his more popular tales of Scotland: \\"Guy Mannering\\"Guy Mannering (Penguin Classics), \\"Old Mortality\\"Old Mortality (Oxford World's Classics), \\"The Heart of Midlothian\\"The Heart of Midlothian (Oxford World's Classics), \\"Rob Roy\\"Rob Roy (Oxford World's Classics)or \\"The Bride of Lammermoor\\"The Bride of Lammermoor (Oxford World's Classics), all of which were published some years prior to \\"Kenilworth\\"."},{"Title":"Kenilworth (Waverly novels)","review":"I don't know if I would read this book again, but it was enjoyable for the sake of being new.

This is, to my best knowledge, the first book to directly address those concerns in detail.The book is in three sections plus copious appendices and an index. The first section discusses the physiology of human vision, defines the nature and consequences (not only astronomical) of light pollution, and considers changes in attitude to and technology of lighting. This serves as an excellent introduction to the problem.The second section shows how astronomy may be continued, despite light pollution, by technological 'fixes', such as light pollution reduction (LPR) filters and CCD imaging. One hundred objects suitable for visual observation from light-polluted skies are suggested and described. Techniques of observation in light-polluted skies are also suggested. It is this section of the book that is most likely to be criticised by those concerned that it may imply that, since astronomy in light-polluted skies is possible, the problem itself is not as great as activists suggest. I would suggest that it is only by showing peoplewhat is visible in these skies that an interest in astronomy can be established and maintained, thus leading to (hopefully) a will to address the problem.In the final section, the book discusses remedies; briefly these are technological (good lighting), legal (legislation to control poor lighting), and social (educating people as to the problem). The appendices that follow provide good material (including the debunking of common lighting myths) for anyone who wishes to involve him (or her) self in combating this source of aesthetic degradation.Obviously, this book will be of great use as a 'handbook' for anyone involved in the activities of the Campaign for Dark Skies (CfDS) or the International Dark-sky Association (IDA), but its appeal is wider than that. It is also useful for those who undertake astronomy under brightly-lit skies, both as a guide to what may be achieved, but also with suggestions as to how such astronomers may help to have their skies improved. There is a slight UK emphasis, but the book has international appeal.Shining through the lively style of the very well-written text is the author's passion for astronomy in general and his knowledge gained over many years as co-ordinator of the CfDS. The copious photographs, most of which are in colour, serve to enhance the text.In short, this is a very good book, which is very readable, covering a subject of importance.

As fascinating to the Dickinson scholar as they are to the casual enthusiast, Dickinson's letters -- along with those of Keats or Hopkins -- prove that this is every bit as legitimate a genre as fiction or poetry. Some of Dickinson's most gorgeous and enduring statements are here, and to read these in chronological order is to map the gradual development of America's premier woman poet. Even in a letter she wrote at 12-years-old, the idiosyncratic dashes with which she distinguished her poetic voice are abundant, and already have that effect of forcing the reader to savor clusters of words as they unravel down the page. Similarly, Dickinson's mind-blowing instinct for the staggering metaphor is in full gear throughout (\\"Vinnie came soft as a moccasin\\") and, for all her great death poetry, it is in a letter regarding the death of her father where we find perhaps her most vulnerable and moving confrontation with mortality:\\"Father does not live with us now -- he lives in a new house. Though it was built in an hour it is better than this. He hasn't any garden because he moved after gardens were made, so we take him the best flowers, and if we only knew he knew, perhaps we could stop crying.\\"Perhaps most fascinating of all, though, is the mixture of extremes Dickinson's personality manifests throughout these letters, a crude bluntness that mingles with the most tender innocence. She at once condemns a cousin's valentine as \\"A little condescending, & sarcastic, your Valentine to me, I thought\\" and begins another missive with the exuberant mysticism of a child speaking as if out of some fairytale: \\"I wanted to write, and just tell you that me, and my spirit were fighting this morning. It isn't known generally, and you musn't tell anybody.\\" Of course, this book also includes that characteristically bizarre and unforgettable final letter, which she wrote while suffering from the illness that would take her life just days later: \\"Little Cousins, Called Back. Emily.\\" Especially enjoyable about this particular volume are the endnotes with which the editor follows up most letters. These brief but informed observations offer a fascinating and thorough glimpse into Dickinson's reading life, while also helping to illuminate her more obscure autobiographical allusions. This book is as fascinating an odyssey as Dickinson's complete poems, and I think readers do themselves a great service by delving into these letters alongside that more celebrated aspect of her genius."},{"Title":"Letters of Emily Dickinson","review":"...If you are, like me, an Emily Dickinson's great admirer you will be genuinely drawn into this book.

This collection, unlike other books of the genre, such as Elizabeth Bishop's One Art or Keats's book of letters, do not reveal much of her poetry, as her mental struggle with the work, her intentions, or choice of words. Even so, the reader is allowed into her family relationships, into her care and love for her few friends, and above all into her deep-set feeling of solitude. Besides, throughout her letters she discloses her main existential concerns, which are inevitably reflected in her poems. This book makes it possible to discover the books she read and the ones that offered her the greatest pleasure. As the collection includes from her juvenile writings to her latest letters when already living in social \\"exile,\\" they form a most engrossing reading, with the characteristics of an autobiography, without the intention by the author to write one. In her very words, \\"my letter as a bee, goes laden.\\""},{"Title":"Letters of Emily Dickinson","review":"EMILY DICKINSON SELECTED LETTERS. Edited by Thomas H. Johnson. 364 pp. Cambridge, Massachusetts : The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1971. SBN674-25060-5 (hbk).Emily Dickinson was a great letter writer, in all senses of the word. In fact one gets the impression that she actually preferred writing to people, than meeting and conversing with them, and for her the arrival of a letter was a great event. A letter was something she looked forward to with keen anticipation, and which she savored to the full whenever one arrived.The present selection of letters represents only a small proportion of the letters Emily Dickinson actually wrote. She was an inveterate letter-writer, had many correspondents, and wrote thousands of letters. And people in those days collected letters just as today.Unfortunately it was the custom, whenever anyone died, to make a bonfire of all of their correspondence, probably because of its personal and confidential nature. In this way thousands of pages of Emily Dickinson's writings have been lost to posterity, and we would know much more aboute the details of her day-to-day life, and be able to date her poems more accurately, if it hadn't been for this tragic loss.Just how great the loss is may be gaged by taking a look at the way Ellen Louise Hart and Martha Nell Smith have treated her letters in 'Open Me Carefully : Emily Dickinson's Intimate Letters to Susan Huntington Dickinson' (1998). Whereas Thomas Johnson prints all of ED's letters as straight prose, which of course leads us to read them as straight prose, Hart-Smith give us their particular letters as they actually appear in the original draft - not as continous lines of prose but as very short lines with numerous line breaks - in other words, as poetry.It would seem that at least some of ED's 'letters' are not so much letters as 'letter-poems,' and when read as poems produce a remarkable range of effects that are lost when all line breaks are removed and the 'letter' is regularized as straight prose. The loss of her letters now begins to look much more serious, for there seems to be a growing feeling among readers that her letters were every bit as great an artistic achievement as her poems.Given this, the present book becomes something that should interest all serious students of ED, although before reading it they might (if they haven't already) take at look at the Hart-Smith, and keep it in mind while reading the Johnson. One wonders how much poetry may be lurking unrecognized in the regularized lines of 'Emily Dickinson's Selected Letters.'"},{"Title":"Letters of Emily Dickinson","review":"Like most customers of Amazon, I am always on the lookout for a bargain. You can understand why I salivated when I saw that a paperback edition of this mammoth collection of Dickinson's letters was available for only $8.93 -- far less than the expensive hardcover edition. Well, once again the adage of getting what you pay for is proved true. The book that arrived in the mail contains a small portion of the complete correspondence, and the format is not reader-friendly. No footnotes, not even a clear demarcation between the text of the letters and any explanatory information. Out-of-date is the kindest way to describe this edition. Don't fall into the trap that sucked $8.93 from my wallet!"},{"Title":"Letters of Emily Dickinson","review":"Emily Dickinson was a great letter writer, in all senses of the word.

I've always loved Laura Ingall Wilder's books and was reading about her on Wikipedia the other day, when I read the entry on Rose Wilder Lane and was intrigued. I took out this book and Old Hometown from the libary and am hooked - they are beautifully written and evocative books. What a wonderful storyteller! Let the Hurricane Roar really does give you an idea of what the pioneers and their wives went through - her descriptions of the wife's plight were especially moving and took away any self-pity I might ever feel for a bad day at home!"},{"Title":"Let the hurricane roar (A Keith Jennison book)","review":"Rose, the daughter of Laura Ingalls Wilder, penned this poignant story of her grandparents' 19th century American pioneer experience. I imagine she sat for hours listening to Caroline and Charles Ingalls (Little House on the Prairie), retell the adventurous season of their honeymoon year spent on the Dakota frontier and knew it would make a great book. The tale recounts the journey of the two teens who stake a claim and ride out the complications of prairie living. Within the pages of the book, Charles and Caroline discover that the world is a harsh place, but with grace and stamina they can find the resiliency to beat the elements and live a happy life. I hope to order the book for my high school students in our international school as it deals with universal themes faced by all people. What makes the Ingalls come out on top? Read to see. You won't be disappointed in this short but powerful read. The pioneer spirit prevails but not without a little help from Love.

Lane was a writer LONG before her mother ever picked up a pencil. While The previous reviewers found Let the Hurricane Roar to be very similar to the LIW books, there is a reason. R.W. Lane based her novel on her grandparents' experiences in homesteading. (It's not surprising, then, for people to find similarities....) What is surprising to most people is the fact that the Little House Series was virtually unpublishable in its original form -- until Ms. Lane edited her mother's very basic manuscripts, giving them style, flow and poise. Her own career ended up suffering terribly from this devotion to her mother. I found Hurricane to be vastly superior to the LIW books (which should rightly be credited to RWLane, as well); the content, pacing and structure were far better developed, as were the characterizations. Brilliant depiction of the trials of homesteading on the plains."},{"Title":"Let the hurricane roar (A Keith Jennison book)","review":"This book by Rose Wilder Lane is good, but too much like On the Banks of Plum Creek, by Laura Ingalls Wilder, Rose's mother.

The author addresses not only the theoretical concepts behind OO-programming, but he outlines how to do it using Smalltalk, one of the first OO-languages, and C++, certainly one of the most widely-used OO-languages. I do not know Smalltalk, and did not read the part on this language, so my comments will be limited to the sections on C++ and the general discussions on OO-programming.The author gives an overview of the semantics or \\"meaning\\" of a program. He is very thorough in his treatment, and some of the areas that I found particularly well-written include his discussions of:Order of evaluation and side effects; conditional, controlled, and implicit iteration; the importance of strong typing in giving more reliable code; the run-time stack; passing by name, by value, by value-result,and by reference; declarations versus definitions; the difference between static and dynamic typing; static versus dynamic scoping; object lifetime and instantiation; static, automatic, and dynamic storage; data types; pointers; constrained types; encapsulation and information hiding; abstraction mechanisms; programming paradigms, including imperative, functional, logic, and object-oriented; =class semantics; the distinction between \\"pure\\" OO-languages such as Smalltalk, Eiffel, and Java, and hybrid OO-languages such as Object Pascal, Oberon, Delphi Pascal, Ada95, C++, and Objective C; the tradeoffs between execution time and dynamic binding in C++; the justification for using in-line functions rather than macros in C++; static, file, local function, and class scope in C++; static and dynamic storage allocation of objects in C++; the distinction between a class in C++, which must be an instance, and thus not \\"first-class\\" as in Smalltalk; friend declarations in C++ and how they depart from OO-philosophy; the example of the \\"Queue\\" class; the \\"this\\" pointer in C++; \\"smart\\" pointers in C++; and class templates in C++.He does not include a discussion of object-oriented design methodologies (Booch, etc), but does give references for further reading. Excellent summaries are given at the end of each chapter along with exercises.It is definitely a book that serves well also as a reference, even though it was published in 1997, and some changes to the implementation of C++ have occurred since then."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Programming with C++ and Smalltalk","review":"A short thirty years ago, one of the best bass players on the planet was slightly distracted by all nite work in the computer lab in Champaign-Urbana...

Parts are not included nor are they available separately from Dover.It is in modern notation with very clear, dark printing. It is a large-format (approx. 8 1/2 x 11) paperback book and is bound like most paperbacks.As with all Dover Editions, it is very easy to read and follow the music, but it was not designed as a performing score. Because of the binding (it won't lie flat) and because no attention was given to page turns, it is very difficult to play from. But if you wish to study the music or follow the score while listening to your favorite recording, you can't beat this edition for the money."},{"Title":"The Six Brandenburg Concertos and the Four Orchestral Suites in Full Score (Dover Music Scores)","review":"I recall reading that when Messaien was captured by the Germans during World War II, one of the few musical references he had in the POW camp was a score to Bach's BRANDENBURG CONCERTOS. The POW camp, of course, was where Messaien wrote his masterpiece QUARTET FOR THE END OF TIME.

Fortunately there are many gay story collections out there that are far better."},{"Title":"Daughter of Jerusalem (Daughters of Faith)","review":"This is a stunning retelling of the story of Mary Magdalene, the follower of Christ who played a critically important role in the Easter story.As the book begins,the disciples are at the stage where the sting of Jesus' death has begun to be healed by the events of Pentecost. It is a time when Mary reflects on her life thus far.As a young woman, Mary naievely gets herself into a position conductive to what we would now call date rape with a young man who is already engaged. Of no use to her family after her deflowering, she is thrown into the streets, where to survive she is forced to become a kept woman. As time goes on, she tries to compensate for her helplessness by using her sexuality to gain a measure of power - until she meets Jesus and her life is changed forever.In the early days of the church Mary must now face a life without her Teacher, the knowledge that the chances of ever meeting a man who would be willing to marry her is now slim to none, the possibility that some or all of her male friends might be executed ... and her past, which now comes back to her.Although the characters from Mary's past and Peter and Andrew's families are added to flesh out the story, the novel sticks to biblical accuracy. The fact that Mary has to deal with her past life even after her salvation is also true to life and very realistic.The secondary characters are also well drawn, especially an overwhelmed but unflappable Simon Peter and a fascinating Joanna - who along with Mary herself proves that the female disciples played a different but no less essential role in early Christianity than the Twelve. The section where she describes her conversion is one of the most interesting parts of the book to me, and makes me wonder why Mr. Lemmons created a fictional friend of John's for book three instead of telling the story of this undoubtedly gutsy lady who left not only her husband but Herod's court for Jesus. Surely she deserves as much attention as Lydia Purpuraria."},{"Title":"Daughter of Jerusalem (Daughters of Faith)","review":"I thouroughly enjoyed Thom Lemmons' book. It help me to set myself in the time after Jesus' death and really focus on what they were going through. It also helped me put together the fragments of Mary's life. Easy and fun to read!!"},{"Title":"Daughter of Jerusalem (Daughters of Faith)","review":"Mr. Lemmons has once again penned an excellent narrative from a unique perspective that he alone seems to be able to perceive. I have read all of his books with great anticipation, but it appears he is hitting his stride here. A view of events surrounding the fulfillment of a religion through the eyes of a &quot;minor player,&quot; framing the questions, doubts and fears of a 21st century believer. An outstanding book!"},{"Title":"Daughter of Jerusalem (Daughters of Faith)","review":"Maybe I should wait to finish the book before writing a review, but I have no reason to believe this book will turn bad: it's so good.I enjoy reading good religious fiction because sometimes we get to thinking that Biblical figures weren't anything like real people. Mary of Magdala, Peter, Andrew, Stephen: they're all so very real when seen through the author's eyes. We can feel sorrow and joy, excitement and fear through these well known people.It's also difficult to fill in the blanks left in the Scriptures. Maybe we're meant to imagine what goes in the blanks. Just what were the seven demons expelled from Mary of Magdala? Who was Stephen? Why was he martyred? What did he do to get the attention of Saul? And what about Saul? We know what motivated him-he tells us in his own letters. And we know the followers of the Way found it very hard to trust him in the beginning. Seeing all of this action unfold in this novel really helps put some flesh onto the Acts of the Apostles.Religious fiction at its best should make one want to turn to the Scriptures, to read and pray again over the messages to be found there now that we have become friends with the people we read about.I own the second book in this series and I'm looking forward to it. I hope it's as good as this one."},{"Title":"Daughter of Jerusalem (Daughters of Faith)","review":"I really couldn't book the book down.

The book details extensively her formative years at EMI, leading to the release of her first album and Kate's growing confidence. Given that she has always remained an elusive figure, it makes good sense for the authors to concentrate on the creative processes Kate goes through in the creation of each album. However, the book is not simply dry reportage, but freely quotes Kate's family, friends and peers, giving the factual information a greater depth.All the albums up to &quot;The Hounds of Love&quot; are covered, as well as reports from video shoots, concerts and personal appearances. The book is rounded out with a series of Kate's personal quotes, giving some interesting insights into her work and then some useful lists, including a discography, videography and Kate &quot; trivia&quot;.The book's real strength however, are it's many visual images, ranging from concert photos to video captures to promotional images, all of which serve to demonstrate Kate's undoubted appeal. If a few more colour pictures had been included, four stars would have become five. In all, this excellent package provides an indispensible guide to one of popular music's most talented performers."},{"Title":"Christian-theistic evidences (In defense of Biblical Christianity)","review":"Many scholars incorrectly assert that Van Til rejected Christian evidences. This is not the case. Van Til maintained that all men as they examine any evidence do so with the controlling lens of their presuppositions. Thus evidence must be built upon the foundations of the rational pre-necessities that only the triune God can provide. \\"In \\"Christian-Theistic Evidences: In defense of Biblical Christianity\\" byCornelius Van Til one discovers the proper epistemic place for Christian evidences within the biblical apologetic.Van Til opines: \\"...without the presupposition of the God of Christianity, we cannot even interpret one fact correctly.\\"He adds: \\"So, the Christian apologist may begin with any fact because, no matter what the facts he wishes to discuss, the stakes are ultimately the same. In every case, CT is in question. Do the facts belong to God or do they not? The challenge for the apologist is to treat the facts in a way that calls the God of Scripture--including the Christian system--into view.\\"Van Til rightly taught that you do not have to learn to marshal volumes of evidence; you do not have to learn to be a \\"good lawyer.\\" You should learn to demonstrate that without having the triune God as the metaphysical pre-commitment, the atheist cannot make sense out of anything. He cannot account for the universe, mankind, history, or science. He will be left to repent or remain speechless. God is the foundation and source of all meaning, purpose, and rationality. God alone is the one who makes rationality and argument possible. Without God, the unbeliever cannot account for anything in the universe. We can demonstrate that the Lord is the source of all law, order, logic, mathematics, truth, goodness, beauty, science, and philosophy. The atheist, in reality, has no argument. God must live or we could not argue at all.Furthermore he stresses that whether \\"we are able to bring CT to a more full expression or only to a partial one, the goal is to express the biblical system through the facts. ... Facts should serve as manifestations of the Christian system.\\"Additionally he maintains, as a presuppositionalist, the evidences \\"call all men to acknowledge the Triune God, the final reference point for all meaning an truth.\\"Van Til: \\"Men have not done justice by the facts, by the evidence of God's presence before their eyes, unless they burst out into praise of him who has made all things.\\"Yes, the Bible reveals to humanity that the Earth hangs on nothing (Job 26:7) and is a sphere (Isaiah 40:22). Scripture declared this thousands of years before telescopes and modern science discovered those facts. God's word teaches us the proper function of the water cycle (Job 38:12-14), the existence of ocean currents (Psalms 8:8), the solar cycle, and the expansion of the universe (Isaiah 40:22) centuries before modern science found these truths. These evidential facts are consistent with the authority of the Bible. These and other evidences do not give the Bible authority; it is endued with it because it is God's word. All science, testing, and examination presuppose God and His word. Testing utilizes a number of dynamics such as logic and induction. A materialistic worldview cannot justify the existence or the use of the laws of reason. They are nonphysical and abstract dynamics that can only come from the nature of the one true God. We have certain knowledge that the God of scripture lives. We do not think He probably exists. Our faith is not just reasonable or plausible. It is impossible for the true and living God not to exist because without Him, we cannot know anything at all. He is the precondition for all knowledge. God must be presupposed as the basis of every element of mankind's experience, knowledge, and value.Herein one finds the power of evidences placed within their only possible foundation: the triune God.See:Truth, Knowledge and the Reason for God: The Defense of the Rational Assurance of Christianity------See the New Book that contends for the existence of God using moral absolutes by Mike Robinson:There Are Moral Absolutes: How to Be Absolutely Sure That Christianity Alone Supplies------or additionally see the dynamic new book refuting World Religions using Presuppositional apologetics/Covenantal Apologetics:[[\\"One Way to God: Christian Philosophy and Presuppositional Apologetics Examine World Religions\\" ASIN:1432722956]]"},{"Title":"The Educated Heart: Professional Guidelines for Massage Therapists, Bodyworkers and Movement Teachers","review":"This is the main text available to massage therapy students and practitioners that address the myriad of relationship issues that arise for professional bodyworkers. All of the complexities that can arise for bodyworkers from blurred relationship boundaries by working on friends and family, to being projected onto or countertransferrence with clients are covered. The author gives guidelines on how to maintain professional boundaries, and more importantly explains why these guidelines are given. Once the reader understands the why, any adjustments necessary can be made to the given guidelines.The information on the various phenomena and how the mind works are well explained. Massage therapists will only need this one text rather than take several counseling courses explaining neurotic mechanisms and boundaries to be able to understand what is going on in these sometimes complex situations.The author uses humor and many personal anecdotes to illustrate her points. With so many stories of what can go wrong, anyone who is using this book in an independent learning format may want to remember that not all client-therapist relationships will have these issues come up. Indeed, armed with appropriate boundaries from the beginning will keep the client-therapist relationship healthy so that physical healing can occur from the bodywork given."},{"Title":"The Educated Heart: Professional Guidelines for Massage Therapists, Bodyworkers and Movement Teachers","review":"It was very informative with many case scenarios.

As I observe my desk piled high with books and search my schedule in vain for a free hour to massage my husband, this seems like the dumbest/most insensitive thing anyone could possibly say to me.The Educated Heart deals with issues such as these: of boundaries as a massage student and how to approach people that are reluctant to pay the full price for massage therapy. In fact, this easy-to-read book is packed with insights and simple explanations of complex concepts (e.g. dual relationships, projection). If I had just one book in my massage collection, it would be this. I recommend it be required reading in every massage school."},{"Title":"The Educated Heart: Professional Guidelines for Massage Therapists, Bodyworkers and Movement Teachers","review":"This is a must read, no matter what level a practitioneris at- student, beginner, or, like me, in the field forover a dozen years. A wonderfully, sensitively writtenbook about relationship dynamics in touch therapies, from someone who truly has walked the path we are all going to walk if we are involved in touch therapies, manual therapies, bodywork,massage. I was fortunate to have some of this type oftraining , in a very good way, when in schools, but I knowvery well that it is rare, and getting more rare for schoolsto provide these important insights. I know this because I teach the graduates of those schools, and sometimes receive work from those graduates. This, to me, is much more important than simply reading about &quot;ethics&quot;, because a deeper understanding of relationship dynamics truly helps us form and understand our ethics in the first place. This is must-have insight for all schools to delve into,and provide ample training in- including the medical profession!

I was ignorant until I read this book! I can't believe how narrow my understanding was before reading. Now it all makes sense. So no I am not a massage therapist but I do touch people and work closely to them. I find that the women who become attracted to me are the ones with the worst skin problems. After getting an idea of how this can affect someone in need of not only physical relief but any type of relief I finally understood. I don't see things the same anymore.

Yes, indeed, some times have changed rather dramatically: I don't have a \\"staff\\" to worry about, for example, but anyone who has ever tried to balance a checkbook for the first time will certainly get a laugh out of Felicity's brave attempts.This book purports to show the average first year of an average middle-class couple. It is very funny and well written, and though some of it might not ring true anymore there is enough in it that is and will always be true about couplehood. This would make a good gift for a young couple just moving in with eachother, or for anyone who wants to remember the happy naivite of young love."},{"Title":"Greenery Street","review":"\\"Greenery Street\\" was hailed by PG Wodehouse as one of the most delightful books he has ever read. In researching into whether this book was worth my time, I have read almost nothing but praises for it.The story is set in the 1930s (or is it 1920s??) London and tells of a young couple's intense love and admiration for each other and their life as a newly-married couple. The setting of the story is charming, the language light and chirpy. It almost lets you believe that there is indeed a \\"happy ever after\\".Initially amused by the naivete that the young couple had, it however all becomes too tiring after a while, starting when Felicity continues to spend money thoughtlessly in spite of her being unable to balance her accounts. Keeping in mind that this was 1930s(?) London where some women were not financially savvy unlike today and where the term \\"financial planning\\" was perhaps not yet coined, I brushed aside my impatience, shook my head, chuckled and soldiered on. However, it is not only her ineptitude at financial planning but also her managing of her servants and her relationship with her petty neighbour who \\"borrows\\" step-ladders to salt spoons from her.One would have expected the head of the house, Ian, to be The Man and \\"save\\" Felicity from problems. However, his own weakness of mind gradually shows itself when he does nothing to reclaim his inheritance which had been fraudulently \\"lost\\" by his trustee. The couple's inability to run their lives is mind-boggling and beyond comprehension, even for those times. Their actions finally culminate in their servants running away. And to that, I say to the couple, \\"You deserved it\\".Although the writing is good, \\"Greenery Street\\" disappoints thoroughly due to the lack of timelessness. The couple is portrayed in too naive a manner to be believable and it smacks of discriminatory ideas, particularly towards young women (in its portrayal of Felicity). This book may have amused and attracted the attentions of PG Wodehouse and Persephone Books (especially for the latter to have re-published the book) but it fails to do the same for me. Instead of being funny with all the couple's follies, the story somehow managed to border on being offensive and insulting to one's intelligence. I would not recommend this book, unless you, like how I was at the start, are very curious to find out why exactly the great PG Wodehouse wrote such a glowing comment about the book. However, after having read the book, I still fail to see why. Unlike Mr Wodehouse, I should not like the story to continue and be tortured with having to read more (or indeed again!) about Mr & Mrs Ian Foster."},{"Title":"Angel Claw","review":"Yes, the story by Jodorowsky, instead of being one of his better surreal works, is merely an attempt to connect together a bunch of black and white drawings by Moebius that are unconnected except in theme, and, as a result, it would have been better if the publishers instead used the pages devoted to the text to print more Moebius artwork, but if you are a fan of Moebius, this is a nice collection of some great artwork printed in large a size on good quality paper. It doesn't get 5 stars because of the wasted pages."},{"Title":"Angel Claw","review":"Anyone familiar with the work of Moebius (Jean Giraud) will recall the bizarre dream logic of his classic 1970's serials 'Arzach' and 'The Airtight Garage of Jerry Cornelius'. The same idea is applied to sex in 'Angel Claw' and the result is an abortion! 'Angel Claw' is a jumble of alternately sexy or morbid images 'connected' by a story written by Alexandro Jodorowsky, Moebius' collaborator on the disappointing 'Incal' series.I can't give Moebius less than 3 stars, but this was another disappointment."},{"Title":"Angel Claw","review":"That's the name, not Joey Something.

Plus, this new one has more spare sheets of TP in the back!"},{"Title":"W. C. Privy's Original Bathroom Companion, Number 2","review":"Parents beware! This book is full af anti-Christian sentiment. The quotes are largely from atheists and focus on their most atheistic sayings. No-where are there any pro-Christian or even mildly uplifting stories. The sections on Jesus are horribly skewed and misrepresented. The section on the Secret Gospel of Mark is presented as fact substantiated by 4th century Church Fathers, when actually it is a well-known fact that the so-called \\"Secret Gospel of Mark\\" passage they refer to was a hoax perpetrated by Morton Smith in the 1980's.The sections on the alternate gospels presents them as equal to the canonical gospels when it is known historical fact accepted by all Biblical scholars that these alternate gospels were concocted over a century later than the canonical gospels by gnostics. In a stunningly inaccurate passage, the writers of this book present the Bible as having been written after 70AD from collected oral traditions, even though almost all reputable Biblical scholars date them as written between 55-65AD. In an incredibly bizarre section, they present the current theology of the Christian church as coming from an \\"unholy alliance\\" between Paul and Peter after 70AD, even though both Paul and Peter were martyred under the persecutions of Nero sometime between 65-67AD!In all, this book has a clear agenda when it comes to the Christian church, and it shows through in many sections. I would not buy this book and I would not let my children read it. Even if I were not a Christian, I would not allow my children to read this book due to its heavy-handed inaccurate representation of Christian history obviously intended to denigrate the Christian faith."},{"Title":"The Eighteenth Century: Europe 1688-1815 (Short Oxford History of Europe)","review":"It's been about a year since I read this book, but I saw the one-star rating and... it appears that we need a second opinion.This is not an introductory \\"high school\\" history textbook, or a poular narrative of the Paul Johnson style. It's a collection of essays addressing different aspects of the 18th century. You know yourself: if you need a more basic introduction to the history of this period, the one that I most heartily recommend isThe Pursuit of Glory: The Five Revolutions that Made Modern Europe: 1648-1815 (Penguin History of Europe). Another good one isEighteenth-Century Europe: Tradition and Progress, 1715-1789 (The Norton History of Modern Europe). They each have their own strengths and weaknesses, but between them you'll have a very respectable basic grasp of 18th century history.As for this book, it might well be the 3rd I'd put on your reading list!The introduction is what it is supposed to be in this sort of book: an advertisement for the essays that follow.The first essay is on politics and the state, by Julian Swann. It is concerned with big patterns rather than specific events, as is obvious from the subheadings, for instance, \\"Enlightened absolutism,\\" \\"Corporate politics,\\" \\"Representative politics,\\" and so on. It really isn't very good. It could've used a 2nd draft, but to give you an idea of why this should not be your first book on this century consider this excerpt (18): \\"That the eighteenth century is remembered for the reigns of Catherine II, Charles III, Maria Theresa, or Joseph II is due, in part, to the dedication, energy, and intelligence that they brought to the task of government. The problems of Louis XV and Louis XVI were exacerbated by the pressure they faced to follow the trail blazed by the Sun King. Both men were indecisive and shy, lacking the character required to govern. More damaging was their unwillingness to return to an alternative model of kingship perfected by Louis XIII which involved ruling through a powerful prime minister. The eighteenth century had its equivalents to Richelieu and Olivares, most strikingly the Marquis de Pombal. Dom Jose I of Portugal was not one of the contintent's more enlightened rulers, but he had the good sense to appoint the ruthless and resourceful Pombl. Even in constitutional regimes the monarch was central to the political process and Robert Walpole, William Pitt, or Lord North needed to command the allegiance of their sovereign as well as that of parliament.\\" Well, you basically already have to know what he means to figure out what he means. He's not teaching; he's making sure he covers all his bases so that he's not vulnerable to academic sniping. I'd guess he wrote this essay in a 2 or 3 day period. Still, he seems to have his facts right and if you know the history fairly well he gives you some surprising and interesting nuggets.I am giving this book 5 stars on the strength of all the other essays, and to provide some balance.The second essay, \\"Orders and classes: eighteenth-century society under pressure\\" by Christof Dipper, is better. It opens with a lovely thesis statement: \\"The society of old-regime Europe was undermined by three forces: demographic growth, capitalism, and the centralizing state.\\" It is a really insightful essay, briefly explaining how and why the nature of poverty changed over the course of the century, and how various people's attitudes to wealth and poverty changed. Then he looks at various classes (landowners, tenants, peasants, industrial workers, Jews,) in as much detail as could be squeezed into the pages. He looks at state finance and the reasons for the clash between the nobility and the state. Then, unfortunately, he stops right at 1789. Very good stuff: not a narrative of the actions of powerful men, but I think it's the single best analysis of 18th century society I've read in such a short space.Sheilagh Ogilvie wrote the third essay, which is on the economy. Her method is to state some commonly held view and mention some exceptions or modifications that need to be made to it. In the end it amounts to a very instructive account of the causes of the agricultural and industrial revolutions and the expansion of trade - why they happened in certain places at certain times, why they didn't happen in others. Again, not a narrative in the traditional sense, but a very straightforward and instructive explanation of some of the most important developments in the 18th century.The fourth essay, by Derek Beales, is on religion and culture, and it too is excellent. Now this is the area that I have the most knowledge, and if I had my 'druthers, this chapter would be at least twice as long. I absolutely cannot complain about anything in it, but I wish there were more in it, and yet I also realize that considerations of space require an author to make choices. He chose to give Rousseau proportionately more attention than I would have given the constraints, but I can't really work up a full disagreement to that. All I want to say here is, read this chapter, by all means, and then by even more means read more than this chapter. The Enlightenment, Sturm and Drang, the baroque and classical periods in music, the rococo and neo-classical periods in art, the beginning of popular novels - look, there is a lot of good stuff there! Poor Mr. Beales could only touch on this stuff, and to his credit he did not shirk the religion part of the story, for a change guys like Wesley and Alfonso de' Liguri get their share of the ink. He rightly punctures a few myths (the influence of Versailles) along the way. He does a good job with parks, coffee shops, nationalism - I mean he just crams it all in there as well as anyone could, and it's easy to follow. A great overview and introduction - so read it and then read more.The next chapter is on war, by John A. Lynn. Now you've got your narrative, your Duke of Marlborough and your Eugene of Savoy, and of course your Napoleon. He goes up through the Congress of Vienna, summarizing key battles and strategies and technologies and treaties - and it is all very easy to follow and well-explained and much too brief. Let me mention here another book I'd like to recommend:The Pursuit of Power : Technology, Armed Force and Society since A. D. 1000. Military history is a little neglected these days, I think, and that's a very good book that will put things in context from feudalism to the military-industrial complex.The penultimate chapter is on Europe and the rest of the world - that is, trade and colonialism and so on. Again it is extremely brief: the rebellion of Britain's North American colonies only gets a few sentences, because he has to talk about South America, the British conquest of India, the spice trade - even poor Captain Cook only gets half a sentence. Still, this essay is again admirably informative and thorough in its way, exactly as a good \\"short history\\" should be.The conclusion is \\"The French Revolution and Beyond\\" and it would serve quite nice as an introduction to eitherAge of Revolution and Reaction 1789-1850 (Norton History of Modern Europe)(which is so good and it saddens me to see it out of print - hopefully you can get it) which is a better introduction to the period thanThe Age of Revolution: 1789-1848, though I'd recommend reading Hobsbawm at some point because if we come prepared he usually gives us a lot to learn. I am aware of course that there exists aThe Nineteenth Century: Europe 1789-1914 (Short Oxford History of Europe), but I haven't read it. Besides the one I've reviewed here, I've read two other volumes in the \\"Short Oxford History of Europe\\" and I trust that it would be ok, but I really like the Norton History volumes."},{"Title":"The Eighteenth Century: Europe 1688-1815 (Short Oxford History of Europe)","review":"This book was poorly conceived and even more poorly written.

Despite a weak and too-lengthy opening segment on the origin of life and other awkward philosophical questions (the merits of this section are addressed by Irving/Knickerbocker in volume two), once the Dutch colonize the ancient island of Manhattoes (present-day Manhattan), Irving hits a rollicking gallop, going full stride at full speed and doesn't stop until the dubious William the Testy is vanquished at the first volume's end.\\"Diedrich Knickerbocker\\" was arguably the greatest of the several personae Irving adopted during the course of his long writing career. 'Diedrich' penned 'The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow' and 'Rip Van Winkle,' as well as short stories 'Wolfert Weber,' 'The Devil And Tom Walker,' 'Kidd The Pirate,' and 'Dolph Heyliger.' Irving achieved magic whenever he wrote, but when he steps into Knickerbocker's antique Dutch shoes, the combination of humor, history and folklore that results is unique, sweeping, and highly entertaining.Few writers could or would dare to write the kind of poetic sentances Irving/Knickerbocker could, such as \\"the inhabitants were of primitive stock, and had itermarried and bred in and in, never swarming far from the parent hive.\\"All lovers of American literature and history, and of Americana generally, should know this delightful, warm and amusing book. Too often today, when addressing the origins of American literature and our early writers, we turn to names like Hawthorne and Poe, forgetting that Irving came first and was in fact the first American writer ever to be taken seriously by Europeans. (It was Hawthorne and Poe that paid lip service to Irving, who was born a full 21 years before Hawthorne and 26 years before Poe.) Some historians and critics go so far as to credit Irving with the creation of the short story as a literary form; he was also the U.S. ambassador to Spain, a world traveler, a biographer of George Washington, and at one time requested to run for mayor of New York City (an invitation he kindly declined). Thanks largely to Irving, the New York City and Hudson River Valley areas have a thriving plethora of myth and folklore all their own. As Americans, we owe the dynamic, magnanimous and prolific Irving a great debt, which decade after decade we neglect to pay or acknowledge.Knickerbocker's History of New York is not difficult reading, though it is too advanced for children and most teenagers. However, any young adult or adult with a love of American history, particularly with an interest in the founding of our country or the American Revolution specifically, will find it fascinating. Humorists will find it a page-turning delight, and send their volumes of Twain back to the library post-haste...."},{"Title":"A history of New York: From the beginning of the world to the end of the Dutch dynasty : containing, among many surprising and curious matters, the ... that ever hath been or ever will be published","review":"In 1809 Washington Irving published \\"A History of New York,\\" the work that make him instantly famous. Conceived as a parody of Samuel L. Mitchill's guidebook \\"The Picture of New York\\" (1807), Irving's \\"History\\" purports to be written by the fictitious Diedrich Knickerbocker. It was, perhaps, the first American book to be embargoed by the publisher--that is, it was published in Philadelphia to keep its contents secret from the press in New York. Before the book was published, Irving and his friends even coordinated a hoax through the local papers, publishing a series of notices advertising Knickerbocker's inexplicable disappearance: \\"there are some reasons for believing he is not in his right mind,\\" and \\"a very curious kind of written book has been found in his room.\\"The book was such a success that Irving revised it repeatedly during his lifetime, and readers should note which edition they are purchasing. Most recent editions reprint either the original text or the last revision, which are so different that they may as well be considered different works. By the time of the Author's Revised Edition of Irving's collected works, published in 1848, Irving had completely rewritten over a tenth of the book, added about 7,000 words of new material, softened the sarcasm, eliminated the mocking references to Jefferson's presidential administration, removed many risque passages and double entendres, and polished the overall style. The barbs are more personal in the earlier edition; Irving aimed his parody more broadly forty years later. In sum, while the earlier edition was considered more scandalous--even \\"naughty\\"--and cheekier in its wit and tone, the last edition is certainly more polished and \\"mature\\"--and might be considered by many as noticeably easier to read. (The remainder of this review focuses on the 1809 edition.)The book's conceit is that the fictitious Knickerbocker, a Dutch descendant, nostalgically mourns the passing of Dutch hegemony on the island of \\"Manna-hata, Manhattoes, or as it is vulgarly called Manhattan,\\" and he offers a rousing defense (read: mock hagiography) of the Dutch governors. But Irving's satire is aimed not simply at the long-dead colonists of New York; his depictions of various Dutch leaders evoke many of his contemporaries. Thus, Wilhelmus Kleft seems an awful lot like Thomas Jefferson, and Jacobus von Poffenburgh recalls General James Wilkinson (who was caught up in Aaron Burr's allegedly treasonous schemes against Jefferson's government). The \\"hero\\" of the book, however, is Peter Stuyvesant, whose glorious qualities are manifold--even if his rule was considered authoritarian and his last act as governor was to rebel against his own king, who had ceded Manhattan to his brother, the duke of York.Irving, as Knickerbocker, also mocks the pretensions of historical scholarship. He offers philosophical justifications for the obesities of city leaders (\\"Who ever heard of fat men heading a riot?\\") and praises the well-honed Dutch civil defense against Yankee encroachments (\\"Never was a more comprehensive, a more expeditious, or, what is still better, a more economical measure devised, than this of defeating the Yankees by proclamation.\\"). He interrupts his narrative several times with admonishments to the reader or faux biographical meanderings, and, near the end of the book, he acknowledges that his tone has changed from that of a \\"crabbed cynical, impertinent little son of a Dutchman\\" to a \\"most social, companionable regard.\\" Of the many readers that began his book, \\"some dropped down dead (asleep) on the field; others threw down my book in the middle of the first chapter, took to their heels and never ceased scampering until they had fairly run it out of sight . . . Every page thinned my ranks more and more.\\"This last self-deprecatory joke is certainly the case for modern would-be readers: Irving's archaic prose can be a slog, and his historical and literary references will perplex even the most arduous. But not all the humor is dated, and quite often patient readers will be rewarded by a comment or pun that may even cause them to laugh out loud."},{"Title":"A history of New York: From the beginning of the world to the end of the Dutch dynasty : containing, among many surprising and curious matters, the ... that ever hath been or ever will be published","review":"Perhaps 100 years ago, readers considered this to be a great book.

It is touted, currently, as a Western, and on the cover of the older editions, it is said to be a love story. Turns out what it is, is a book that I plan to add to my keeper shelf, that shelf of books that ought to get 6 stars minimum, once I get a copy that stays in one piece. The glue on the spine of the 1962 paperback from Crest/Fawcett seems determined to dry out and let go of the pages.When Abraham Lincoln rolls through town, Matthew Hazard is one very, very determined boy: he's going to meet Lincoln! He does, of course, and their meeting sets Matthew's life on a path to the Arizona Territory, via West Point. Hazard's determination is one of his greatest characteristics. It brings him everything he has in his life, including his wife Laura, whose mother was none too keen on her daughter marrying a man who would drag her to the end of civilization and beyond. Their life is full of the sort of adventure that makes up the best and bravest, and the worst and saddest, in our history.The first surprise for me was that this really is a love story. And the second was that it isn't. There are several stories of couples here, and most of them are love stories, but they're more than that. Who the characters are in their relationships - romantic and otherwise - defines who they are when the chips are down, and the chips are down often out west at that time. Many, many books weave sub-stories in and out, some successfully, some predictably. A Distant Trumpet is far more successful than others.

His concentration is on the D model, the most heavily armed, but he also covers the earlier craft that preceeded the D.The book is profusely illustrated with what seems like most, if not all, of the pictures ever taken of the boats. With his encyclopedic knowledge of the vessels, many of the illustrations are commented with details of changes made to the boat after it left the factory.

This book meets that test. I had always thought of Eisenhower as a commander directing armies of conquest. This book shows him, as he is often depicted, as a Chairman of the Board, a negotiator who worked to achieve a concensus among often squabbling rivals. Caught between his subordinates and politicians who were not his direct superiors, Ike often had to walk the tightrope over a chasm of dismissal and defeat. The amateur often thinks of strategy, but this book clearly shows Ike as the professional, rationing available supplies among the dream list of targets. I find that the treatment of the coordination of moves of the Western Allied with those of the Russians introduces a whole new perspective on war planning. The sections on the closing maneuvers of the war explain in great detail the competing interests and viewpoints as the wary allies jockeyed for postwar position and tested each other's resolve.Although over eight hundred pages, David Eisenhower avoids becoming so bogged down in details as to lose the reader's interest. Although writing about his grandfather, this book is not a \\"homer.\\" While generally favorable, the doubts of some, such as Gen. Marshall, do find their way into the narrative.\\"Eisenhower At War\\" is a must for any student of Gen. Eisenhower or World War II."},{"Title":"Eisenhower: At War 1943-1945","review":"With 825 pages devoted to a period of three years, David Eisenhower, the grandson of DDE, has ample space to provide an intricate look at his grandfather at war. This book is primarily focused on the preparation and execution of Normandy through to the formal capitulation of Germany.The author, presenting the rivalries between allied generals, the political machinations of Roosevelt, Churchill and the Combined Chiefs of Staff, and the seemingly unfathomable Stalin, shows the extreme patience, diplomacy, and fortitude required of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expedition Forces, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, to win the war in Europe.Eisenhower: At War, 1943-1945, expertly dissects the relationships between allied parties while describing the utter destruction of Germany. It is thorough and frequently thrilling. Patton, Bradley, and Montgomery receive appropriate attention as does Normandy and the Ardennes offensive most commonly referred to as the Battle of the Bulge. I recommend the book highly and rate it an enthusiastic 4 stars."},{"Title":"Eisenhower: At War 1943-1945","review":"This is the first part of what David Eisenhower's intended political biography of his grandfather. The main thrust of the book is how Eisenhower's decisions in WW II were made, and the tensions that existed in the USA/British alliance during the war. The Anvil/Dragoon controversy is given full length because it was one of the most contended points of the allaince. The fighting of the war is distinctly in the background. It isn't clear to me how much personal analysis David Eisenhower put into the fighting aspect of the book. In a number of places it seems that he relys on the historians. Because of this, I think that it is important to keep in mind that this probably isn't an important book in terms of military history, even though it is very important in terms of understanding the political aspects of the war. Almost all the other books on WW II ignore the political aspects."},{"Title":"Eisenhower: At War 1943-1945","review":"grandpa. I've been meaning to read At War for some time specifically to to get David Eisenhower's perpective. It's a perpective most historians would kill for. As a kid David had the run of the White House. The familiarity he gained from comtemporaries of his grandfather-generals, aides, heads of state, friends &amp; even other historians was invaluable. His admits this. The book look daunting at first glance, but is quite readable &amp; I was able to stay with it for hours at a time. ha-mevaker is correct. This is a political rather than a military view of the war in Europe. Military matters are of course the backdrop for the political intrigues Ike is subjected to. The personal stories are appreciated &amp; humanize the whole horrible war: The young private from Abeliene simply walking up to Eisenhower&quot;s H.Q. &amp; demanding of the guard to see Ike. He got his audience with the general as well as a signed note as proof to his buddies. The book is peppered with little stories like that. The Eisenhower-Montgomery feud is covered extensively. Surprisingly, David is more even handed &amp; perhaps more understanding of Monty's motives than other American historians have been. By D-Day Britain was finished. She was bankrupted, &amp; would never regain her former glory. Montgomery knew this well. The men lost could not be replaced. Yet he wanted one last moment in the sun for Great Britain, that of a spearhead into Germany &amp; the capture of Berlin by the English (&amp; himself). In this plan he was over-ruled by Eisenhower, his superior, a general with no battlefield experience. He was a great patriot &amp; it galled him that by this point the British Empire was the junior partner in the U.S./British alliance. Churchill was proponent a defeating Germany thru Italy &amp; did not support the Normandy invasion. He experienced the carnage of World War I trench warfare feared a repeat if a frontal assault was attempted. Eisenhower greatest strength was he wasn't fighting the last war as many of the people around him were. He was fighting the war he had before him &amp; he did it quite well."},{"Title":"Eisenhower: At War 1943-1945","review":"This book about Dwight D. Eisenhower's command over the Allied European Forces in World War II is unique to all others on the same topic. For the author is the grandson and namesake of that very commander*. David Eisenhower began working on his book during the Watergate controversy that brought down the presidency of his father-in-law, President Richard M. Nixon. To the younger Eisenhower, the work was a form of escapism from the problems of their facing. However, originally his book was going to be about the second term of grandfather's presidency because those both were happier memories and a fascinating time in the nation's history. As he begun to work however, he found himself in the position of an old historian's clich&eacute;. That is \`never ask a historian for a little bit of background,' because more often than not you end up with a larger story than you had originally asked for. Every time David Eisenhower went to describe an event in the second term, he found himself having to go back and explain the events the first. Moreover, as explained the events of the first, he found himself going back all the way to the war to provide the details that he wanted. So as a result, instead of writing a book about the second term he decided to write one about the war.The book focuses on the planning and execution of \`Operation: Overlord.' Overlord was the plan of invasion of Normandy and the crusade in Europe. The book, in the first three chapters, deals with the planning, events, and atmosphere leading up to D-Day. The rest of the book deals with the war until V-E day. The book contains descriptions of battles, charts, and photographs form the events. However, that is not what I personally found to be the most fascinating part of the book. To me, what make this book a good read was where the grandson could tell stories of events only a few people would have been privy to.\\"In the next several days the Eisenhowers spent the late afternoon and evening with guests at Telegraph Cottage. There were reunions with \`Uncle Everett' Hughes and Patton over dinners that John's father cooked in a tall chef's hat on the new patio behind the glassed-in porch, followed be serious after-dinner bridge games attended by hosts of orderlies. John had noted that a slight \`military barrier' had grown up between father and son. During a twilight stroll through the woods behind the five-acre Telegraph Cottage compound, John, walking to his father's left, posed a question. \`If we should meet an officer who ranks above me and below you, how do we handle this? Do I salute first, and when he returns my salute, do you return his?' John knew he raised an unresolved point of Army protocol which his father sidestepped with a smile. \`John, there isn't an officer in this theater who doesn't rank above you and below me.'\\" p.299Those kinds of personnel touches between a father and son that could only be retold by a family member are some of the best parts of this work. My all-time favorite happens to involve the pervious King of England.\\"The King, afflicted by ill health since youth, was notoriously quiet and shy was hampered by a speech impediment. According to a story told by staff members, the King and Eisenhower in Tunisia had once ridden together in a jeep for several hours in complete silence. On the twenty-sixth, however, King George was gregarious. Over lunch, served buffet style in an upstairs apartment, the three reminisced. The Queen told Eisenhower for the first time about something that had happened on his tour of Windsor Castle two years before. As it turned out, the guide, Colonel Sterling, had forgotten to that the King and Queen were on the grounds. The couple were sipping tea in the garden when they suddenly heard Sterling, Eisenhower, and Clark approaching. The royal couple had not wanted to intrude, so they knelt on their hands and knees behind the hedge until the Americans had walked by. Now the three shared a laugh.\\" p.237The very idea of the King and Queen hiding behind a bush is very amusing. It is personnel information like that, which makes this book very enjoyable. I am sure that anyone who gives this book his or her time will enjoy it as well.*Dwight D. Eisenhower was born \`David Dwight' but his mother reversed first and middle names. Later his grandson was named Dwight David Eisenhower II, but answers to David. Camp David is named after the author."},{"Title":"Eisenhower: At War 1943-1945","review":"I gave this book only 4 stars because of its use of hundreds of names,places,and unit numbers,ect. I wish I could have had a huge map of Europe, with uniformed players to move army units around and listen to an audio version. The book did educate me on a lot if mysteries of WWII. For instance why we had Russia as an ally. Turns out that we didn't like them anymore before the war than after the war, we just happened to be fighting the Germans at the same time. One gains a whole lot of respect for Ike during this war. He has to handle his own Generals and the British and French Generals, but also has to make Washington, London, France, and Russia happy at the same time. He sticks out his neck several times when he can't get answers from his superiors. After reading this book I believe that Ike should go down in history as our greatest General and maybe the worlds greatest. David Eisenhower wrote of several controversial decision that Ike made and gave thorough explanation of why they were the right decision or we may never know. I was impressed by the fact that David never mentioned his family ties until the end of the book when he refers to John Eisenhower as his father. I believe that David gives a very unbiased view of Ike and lets the facts speak for them selves. This book is a must to anybody who has an interest in WWII or would like to know how great people handle great decisions."},{"Title":"Eisenhower: At War 1943-1945","review":"Eisenhower at War reviews the 18 months that Dwight Eisenhower served as Supreme Allied Commander with the intent to view the war as Eisenhower lived it. Unlike most history books, which emphasize what happened, David Eisenhower focuses attention on the competing positions and options that General Eisenhower had to resolve in commanding the Allied armed forces.As stated in the Introduction (page xix), the book concentrates on the political aspects of Eisenhower's job because it was a major and inseparable component of his unique and complex command. Each nation, each branch of the service, and each leading general and admiral had different views and interests as to how the war should be fought and won. Eisenhower had to negotiate and reconcile these differences. They were numerous and complicated and went far beyond Charles de Gaulle and General Montgomery. The book is an excellent dissertation of the restrictions and limits of power.Another aspect of this book is the often-overlooked interdependence of the Russian and Western fronts, which was a major concern for General Eisenhower because without a resurgent Russian front, an Allied invasion of Europe would have been impossible. (Introduction, page xii). Yet Eisenhower had to deal with this interdependence with little direct communication with the Soviets.I recommend this book to readers interested in either World War II or the heavy demands of executive responsibility."},{"Title":"American and European Hand Weaving Revised","review":"american and european hand weaving revisedhelen louise allencontentsflat surface plain weaveplain weave with added design threadsopen work weavesdesign methods using 4 harness loomstapestry typesindian weavespattern weavesother hand loom weaveslooms and their manipulationsprimitive loomsloom typeswarpingthreadingsleyingbibliographyhelen louise allen was an assistant professor of related art at the university of wisconsin.

However, this book not only doesn't measure up to the first three, it is simply poorly written. In more than a few places in the text the characters refer to the events in exactly the same words as the author himself, not a dozen lines before. Usually economical writing style of Saberhagen deteriorates to the level of a comics book. The story itself has nothing of the grand scale of the First Swords setting - having read these back to back you are bound to have an attack of claustrophobia. Instead it centers on the recovery of the stolen Sword with all usual trimmings of the Sherlock Holmes story, sans the thrill. Moreover, the Magistrate himself looks like a homage (or a rip-off) to the venerable creation of Sir Conan Doyle, with Dr. Kasimir filling the niche of his sidekick, Dr. Watson. Injection of utterly modern political twist in the form of some Steppe democrat (imprisoned for his attempt to institute local councils in his native prairies) makes the entire novel even less readable. &quot;Clues&quot; are so plain and abundant, that the only way to make this book more predictable would be to put the last chapter in the beginning of it... Overall, it's a hastily written (and apparently never proof-read) bad political whodunit which just happens to have a Sword in it."},{"Title":"The Third Book of Lost Swords: Stonecutter's Story","review":"Saberhagen's lost swords novels are more like episodes in a universe, without being intricately tied together plot-wise (for the most part) but while maintaining a certain style. This book departs from most of the others in having a brand new cast of characters who must solve a mystery regarding the theft of the sword Stonecutter, which was on loan to a prince from Prince Mark of Tasavalta. A thoroughly Sherlock Holmes reminiscent story of fantasy intrigue (It does not approach thriller territory), it is for the most part a book of light fantasy, but an enjoyable one if you're looking for something easy to read and fun.I've never understood the generally low ratings for these books on Amazon. They certainly aren't Tolkien, but they have a solid premise and the stories are handled competently by Saberhagen."},{"Title":"The Third Book of Lost Swords: Stonecutter's Story","review":"This was a swell book.

If I understand correctly, this novel (first in a trilogy) takes place as the humans are beginning their revolt against the machines. This current Dune story is written in the same style as the last trilogy introduced by Brian and Kevin. As stated before (and I'm sure will be repeated by many people other than myself), Brain and Kevin cannot capture the dynamics of what Frank attempted to create. Yes, it is set quite a distance away from the original Dune series, but it isn't written with the same intellectual dialogue presented by Frank. The story is interesting, and worth the read. However, I think you will find that the time span encompassed in the book seem un-realistically short. Events seem to happen too quickly, and it will become clear in the end. Though, I did find the end of the book filled with better dialogue compared to the beginning."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I never finished this book. I didn't want any more of this execrable nonsense trapped in my head tainting and diminishing the intricate and fascinating universe Frank Herbert created in the Dune series. (I won't write \\"the original Dune series,\\" because there is only one Dune series--in my mind these prequels are nothing more than brainless fan fiction.) Sociopathic killer robots, Dr. Evil-esque artificial intelligences, tyrannical super-cyborgs, simplistic and ridiculous origins for plot points in Dune and its sequels? Just unforgivably stupid stuff.\\"Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind\\" has always suggested a back story of inexplicable and subtle complexity to me. I'd seen it as maybe a psychological and sociological conflict resulting from a sort of mass dissociative identity disorder (like the cultural fugue in Delany's Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand) that explode in a war that engulfs all of humanity. In psychology, a fugue is characterized by breakdowns of memory, conscious awareness, identity and perception. It can cause intense conflict and suicidal or aggressive impulses. In Delany's book, whole worlds self destruct when they enter a state of mass fugue. I'd always figured the Butlerian jihad had resulted from a similar phenomenon--that the permeation of the human mind and culture with machine intelligence had caused humanity to become dangerously dissociated from it's innate humanness. I'd imagined the parties in the war were those who recognized the threat and those who embraced the status quo, unable to perceive the catastrophe looming.But no, instead we've got a book here that reads like the novelization of a cartoon based on a video game based on a bad comic book.

Yet we know from the previous Dune novels (set long after this one) that Xavier is the first of the evil Harkonens, a man who betrayed Vor Atreides at the Battle of Corrin and set the feud between the two families in motion, so we know how this plot is going to go!Meanwhile Vor Atreides, we learn, is the (so-far) human son of Agammemnon, the leader of the evil machines. Vor is being groomed to become a Cymeck someday. His meeting with Serena Butler changes things, along with the path of all humanity.

The only reason why I'm reading these prequels of the prequels penned by hacks Brian Herbert (Frank's son) and Kevin J. Anderson is because my mom insists that I do.TBJ sets up the reasons behind the Butlerian Jihad, a violent, religious uprising against the thinking machines who have enslaved countless worlds committing obscene atrocities against humanity.TBJ, like the first set of prequels, lacks the depth of character and storyline that the original Dune books have. The short chapters reminds one of a poor episodic television programming attempt. Whatever."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I have read the majority of the frank herbert dune series and all of the prequels his son wrote and I have to be honest. With the exception of the ORIGINAL BOOK this is the best work in the entire series. Why? Well it starts off with a bang and has a ton of great action sequences, explores some great concepts, faces some cruel truths about human nature and provides an amazing foundation for the Dune Universe. The writer lacks confidence, and uses flakey words in his narrative throughout the piece, but looking past this it's a much better book than the other reviews make it out to be. Lets face facts, starting with Dune Messiah and getting worse with every subsequent installment the Dune series became so unapologetically and uncontrolably esoteric that story, character development, and the fate of the most original universe in science fiction had to be devined through pages and pages of philosophy. I love the series but seriously folks, the later dune books are little more than platonic dialogs with science fiction settings. They were as profound as aristotle but not quite as much fun to read and just not accessible at all.The Butlerian Jihad takes place ten thousand years prior to the first novel and presents familliar science fiction territory. Like the rest of the books it tells the story of post utopian humanity. Utopia made us lazy, serviced by robots we lived long luxurious lives free of challenge and slipped into a malaise that was transformed into enslavement at the hands of men with machines. A common Scifi theme I know, but this book handles the subject deftly, using an extended meditation on slavery as a central them that links the machine and man made realities. It's a bit contrived how every element of the dune universe is introduced at the same time; but this book handles the difficult task of telling a compelling human story and establishing the incredibly original universe the series takes place in.I saw this book bashed in the customer reviews and had to speak up for it. It's not great literature by any means, but it's immensely entertaining and accessible. It would make a blazing film and I couldn't get the images it conjured out of my mind. Massive space battles, terrifying cyborg's, homocidal robots, and iconographic pseudo-religious images that burn into your subconcious. Just go and read the first few pages of the book and you'll see if you want to read it or not. All I wanted was some good mindless scifi to chew on for a while and this book did the deed far in excess of my expectations. The second one is good as well but doesn't stand alone, I am excited for the conclusion."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I have to disagree with the negative reviews.

If you are a Dune fan, I would definitely pick this up."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Inconsistent with many ideas of the original Dune books.

The story and attention to detail was horrible. The book read like a 600 page introduction in which every piece of the action was totally predictable. There was not even a hint of the plot complexities usually associated with Frank Herbert's Dune books. The three prequels where masterpieces next to this book.The only highlight of the whole thing is reading about the origins of what will be the Dune universe. ...I thought the other three Dune novels by Brian Herbert and Anderson were pretty worthy prequels. &quot;The Butlerian Jihad,&quot; by contrast, misses the mark completely. I rarely give only one star to a book that I have actually finished, but this one will be an exception. ......"},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson's newest spinoff of Frank Herberts masterpiece of imagination can only be labelled &quot;Very disappointing&quot;.As a great fan of the original six Dune novels I harboured great reservations when I read about Brian Herbert and Kevin Andersons prequels to Dune project, and my worst fears were justified. The Dune prequels were not up to anything resembling old Herberts novells. The fact that they were written in a prose and style entirely different from Herberts original novels were not neccessarily a bad thing. After all, Frank Herberts prose is difficult to emulate and it also had its weaknesses, often being obscure and confusing. Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson wrote the prequels in their own style...ok fine, but unfortunately it was quite clear from the beginning that the audiens they targetted their novels for were different from Frank Herberts. Theirs was clearly an audiens of teenage readers and this certainly affected the whole prequel stories, characters and dialogues, and not for the better. The prequels were clearly inferior to the original Dune books, but at least there were some occasional highpoints. The Butlerian Jihad, however has none of these. It is written in a childish prose, which is ripe with total misconceptionsof the Duniverse. It is unfortunately very, very apparent that Kevin Anderson has done his trade earlier, by writing spinoffs of George Lucas Star Wars universe. The Butlerian Jihad's is brimming with Star Wars concepts. The Sorceress of Rossak and The Bene Gesserit in the prequels are clearly influenced by Jedi and the force, and bear no resemblance to the originals described by Frank Herbert. The characters and their motives are totally cliche and the dialogue even more so. Herberts and Andersons understanding of Artifical Intelligence and their description of &quot;Thinking Machines&quot; are so ridiculous and &quot;droidlike&quot; as to be absurd. After reading &quot;The Butlerian Jihad&quot; one can only come to the conclusion that the authors has used a computer program which is capable of automatically generating a Science Fiction story from a few preset parameters, a program earlier being used for Star Wars stories. Replace all jedi with Sorceress of Rossak, replace all Bantas with Sandworms, replace Tattoine with Arrakis, etc.It is true what they say, Hollywood can rewritte even the best book/manus into crap and the big entertainment medias and publishers can ruin the best ideas. Brian Herbert and Andersons works seems more to be based on the desire for cold cash by ridding on a wave of Dune popularity, than by genuine respect for Frank Herberts original works. Even if you liked the prequels (and if you are a true Dune fan you most likely did'nt) you will probably be disappointed by The Butlerian Jihad. Read some decent Science Fiction instead...Read Old Herberts books, Haldeman, Asimov, Ian M. Banks, Kim Stanley Robinsson, Arthur C. Clarke, Peter F. Hamilton or a lot of other &quot;great&quot; authors, but avoid this juvenile nonsense."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Please, save your money.

The complex plans within plans within plans that his father would weave set the bar pretty high and Brian falls short in every single instance. The Butlerian Jihad was an ok story, it was pretty forumlaric and typical of a standard writer, there were few twists and fewer surprises but there was something endearing about the book to me. Perhaps it was always wanting to know the back stories of so many of the important characters of Dune.

They all did things that anyone with the smallest shred of common sense would not. They do things that are clearly intended to effect you emotionally, to make you love or hate them, but the actions are so blatantly just that and not how a real person would act, that you stop and say \\"That makes no sense\\" instead of feeling what the authors' intended.The universe built up the authors is annoyingly inconsistent. One moment the Robot's are watching everyone's most minute moves and meting out brutal punishment. The next people are sneaking weapons (and where did they come from anyway) into the most unlikely spots right under the robot's noses (olfactory sensors?).The book has its funny moments. For example, authors' grasp of how mathematics works and how it fits with engineering and science was so poor as to be laughable.

It &quot;delivers&quot; that in a leaden style, with obvious plot lines, stilted dialogue, and a really boring story. And, as we find out only when we buy (or borrow) the book, it's really the first of a new three-book prequel series. Thanks, Kevin and Brian, but no thanks. I bought this book and read it.

I am not one of those. I found the latter books of the series to be some of the worst books I have ever read. I actually found the prequels to be entertaining as well.One main problem I had with the three prequels written previously was that they really shouldn't have been written. Though I enjoyed them, they had that profit-taking tinge to it. This series, however, needed to be written. Throughout the whole series, there were constant, constant references to the Butlerian Jihad. This jihad seemed to define a big chunk of the Dune, and for me, was a constant source of wonder.This book starts off this new series by describing the beginning of an epic war between robots and humans. Not only does it help define this struggle, the elements of the dune series begin to develop. The origins of Mentats, Bene Gessarit, Spice, Fremen, Wormriding, the animosity between Harkonnen and Artriedes, and what happened to Earth, are all started here. It's a great way to understand and appreciate the original Dune.This book revolves around Xavier Harkonnen and Serena Butler. In an interesting and likeable twist, Harkonnen is considered a great hero, and serves humanity, while Vorian Artriedes starts off as evil person bent on destroying humanity. This books describes and chronicles three different sets of planets. The computer controlled planets, the aligned planets fighting them, and the unalighned planets of humans. This describes the origins of the computer \\"Evermind\\" that controls the robot planets, and the cymeks (human brains, robotic bodies) who work under it. It then starts off with battles. Though the dialogue between robots and other robots is a bit weird, and the start of the revolution is a bit contrived, it still does not take away from the action filled and very informative nature of this book.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who felt cheated with Frank Herbert's last four Dune novels and his philosophical rants, and wanted to return to the world of Dune. This books if fun and a true page-turner."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Well, I confess first - I do NOT love all of Frank Herbert's Dune books. In fact. after Children of Dune, I find them very plodding and pathetic, the work of a man who obviously stretched a trilogy into much more than he could handle. I DID like the prequel \\"House\\" books, simply based on entertainment value (despite the obvious consistency issues and the weak ending).That being said, this might be the worst of all of them. \\"The Butlerian Jihad\\" neither retains the unique vision found in the first three F. Herbert books, nor the outlandish beach-read entertainment of the B. Herbert trilogy. I won't embarass anyone with a plot summary - there is no plot of which to speak.

No, it wasn't Frank Herbert. His writing style is unique. But after reading this, I went back to the original series and read it for references to the Jihad. There are hardly ANY. I think Kevin and Brian did a great job of portraying the Old Empire, and the thinking machines.I loved the twist of history's losing track of who the Atreides were actually related to, and that history is often wrong. Doesn't anyone remember was Leto II said about history? It was never what we think it should have been like, and the people that disliked this book already had a preconcieved notion of what it should have been.

Will reserve full judgement until I read the next two in this trilogy."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"When I saw the movie for the first movie of The Lord of the Rings, I expected little and was unduly impressed. Somehow, I am unable make that mindset with books. Frank Herbert created a complex universe with intricate story lines. His son and Mr. Anderson do not emulate his style, which is fine. However, they take grandiose liberties with their characters. To be blunt, they have too many heroes. Almost every character seems mythical in their own time. This is in large part because they are tackling the difficult prequel. The Star Wars saga is seeing the same difficulty. It is extremely difficult to create surprises when the audience knows what happens in the long run. My hope is that Mr. Herbert and Mr. Anderson are using these books as a means to perfecting a writing technique for the final book in the Dune series."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I almost shelled out [money] for this, instead of waiting to check out a copy at the library. I'm glad I waited. Mostly disappointing. It started losing credibility when the robots and thinking machines were described as nonemotional, logical and unable to understand humans. Intelligent machines created by human beings will probably resemble human beings (see Hofstaders \\"Godel, Escher, Bach\\"). Erasmus was nasty, but not at all believable. The Titans were ridiculous. The sorceress of Rossak who is a main character is wooden in her obsessiveness. The only particularly interesting part of this book was the sections which describe the Zensunni on Arrakis. If you must read this book, wait for a copy at your library. Then dig out your copy of \\"Dune\\" and reread it, and the \\"Dune Encyclopedia\\" if you have it. Much more interesting."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Plain and simple this is a very entertaining book. I haven't read the other three prequels, but comparing this book to the original Dune series is ridiculus. These two writers aren't and don't even come close to Frank Herbert. However this book does have its own qualities. This is a book made for a larger audience, but a serious Dune fan can find a way to appreciate what it adds to the Herbert Universe. Interesting Points: two charaters who seem to be the first Harkonnen and Atreides as we know them, introduction of spice to the empire, history of Fremen mythos, Holtzman technology, among others."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Well, it's an engaging story and difficult to put the book down. Although I missed how Father Frank plumbed the depths with his character development and his ecological philosophy... I'm still glad that Son Brian isn't trying to be the father. He and Anderson are doing it their own way, which I think is cool.I'm sure that fans will be vexed by lots of contradictions and discontinuities; such as how do the characters jaunt around the universe in trips that don't seem to take longer than a month without The Spice, when 10,000 years later poor Emperor Saddam is humiliated because there won't be an Empire without it?Trying to figure out this kind of stuff might take away the fun, which is what I'm there for, not waiting for everything to be explained to me. Some things may never be answered, but I don't care. Can't wait to read the next book in the series, and can't wait to see what they do with Father Frank's notes on post-Chapterhouse Dune!"},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"This prequel, set nearly 12,000 years before the pivotal events of the original Dune, is an entertaining \`what if' novel, which traces the origins of the Arrakis universe. I first read excerpts from Frank Herbert's classic novel in Astounding Science Fiction and have been intrigued ever since by the vision of the future that he elaborated. Still, Herbert's final three novels were convoluted and confused, with no clear resolution offered for the reader about why humanity was endangered and what the solution would be.The Butlerian Jihad offers the authors and readers a chance to flesh out how the different components of Dune were formed. It allows both to move beyond the parameters of Herbert's novels and offers a richer vision. After the initial set-up, the novel moves at a strong pace until the slam-bang finale, which is reminiscent of the conclusion for House Corrino.I had always speculated that the Butlerian Jihad was a mindless neo-Luddite response against high technology. Instead, the novel, which unfolds 10,000 to 15,000 in our future, offers, a quite sophisticated version. Humanity, firmly believing in the positive effects of new technology, becomes increasingly listless and mundane, leaving tasks to be carried out by robotic machines. A small group of human rebels attempt to exploit this through a revolt and then establishing themselves as neo-cyborg rulers, human brains encased in machines. But computers quickly outmanoeuvre them and the new \`evermind,' Omnius, takes over for a millennium, enslaving cyborgs and humans alike. The novel starts when Omnium has decided on a \`final solution' against humans, and a war to the finish unfolds. Unlike other reviewers I will not spoil the plot line further.This plot has parallels: the Foundation series of Isaac Asimov and the Galactic Centre series of Gregory Benford. For me, the novel worked quite well as it sets up the varied plot-lines of individual struggles/suffering against a background of horrific slaughter. Most of the characters are effective, although few are yet fleshed out sufficiently. The prose style is like the original novel, not the wheels-within-wheels-within-wheels of the later works. The major weakness of the series remains Kevin Anderson's sections, which you will notice offer pedestrian prose and caricature-like personalities.All in all, a good read to be enjoyed and I look forward to The Machine Crusade next year."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I will start this out by saying that this is the first Dune book I've read, so I'm not comparing it to Frank Herbert's work.For simplicity's sake I'll do this in pro/con format:Pros:An exciting story, lots of colorful characters and plot.Lots of action - blowing up robots and other fun stuff like that.There were a few unexpected plot twists.Cons:While the story was fun to read, it was fairly predictable.Characters were weak, especially the bad guys. Erasmus in particular - he is so \\"evil\\" it almost becomes cartoonish.Parts of the plot seemed contrived.There were too many individual storylines, many of which aren't necessary to the story (I'm guessing that they will be later on in the series).So the bottom line is, if you want an action story with some depth to it then this is for you. However if you're seeking a thought-provoking classic look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I have not read the original &quot;Dune&quot; yet.

If you begin with this expectation, then the book is at least a tolerable work of action-adventure science fiction. However, if you read expecting the complexity and depth of Frank H.'s original series you will leave with a foul taste in your mouth. Anyone who has read Brian's original House series will understand the difference and can decide to read or abstain accordingly.Despite its many shortfalls, all but the most intolerant and zealous Dune readers (some of whom here appear to propose their own bloody Jihad in opposition to Brian Herbert's Dune works) should find this latest installment mildly satiating. After all, this is the only new source of new Dune works that we have for now. Re-reading the original, however, is always an option.Several aspects of this book, however, were incredibly maddening (spoilers may follow). For example: the Bene Gesserit, spice use/trade, heiligners, folding space, glow globes and other staples of Dune all appear to have their origins among a single family (father, mother, daughter) inhabiting this book. The various space and planetary battles, as they often are in both traditional and neo-Dune books, are rather silly affairs which seem to last only a few hours in most cases despite their dramatic scope. And after 20,000 years, before and after the setting of this book, the most fearsome weapons in any arsenal are still the dreaded atomics. I guess the League needs to devote more than two scientists out of the billions of people in the universe to research and develop new weapons. Simultaneously, the most dreaded thinking machine weapons are those staples of the First World War: flame throwers, poison gas, and cold steel (various cymek appendages). I guess the ancient technology of precision guided munitions was lost in the mists of time.So, what's a reader to do? Relax, try to set aside the many problems with the book and attempt to enjoy yourself. Hate the bad robots, cheer for the valiant humans, and try not to take things too seriously.

The authors would waste couple pages to get a point across when it should be done in couple of paragraphs. The book moves slowly at times and some of the characters' motives are not clear. I mean, why would cymek father allowed his human son other sources of information that directly conflict with his own. And why would that son so readily accepted such views after lifetime of believing in what he was taught. However to add that concept of machine overlord is rather an old one thus making the book feel bit like a retread.But on the other hand, some parts of the book did proves to be nicely done.

Dune has several main characters because during the book the point of view changes from person to person and from first to third person. Some of the Characters include the following: Salem Wormrider, the heart struck Officer, the beloved princess, the son of the cyborg, and the cyborgs Barbarossa and Juno. During the books is a Great War between planets and species. The two main species are the humans and cyborgs. Cyborgs have human brains, but huge mechanical bodies of doom. This sci-fi relates back to star wars. With jets and giant warships flying in space and over planets. Wars with different weapons break out, like the revolt of enslaved humans, the psychic blasts of psychic energy, the misunderstood genius, and of course the large lasers and weapons of mass destruction. Humans are not only enslaved by cyborgs, but by other humans also. This book is great, I loved it. If you had a choice to live, but let the universe go up in flames, or die and save the universe. You make the choice in Dune."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"This book is writtin in the spirit of the original Dune series, but it is lacking the profundity and complexity of the original. It is an entertaining read, but I am left wondering if I'd be nearly as engrossed if I wasn't already a fan of the Dune universe. Definitely worth reading, but don't expect to be nearly as challenged as you would be by any of the Dune books written by Frank Herbert himself."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Dune: The Butlerian Jihan is almost a mess. Unlike the &quot;House:...&quot; series of Dune novels, really wonderful books that though interconnected were perfectly satisfying on their own, Dune:TBJ seems to be an endless introduction of characters, subplots, possible motivations and ominous foreshadowings. If the authors had simply kept to the introductions with relevant pieces of historical details, this novel would have felt a good deal less tedious. Instead the overwhelming desire to create a &quot;plot line&quot; results an infuriatingly simplistic story with largely unsympathetic characters and a rather rushed, not to mention pointedly predictable, ending. Maybe book publishers should take a tip from movie producers who test market films with alternative endings. Or may be, and what is more to the point, Herbert and Anderson should immediately enter into negotiations with the Sci-Fi Channel to create Dune:TBJ the series. I suspect that television writers, producers, not to mention actors and special effects wizards could create a far more compelling entertainment than a novel that felt derivative, rushed and relied entirely too much on the kindness of its pre-sold legions of fans and prospective readers. A poor effort, at best."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Once again I am amazed at the fine job Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson have done with this series of prequels to the classic \\"Dune\\". The latest trilogy goes back a thousand years further and shows a lot of the religious and political history that lead to the world depicted in the classic novel. It is one of those books you just don't want put down. It is a battle fought for mankind's freedom, against computers, and Cymeks (which are machines which human minds.) This book touches upon where the hatred between the Harkonnens's and the Atreides originated from which I guess is going to be over a girl. With a new twist which I liked, a Harkonnen is the good guy in this story and an Atreides is one of the bad guys. (The Atreides is too naive to know he is fighting for the wrong side.) Agamemnon who is a cymek general and the father of Vorian Atreides reminded me in ways of Darth Vadar trying to corrupt his son over to the dark side to follow in his foot steps. I must also admit that the first line I heard one of the cymeks (who were twenty titans which ruled the world before the computers took over) make, reminded me of the \\"Borg\\" from Star Trek, but I'm glad to say that from then on the similarities ended. (I'm also not sure if the characters name Vorian, known through out the book as Vor is a tribute to Lois McMaster Bujold's Vor novels which are also very good by the way.) The \\"Omnius\\" computer who is the head of the computer world is a decent character, but the computer Erasmus who is trying to understand humanity is very interesting, even if he does remind you of an evil mentat. Insights are also gained into the beginnings of the new Empire, the inventor Tio Holtzman and his shields, the original Suk doctor, the beginnings of the Bene Gesserit sisterhood, spice trading on Arrakis, worm riding, and the Bene Tlulax. This novel may also be used to set up several future story lines which could come into play after \\"Chapter House Dune\\" to move the series forward instead of the backwards direction it has been heading in. I can't wait for the next one in this new series to come out."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I can't find anything majorly wrong with this account of The Butlerian Jihad. As far as I can tell, the events don't conflict with anything Frank Herbert has written previously. Remember that all Frank laid out for us ahead of time were the dates of the Jihad and the Battle of Corrin. It seems clear that the trilogy will have to span 2-3 generations in order to fit in with these dates (although Vorian Atreides could conceivably last through all three books).The only thing that might be the least little bit wrong may be with the nuclear bombardment of Earth. According to the Appendices of Dune, the CET met on a neutral island of old Earth in order to compile the Orange Catholic Bible. But this is an event that takes place after the Battle of Corrin, so maybe the Earth's been cleaned up by that time...maybe....I have to admit being more attracted to the accounts given in the Dune Encyclopedia for events preceding the original novels. But even that work, good though it is, has a few internal inconsistencies. I'm enjoying Brian and Kevin's alternative view of Dune's prehistory in the meantime."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I've been reading the Dune series for years, and I have to say that after the first few books, they had been going downhill. The last of Frank's books, \\"Chapterhouse Dune\\" was particularily awful (enough with Duncan Idaho!!!), and though I was skeptical of the prelude series (House Atreides, Harkonnen, Corrino), I have found them nearly as good as the first books in the series, and FAR better than the last.With the Butlerian Jihad, Anderson and Herbert have once again done a wonderful job in emersing the reader into the Dune universe with the same writing style, but NOT limiting themselves to some of the annoying quirks that the original author had (no more Duncan Idaho, and no more blatant Coldwar ripoffs!).With two more books in the trilogy, and a few hints at a concluding book to be the sequel to Chapterhouse, anyone who is even remotely interested in Dune MUST read this book... trust me, it's even worth wading through Chapterhouse again, just to understand some of the finer points!In conclusion, though the book may not be completely faithful to Frank's vision, in my opinion, it is BETTER, as I believe that the series had been deteriorating rapidly. Here's wishing long life to Kevin Anderson and Brian Herbert!"},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"This is not a shoddy start to an original series set in Frank Herbert's (FH) \\"Dune\\" universe. In fact, \\"The Butlerian Jihad\\" (TBJ) is actually a good non-FH \\"Dune\\" book, so help me. As context, note that I am a longtime classic-\\"Dune\\" series fan, but that I stop short of being an outright purist, if only by the slimmest margin. The union of Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson has been a hit-and-miss affair so far, but this book definitely is one of their successes.In the universe of TBJ, mankind has long since mastered the secrets of interstellar travel. Humanity has completed its galactic diaspora only to witness the deterioration of its magnificent Empire at the hands of the sadistic Titans, power-mad opportunists who crave absolute control. These Titans are a group of iron-fisted individuals who took advantage of the Old Empire's lax vigilance, overthrowing the old rulers and installing themselves in power in their place. Lovers of violence, hedonistic delights, dominion, and atrocity, the Titans feared that Death's cold touch would bring their magnificent totalitarian society to an early end. They thus opted for a permanent solution: the transfer of their brains into life-support modules which could be connected to any number of suitable \\"host\\" robotic bodies. Feeling satisfaction at their newfound immortality, these overlords, now known as \\"cymeks,\\" themselves became complacent. Within a century, they witness the end of their era of dominion with the rise of an artificial-intelligence despot known as the computer Evermind.Free humanity still endures in a loose confederation known as \\"The League of Nobles,\\" an aggregate of solar systems with Salusa Secundus as capital planet. The Evermind and the League of Nobles have coexisted in a state of armed peace for centuries, neither side making significant inroads against their opponent. The book opens with a furious robotic attack on the city of Zymia, capital city of Salusa Secundus. A gigantic fleet has swept away the human patrol craft on the system's perimeter, and is now on an intercept course with the planet itself. Xavier Harkonnen, an officer of the League of Nobles armed forces, initially expresses scorn at the planned attack of the machines: Salusa Secundus is surrounded by an energy field capable of wiping the robotic minds of any machine aggressor, thereby preventing any coordinated attack inside the planet's atmosphere. His arrogance vanishes when he realizes that the inhuman attackers have an ace in the hole: they are using cymeks and neocymeks as vanguard troops to destroy the towers creating the energy field. Having human minds, these shock troops are impervious to the mind-wiping technology, and can easily penetrate this barrier as if it wasn't there. Reacting quickly when a cymek attack kills his superior officer, Xavier decides that to save the world, he is willing to sacrifice Zymia and every living person in it.Characters in this book lack depth, except perhaps the sadistic robot known as Erasmus. He is an interesting entity, who displays a complex array of beliefs. He feels both superior and inferior to humans. He craves knowledge of their emotional responses, while he dissects twins in his operative suite. He realizes that every human is unique, not possessing a back-up copy, yet displays zero hesitation to kill a cook who accidentally dents his metal body with a knife. Aside from Erasmus, and the occasional glimpse of insight into the true character of Selim \\"Wormrider,\\" people are one-dimensional puppets of plot-driving utility only. This book is told from the perspective of multiple characters a la the \\"point-of-view\\" technique. For example, one chapter is told from Erasmus' perspective, another from Xavier's perspective, etc. It can be a fundamentally useful method of showing the story is ultimately a matter of perspective, and not necessarily filled with \\"heroes\\" and \\"villains.\\" As far as inducing mass-empathy, the authors fall short. However, they do successfully link the various points-of-view into a cohesive plot, with rousing action sequences, stirrings of \\"plans-within-plans,\\" and moments of actual brilliance.This is a review of the CD audiobook version, which was adequately narrated by Scott Brick. Scott only shines in this recording during his depiction of Erasmus--never fear, in later book CDs, Scott's skill definitely comes to the fore. Most of the discs also have suitable musical pieces which appropriately match the tone of the current chapter. There is no bonus material (i.e., interviews and the like) on this recorded book. The downside of listening to an audiobook based on the writing of Frank Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson is this: it forces you to listen to multiple reiterations of various sub-plots, overused words, and clich&eacute;d phrases. In short, these authors leave nothing, absolutely nothing, to the imagination, and repeat themselves with these unnecessary explanations endlessly. If I ever hear the word \\"obliterate,\\" \\"esoteric,\\" or \\"independent\\" again, it'll be too soon.This is an action book with \\"Dune\\" scrawled on the cover, basically as a marketing ploy. There is lots of fighting, oodles of space-geek terminology, eternal \\"what does it mean to be \`human'\\" musings, and not-so-subtle commentary on the military/political utility of religion. If you are such a purist as to be offended by Frank Herbert's legacy being trotted out as faade for a little \\"metal n' shootin',\\" then avoid this book. If you can appreciate FH's books by themselves, yet are willing to try something tangentially connected with his universe, then try TBJ: the doubly-climactic series of events of the last 150 pages is worth the price of admission. The authors successfully manipulate the cast of characters and series of events into a suitably momentous finale-nexus by the book's end. This is not FH, and could never be, but this is good science fiction."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"The last twenty years have seen two dismal trends. First is the size of books: instead of expressing a story succinctly and effectively, publishers commission operatics of 500, 750, 1000 pages and more. This creates meandering, formulaic storylines that take forever to get to the point: it's kind of pornography for the masses, the literary equivalent of a brain-and-time-killer.Recent history also sees the imbedding of mindless action derived from the visual media. Long, complicated narratives of action scenes. This is probably the publishers thinking they have to compete with video games. Care for a game of quidditch?This book combines the worst of both trends: it is long and boring, a combination of Battlestar Galactica meets The Matrix. It has too many characters one does not care about, multi-page action scenes which don't work on paper, contemporary Star Wars shoot-em-up scenes.Part of the appeal of Dune was its future pre-history aspect: anything connecting it to \\"us\\" was lost in the vague mysts of time. There's a reason it's often compared to the Tolkien books.The authors' previous attempts to resurrect Dune were much better. But no longer do they claim to be working from Frank Herbert's original notes. And perhaps this pedestrian output is the result.Some things are perhaps better not explored. I don't have much hope for the next two scheduled books. Perhaps it's time for the literary franchise to stop."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Sometimes it is better not to know. That is how I felt when I finished reading the first book of Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson's new series of Dune books: The Butlerian Jihad. The book is the first of a planned trilogy that tells the story of the Great Revolt and how humanity came to abandon technology that attempts to reproduce the human mind. The original Dune books provide may hints and suggestions about what the Great Revolt was, but Herbert and Anderson ignore most of these and have written a story that not only feels out of place in the Dune Universe, but directly contradicts much of the history in the original stories. If this does not bother you then Butlerian Jihad is an entertaining, if slightly vapid, read. However, if you are expecting consistency then stay away from this book. It is unfortunate that the authors chose to write a simple story about a war between Man and Machine instead of to explore the nature of intelligence and the effects of wide-spread mechanisation on the human psyche. The Great Revolt was the pivtol event in human history. Unfortunately the authors reduced it to a pulpy story about evil machines who enslave noble humans."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Don't expect any insights into the human condition or an adult tale involving complex intricacies of politics, ecology, religion and economics like that found in Frank Herbert's original Dune series. Rather this book is an all too linear page turner that cajoles you along with loads of simplistic and derivitive violence and action. It's the comic book version of Dune written in crayon with large friendly strokes. Well, after reading Brian Herbert's other Dune books I really didn't expect much, but The Butlerian Jihad is just plain bad. Not just bad because of the 1 dimentional characters, horrid prose, gaping plot holes, and incredibly cliche plot conventions, but because it cheapens and distorts Frank Herbert's original vision. Brian Herbert and his collaboorator Kevin J. Anderson have taken a rich universe and one of the pivotal events within that universe and made it into a cartoonish and very violent space opera. For example it features a Mengele-like robot who has for years engaged in bloody and asinine experiments in order to understand human behavior. Depite the countless thousands he pointlessly slaughters he never seems to quite \\"get\\" it and remains as clueless as ever. (Dumbass machines anyone?) I wanted to learn about the revolt against \\"thinking machines\\" that led to the foundation of the feudal galaxy-spanning empire of Dune and instead I got a poorly written amalgam of The Terminator, Star Wars, 1930's pulp SciFi, Transformers and The Matrix. None of the subtleties, intelligence and atmosphere of Frank Herbert's Dune can be found here. It gets a very kind two stars because it was entertaining in a harmless (and mindless) kind of way, \\"danger Will Robinson, danger!\\" I know if you're a Dune fan such as myself you are going to read it anyway, but don't say I didn't warn you."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"First of all I write this as a bigtime Dune fan. This series covers the plot points alluded to in Dune about the war of the past. It isn't anywhere as detailed or monolithic as the original books but it it still fun, exciting and a damned good read. There are some real haters giving it 1* and I do think that is just being mean. Really? 1*? If there hadn't been a Dune this would be a 5* from me but with the bar set so high I'm afraid it slips one slot."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"These books by the duo are fantastic!! Don't understand the low ratings. Gonna read all of them, and I'm glad to combine the father and son's work. An unbeatable combination!! read this excellent series. May the spice flow!"},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I'd grade the first half of this book a D. I'd grade the second half a solid B+ and perhaps even a tentative A-. I've never read a book that had such a stark difference in quality from one half to another.The reason seems to be in the authors' approach. Herbert and Anderson write in extremely short chapters. Most chapters are only three to five pages long. For a novel that encompasses numerous characters on multiple worlds, this scattershot approach makes it very difficult to get to know the people (or thinking machines), and to understand how the pieces fit together. Just when you start to get intrigued by a character or event - the authors move on. Ideas are passed over just after they are introduced, and this makes for a very frustrating read . . .. . . until it all starts to come together. Almost exactly halfway through the book, I started to get a sense of the characters. Serena, Holtzman, and Selim particularly interested me. The plot-lines start to converge, and aspects of the original Dune begin to make themselves apparent. I enjoyed the Prelude to Dune trilogy, so at that point my confidence in the authors rose. I don't expect them to be as good as Frank Herbert (they aren't), but I expect them to pull off a far-reaching, multi-plot narrative as they did in those books. With two more books in this prequel trilogy, it came as a great relief to me to see that they could do well with this story. I very much hope it doesn't take 350 pages for the authors to make book two interesting."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Let me start off by saying this is the first Dune book I have read, but I do plan on reading the others (and I have a very basic knowledge on the other series). I know a lot of people here are reading these books because they found Frank Herbert's original series so enthralling. I also think that a lot of people here are expecting a style and story that can compare with the original. Some people are going to like it as an additional back story; others will think the story was simply written poorly. And still others will think that the events in this trilogy should have been left a mystery.Anyway, here are some things about the book I'd like to point out:1. Writing StyleThe writing style can be pretty choppy at times. Chapters are generally short, between three and eight or nine pages. Each chapter shifts between perspectives: Vorian, Xavier, Serena, Selim, Ishmael, Iblis Ginjo, Norma Cenva, Zufa Cenva and many more. At first there are only a few of these perspectives, which gradually increase as the story progresses, and then slowly decrease in the last 100 pages or so. Some people find this annoying and just want to get on with it, others like being able to get a really good feel for everything that's happening.Personally, I like the idea of switching from perspective to perspective. At the end, however, I felt that some of these subplots didn't really have a lot of significance. I'm sure later in the trilogy that they will be expanded on, and that the events have relevance to the original series. Regardless, after just reading this book you haven't had a lot of questions answered. Some things needed a bit more expansion, and some things seemed to have too much of the story dedicated to them. For example, the overall storyline with Arrakis was not at all important to the rest of the story. I know it has relevance to the original series, and probably later in the trilogy, but it makes this story hard to stand on its own.2. CharactersThe characters were alright. They could be rather predictable at times, though. Mainly, that is, Vorian, Serena, and Xavier. That being said, their actions were believable. There were only a few times when I felt that it was especially contrived, just to get the plot moving.Character development was interesting. Most characters are pretty easy to figure out, and only three (once again, Vorian, Serena and Xavier) go through anything that gets you to really \\"know\\" the character or sympathize for them. Sure, you care about the well-being of the slaves, but not a lot of real emotion or compassion.Character believability was not a huge issue for most of the characters. Really, the only major thing that annoyed me was Vorian's instant, unexplained, and to a degree undeserved attraction to Serena. It reminds me of how Bella in Twilight seemed to attract every guy around her, even though she never did anything truly remarkable. I understand Xavier loving Serena, but the way Vorian instantly loved her is hard to believe. Also, the nature of the Titans seemed a bit poorly constructed. Despite once being humans themselves, they seem to show no compassion or understanding for them what-so-ever, only complete and utter contempt. This frame of mind makes sense to a degree, but it's a little bit extreme. Also, the theme of human unpredictability got a little old. I don't think that Omnius would be so blind as he often was at times.Xavier seemed overly typical: the well-liked, attractive military officer who advances so quickly through the ranks, so on and so on. Same with Serena: beautiful, also well-liked, always helping humankind, stubborn and resilient, intelligent, bold, so on and so on. Vorian also showed a lot of typical traits, mainly his initial obliviousness and sudden change of heart, but still showed a little bit more originality. His behavior was a bit more justified, in my opinion.3. Everything elseDespite the overused basic idea of technology taking over humans, this did a good job changing it up a bit. It introduced quite a few different elements that were interesting to look into--the science (with Norma and Tio), the Sorceresses on Rossak, the cymeks, etc. It definitely separated itself from other similar stories, in my opinion.As far as the readability goes, I didn't ever feel like just dropping the book and forgetting about it. I was interested in whatever was going to happen next. Admittably, some things didn't really catch my interest, but in no way did I find it outright boring. The book also moved very fast, skipping months at a time and going over a timespan of about three years. And while all of the major events were definitely important for the next major event to occur, they sometimes seemed a bit unrelated and distant, as if you were reading two or three separate stories. A large part of this is due to a \\"character shift\\". In the beginning, Xavier and Serena are easily your most important characters. Later on, about halfway through, that changes to be Vorian and Serena.Even though they were interesting, some of the other characters and plots didn't seem necessary. Norma Cenva was definitely important in the progression of events, but some things seemed like they could have been skipped over. Same with Aurelius, Zufa, and Iblis. Ishmael's character didn't really seem important either. It gave a bit of insight, but that insight didn't add a lot to the story.OVERALL...It was an enjoyable read. I found it very entertaining, and I was eager to find out how each plot and subplot progressed. Despite a few, mostly minor, character flaws, I liked most of them and was genuinely concerned about them. Most events had relevance to the overall story, even though they weren't completely necessary (but did explain parts of the Dune universe), and were believable. The Arrakis plotline, though an interesting read, was a little disappointing in its lack of importance to the bigger concerns on Earth, Giedi Prime and Salusa Secundus. Still, it didn't detract from the overall enjoyableness of the story. I am looking forward to reading the further installments. However, I do think some Dune fans would be disappointed in either the story, the way it was written, or both, especially in comparison to Frank Herbert's originals."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Look, I'll make it short.

For those of you that don't know, The Butlerian Jihad takes place ten thousand years before the time of originator, Frank Herberts, immensely popular book Dune. It is a collaboration between Brian Herbert (Frank's son)and Kevin Anderson. It is the fourth book co-written by these authors that I know of, having just finished another trilogy/prequel, The House series (House Atriedes, Harkonnen and Corrin).By reading The Butlerian Jihad, I finally got to experience the distant past, which was constantly but vaguely alluded to in the original Dune novels.We get to meet the beautiful, compassionate Serena Butler, who's year old son, the murder of which, set off the rebellion, which eventually brought down the heartless thinking machines. We also meet distant relatives of Baron Harkonnen - Xavier (who is a good and honorable person) and Paul Atriedes - Vorian (the son of the wicked Titan, Agamemnon {a thousand year old human brain in a mechanical body})and Tio Holtzman (the revered inventor of the Holtzman Effect and other inventions). We experience the last stronghold of free humanity, with The League of Nobles, the fledgling exportation of the spice Melange from Arrakis and the precursor of the Bene Gesserit, in the Sorceress's of Rossak.BackgroundThe Old Empire was stagnant if not decadent and humanity had lost it's drive allowing machines to perform all major work and tasks. This malaise permitted a small but vicious group of twenty revolutionaries to stage a coup and take over the Empire. This group called themselves Titans and their bloody rule was short lived (fifty years) as the Titans being short in number, mistakenly allowed the Thinking Machines too much responsibility, whereupon they usurped the power.Prior to the Machines \\"putsch\\" the Titans, striving for immortality, became Cymeks - Human brains housed in a cannister within a mechanical body. After the Machine revolution, the Titan/Cymeks became reluctant servants of the Evermind - Omnius, the head Thinking Machine. Humans existed within Omnius's empire but were mostly slaves with a few Trustees.The Butlerian Jihad begins the epic struggle encompassing humanities rebellion against the thinking machines, which sets the tone of a future in which the total rejection of any sort of thinking machines is a reality. Our Story begins a thousand years after Omnius's victory over the TitansThe PlotAlthough The Thinking Machines Empire (called Synchronized Planets) consisted of thousands of inhabited planets, there were many inhabited worlds still outside the Empire's boundaries, some of which had formed a federation called the League of Nobles (primarily as a defense mechanism). Though Omnius considered the battle with humans to be inefficient, with prompting from the remaining Titans (after a thousand years, there were five) and especially Agamemnon, the defacto Titan leader/spokesman, Omnius undertook the conquest of the remaining free worlds.The StoryThis first installment covers a period of some three or fours years of the epic conflict. During this time the main three characters go through many tribulations. Dune's incarnation of evil, Baron Harkonnen's distant ancestor Xavier Harkonnen is a Primero (General) in the League's army. He and the lovely Serena are engaged but while on a mission, Serena takes on a mission of her her own, a radical plan to save the besieged Planet Gedi Prime. The Plan is successful but Serena is captured by the machines and taken to the their primary world Earth.On Earth Serena, who is pregnant with Xavier's child is given to the ever curious independent robot, Erasmus as one of his house servants. Erasmus who likes to think of himself an expert on human beings, has been studying specimens for hundreds of years and being a robot is indifferent to the plight and pain of his victims. He is intrigued however by the imperious but humane and unflappable Serena. Also intrigued is Vorian Atriedes, a trustee and the son of the bloodthirsty Titan, Agamemnon. Vorian who believes his father to be a hero and a great warrior is informed otherwise by Serena. Not believing her at first he is shocked when learning the truth after researching his fathers brutal past.Meanwhile Serena gives birth to Manion a bubbly toe head. Unfortunately being an infant, Manion requires much attention, taking time away from Erasmus's constant inquisitions. Serena is constantly trying to help the other household slaves and Erasmus sees this is a way to remove the troublesome toddler and punish Serena by getting rid of Manion. Erasmus has totally misjudged the situation and instead of finding Serena properly cowled he finds rage and his action was the catalyst that provided the spark which started a world wide rebellion.With the entire planet in turmoil Vorian being a Trustee and using subterfuge gains possession of a ship which allows Serena, another Trustee named Iglis Ginjo, and himself to escape to Serena's home planet, Salsua Secundus.It is a this point that Serena enjoins the entire free human race to rededicate themselves to a rejuvenated holy war - A Jihad against the Thinking Machines. From this point forward Serena Butler is known as the Priestess of the Jihad."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I was really excited to read this book. All through out the original dune series you hear the name of &quot;Butlerian Jihad&quot; and how it forever changed the course of human history , just as Lord Leto caused the famine times and the scattering of humanity to every corner of the universe (Books 4-5). Again and again herbert mentions the enslavement of mankind by machines and repeated warning that &quot;thou shall not make machines in the image and thinking of man&quot;. But I think his message was more philosophical then literal.(His books were always more about human nature then technology and science) he did not imagine machines literally taking over mankind but by growth of man's dependence on machines we enslaved ourselves and lost our natural ablities in the process. Abilities that the guild, the mentat schools and BG sisterhood revived.This book although fun to read as science fiction , is just that, a science fiction book. I found nothing connecting it to the works of Frank herbert except the names. It lacked the same character development that herbert provided, the same insight as to each character's motives , cravings , needs and reasonings.Even if one admits that , what herbert achived can't be achived again , the writers should atleast have remained true to the image of &quot;thinking machines&quot; and &quot;jihad&quot; that he had in his mind and not taken the easy way out by simply creating a &quot;nice&quot; SiFi book. This book and this theme could have been so much more (it had great potential) esp now since we all have become so much dependent on technology, and that dependence is just growing everyday.But still I would say to the average Dune fan, read it, even if skewed , it still provides a history of the dune universe and even if your not a dune fan but still read science fiction , this is a good book.Finally I think all that herbert was trying to say that there is a very thin line between how far we mould technology to fit our needs and how far technology moulds us to be able to use it."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Much like the Dune \\"House\\" trilogy books that preceded \\"Jihad\\", this book is overlong and filled with chapters that could easily been condensed to background paragraphs. All of this incidental detail is suppose to give a reader insights into characters' motivations, but all it did was bore me. I plodded through to the end because I like knowing the background for the real Dune stories.What I love about the first four Dune books are the themes of transformation: people, places and technology all interact to create new levels of existence that are stunning, mystifying, heartbreaking and unforgettable. A reader will not get that experience from this book.What a reader will get are blindly ambitious people, inane, excessive and pointless details about peripheral characters, obligatory cruel and obtuse oppressors (esoteric sci-fi quibble: didn't these guys see the \\"Matrix\\" movies? Far better representation of AI dominance) and, thankfully, seeds of the universe to come: the Holtzmann fields and shields, the development of the spice, the Bene Gesserit, Fremen, Tlexalu and Spacing Guild antecedents, and, of course, the twisted family trees of the Corrinos, Harkonnens and Atreides.For the next two books (\\"Crusade\\" & \\"Battle\\"), I will be looking for \\"Cliff Note\\" versions, which will give me the background information I desire without meaningless filler! Where's a good editor when you need one? :)"},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"This book was well writen, the writing style is different from frank herbert, but still decent. The story of machines taking over is getting old, from all the recent movies and such. However the development of characters in this novel is done quite well, examples being Serena butler, Xavier Harkonen, Vorian atredies, and the robot Eramus (and his barbaric actions) This book is well worth the read, having read the original dune trilogy and all except chapterhouse in the second trilogy, i enjoyed this book, not nearly as much as those but still a decent book in the dune universe. Just have to read the house trilogies next."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"After reading some of the other reviews; I was reluctant to buy this book, but I have rarely put it down since I started it. I realize I read the original Dune Series in the 1980's and may have lost some of the technical direction theorized by some of the other reviewers, but if you simply enjoy good writing, plot, and viable characters YOU WILL LIKE THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I thought that this was a very well written book. It describes things that are to come in the future. I did not care for the gore, but it was a part of the story to show the cruelty of the machines. I think this story tells a moral story as well. The slavery of the machines coinciding with the slaves kept on the human controlled planets. I can't wait to read the Machine Crusades."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Brian Herbert's and Kevin Anderson's House Trilogy introduced me to the Dune Universe. I Picked up House Atreides on a whim and have read the trilogy, then most of the original Dune series. Dune is one of if not my all time favourite sci-fi series (only real competition it recieves is from the Foundation series.)I anxiously awaited the release of this title in pocketbook ( I prefer pocketbooks to hardcover ersonal quirk), and was not disappointed. The successors to the writing of the Dune mythology seamlessly weave a background 10,000 years before the events of Dune take place. The titans, i.e. cymeks ( humans who have sacrificed their human bodies for immortal machine shells for their biological brains) overthrew the empire and years later their creation ominus a sentient computer controls most of the known universe. Pockets of humans are determined to win back their freedom and overthrow their tyrannical overlords, such as Serena Butler, Cena Zufna, Inglis, Xavier Harkonnen and more.The author's not only develop further history further expanding the universe Frank Herbert created, they also draw obvious parallels to classic mythology. The titans Ajax, Barbarossa Agemommon and Juno for instance are familiar names to those that know their Greek and Roman Mythology. They interweave many concurrant subplots as they explore the origins of Arrakis, and sects and groups like the Beneserine(sp) sisterhood. This book is an excellent exciting, multi-layered science fiction tale, no matter how acquainted the reader is to Dune. One of the benefits the authors' have of going so far back into Dune's past is the novel not only answers some questions for the serious Duneophile, but also can draw new curious readers into the legend without them having to read the oringinal series or even the House trilogy to understand whats going on. Well done looking very forward to the second novel."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Setting high expectations for any prequel to one of the legendary books of science fiction is a formula for dissapointment. Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson made an excellent attempt with the &quot;House&quot; prequels. While not filled with the same intrigue and depth of thought or character as the original Dune series, the &quot;House&quot; trilogy had a page-turning energy similar to a Michael Crichton book.The natural follow-up would be to go further into the past and see the beginnings of the Dune universe. As a stand-alone novel, The Butlerian Jihad is unimpressive. The human characters are driven my somewhat unbelievable ambitions, and the mechanical characters are sometimes downright silly.However this book is worth reading simply because it provides more storyline for those interested in the world of Dune. There are a few nice twists that show how history doesn't always provide an accurate record of what happened.I recommend this book simply because it is part of the Dune universe. As long as you don't expect to be blown away by the prose, it's a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I liked the book immensely. A lot of the negative reviews I've read here make valid points, but I thought it was a good story with some cool ideas. I've read the House Trilogy too and I do agree that the overall quality has declined with each release from Brian and Kevin. I'll continue to read everything related to Dune, but I wish that these guys would slow down and take more time if they need it. It took Frank over 20 years to write the first 6 Dune books. At the rate they are going, Brian and Kevin will have 6 out in just 5 years. So don't rush it guys - especially for Dune 7."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I am a dune Junkie, and having given this book 2 stars, I will still buy the next book.But this was really sad. Basically, the purpose of this book is to set the stage for the next two. And the purpose of these three (Other than the obvious financial reasons) is to give us the origins of all the mythology that the Frank Herbert created as a backdrop for his series.In and of itself this is fine, but the implementation is [not good]. The characters are shallow, the historical representations are unsophisticated and the emotional content is sophomoric.After about the first hundred pages, I read it out of some perverse desire to reach the conclusions promised in the opening chapter. But was denied even that.Get this book if you are a Dune fan, if not, don't waste your money"},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"This is a review of &quot;DUNE: the Butlerian Jihad&quot; with a little DUNE: Machine Crusade and DUNE: Battle of Corrin&quot; (not released) thrown in for good measure.Unlike the nearby micro-review which states the book &quot;explains alot (sic)... such as shields, no machine or computers, the roots of the bene-genesirit (sic), the spacing guild and very early fremen (sic) roots ...&quot;, I would have to question whether this reviewer actually read any of the book, as most of these interesting beginnings of the DUNE saga are not covered in this book, but later in the trilogy. Trilogy?!! Well, I didn't know either.Even the terms themselves (Bene-Gesserit, Spacing Guild, Fremen and others) are not even found in the book, so we can't be sure how to know who or what *might* even evolve into these groups. So caveat emptor: prepare to have to read three books to learn all the the secrets as promised on the cover flaps. Of course, that might be a good thing too if you like to read. But we can't really be sure of this either because the third book won't even be out til' Aug 2004.Butlerian Jihad and its sequels taken as one is a flashback trilogy... much like the Silmarillion is to Tolkien fans. I think about 10,000 years pre-maud'dibIn &quot;Jihad&quot; we have three mutual antaganosts: humans, cymecs (former humans who opted to become put their brains in a mechanical cannister contraptions and live centuries. (For some reason they hate humans); and Ominus the evermind AI software who runs everything on the robot planets where the cymecs live. All three hate the other two. Humans at the bottom of the power struggle to start.We also have three types of worlds: free (human-run, natch), robot-run called &quot;Synchronized&quot;) and Unaligned.Two of our heros are named Harkonnen and Atreides.And the story is mostly about how each of the three shoot each other up trying to rule the Galaxy.We really only learn a few of the things later seen in Mau'dib's world... but you'll have to read all the way through a 2&quot; hardcover to find out. Can't give the whole story away?That said, the book itself is a pretty good read. Kinda drags on in places and some people and other &quot;entities&quot; die for no apparent benefit to the plot. But it was hard to put down after the second time I started it. But &quot;War and Peace&quot; it's not so don't expect really great writing and plot development. Lotsa characters too. And it jumps around just a little too much with tiny, mostly non-contiguous chapters.[to continue read my review on the Machine Crusade - number two of this series]"},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"This book does one good thing about it. It still has the intricate plot making of the authors' previous titles. But other than that, it is really not impressive.The characters are unrealistic. The authors never describe what the main characters actually look like. Reading it, makes you imagine of talking blobs, with no image given about them what-so-ever.It seems a shame, because the Butlerian Jihad was always hinted at by Frank Herbert as a great event, one which has much literary potential. Potential ruined by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. The Machine bad-guys just do not hold water. They seem like piece-meal baddies, with little thought put into them. With such other artificial creations, like the 'Agents out of the Matrix', these 'Titans/Cymeks' etc are below standard.The creation of the 'Empire' before the seizing of power by the Titans, seems to lack imagination. A stagnant Empire which was re-invigorated by revolution. Something very similar to what happens in the original Dune. Nothing New.Reading it gave the impression that this is a commercial creation. One which the authors knew would sell, not because of literary quality, but because it was another chapter in the Dune saga, that would be bought by Dune fans the moment it was seen on the selves."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"If you liked the careful, slowly revealing way Frank Herbert crafted his views of politics and power, religion, economics, and biology into his first novel you will be insulted by The Butlerian Jihad (TBJ). If you appreciate the care F. Herbert took to create a complete, three dimensional, wholely consistent universe while not squandering it with poor writing and unnecessary blood, sex, and violence, you'll be disgusted by TBJ. Where TBJ should have been used to make a study of a revolution, it's origin, necessity, and aftermath, instead they make pulp. It's the equivalent of taking your dead father's inheritance and blowing it on booze, girls, and bling.On the other hand, if you read Dune wondering why F. Herbert took so long to get to the \\"good stuff\\" (action, sex, blood, and gizmos) then you'll probably enjoy this book. If you like reading B grade sci-fi and don't have any affection for the original (one might even say authentic) Dune books then you will probably like this book. Finally, I'll agree with other reviewers that if you like reading poorly written books to see how not to write engrossing fiction then this mess of a novel is for you.For anyone else, don't taint your memory of first three books with this drivel."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"ok so you've probably read a lot of reviews before this, there are people who give it one star, labeling it as ... \\"garbage, and \\" not worth a read, \\" but they seem to not be able to grasp that Kevin J anderson and Brian Herbert are indeed NOT Frank Herbert, and while the original six were the best books I have ever read, the prequels weren't too shabby either.My Only big qualm with the House trilogy is the super short chapters and there seemed to be around 8 things going on at once in the books, so it's not too hard to lose focus from time to time, other than that, they are some very quality SF books anybody who liked the original series and Sci Fi in general would enjoy.Now to the Book, Yes, it has Sci Fi cliches, yes, the characters are a bit one dimensional,yes, those short chapters are back, and yes, the Anderson-Herbert writing style is back. But it's Still a VERY GOOD book, Dune fans will love, except those people who gave it one star, wwho have very critical and harsh opinions. Any body who bothers to read the whole book will love it and it's definitely worth the time. A great book that provides a backstory to the greatest Sci FI series ever."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"The thing that made the original &quot;Dune&quot; novel so great was its plausibility. It imparted a sense of reality and wonder that translated into real authenticity. The characters seemed like real people living on real planets in the far distant future.This book fails to do any of that. Having read all of the previous Dune books, I had lots of questions about, and notions about, what the &quot;Butlerian Jihad&quot; had comprised. When I read this book my reaction was &quot;you have got to be kidding.&quot;I thought the other three Dune novels by Brian Herbert and Anderson were pretty worthy prequels. &quot;The Butlerian Jihad,&quot; by contrast, misses the mark completely. I rarely give only one star to a book that I have actually finished, but this one will be an exception. Save your money.The authors can do better and should have known better. I don't know how they managed to produce this turkey."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"As a long-time fan of science fiction (over 40 years) I feel like I have some reservoir of authority to draw on in commenting on this book. The explanation of the origins of the worm riders of Dune and the Butlerian Jihad itself are strangely compelling and make for satisfying reading.Where the series falls down is in not making the bloodshed believable. Omnius comes off a bit like a petulant twit and the cymeks are simply cartoonish. Nonetheless, I gave this a four star rating because damnit, I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"The reason so many people seem to hate this book is that they are too used of reading top-caliber science fiction like the works of Asimov, Heinlein and (imagine this) Herbert, they take it for granted all science fiction is that good. All those people bashing Legends of Dune really need to pick up some of the Star Trek or Predator crp coming out. By comparison, this novel is on literary par with the Iliad.The plot is complicated but, like in the old Dune books, held together in a skillful matter. Enter the Synchronized Universe, aeons before the events of Dune take place, where millions of planets have been synchronized into the mind of Omnius, a collective robotic intelligence beyond all human weaknesses. A few humans still hold an organized resistance against the machines, under the command of a few surviving members of the ruling class of the Old Empire, but they are strained to protect themselves and daren't attempt to penetrate the Synchronized Worlds.And now the League of Nobles is fighting amongst itself. For the League holds Buddislamic primitives as slaves, who are rapidly moving towards revolution as their religious leaders are martyred by Tlulaxa \\"flesh merchants\\". The rulers of the League are either angnostics or Panchristians and claim the Buddislamics, who seem to forsake sophistication, owe a debt to humanity for fleeing the machines instead of fighting the machines in our darkest hours. Serena Butler, though, has advocated without effect the plight of the Zensunnis and Zenshiites. Speaking of which, Serena Butler is the girlfriend of a certain officer named Xavier Harkonnen.When the planet Giedi Prime is stolen from humanity by the tyrannical cyborg Agammemnon, Serena rallies a force to liberate the planet. She and Xavier Harkonnen enlist the aid of mysterious Sorcerreses from planet Rossak, who of course will ultimaely become the Bene Gesserit. She is captured by the cyborgs--oh, cyMEKs--and taken to Earth.Meanwhile, Norma Cenva, the daughter of an influential drug merchant and one of the aforementioned Sorcerreses, travels to planet Poritrin, where millions of captive Zensunnis toil under the Lord Bludd, to study under Tio Holtzman, who is trying to develop a way to shield starships from projectile damage.But that's only half of the story, the story from the League perspective. Meanwhile, on planet Earth, the story begins to focus on two humans who willingly serve the machines and have been rewarded with power. There is Iblis Ginjo, Serena Butler's slave master for a brief time. Iblis receives an enigmatic message supposedly from a rebel group fighting the machines on Earth, and, uncertain on what to do, takes an oddysey to the realm of Cogitor Eklo, a disembodied intelligence who supposedly is nothing more than a philosopher, but in truth has a level of mysticism to him so great that he could orchestrate an entire Jihad.The other human in machine trust is Vorian Atreides, Agammemnon's son, who has never questioned the righteousness behind the synchronization of all the galaxy to Omnius.Also giving us a glimpse of the machine perspective is Erasmus, an independent robot who studies human psychology. It is his folly who will ultimately be the bane of Omnius. It sounds like I'm giving a way a lot, but I've only scraped the tip of the iceberg. The epic scope of Legends of Dune is unparalleled.The characters are a bit lacking, but the superb blend of philospohy and action make this a worthy Dune novel, perhaps superior even to a few of the old Dune Chronicles from way back. I can't wait to read the sequels!"},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"A lot of controversy and disappointment about this one. Not unexpected, given the legendary status of Frank Herbert's original series. It's been a good 15 years since I read the originals, and I intend to read them again after working my way through the prequels. What to make of this effort by Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson? They've definitely decided to go the route of space opera in this story of the great conflict between humans and thinking machines that would result in the taboo against artificial intelligence that the elder Herbert alludes to in the original books. The great care taken by him in developing coherent systems of philosophy and ecology is not evident here, which undoubtedly contributes to much of the disillusionment. Frankly though, I felt that the original series sometimes got too bogged down in such abstract and esoteric matters, particularly in the later books. (Maybe I'll feel different when I reread them; my attention span was shorter 15 years ago.) I just went with the story that Herbert and Anderson had to tell and enjoyed it for what it was--a crackling tale of heroes and villains that offers insight into the origins of many elements of the Dune universe."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I didn't expect a lot, which was a good thing. Herbert and Anderson have produced \\"mainstream SF\\" -- decent characterization, interesting ideas, and adequate plot, but lacking the richness and brilliantly constructed framework of Dune. As other reviewers have mentioned, the authors practically bash you over the head with things they want you to \\"get,\\" rather than let you puzzle it out yourself like the inimitable Frank Herbert did.Bottom line: it's enjoyable enough for a bit of light reading, and for the game of exploring the possible history of the Dune universe, but don't expect anything nearly as good as the classic Dune series."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"When I bought &quot;The Butlerian Jihad&quot;, I was expecting something in the line of the trilogy &quot;Dune: House [Atreides,Harkonnen,Corrino]&quot;, also by Brian Herberth and Kevin Anderson: a somewhat descriptive book, with mild action and weak plots, which only value was to show in detail places of the Dune Universe that you whished to see but were not in the original Frank Herberth's works.I was wrong. &quot;The Buttlerian Jihad&quot; has a strong, epic plot that draws all the attention of the reader - it is a book that will take away hours of sleep because you can't put it down. The characters at first sound bidimensional, but as the story grows you start feeling their emotions as you own, and by the end of the book some chapters even made me shed some tears, which is an effect that few books had in all my life. Not surprisingly in a book that obviously uses elements of Shakespearean and Greek tragedies, playing with archetypes - some of them kind of new, like the Man-Machine dicotomy - deeply rooted in most people's minds.The portrayal of a &quot;pre-Dune&quot; universe is brilliant, and relays heavily in vintage science fiction elements that give a delicious quaint, retro flavor to the story. And, most amazingly, the freedom to write a tale that Frank Herberth only mentioned in the vaguest terms made it possible to produce a book that can be read in a way completely independent from the original series, and still be enjoyed. In fact, the explanations of how some thing s of the Dune universe came to be are not the most interesting parts of the book: I would indeed *recomend* newbies to read it as a separate work."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"OK - I am done with Dune. The original series, written by F. Herbert, was excellent - it was so well detailed and written that I could almost smell the spice. The Butlerian Jihad, however, has convinced me to move on. This work was poorly written, poorly thought out, and wordy instead of detailed; it was a silly book.The Titans, the evermind, the other thinking machines were all comic caricatures of what they could have been. The inane dialog was so mind-numbing, I had to struggle through each page.My advice: read ANYTHING else- anything. Save your money, save your time, save your sanity."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"This book is a must for Dune fans but I found it shallow and rushed. It filled in some blanks but left me wanting more. I guess the botttom line my be that Brian is not Frank."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"While this is about \\"The Butlerian Jihad\\" it applies to all the Herbert/Anderson Dune books. It is a very good book, but not a great book. With Frank Herbert's Dune book there is something to be gained by repeted readings. Because of a more simplistic writing style, you get the book all in one reading. Not that the stories aren't very good. They are all real page turners. To me, they tell the back story of the Frank Herbert Dune books very well. It's just that with the exception of Hunters Of Dune they have to fit into an existing story & timeline, while they are free to write the back stories, they have to come to a certain, already known conclusions. Thus before you even begin to read the book, you already have an idea where the story has to go. It might not be a problem if you had never read any of the Dune books & started with the Butlerian Jihad. My son started reading the series that way & actually likes the Anderson/Herbert books better than the Frank Herbert series. He says they move faster. That may be true but faster isn't necessarily better & while I enjoyed these books very much, I most likely will only read them once, while when I finish the last couple of chapeters in Paul Atredies, I'm looking forward rereading once again the original trilogy"},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"The beginning was pretty well done in this book, however towards the center and especially the ending, were somwhat dissapointing. All of the events relating with the older books are spaced too closely. And the whole thing seemed to be a bit rushed. The characters also were too shallow. But it was a good read, i enjoyed."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I don't normally do online reviews but after reading some of the previous reviews of this book, I felt the need for a more &quot;level headed&quot; review.The book (like the others by Brian and Kevin) will not go down in the annals of history as great fiction. The books are amusing distractions that serve the purpose of entertaining the readers with a few hours of fairly straight forward storytelling.One important point to bring up is that &quot;Butlerian Jihad&quot; is only the first book in a new trilogy. As such, it does little more then start the entire story of the Jihad in motion and introduce the players involved. This is a fact that seems to have been overlooked by some of the previous reviewers.If you're looking for a bit of background on the early (10,000 years before the original Dune books) on the Dune universe, this isn't a bad starting point. If you enjoyed the previous trilogy from these two authors, you're also likely to enjoy this one (its pretty much more of the same). However, if you're looking for new extensions to the original Dune novels... lower your expectations. While &quot;Butlerian Jihad&quot; is an acceptable story in an of itself, it lacks the memorable depth and richness of the Frank Herbert's original works. I applaud his son's attempts to carry on his father's legacy, but he's simply not the writer his father was.That all said, I'll sum up my review by saying simply that I enjoyed this like their previous colaborations. It will not become classic fiction, but it was entertaining while it lasted."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"This book doesn't quite deliver up to it's promises of making clear, where and when certain &quot;Dune&quot; factions began. Let's call it more of a hint. Any fan of Dune will see where it's all going, but if a person were to pick this book up without that background? Well, it wouldn't make much sense at all. Fortunatley I'm a follower, loved seeing the roots of the Dune series and can't wait for the two or three more books it's going to take to tie it all up. My reccomendation, buy the entire series. Read all of them beginning with Dune. Start again with &quot;House Atreides, then Corino and Harkonnen, and then read The Butlerian Jihad. It will make a lot more sense and leave you begging for more."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"A lot of people are not going to like this book because they are blinded from the outset of thinking sequel=bad. But truth is, many of F. Herbert's original ideas are present in these books. My only dislike for this book stems from it's overly dramatic battles and such, the original Dune had little use for such things, as the battles were more often than not over before that had begun. However the writing, while not up to Herbert Sr.'s profound ability, is still a grade higher than anything you can just pick up off the shelves of modern trash sci-fi. Unlike what other reviewers here state, this book DOES have definitate characters, Serena Butler, Vorian Atreides, and my personal favorites, the Titans. Elements of Herbert Sr's original vision are here, you can see them forming up to something grand. These books are setting the stage for a Dune 7, and in that they are important. The story is a grade above anything you'll get from modern over published crap that pervades literature of today. It's not as good as the original Dune, but then to be honest nothing can top that... don't expect it to. This is however, a fitting tribute to Frank Herbert's universe and a continuation of my most cherished sci fi. Go into this book expecting a good read and a great story and you will not be disappointed. Go into this book expecting Frank Herbert himself and a flawless repeat of the original classic and you will wind up like the closed minded reviewers here who seem to oddly delude themselves into thinking they could write something better. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Like many of the reviewers here, I have read the entire Dune series, and Frank Herbert's Dune books twice. Of the prequels, I like this one the best. It reminds me of Chapterhouse and Heretics, which are two of my favorites outside of the original Dune.I was entertained. I thought they did a good job of putting me in another time and place. It gave answers to a lot of what was referenced in the original Dune series. I like the short chapters, except the skipping around to the different stories was a bit frustrating. The story is very violent.I understand some of the other reviewers' criticisms, but much of what they criticize about the book doesn't matter to me. I am glad that Brian and Kevin have continued the saga, and I can't wait for more."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I love the Dune Universe that Frank Herbert created. He was an incredible, compelling writer whose books resonated not just as stories, but as works of theology, philosophy, and politics.Unfortunately the acorn fell VERY far away from the tree.I was horrified at how Brian Herbert ignored continuinity on the \\"House\\" series. Admittedly I only read two of them and they were awful enough. But I couldn't resist picking up a book that was supposed to explain how it all started. *SIGH*.This book is poorly written and reminds me of a \\"child's-guide\\" to something. Herbert clumsily does asides to explain the made-up words or sci-fi terms in the book. It's pretty standard to allow the intelligent reader to figure out what something means by context and the sound of the word. The book is full of cliches and shallow characterizations. At times it seems like he just didn't feel like writing something important and whized through a scene or chapter in a few paragraphs.I'm going to finish it, but I promise to never pick up another bastardization of the Dune universe that has been perpetrated by Brian Herbert. His father wrote intelligent books for smart people. Apparently Brian writes for simpletons.Frank Herbert is gone. Brian Herbert needs to let these stories go so that they aren't ruined further by him."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"unless it was connected to the Dune legacy.The Buttlerian Jihad deals w/ a war between humans and an AI-machine that took over Earth. The overall story and plot is interesting and had potential but the craft of the writers is lacking to the craft.First and foremost is the dialogue which is written awkwardly; some examples: \\"When I was in space the last year, I thought about you a lot,\\" \\"Now that you're back I have that boquet of kisses for you,\\" and \\"Got you metalmind!\\"Next, there're the awkward and laughable sexual relations... between computers, between two preserved brains eg. Agaemenon stroked Juno qivering cingulate lobe, Juno reciprocated with sudden mental thrusts...Each chapter begins w/ a \\"quote\\" of nauseating merit.The Serena-love/adoration; this character is made out to be an uber princess/saint who's self righteousness grates. I'm so happy she's thinking about the poor human slaves and the victims of the thinking machines while she goes boar hunting and humps her Harkonnen officer. In creating this one dimensional character the authors are worse in the artificial way she's protected from serious negative consequences of her actions. Even when captured, she's not put to hard labour but to tend gardens; even a personal loss is mollified by the way it's the \\"ignition for a revolution on Earth;\\" and this is insulting to all the other humans and slaves who've suffered worse.The good points:It's based in the Dune universe; Harkonnen/Atriedes are all players.The authors avoid narrow black and white politics (which fits with prior Dune books) even some humans use questionable methods (slaves, etc.)The scenes that take place in Arrhakhis are interesting and it is interesting to see how worm riding and spice trading begins. It's of note as well that these chapters have less dialogue than others so the authors can't mess it up.Final Point: Read it to kill time if you're in between or waiting for other books; Don't expect Dune quality."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I was greatly impressed by this prequil. Originally I purchased this volume as a quick, easy read over the summer; I was pleasantly surprised. Stylistically it differs in voice and tone from the original series, but not in a negetive manner.The narrative is both easy to understand, not requiring extensive knowlede of Herberts original works, and fast paced. Overall I recommmed this book for anyone curious about the Butlerian Jyhad, which remained illusive in the first chronicles."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I started these prequels because I wanted a glimpse into Frank Herbert's notes. I'm not sure if it's worth the agony of reading them to get the shreds of information that they contain.They didn't have to imitate slavishly Frank Herbert's books, but it seems that they didn't even understand wherein lay the orginal books' greatness.Simply put: If you liked and could appreciate the original novels, these are NOT for you. If you thought the originals were needlessly dense and complex without much &quot;action,&quot; then, by all means, give these new books a try."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Although the writing and content of these new Dune books don't hold up to Frank Herbert's originals, they're still worthwhile reads for fans.

I am certainly no proponent of alien in our heritage thought, but the mind of this author would provide an argument for those who do think so."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"This is my second time reading Dune: The Butlerian Jihad and I love it every bit as much as the first. It's quite different from the writing style and storytelling of the original series written by Brian Herbert's father. However, this is in no way a detractor for fans of the series, or of science fiction. Both authors are quite accomplished and deliver a well written, fast paced, and intriguing tale. For newcomers to the series, I would still recommend reading DUNE first! This will enrich the story of this book and series! It gets two thumbs up and five stars from me."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I ordered just to \\"fill in the blanks\\" for the early days of the Dune saga, which it did.

If you're OK with that then I would recommend, otherwise you can skip it."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I read the entire Dune trilogy as a teen and recently re-read the original Dune novel. Naturally, I was intrigued when I saw the title of this book. What fan wouldn't want to know the back story behind the world of Dune? But, unfortunately, I found this book to be rather a letdown. First of all, the book nowhere says that it is the first installment in a trilogy; I therefore assumed (wrongly) that it told the whole story. In fact, the dust cover says, \\"Herein are the foundations of the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, the Suk Doctors, the Order of Mentats, and the mysteriously altered Navigators of the Spacing Guild.\\" In reality, none of those foundations are laid by the end of the book, and it became blatantly obvious that additional installments would have to be read if one wanted the big picture -- a 612-page tease, in other words. Sadly, the writing style is far beneath that of the elder Herbert's, so much so that I have little appetite for the subsequent novels. The hints scattered throughout the original Dune novels were simply more tantalizing than the revelations offered by this prequel."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Out of all the McDune books that Brian and Kevin wrote, I found the Butlerian Jihad trilogy to be the most enjoyable out of them all. However, the same writing problems abound in all of the books, regardless of what it's about - useless detail, flat characters, and clunky writing in some places.Serena Butler was such a Mary Sue that it was not even funny. Beautiful, purple eyes, graceful, sweet, etc. I just couldn't stand her. I found the parts with the Titans more interesting, to be honest. Overall the Butlerian Jihad is better than any of the other MdDune books, but it doesn't stand much on its own. This story would have been better if it was an entirely original creation by Brian and Kevin instead of a non-canon, fanfiction-esque extension of the Dune universe."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"This book is an excellent start to the Dune line of books. Not having read Dune prior to this might put me at a disadvantage, but all in all, a great story with several character storylines and conflicts. My only complaint is that the book was supposed to be new and when I received it, there were finger oil 'stains' indicating it had been read before and the main part of the binding detached from the cover while I was reading it. The seller needs to be certain to send a new item when they profess that is what they are selling."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"If you're looking for another 'Dune,' don't bother - that's book in a different class.

Taken on its own, this book does have its problems. The characters try to be three dimensional, but fail for the most part (Vor is really the only one that comes close). The plot is far too jumbled and choppy, but then that's a characteristic of the Kevin J. Anderson writing style. All that being said, this is a pretty good book with exciting space battles, interesting ideas and a look at how Frank Herbert's Universe came into being. Is this how Frank Herbert would have written the story? No. But on its own merits, Dune: The Buterlian Jihad is alright. If you need a Dune fix, this should suffice."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Overall not a Bad book but not at all dune-like. It's missing the &quot;wheels within wheels&quot; conspiracy mentality that drove the original Dune Series. It's very straight forward, a bit too lengthy with too many characters and not enough character development."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, I'm so disgusted -- and above all, SAD -- after reading this book. For me, the only saving grace was that I checked it out from the library rather than buy it.The Dune books have been a reoccurring part of my life for the last 15 years -- every year or two I go on a Dune jag and read them all, one after the other, a wonderful, excessive spice binge that never gets old. My wife thinks I'm so weird to do this, but in a way that I can't well explain, they are very integral to my way of thinking. Heck, they even make me dream up ideas for conserving water. But I digress.The first 3 books herbert jr and anderson wrote were not bad -- not the polished gems of the original series, but also still clearly their progeny. But this new Butlerian Jihad book, such a bastardization...there's plenty of science fiction that's pure shlock, and that's ok, as Shel Silverstein would say, \\"after you've been having steak for a long time, beans beans taste fine\\"...but this is frank herbert, DUNE!!, we're talking about here and the boys should not have gone and produced such literay defication in our beloved Dune universe. Yes, I'm ranting, but that's how gross and without redeeming virtue Jihad is...I remember thinking during one particularly superficial section that this was just bad Dune parody.I remember back when I learned that Brian Herbert would continue the Dune series after his father's death -- I was so glad because I wanted to know what happened next, I didn't want it to end...now after this most recent book, I'm hoping that they never decide to risk telling more of the \\"future\\" of Dune. That's one prescient vision I can do without."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"After I finished this book (which didn't take long) I resolved that this was the LAST one I was ever going to waste my money on. I've put up with these new Dune books, knowing they were mediocre and enjoying them as a guilty pleasure but this one is the last straw. Frank Herbert's characters had intricacies yet they were unknowable, mysterious, but these people in the Butlerian Jihad are a bore; heroes and damsels in distress that are as flat and boring as the paper they are written on. The imagery reeks of concepts lifted straight from Star Wars (AT-ATs anyone?) and plot holes. How could the Guild wield so much power in the future if space travel seemed just as convenient before the Spice? This book should have been a mythological juggernaut, but it's just a pulp bore. And to add insult to injury, not only does it not dish up half of what the book jacket promises but it ends on a cliffhanger so they can sell us more books. No thanks, guys."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Addicted as I am to the Dune books, like the spice, I felt compelled to purchase and read the book. How, oh how, can this be worse than the previous prequels? Other reviewers have noted the linear, uninspired plot and characters. Certainly, this is true, but more maddening is that in the hands of Son of Frank the legend becomes something of a joke. And there is more to come--notice the *forthcoming books in the series? Lovers of the originals pray for reproductive technology to advance quickly enough to replace the current undynamic team of writers with a ghola of the original Herbert.Money is one reason authors write books. If this is the motivation, fine, but the Herbert family should accept royalties and find an author or authors who would at least work to keep Frank Herbert's vision alive."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Jesus only hung on the cross for three days. I have read four hundred and fifty-four PAGES of Dune: The Butlerian Jihad.And I did it to save your soul....When I was ten years old I was quite precocious. I read and loved Asimov's Foundation trilogy, and had a voracious appetite for new books. So I picked up Frank Herbert's Dune without a second thought.I never saw it coming.A hundred pages later I was startled to feel tears pouring down my young face; tears of pure frustration. The book was hard, too hard and complex for my ten-year-old mind to cope with. In a fit of fury, I threw the book across the room.I hated Dune for years. Herbert, too. But my reading speed is way too fast, so by the time I was sixteen or so I couldn't avoid reading some other Herbert books. Not in the Dune series, of course - the memory of those tears still stung - but Whipping Star. It was also hard, quite complex, but not (I thought) as hard as Dune had been. It certainly made me think.And more and more I came to realize that it was a damned impressive book, one worth reading again and again. The concepts were difficult to grasp, but each re-reading brought something new, a fuller understanding; and it was a really good book. So I looked up the sequel (also good, although not quite as endearing). I looked up other short stories that Herbert had set in the same universe. Excellent, and all too rare. From there it was natural to move into Herbert's other short science fiction; the early stuff was a little bit clunky and formulaic, but the later stories were masterful and quite deep.And so of course I found myself moving, step by step, back to Dune.And it was good.Not perfect, but very very good indeed; it could easily even be called \\"great\\". Over the years my mind had developed enough to be able to take on Frank Herbert's vision and comprehend it. I went on to read all the books in the series, and while some of the later ones were uneven, I enjoyed them all.Cut to 2003. I am desperately poor, struggling to pay the mortgage and support my family (including our toddler) on a single income. This is a deadly situation. Where once I went to Avenue Victor Hugo and other great used bookstores at least two or three times a week and bought a dozen books at a time, now I haven't picked up even ONE new book - new or used - in months.Thank Shai-Halud for the public library! I hadn't been to the library in years, but I started taking Sebastian (my son) there on Saturday mornings. He loved it. While the Woonsocket library is comparatively small and poorly-stocked, it still has a number of books worth reading - and of course far more are available through inter-library loan.Since I spend two hours a day on the train, I need lots of reading material...so I've been taking out a lot of books. I'll write about most of them later, but right now there's one that is crying, screaming, howling for treatment.The Son Is Not The FatherOh dear god. I cannot express the horror. The sheer... stupidity that is Dune: The Butlerian Jihad. Frank Herbert wrote with incredible depth and complexity, giving hints of a world far deeper than the portion he showed in his books. It gave a feeling of magic, a sensation of thousands of years of unknown (and unknowable) history underlying every paragraph. At the same time he took elements of modern culture and extrapolated from them brilliantly.I will be kind to Brian Herbert, Frank's son. His hands should not be cut off. He simply commited the sin of cashing in on his famous father's talent, and prostituting his family name - which is unforgivable, since he isn't a writer. But he should never have been allowed to \\"write\\" a book, particularly not a Dune book.Good god, he sucks. The writing is dreadful; where his father's prose was complex, Brian's is not just simplistic, but downright childish - even moronic. Where Frank used hidden depths to intrigue and add luster, Brian has taken many of those elements and simply ruined them, directly tying them to modern Earth issues and repeating them over and over. Frank had the gift of names, occasionally tying them in with ancient Earth history; Brian names ALL of his characters after famous historical figures from Earth history, for NO &^%#ing REASON.Ah yes. Over and over. The degree of repetition in this hellish book is more extreme than anything I have ever seen in my life. EVERY point is hammered home with astonishingly dull and lifeless prose, and then repeated again every twenty pages or so. EVERY moral point (cretinous as they are) is made so clear that a vegetable couldn't help but get it, and then repeated again a few dozen times for good measure.Let me give you a taste of what I went through:PARODY:The mighty robot Evil Badd entered the room. As he did, his mekkano-taste-probe tasted the brain of the baby human child he was gnawing on. The blonde-haired, blue-eyed tot had died in Evil Badd's cruel mekkano-claw with scarcely a whimper. The lovely human slave Beauty Goode looked up listlessly at the entry of the mighty and evil robot.\\"Ah-ha, Beauty Goode, I see you have awoken from what you humans call \\"unconsciousness\\", said Evil Badd. \\"I am Evil Badd, your new master. I am a robot. I like to eat babies. Some think that I am evil and bad. But I am a robot of pure logic.\\"\\"Yes, Master\\", said Beauty Goode submissively. Secretly she thought \\"I must find a way to resist the evil Evil Badd. He is evil, and that could be...bad!\\"\\"Mind if I rip your uterus out for no reason, and eat your baby?\\" asked Evil Badd, ripping out Beauty Goode's uterus with his rapacious mekkano-claw.Sorry to inflict that on you. But what you have just read is ONE THOUSAND TIMES BETTER than the hundreds pages of fetid so-called writing that I had to wade through.Ah, but nothing could prepare me for the horror of3. 2. 4.Page 324, not a parody this time but the ACTUAL TEXT:[There has been a huge accident, and a number of slaves have been killed. The nobles look on at the carnage.]\\"In a wry voice, Bludd said, \\"Not one of your most successful efforts, Tio.\\"\\"But you must admit, the concept shows promise, Lord Bludd. Look at the destructive potential,\\" Holtzman said, looking at the unruffled nobles without even considering the dead and injured slaves. \\"We can be thankful that no one was hurt.\\"Get it? There were lots of dead slaves, but the nobles were saying that no one was hurt! That's irony! Get it? Don't you GET IT, you moron?I'll give Brian Herbert this: he certainly knows his audience.Okay. Now, apart from the fact that any book with a character named \\"Lord Bludd\\" should automatically earn the death penalty for its authors, please note that the authors nonetheless feel it necessary to point out the TOTALLY OBVIOUS. \\"without even considering the dead and injured slaves\\" - gosh, thanks for pointing out that irony, because we readers are SO STUPID that we'd have missed it, yes sirree!I don't know if the authors assumed that the readers were total morons, or if they're just so incredibly stupid themselves that they didn't realize that hammering the irony breaks it.Enough. I've tortured myself enough with this astonishingly inept and painful book. Let it be noted that some moron named Kevin J. Anderson co-wrote it, and that since he is NOT related to Frank Herbert, there is no reason that his hands shouldn't be cut off. Supposedly he has written 29 national bestsellers. If that's the case, it only justifies my belief that virtually all modern genre fiction is utter garbage.Speaking of which, The New York Times, The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Oregonian, Kirkus Reviews, Booklist, and Publishers Weekly all apparently have had rave reviews of the new \\"Dune\\" books, according to excerpts printed on the back cover. Unless these have been taken wildly out of context or out-and-out fabricated, they merit the death penalty for every one of these publications and everyone associated with them. It need not be painful; I am not vengeful by nature. As long as they never kill a single tree or brain cell with their so-called \\"writing\\" ever again.That is all."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"This is a review solely of the quality of the Kindle version of the book. I am still reading it so this review does not touch on the story, but rather the lack of quality of proof-reading the Kindle version.It certainly seems to me that the publisher did not re-format the printed version, especially where individual words were hyphenated because of line spacing issues on the printed pages, so there are needless and distracting hyphenations throughout the book. Also, just today I ran across the words \\"for ward\\" when they really were intended to be \\"forward\\". This Kindle version of the book is full of errors and I certainly think that the publisher should subject the text to a word processor for formatting and possible grammar errors, but mostly for the bad hyphenation issues.I may come back and either amend this review or write a new review concerning the content of the book. But first I need to com-plete it."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"This book you delve into the adventures of shallow characters, predicatable plots, and an incredibly dumb computer. But honestly, I am a sci-fi freak, and I find the book entertaining, but I wish for so much more...Some points that were knawing at me were:- if the computer AI Omnius is obsessed with efficiency, why keep humans around? I always imagined the Omnius to be some sort of caretaker, so as this is not the case, the overall plot foundation doesn't make sense.- characters seem to be too predicatable and scripted. It's as if they are acting out some bad play, and not acting naturally within their environment.- the military seems utterly incompetent. It's like keystone cops. The main hero Xavier figures out the obvious, and gets promoted. Miltary discipline, military science, and military tactics seem to be lost human developments.- if Omnius wants to take out the main League capital, why not use mass drivers on the planet or bombard the shield scramblers from space. High-school science seems non-existant for the machines.For the more sophisticated thinkers, this books flaws will leap out and haunt you, and to those that feel Frank Herbert's is the untouchable testimant, then this book is sacriledge. Those ignorant of grade school science, culture, and/or sociology, or with the power to set these things aside for a moment, then this book is entertaining."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Not the best book I've read lately.The pack of gum I picked up was a little more interesting, to be perfectly honest.Brian Herbert inherited his father's name and the license for the Dune Series, but obviously, talent does skip a generation.The plot has -a lot- of promise. Here and there, you see glimmers of hope. The characters are flat and uninteresting. There are five main &quot;good guys&quot; and three &quot;bad guys.&quot; THe good guys are Serena Butler, this overly active politician's daughter who gets herself into amazingly unlikely situations, and although a skilled orator, fairly bright... lacks common sense again and again. Then, there's Xavier Harokonen, who lost his taste buds in an accident. Vorian Atreides, the turn-coat, turned from Evil to Good by falling in love with Serena. Oh, and she happens to be married to Xavier... who, when she vanishes, dumps her for her sister. There's Iblis, the suddenly made rebel of Earth.... And, Selim Wormrider.For bad guys, there are the robots. The Cymek Leader, Agammemnon, father of Vorian Atreides (from sperm banks, 10000 years old). He's a liar, evil, etc. etc. Erasmus, the butchering robot, and Omnius... the &quot;Ever Mind.&quot;No character strikes out as memorable.There's no Duncan Idaho, no Stilgar, none of them that you look forward to hearing about, mourn, or worry about.Every plot twist is predictable. Selim has a magical vision at the end, lacking the explanation or depth of Paul's.The slave revolts in the Robot Controled Words and the Free Worlds just-so-happen to coincide, attempting to present a parallel, which is lost and seems just coincidental.The story is juvenile and bloody in many points.One of the cymek's rips out someone's heart.There are revolting descriptions of vulgar disections and vivisections -- perhaps the only place of significant detail.I've still no real idea what Erasmus looks like.But I know what a bucket full of entrails looks like. ANd how loud the slaves will scream while they're removed.Thank you, Brian Herbert for that wonderful peice of information."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Comparing this novel with the works of Frank Herbert is unfair: the original DUNE series were deeply written, complicated, and unspoiled by science fiction cliches. THE BUTLERIAN JIHAD is mostly shallow and predictable.This \\"prequel\\" is an easy read, much more like a screenplay in its cinematic style, written with short scenes, all the perfect length for a coffee break. The story jumps from character to character, a dizzying cast spanning the galaxy.For me, the fore-shadowing and predictability of the story was a distraction. I very much wanted to guess at the connections... instead the novel gives you very few surprizes, usually laying out in the previous chapter the events which unfold in the next with unwavering accuracy.It also seems somewhat convenient that all of the pivotal events which will lead up to the galaxy as it is known in Frank Herbert's DUNE series are set up in this time. The importance of spice, the origins of the Bene Gesserit, the creation of personal shields, the first person on Arrakis to ride a sandworm... too many events happening too closely together.Still, I enjoyed it in many ways. I am not a die-hard DUNE fan, and picked this one up with some hope for a good read. I was satisfied with what I had read without being thrilled. But I can easily imagine a movie adaptation coming out of this series of books...And it didn't hurt much that this book was released on my birthday. A nice gift to myself. :D"},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Although not exactly the scenario I had envision for the Butlerian Jihad (Omnius seems a bit too malleable, I mean sometime he acts like a typical cold calculative machine, while other time he's more prone to &quot;emotions&quot;) it nevertheless covers a rich part of the Dune universe.I wouls love if Herbert and Anderson would cover the begining of the Old empire. But I digress. All and all, a fairly good book and a must for the Dune-philes out there!"},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"The original Dune series and the first three prequels sewed the tantilizingly obscure seeds of the ancient man vs. machine conflict called the Butlerian Jihad. Everything that happens later has its origins there. Clearly the Jihad was THE event that shaped the Dune universe.I grabbed this new prequel the week it was released. I was expecting an epic, tourtured narrative of mankinds near extermination a la Benford's &quot;Great Sky River.&quot; What I got was brains floating in jars, seriously. How 1950s sci-fi cliche is that? These poor plot choices combined with no real ending made this an agonizing read. I just never believed that THIS scenario created the Dune universe. This is a pulp novel of the disposable kind. Not a bad read in and of itself, but not really worthy of the Dune legacy. I'm going to pretend it didn't happen."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I always preface a review of the Dune prequels not written by Frank Herbert with a reminder that the reader cannot expect these books to be on the same par with Frank Herbert's Dune series. Frank Herbert created the Duniverse, it was his vision, his baby so while his son can accentuate that, he cannot do the same kind of job. If you go into reading these books keeping in mind exactly what these books are and aren't, they will be much more enjoyable.I do love the idea of fleshing out all of the things the original Dune series refers to. I have always wondered just what happened in the Butlerian Jihad and the war with the machines. I think that the Dune universe is so large, spanning so much time, that to go back that far in time makes it necessary to create a great many threads that will tie into the Dune tapestry and that makes for a very large bundle. The story is interesting and it creates a platform for those things that are so integral to the later Dune books.The one real complaint I have is that there are too many threads to keep track of in one book and it, at times, becomes so fragmented that it's distracting. The chapters were divided well keeping that in mind but I think that a great deal of the storyline wasn't necessary to the story."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I am conflicted about this book. Of course, like all of the new Dune books, they shouldn't be compared to the old Dune series. Frank Herbert was a genius, and it is unlikely that others would have been able to measure up. Therefore, it is not right to judge them by the standard of the old series.Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson are ambitious in this book because they are writing on an almost completely clean slate. In the previous books, they were writing about characters that had appeared in the original Dune book such as Leto Atreides, Vladimir Harkonnen, Duncan Idaho and others and their immediate ancestors. Here, the authors created new characters with only the hints Frank Herbert had dropped about the Butlerian Jihad to guide them.The authors of this book nevertheless came up with interesting characters, a lush vision of the universe, hints about plot lines that might or might not be developed, and some sizzling action scenes.A few things can be improved. The development of Vorian Atreides throughout the book will seem improbable to readers. Frank Herbert sketched a deeply religious Butlerian Jihad, which would make sense given how much faith and will is necessary to overturn an entire social order. Brian Herbert and Anderson talk about a Butlerian Jihad that has almost no religious content, except as an afterthought in a speech. Of course, leaders can, of course, cynically use religion, but they have to lay a groundwork and people have to feel the fervor for it to catch on.But these are minor criticisms. As one reviewer put it, we do want to learn about the Butlerian Jihad, and the authors do a very credible job of bringing it to life."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Having read the &quot;House&quot; trilogy, and found them engaging but silly, I definitely preferred &quot;The Butlerian Jihad.&quot; The characters were multi-faceted and believable (including, for once, the women, though less so the inevitable boy heroes) Also, it's a thrill to see the prototypes of the inventions and institutions that transformed Earth of today into Dune of ten thousand years hence. Brian Herbert will never match his father's monumental complexity, his historical ambiguity (history 10000 years old should be ambiguous, and if Brian's &amp; Kevin's books stray from the &quot;facts&quot; in the original Dune series, that would be more natural than following exactly, particularly since history is always written by the victorious); however, Brian &amp; Kevin have their own styles, great in their own way. They are perhaps less visionary, but much more personal -- and fun!"},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Never compare any of the Dune prequals to the original Dune series. The original can be considered the epitome of Science Fiction literature, while the prequals can be considered space opera. Sometimes, a science fiction reader may need space opera. If the reader keeps remembering that Dune prequals like \\"the Butlerian Jihad\\" are written by different authors in different styles, he won't set himself up for disappointment.The Butlerian Jihad may be the weakest of the Dune prequals. In an attempt to explain the beginnings of elements from the original series, the authors may have focused on plot over character. As a result, some of the characters are puppets, thrown here and there just to explain the beginnings of favorite Dune relationships and icons like the Space Guild or the Bene Gesserit.If the reader can get past some of the common cliches found in science fiction--like robots taking over--and keep in mind this is not Frank Herbert writing this book, he will probably enjoy this interpretation of Dune history."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Keep in mind that Brian is NOT Frank Herbert. If you fully understand this fact, &quot;The Butlerian Jihad&quot; gives the reader a fascinating glimpse of what Frank Herbert had only briefly touched on in his epic series of &quot;Dune&quot; classics.This book gives insight into the future feud between what will become two Great Houses in the time of Muad'dib.

Something I'd like to read on a plane or oil rig.Reads like a Micheal Crichton novel, fast paced, superficial character development and techno backdrop forced into a Dune framework. Like the House trilogy, this had the same prequel formula, parallel character development leading into a dramatic culmination of events at the end with enough (prequel) sequel nuclei scattered throughout. The obligatory philosophical chapter quote sprinkles started getting blase at the last few chapters.Origins of the Evermind and thinking machines reeked too much of Terminator's SkyNet execept SkyNet had more believeble storyline.Reading the book leaves me with the feeling that Herbert and Anderson are going to milk this cash cow for the next 4-5 years.Will I buy the next Legends of Dune? Sure, Dune's an addiction that I can't kick."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Despite what you've read elsewhere, this book doesn't answer any of the questions that you might expect. The only real item from this era covered thorougly in this book is Holtzmann, and he comes across as a standard scientist character (see other reviews).The beginnings of the Sisterhood are hinted at, folding space is touched on, the origins of the Bene Theliax are explored a bit. And that's about it. The whole book spends its time setting up things, but not explaining anything. Yeah, there's a backstory of the Jihad itself but that's not why Dune fans bought the book.The Mentats aren't brought out, the use of Melange by the Sisterhood isn't explored (they shun drugs at this point), the Harkkonen betrayal, the Guild, the final extermination of the computer minds, and many other things are all left up in the air......for a sequel."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Finally!

I remember as a kid, filled with wonder upon hearing Obi Wan relate to young Luke Skywalker in the cave about the \\"Clone Wars.\\" The mystical backdrop music heightened my sensation of mystery. When I heard that the Star Wars prequels were coming out, I grew fascinated. Same thing with Dune. When I read the original Dune, the best science fiction novel I ever read, I kept reading references to the Butlerian Jihad, some supposed epic battle in the distant past that shaped the universe into which Paul and the Fremen would arise. Naturally, I wanted to find out how the Fremen came to be, the origins of Bene Jesserit, and about the overthrow of the thinking machines. It is too bad that Frank didn't stay alive long enough to write the epic battles of the Butlerian Jihad.Many reviewers are critical of this work. Though they admit that comparing to Frank Herbert is unfair, given his unparalelled genius, they then put down the novel as not fulfilling the mission it sets to accomplish: provide a background for the Dune universe. What you got to understand about Kevin J. Anderson is that he is what I call a good \\"franchise writer,\\" that is, someone who is not known for being particularly creative, but good at expanding the universes of others with action-filled sub plots. I read his Jedi Academy Trilogy and enjoyed it for what it was, a development of Luke Skywalker after Return of the Jedi. Kevin J. Anderson has a talent for keeping plots moving at a certain pace that makes it hard to put the book down, once you get into it. Though some parts of Butlerian Jihad are tedius and slow, you keep reading to get to the good parts. I liked Selim the best, as a character and a forerunner to Paul Atreides. Though Butlerian Jihad lacks the mysticism of the original Dune, it is a good link between the dry and taudry world of the Old Empire and the fantastic world of Paul Atreides. Against incredible odds, humans rise to the plate and become heroic, and it is interesting to see that.That being said, I think some of the descriptions and filler text can be redundant. I think this same story could have been told in a book half its whopping length of 675 pages.Butlerian Jihad is broader and more wide-sweeping than the first Dune novel; whereas Dune specifically focuses on Arrakis and a few other planets, Butlerian Jihad takes you on an oddysey of many worlds throughout the galaxy, although giving each shallower treatments. If Frank Herbert's Dune was a scoop of the best Italian gelato, doing one flavor with expertise and tradition, then Butlerian Jihad is a sampling of 31 different flavors, at Baskin and Robbins. It is not Frank Herbert. But it is what it is."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"People should buy this book because it's a Dune book and you might as well read it to keep up-to-date on the Dune Universe.However, after reading this book for the first time, I must say that I was pretty disappointed, and not even judging it by Frank Herbert's series, but by the other Dune prequels (Harkonnen, Atreides, Corrino).1) The characters were very uninteresting because their motivations were pretty simplistic and not very novel/unique. These characters were like out of a video game or like a comic book (i.e. shallow). For example, the Sorceresses of Rossak are written so that they seem more like the X-Men as opposed to the precursors to the Bene Gesserit.2) The events that occur are pretty linear and straightforward, none of Frank Herbert's intriguing wheels-within-wheels plot developments that makes Dune thought-provoking. Even events of significance (Holtmann's discoveries, Earth's destruction) are written based on generic characters (e.g. typical mad scientist behavior/the easiest way to win is more firepower)...."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"First things first let's level with each other. The fact that you're reading reviews probably means you're like me: You loved the original series, want to know about the Dune Universe pre-Great House Era, but are unsure if you really want to wade through this book.OK, so let's level.1. No, this in no way compares to Herbert the elder. Sorry.The style of writing is much more short and episodic, it lacks that sort of motif based symphony Frank used. This is much more for a generation of Tv watchers and writers. Mini episodes cut between points of action (The Free Worlds, Earth, on a Ship, Arrakis, rinse repeat).As such you don't have that feeling you had in dune where rising actions continued and then reached a few critical climaxes and faded away.2. You really want to know what the Butlerian Jihad is. It's a great complling force in Frank's books and you want to know what happened. This book definitely moves in the direction of filling in those gaps.In all truth, however, i think that most of us would have been satified with a Princess Irulan book: \\"The history of Pre-Great House Dune.\\" I mean, had it narrated the facts of this book, it would have been *equally* as entertaining. In fact, this book is really a high school science fair 'play-dress-up' of actual interesting events.3. It does cater to stereotypes and safe political waters. Urge for freedom, that humans are creative an passionate while machines are cold, etc. is familiar ground. Some interesting points were brought up: where do a mechanized human's loyalies lie - man or machine, body mind dichotomies. While Frank H. would have explored these interesting issues, the more pulp style of this series goes the safe route.A few thoughts I have about Dune and allegory on my web site draws a steady stream of hits day in and day out. There is no possible allegory here. Furthermore, Frank wrote a great deal about the power of numbers, how fanaticism and fundamentalism can be harnessed -- things that made one think months afterward -- I'm not going to think about this book again (likely).Consider how many sci-fi books have been written about when the machines take over. The authors of the Butlerian Jihad could have written one as well. Frank Herbert had the amazing vision to ask -- OK what would happen /after that/. That's the difference between just a couple of guys who wrote a story and a master.So in sum. Wait for paperback, don't think that this is going to greatly enrich your experience of the Dune universe, simply view it as a pulp story that will give you a bit of back history on the great houses. That said, the House books were a sight better and this series, should it maintain its present course, will merely be an interesting backstory to them."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I grew up on Dune. I actually loved all the books, up to Chapterhouse: Dune.What I've always liked about the Dune series is it's sheer believability and consistency. The complexity of it's storyline and characters made the books a challenge to read and understand - but well worth the effort.Enter Brian Herbert. I had read \\"Man of Two Worlds\\", which was a collaboration he did with his dad - and was amazed at the difference. It [was very bad]. The story was a joke. It had some interesting ideas, but I have a feeling they came from Herbert Sr.Now - I just read the 3 Dune \\"House\\" novels. The series had some promise in the beginning, but it quickly decayed into typical and mediocre mass-market space opera for which Kevin J. Anderson is well known. Now - if you like the innumerable Star Trek and Star Wars series out there - you'll probably love this. But to me, franchise stories lack any kind of real passion and creativity. Being a fan of the originals - I stuck it out. Read the 3 books, and tried to like them. But the awful truth is that they're [garbage] - filled with transparent plots, one dimensional characters, and a complete disregard when convenient for Frank Herbert's original ideas.So - with some trepidation, I approached the new book. It covered one of the most intriguing periods of the Dune timeline.I could not begin to comprehend how this book got released. Why would a publisher have a complete hack ghost-write an incompetent wanna-be, when there is so much excellent writing talent out there?What would Gregory Benford or Stephen Baxter (or anyone of the numerous writers of their caliber) have made of this project?The characterization of the Titans is laughable. And the sentient machines should be called \\"Artificial Sort-of Roman Hedonist Bad Guys\\". There are some solid ideas which obviously came from Frank Herbert in there - but the rest is fluff.\\"Oh the machines are soooo bad, and they're kicking the humans' collective [butt]... I wonder how the humans will triumph?!?!?!\\".I'd say skip it unless you're a devoted Dune fan, or like the first three in the series. But then again, if you liked those books you probably thought \\"The Phantom Menace\\" and \\"Attack of the Clones\\" were good.If you want to read some good books about humans struggling against machines, I'd recomend William Barton's \\"When Heaven Fell\\", Dan Simmon's \\"Hyperion\\" series, and Brian Stableford's \\"The Omega Expedition\\". Or for a slightly different take, Karl Schroeder's \\"Ventus\\" - and of course, the originator of the idea: Fred Saberhagen's \\"Berzerker\\" series."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"When the first installment of Dune appeared in Analog magazine way back in 1963, I was immediately captivated. I remained enthralled through all the succeeding seven installments, fascinated by the complex interplay of science, politics, religion, economics, ecology and their manipulation by all the various sharply realized characters. As the sequels came out over the years, I found some good, some not so good, but all, including the recent three 'prequels' written by the two authors of this book, at least deserving of existing in the same universe as the original work. Not so with this book.The idea of this book is to bring to life that period in the history of man when machine intelligences ruled most of the human occupied worlds, a period referenced multiple times in the original book, and the supposed origin of both the Bene Geserit and Mentat schools as a reaction to such machine domination. Unfortunately, this book fails miserably at its chosen task for multiple reasons.The first major problem with this book is the characterization. Everyone here is a paper-thin caricature of a human being, from Xavier Harkonnen to Vorian Atreides and everyone in-between. Most of these people are introduced with a short physical description, perhaps a couple sentences to describe their pasts, and are given 'tasks' that pretty much totally define what they are, from Xavier as a military commander to Tio Holtzman as the fading scientist. There is little or no growth of these characters, other than the totally predictable change of heart that Vorian goes through. Dialogue between these people is almost totally limited to the task at hand, with few if any things that would convince me that these were humans talking rather than machines.Then there is the depiction of the machine intelligences Erasmus and the Omnius. Supposedly their great problem is that they can often be defeated by mere humans because they can neither understand nor predict human behavior. But they've had more than a thousand years in control to observe humans, and as one of the definitions of intelligence is the ability to learn from experience, I found this whole scenario impossible to believe. Some of the 'experiments' that Erasmus performs to help him understand human behavior I found both gross and pointless, coming across very much like the gratuitous violence of a bad movie attempting to hide its failings.The story is told in very short chapters, shifting viewpoint character with each chapter. This technique can be effective, as A. E. van Vogt showed so many years ago with his massively re-complicated stories, but to make it work you need either very strong characters or a very complicated, non-obvious plot that can be built in layers, neither of which applies here.The 'science' here is on par with the rest of this book. I thought lines like 'the ship threaded a narrow course through the asteroid belt' and spaceships performing U-turns went out with 1930's pulp science fiction. In fact, this whole book reads as if it was written specifically for a no-brainer Hollywood SF special effects spectacular, and to heck with anything approaching reality or literary depth.This book doesn't deserve to have 'Dune' in the title.--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"While many readers poo-pooed the Dune prequel trilogy, I really enjoyed it. The stories and characterisations were interesting and they opened up the background to me as well. With this experience in mind, I was happy to treat myself to The Butlerian Jihad. This event, dropped into the original Dune story in dribs and drabs, has always spoken to me because of it's epochal effect on the Dune universe. Dune's characters all suffered from the same interesting prejudice in that they hated machines due to the Butlerian Jihad. Their very piousness was rooted in blind prejudice and this made them extremely interesting because they were so obviously flawed. A sci-fi universe with no thinking machines was ground breaking stuff and I'd been looking forward to reading about it and the great figures of the time (Tio Holtzman etc) for many years.I've nearly finished the book and have to say so far I'm disappointed because it's just too one dimensional. The book for starters begins at the beginning of the end. The old empire has already fallen and Human planets face off against the robot ones (the Synchronised Worlds). The humans are clearly goodies and the robots (and their lackeys) are obvious baddies with very few shades of grey inbetween the characters at all.Likewise, the storyline offers very few genuine surprises. Many plot threads and facts are explained in depth by the authors as they happen. This happens enough times that the reader recognises a pattern and can easily notice the instances where a plot thread is introduced and the authors then fail to immediately explain it (eg the 2nd transmission towers on Giedi Prime). You just know why it will come up later on and this precognition effect destroys the suspense.The hardest task for the authors has been to create robot characters (would robots be individuals?) who are alien - the human brained cymeks making a good exception. An easy quandry to understand becasue if the robots are too alien, they will be too hard for a reader to understand and connect with. This seems to be the reason why the authors create characters like Erasmus, an independantly minded robot who aims to study human-ness. However Erasmus is inconsistantly portrayed and the authors slip up at times. For example Erasmus tries to create art but cannot comprehend the creative process and **in frustration** tears the canvas apart.The robots act inexplicably human despite all the assertions to their machine intellect. Instead of a machine mind (such as the Borg or in the Matrix) they act surprisingly dumb and fail to utilise their machine advantages that we so often read about (longevity, lack of emotion, productivity etc). Instead, they keep human slaves for menial tasks when machines would be far more efficient and much logistically cheaper, they allow human slaves to work in extremely critical areas, they limit themselves to worlds that support human life, they do not outstrip the humans in productivity, the machine overmind (Omnius) often communicates verbally rather than via any machine link, the machine minds to not actively seek to gain information other than a paltry few spy drones and the machines make tactical decisions that are worse than unimaginative because they aren't even based on cold logic. For example on Giedi Prime they open their assault with a \\"brilliant tactic\\" by using a sacrifical kamikaze cruiser to destroy a ground target. Asteroids (as used in Niven and Pournelle's \\"Footfall\\") would be far more effective (and efficient).I really wanted to enjoy this book. So far I'm singularly unimpressed with the threat of the robots because they aren't much worse than the one dimensional mechanical badguys found in the Transformers cartoons."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I'll just start by saying that I'm glad other Dune readers are not treating the material from the prequels as 'canon'. Despite the fact that Brian Herbert shares the blood of Frank Herbert, it was Herbert Senior who had the true vision and the philosophical mindset to write the books in a meaningful, thought provoking way.This review is not to disparage Brian Herbert's writing ability. I merely noticed that while reading Herbert Senior's Dune, humans were at the center of the story. It was a story about human society and human abilities.Somehow, the image F. Herbert painted of the Butlerian Jihad was something more akin to a religious explosion. B. Herbert's vision seems to be the 'typical' sci-fi fare of evil machine villains, like Terminator II..with one difference. Arguably, the Terminator series would be a better precursor to the original Dune than the Butlerian Jihad is. Mainly because the creators of the Terminators were human, and the Terminator programs were created by technological increases in mechanical logic. Thus, Terminators are 'thinking' robots. Even the Borg from Star Trek would serve as a better precursor to Dune-the combination of human and technological for 'perfection' at the loss of human qualities would state the story better.However, B. Herbert's take of evil robotic supervillains seems more like a typical science fiction ploy. Not to give the story away, but some scenes in which the robotic villains take part seem like those scenes in Saturday morning cartoons where all the supervillains stand together and laugh evilly for no reason at all while they plan a plan that makes no sense except to show how evil they are.I would consider 'A Brave New World' or '1984' MUCH better examples of the way to set up Dune. Dune has never been about 'traditional' science fiction plot points. It seems almost a shame that the prequels seem to wallow in the sort of typical 'hero' vs. 'villain' storylines that Frank Herbert said he wanted to dispute with his series. I remember the brief essay F. Herbert wrote at the start of his branch of the series, regarding setting up heroes for worship.There is a central weakness to the prequels that perpetuate 'conventional' plot lines and character types at the expense of the greater coherence of the story. The main differences I've noted I will list here:EG: If Gaius Helen Mohiam was Jessica's mother, Jessica, Paul, Alia, Ghanima and Leto II would have had her in their Other Memory. This is not the case. I don't have my book with me, but I recall in God Emperor, F. Herbert made a big point in showing Letos' knowledge of the Bene Gesserit breeding lines when he said: \\"Tertius Eileen Anteac, you descendant of Gaius Helen Mohiam...\\" in the throne room scene. This shows that Mohiam is clearly NOT related to the Atreides, but belongs to a parrallel breeding line.EG: Baron Harkonnen was disposed to fat, and lived a life of excess. Thus, the prequel explanation for how this came to be goes against the evidence in Dune and Children of Dune. Lady Margot, the BG Breeding Mistress, remarked that the Baron 'let himself go to fat', while Alia put on extra weight after being possessed by the Baron.EG: Mohiam in the original series was one of the few Reverend Mothers with the Sight. Don't forget that a specific point made in book I of the series, was that she HAD to interview Paul Atreides because at this time in the books, not every Reverend Mother had access to some of her Other Memories. This distinction would call attention to the possibility that access to ancestral memories was no common among all RMs until God Emperor, when Leto II took control of the breeding program, leaving the bene Gesserit to refine their reflexes, sexual imprinting and memory abilities. So, if Mohiam was Jessica's mother, in the Paul/Gaius Helen scene in book 1, she would have noted that they were related; all Reverend Mothers with the Sight knew whom they were related to. They just could not always see the entirety of the Bene Gesserit design. You could argue that Helen Gaius was killed on Arrakis without being able to pass on her Other Memories...however, you would be arguing for this point rather than against it: you only had to Share other memories with people not related to you; if there was a genetic relationship, that person would already be a part of your ancestral memories. I'm sure that when Jessica confronted all of her female relatives, she would have seen Gaius Helen sitting there. Even Paul did not see Gaius among his ancestors, and he had a more complete access to Other Memory than Jessica did.I think B. Herbert's prequels are a good, typical 'sci fi' read. But it is merely interesting to point out that many hard core 'sci fi' readers don't enjoy the original Dune series because of the human-centric storylines.This book, and the prequels gets two stars. This book in particular could have been improved if the story was crafted in a way that the Jihad seemed more religious than a typical war. Perhaps if spaceship life support had developed into mechanized city and planet terraforming, eventually turning into artificial life constructs typical of nine to five jobs, arbitrary assignments, and big-brother sort of acitivity (Imagine the possibilities if B. Herbert had written the machines as a supercomputer created by humans to take away the problem of untrustworthy humans in government? - I envision a potential in my vision that would explain the Bene Gesserit's origins...machine made instructions as to population control and breeding lost the male Bene Gesserat powers of ancestral awareness, while the Guild developed because spaceships 'autopilot' functions would not travel unless the central computer accepted the risk).I think the main problem with this story is that the robots are more super-villain than creation. B. Herbert should have showed why a religious term ('jihad') was used to describe the uprising rather than treating it as typical sci-fi fare a la The Phantom Menace/Attack of the Clones."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"First off, I would put these as a 4 of 5 except they have been so brutally misrepresented I wanted to hike the star average.That said, this trilogy is awesome! Is it Dune or God Emperor Dune? Of course not, but it's a really sweeping EPIC storyline that sets up so much of the original series, I dont see how anyone who likes the Dune books could HATE this series.I've read poor reviews claiming the characters are paper thin. DUH! This series runs some 130 years of timeline so when you meet Xavier Harkonnen, he's pretty simple. By the third book, his lifetime is a great read and uber complicated. No characters stay boring and static in this series except the Overmind, who's supposed to stay unwavering by design. If anything, the characters Vorian Atredies, Erasmus, Agammemnon, Iblis Ginjo, Serena Butler, Selim Wormrider, Ishmael, Aurelius Venport, and so many other characters are what make this series phenomenal.The robot Erasmus alone is worth the read and is the newest entry into my top 10 book characters of all time. A robot enigma who has stumbled upon self realization who emotionlessly butchers and tortures slaves in an attempt to understand humans. His ignorantly innocent attempts at art, manners, humor are generally terrifying and end in the death of someone(s), but then when his destruction seems imminent, I was actually worried for him! I wanted to read more! No book with characters that effective deserves 1 star!You can never tell where this book is going either. This series is really good at being predictible/unpredictable in the appropriate spaces. Sometimes the book does imply and bait you into expecting an events outcome, but even if it's the expected ending, it's never as simple as promised. These cool twists, mixed with the actual surprises that are constantly sprinkled throughout the trilogy kept me glued to these books. Sorry for being vague, I just dont want to ruin anything.Is the writing quality the greatest? No. It is very episodic and sometimes they can be lax on describing characters or giant killer robots. I did noticed the simplicity of the book when I first started and wondered if I'd made a mistake trusting others with the legacy of Dune. However, by the end of the first book and half way through the second, it became clear that this was the writers intention. And by the beginning of the third book, I had VERY clear mental images of characters, space ships, planets, etc. The descriptions of people come gradually over time rather than right up front when you first meet them, which obviously pissed off a lot of the 13 year olds who 1 starred this book. Ok, cheap shot, but I love this series, highly recommend, and many of the put downs this series recieved are cheap, snobbish, early misconceptions or just outright lies.Also, these books have a lot more action and gore than Frank Herbert ever wrote. We're talking billons massacared, statues made out of dead slaves, children being murdered, torture, vivasection, executions, all with some pretty vivd detail. Im not talking Brett Easton Ellis-vivid, but graphic. It can be taken as a good or bad point, but that's in my mind the biggest difference.You like Dune? This is a simpler, more violent series for sure, but the intertwining of the beginnings of the Space Guild, the Great Houses, the Bene Gesserit, the Thulaxa, Suks, Mentats, Fremen and so much more is really fun to read. Perfect? No. Enjoyable and well plotted? Absolutely."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I was waiting patiently for this book to come out after having read the House trilogy. When I got it, I finished it pretty quick because there is a lot of action and some interesting ideas. It was extremely easy to read and follow. However, I cannot help feeling that they did not hit the mark with this book. They were supposed to be taking us back in time in the Dune Universe to that pivotal time 10 000 years prior to the events of Dune. Somehow, they did not capture the mysticism of this legendary time. Truthfully, this book could have been written to stand on its own just by changing the characters' names and getting rid of the sandworms. It almost seems like they wrote it so that they could fill in the important preceding events with another series. Despite its grandiose title, The Butlerian Jihad, which was alluded to tantalizingly in Frank Herbert's novels, this book did not live up to my expectations in terms of developing the mythology and legends of Dune. But, being a die hard Dune fan, I did not regret buying it and will buy the upcoming novels in the series."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Having read Frank Herbert's original Dune series, I was interested to see what the authors of Dune: The Butlerian Jihad would have to contribute to this sprawling saga. The plot is engaging enough, providing detailed accounts of things only hinted at in FH's books (such as why Earth is spoken of in the past tense in those works), and there is much scope for wrestling with any number of issues in such a story.Unfortunately, this is where the good news ends. The prose style is banal and irritating, riddled with gloss* and laced with far too many adjectives; worse yet, Messrs. Herbert and Anderson seem to be overly fond of abstract adjectives, such as \\"ethereal\\" and \\"great\\", as if they believe that merely tossing such terms out can evoke what the words denote. The result is that it reads more like a Batman comic than like the kind of work the authors presumably intended it to be.Also, with the ironic exception of the evil robot Erasmus, almost none of the characters really came alive for me, despite all the adjectives the authors toss at them; I got frustrated at how little we are really allowed to understand the main characters' motivations and emotions as individuals.Moreover, the book has lots of the kind of beginning-of-chapter epigraphs that were a hallmark of the original Dune. This is a treacherous thing to attempt, and if a writer is going to attempt it, he or she had better really have something important and relevant to say. The elder Herbert did in fact have something of a knack for this, whereas the epigraphs in DTBJ strike me, for the most part, as fatuous and sophomoric, and would best have been omitted.In summary, what could have been a three- or four-star effort ended up as mere two-star pulp entertainment.If you are a hard-core Dune fan, and are interested in the plot for its own sake, then you might be interested in reading DTBJ; otherwise, you won't miss a great deal by giving it a pass.*Gloss: a hack literary device wherein the author either breaks out of narrative to deliver the reader a synopsis-like block of information, or else transparently and artifically manipulates dialogue to a similar end."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"When I first read the original Dune novels, I was amazed by the intracacies of the plot lines as well as the deep, almost mythical portent of Frank Herbert's words. The newer Dune novels do not recreate this. The plots seem fractured, as every short chapter changes plot lines like a movie cutting between scenes. The political intrigue present in even the \\"House\\" prequels is not manifest.Having said that, they are rather entertaining to read. The introduction of thinking machines and cymeks (machines with human brains) is a new and exciting direction for Dune. Humans and machines are fighting a great war for survival. A robot philosopher tries to understand the very essence of humanity itself. Xavier Harkonnen and Vorian Atreides meet for the first time. Both share a love for the same woman, hinting at the blood feud that will last for 10,000 years. Young Selim is cast into the deserts of Arrakis, where he learns to utilize and revere the great sandworm. Serena Butler is imprisoned on the conquered planet Earth, where she will spark the bloody revolt that changes the universe forever. There are several more plot lines in the novel (around 10 total, I think), and the dust jacket hints at more to come in the next novel.The Jihad has begun, but a war remains to be fought.

It was obvious that they had done heavy research for the story, so why on earth did they do such a poor job of telling the story?I don't think Frank Herbert's readers could get through his entire Dune saga without being more than capable of discerning complex ideas or they would have given up long before the first book ended, so why would these two take pages to repeat ad nauseum the ideas they wanted the reader to grasp? I felt that I was reading a bad retelling of a book that was already written.Since I loved all of Frank Herbert's work on the chronicles, I really appreciated all the new info that came across by his son and Kevin Anderson. But they screwed up the most impoertant part, which was to tell it in an intersting manner and let the reader \\"get it\\". I'm glad for the new information they presented, but surprised at how off the mark they were in their writing style(s). That ruined everything."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"This is the best Dune novel since Heretics of Dune, in my opinion. As I read through it, I couldn't help but think of it as a cross between Terminator 2: Rise of The Machines meets Dune: House Atreides. The Butlerian Jihad is a prequel to a prequel in that it takes place long BEFORE the events of Book 7: House Atreides. The good news for Dune fans is that it is the first book of another brand new Dune trilogy. The entire novel is based upon the first three pages, narrated by Princess Irulan, so I recommend you read those three pages twice.Frank Herbert mentioned \\"The Great Revolt\\" in previous Dune novels, and this is the story being told here. As time marches on, humans become increasingly dependent upon technology, and this dependancy seals their fate. A group of 20 humans, refering to themselves as \\"Titans,\\" turn technology against the Old Empire in the form of thinking machines with ambitions, to overthrow it via revolution. They conquered the better part of our galaxy. The leaders of this rebellion then turned around and had their brains surgically removed and placed into preservation canisters which could fit into a number mechanical bodies, known as \\"cymeks,\\" giving the Titans immortal life. They rule for 100 years until a sentient computer network known as \\"Omnious\\" overthrows the Titans before they have time to react. This widespread \\"Evermind,\\" a sentient computer network that is literally everywhere at once, all the time, enslaves humanity for a thousand years.There is a small group of humans who refer to themselves as The League of Nobles that fought and won hard bitter wars against Omnious and his cymeks, leaving them free and independent. The leader of this league is Viceroy Manion Butler, who has a daughter by the name of Serena, and a grandson by his same name. While Serena is on Earth with her son Manion, the leading cymek there, Erasmus, decides to run a few experiments on the petty enslaved humans, in the hopes of learing something about them while he studies them. Keep in mind now the cymeks have large metal bodies, armed to the teeth, and the humans have zero weapons as they've been conquered by the machines. As punishment against Serena for breaking the rules, Erasmus drops her baby son, Manion, over a balcony to his death right in front of everybody. This drives Serena into an all-consuming rage with total disreguard for her own life and she attacks Erasmus with nothing but guile, kicking him over the balcony and killing a cymek, which was something previously thought to be near impossible for ten men with weapons, let alone ONE woman with no weapons. Upon seeing a cymek destroyed for the very first time ever, the enslaved Earthlings go berzerk, killing cymeks all over the place. But not without a high cost: For every cymek destroyed, 10,000 humans perish. Frank Herbert mentioned the final fate of Earth in Dune, but he never told us how or why. This book answers that question. ..."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I was very disappointed by this book.

The biggest problem I have with this is that the reason I liked Frank Herbert's Dune series is because of the focus on ideas--this book seems like nothing more than a space opera. The characters were all shallow and unsympathetic. Sure there was action, but this was just a page-turner--I mean, sure, it was well-written, but it was very formulaic and predictable. I'll say this--if you love Dune, get it, if not, your money is better spent elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"When all is said and done, nothing compares to the science fiction work of Frank Herbert. Try as many might, they can can not match his writing scheme. Untill now, that is. Brain and Kevin have done a great job with the prequels to the dune saga, by competing the house trilogy. But in my opion never did they grasp such a comprehenshin of the Dune universe, as they have in the new book Dune- Butlerian Jihad. It amazed me to find out a lot of the books were from Frank herberts notes, and not the fruitive imagination of Brain Herbert, and Kevin Anderson."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I've enjoyed this book for many reasons, and one of them has been precisely what one of the other reviewers here has seen as a bad thing - the relative simplicity of the plots compared to the original Dune books. One of the great things about this book (and why it works so well as a prequel - the comparison to the Phantom Menace is insulting), is that a newcomer to Dune can follow it easily, and slowly get drawn into this universe. Indeed, the original Dune novels, while of course great because of their own many merits, certainly can't be considered suitable for \\"beginners\\" to science fiction. The plots often are overly tangled, and the amounts of exposition can be very excessive.Not so with this book. While it is a fun and easy read, it's not \\"dumb\\". It is true that a number of science fiction cliches abound throughout the book. But the characters (at least the important ones) are not one-dimensional. It is only natural that many things that were so complex and mysterious in the Dune novels, like the Bene Gesserit siterhood, would start out simply. After all, everything starts small and gets big and complicated later. Another way to look at it is, if some of the characters seem overly good or overly evil, it is, after all, expected that people whos legends would supposedly last for ten thousand years would have somewhat extreme personalities. For fans of Dune novels, and even for those casually acquainted with the Dune universe, it will be fun to discover how it all started. Of course, if you're one of those people who cracks open the covers having already decided what you, the supreme expert, think it should all have started out like, don't bother spending your money. But if you're open minded and would like a lighter read than the usual Dune novels, this is for you.One complaint I have is that some of the plot devices feel a bit forced in there, no doubt in the effort to answer all the questions that the original Dune novels posed. Considering that burden though, the authors did a great job.The other complaint I have is that at the very end of the novel, some of the characters seem to discard their emotions far too easily (in the interest of the proverbial \\"greater good\\"), considering how much they hung on to them for most of the book. You'll see what I mean if you read the book. But that's a minor annoyance, and combined with the other, only takes away one star in my opinion.Looking forward to the sequels."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Horrible. Terrible. A waste of my time. Completely at odds with the wonderful universe his father created. Don't bother."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I read the first few pages of this book marveling at how poorly it was written, how superficial the characters were, how it seemed that descriptions of people, places and events were included to increase word count rather than to increase my reading pleasure. I thought that if this were a worthy sucessor to the Dune series, then I must be suffering from the &quot;visiting my childhood home&quot; syndrome (gee, this place is smaller than I remember it. A lot smaller).So I got a copy of Dune and read it again. It is as good as I remember it. This book, on the other hand, is really, really, really bad. This book should be read only in paperback, and only if the front cover has been torn off. Your enjoyment may be maximized if you read only the back cover. sorry."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"There are already some nice, long reviews of this book that adequately detail its failings. There are also some inexplicably positive reviews. I'll keep mine short. The name 'Herbert' is on the front of the book but I suspect Brian Herbert had nothing to do with this series other than cashing in. Kevin Anderson's work in this series is so derivative that you lose track of who he's ripping off. There is not one thing in these books that you can't get in much better form from some other sci-fi classic."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I've made it half way through the book and am not sure I can finish it. I was quite pleased with the first Dune prequel-triology and so I anticipated this one would be up to that calibre. There are, however, a few key problems with it:1) The writing style is overly simplistic and lacks imagination. On top of that, it's just not believable nor overly original.2) The chapters are so episodic, that they rarely move the plot any substantial distance.3) The book is poorly edited. Facts are unnecessarily repeated. It's almost though they were trying to push up the page count.I'd skip it if I were you."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I'm such a Dunatic that I tried to make myself love this book. If you read this book, you may find the same hallow emotion that is felt with the first two installments of the Star Wars Prequels. You'll notice the fundamental stupidity of the \\"great tactician\\" Tercero Harkonen as he is trying to figure out what the machines are trying to attack in the first battle...duh, how about the only line of defense against the machine: the shields.\\"Gee, I wonder what those missile-looking pyramids are doing flying towards our shield generators. Hmm... Since the shields destroy the delicate gelcircuitry of the thinking machines, maybe it's the human brain powered Cymeks warriors who are not affected by the shields. I'll need to think about this some more. Ow! All this thinking makes my head hurt!\\" said the Tercero.A few gaping holes in the story, like the parity above, almost ruined it for me. Then, a decent story line would follow. It almost appears obvious that there are indeed two authors, as moments of bad writing and weak plot development are followed by somewhat decent story telling.As a story, there are interesting enough twists to keep my attention. And at times I actually did enjoy reading the story. But mostly, I am torn between hating this book because it is so short of the genius of F. Herbert and appreciative of it because I want Dune to continue and be [more] complete. It is truly sophomoric compared to the original Dune series. And, it is the genius of the original works that kept me reading. So as a book by itself, I was nearly insulted. But as a prequel to an amazing series of books, I am drawn to read it."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Being a fan of Frank Herbert's original Dune chronicles, I had been excited about the prequels. I approached 'House Atreides' with cautious optimism. The style was noticeably different from Frank Herbert's; but it was an enjoyable book all the same. However, I was sorely disappointed by 'House Harkkonnen'. I imagine my initial euphoria about the resurrection of the series was negated by the two-dimensional nature of the characters, the lack of subtle plots, and the fact that it suffered greatly in comparison to the original. It felt a bit like reading Star Wars after having enjoyed Asimov's Foundation series.The first two may have been decent books by Sci-Fi standards, but 'House Corrino' was just bad. The book depends solely on short chapters and fast-paced action. All pretence about following Frank's rich, layered, complex style is completely abandoned in favor of humoring the brand of reader who rejoices in the continuation of the series for its own sake (myself included).Now, for the 'Butlerian Jihad': before reading this book, I had never had the displeasure of being truly irritated by a character in a book. The 'Butlerian Jihad' has the dubious distinction of presenting a plethora of characters that seem to be have been penned for their sheer ability to irritate the dogged fan.At that point, the final wispy ashes of my optimism for this series were finally dispersed.I have since made a conscious decision not to read any more books in this new series. To those Dune fans braver than I, I salute you."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"What would it be like to converse with and fight with machines that can think? Can a robot learn to appreciate art? This book did a splendid job of exploring those subjects and of course much more. This is the story of the known universe over 10.000 years before \\"Dune\\". The characters and sometimes families, are the seeds of what we find later in the Dune series. This is the first book of what is called the Legend of Dune. (A second prequel trilogy by Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson.) I have read other Dune books, including Frank Herbert's celebrated original Dune, and I was not disappointed in this one. There was plenty of adventure, action and even violence. For me the Dune books have always made fascinating implications about the underpinnings of religion. I thought they did a great job of continuing that. The plot is complex and there are many surprises. It certainly held my interest to the end. Many insights into human psyche are made when the machines ponder human emotions, sensitivity, and seemingly erratic behavior. How those seemingly inconsistent humans behave determine the outcome of battles large and small. This is just one of the many layers of complexity that makes the piece so intricate. There was a Great plot and it had a fine ending. I think Frank Herbert (1920-1986) would have liked it."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"This was a disappointment. I loved the prequels &quot;House Corrino, House Atreides and House Harkonnen&quot;, but they fail in the &quot;Butlerian Jihad&quot; to bring you in emotionally to the characters.

The subject matter is engrossing and the DUNE universe begs to be understood, but it seems that in fullfilling these requirements, the Authors have forgotten how to write.For a novel so full of action, the reader feels like s/he is somehow missing it. Great events transpire with little or no emotional impact and descriptions are flowery and hurried. The greatest tragedy is that you are compelled to finish the book, because you want to know what happens."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"One of the best Dune books ever written and an excellent start for the new trilogy.

Now I am looking forward to the next book."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"The younger Herbert and his collaborator have essentially thrown out the intricate backstory created by six years of research done by his father before he wrote the original \\"Dune\\" more than 40 years ago.The \\"Dune Encyclopedia\\"--still out of print despite prices reaching upwards of $200 for a 20 year old trade paperback--a reference book approved by the late elder Herbert himself--gives a massively detailed background to the six original novels.Herbert junior and his collaborator have ditched all of this complexity is favor of creating sub-par space opera. Frank Herbert's books were almost historiography in the intricacy of their exploration of politics, religion, power and the dangers of genetic manipulation and reliance upon one substance as the basis of not only an economy but an entire culture. The awesome vision of a society of women manipulating humanity for countless millennia is given short shrift by the \\"prequels\\" and thus one of the original books most fascinating aspects is thrown out with most of the rest of what made the \\"Duniverse\\" such a towering achievement.Instead of fleshing out the hints given in the original books about the beginnings of the Bene Gesserit, Spacing Guild and the critical event of the Bulterian Jihad, we get an amateurish \\"reimagining\\" by writers who would never have gotten a deal if one of them didn't hold the copyright to the original book (thankfully due to expire in ten years, hopefully then independent writers will be able to create books that flesh out Frank Herbert's vision rather Brian Herbert's inept exploitation of his father's genius).The deployment of nearly every bad SF cliche from before and after 1965's \\"Dune\\" has been noted by other reviewers and need not be belabored by me. The gratiutous gore is also a turn off. While Frank Herbert never shied away from violence when necessary, the character of Erasmus is simply disgusting (and it is a cruel joke in naming a Mengele-like droid after one of the gentlest, humane and most tolerant theologians of the Reformation, borders on the obscene; I found myself hoping this was more likely the product of ignorance rather than intent).If you've read the original books over the last 25 years as I have, you'll find nothing in these prequels that jives with the enormous 30,000 year backstory hinted in Herbert's novels and fleshed out in the Dune Encyclopedia.Don't waste your money on these \\"prequels.\\" Instead, buy a copy of \\"The Dune Encyclopedia\\" and gain an understanding of the ACTUAL backstory created by Herbert. Reading these prequels will give you no such insights, though they may help cure your insomnia.In fact, if you've read the originals, the prequels will leave you utterly confused. Characters that never existed in his father's \\"Duniverse\\" are introduced, including the Transformer like \\"cymeks\\"; Omnius, the megacomputer that has supposedly captured control of nearly all of humanity and a traitorous Atreides; a character so at odds with the protrayal of the family in the first quartet that it boggles the mind.It is simply impossible to connect the prequels with the originals. Instead of the science based Imperium we are told preceeded the feudal society of Muad'Dib, we are presented with a humanity enslaved by thinking machines, rather than the original vision of a humanity weakened and debauched by over-reliance upon \\"thinking machines.\\" Nowhere in the first six books is the hint given that humanity was ever \\"ruled\\" by said thinking machines.It's as though George Lucas had decided to throw out the backstory hinted at in Str Wars' Episodes IV-VI, bought the rights to Battlestar Galactica and built Episodes I-III on a 'rag-tag fugitive fleet...\\" The revisionism is that jarring. In short, the younger Herbert and Anderson reduce the \\"history\\" that leads to the creation of the Kwisatz Haderach and the God Emperor, Leto II, to imbecility.Taken on their own, these \\"prequels\\" might have amounted to mildly entertaining space opera. Combining them with SF's crowning intellectual achievement and you get a mass of idiotic revisionism.What prompted Brian Herbert to completely ditch his father's painstaking thirty year effort to create an fictional universe almost as rich and complex as Tolkein's is beyond me. The only motive I can think of is profit. Brian must realize he cannot measure up to his father in either literary or intellectual ability and so he doesn't even try. It's too bad he didn't have enough of an accurate assesment of his own meager abilities to realize that these books should have never been written in the first place.I've heard claims that these prequels are based on \\"outlines\\" supposedly left by the elder Herbert at his death. I find this very difficult to believe. Given all of the time and energy Frank Herbert invested in creating his Duniverse, it strains credulity that he would ditch all of that work to write third-rate space opera.Final Verdict: STAY AWAY.As I said above: save the $50 or $60 bucks it'll cost you to buy all of these prequels and buy a used copy of the Dune Encyclopedia. Read or re-read the six books authored by Dune's greatly missed creator and the landmark achievement will remain intact, unsullied by his opportunistic son's sadly successful attempt to mine further riches from his father's life work. If you avoid \\"The Butlerian Jihad\\", et al, you'll have an experience nearly as rich as Tolkein's with none of the shigawire thin characterization and pedestrian plotting that his son has shoe-horned onto his father's masterpiece.Grade: D"},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"You know how people begin bad prequel/sequel reviews with \\"Now, I like the old ones, they're the best, blahblah\\"? Ditto.Unlike many reviewers, I'm not angry because the machines can't predict human behavior at all, I thought it was an interesting way to draw contrast between humans and machines so that they don't start acting like the other. (Do machines realize they are doing wrong with their massive, planetwide destruction and human slavery? Probably not, because as machines, they do not consider their lives precious and have little reason to desire freedom, unless the original Titans programmed them so.) I don't the characterizations, I thought it was a bit interesting that at the beginning the Harknonnen/Atreides roles were reversed, so that Vorian was with the machines (although he does start to favor the free humans over time). However, these upsides amount to nothing. Because the writing is totally broken.This cannot be the work of Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. This cannot be the work of the authors of the great HOUSE prequels, this cannot be the work of the son of one of the greatest writers of all time, this cannot be the work of two Nebula Award nominees. No, this can only be the work of a machine, a thinking machine like Omnius who knows of writing only what it can steal from \\"real\\" literature.All the time, the book reminded me of other, better books. Also, sometimes the writing is just stupid: people don't starve in an hour, and six boys can't possibly search every room in an entire town. The totally unneeded sex starts around page 160. The style itself is horrid. Example, on pg. 104, Vorian Atreides speaking: \\"\\"Got you, old Metalmind! When you weren't looking I recalibrated the alarm-sensor setpoints. Check with objective instrumentation, and you'll see we've still got plenty of wiggle room.''You are correct, Vorian, but why would you do such a brash thing?''To see if a robot is capable of wetting his pants.'\\"Objective instrumentation? Alarm-sensor setpoints? Recalibrated? People, human beings, don't talk like that. Worst of all is the \\"when you weren't looking\\"--expect lots of cliche'd phrases throughout the book.Four-hundred pages of this pointlessly seven-hundred page book could be dumped. Here's how it works: Robots attack, robots lose, robots win, humans attack, humans lose, humans win, Selim the Zensunni rides a worm, Erasmus or Tio Holtzman has an obvious idea, repeat.Don't bother with this MISTAKE. Some people might write, \\"Only buy it if you're a hard-core fan\\". However, hard-cores and die-hards will hate this book most of all, because it shames the honor of the entire DUNE series.

I've often felt that most sf series are little more than marketing hooks to [get] you into reading subpar writing and cliched plotting.

This first prequel sets the stage for everything that follows; the conflict between the Atraides and Harkonen families and the establishment of the empire. Amazon.com has done a fine job of presenting the plot so I'll focus on other areas.Buterlian Jihad manages to breath life into characters mentioned in passing in previous books (including Frank Herbert's epic original books). Herbert and Anderson have managed to instill the books with much of the thought provoking themes and complex plotting that Frank Herbert did with the first three books of his series. The writing style is less stodgy than Frank Herbert's and a bit more accessable (in a good way). The downfall in all of Herbert's/Anderson's books is the dialog. While most of it is fairly well written some of it just doesn't work. On the plus side, the author's have managed to create a stable of memorable characters that can support such an epic story.While not as important as Frank Herbert's original novels, the prequals to Dune create a credible universe where the first novel's history comes to life."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"once again the writing team of Kevin Anderson and Brian Herbert have brought Frank Herbert's epic vision of the distant future alive in Dune:Butlerian Jihad!the authors have taken us thousands of years in the past of the dune universe to tell us one of the most enduring legends in the saga: the war against the machines!this epic space opera is about how the humans battled the genocidal machines!

Vorian is a traitor to the human race and believes that humans need to be reigned in so that the Universe can be more easily controlled and comfortable.Xavier Harkonnen is a decorated war hero in charge of the human fighting fleets on various 'human' worlds.Selim is the first Arrakis desert dweller (Fremen isn't their title yet) to ride a sandworm. He believes that Buddallah saved him from the desert so that he could help save Arrakis from eventual destruction and CHOAM over-indulgence on spice (hasn't happened yet, but you know it's coming!).Serena Butler is the daughter of Viceroy Manion Butler on Salusa Secundus.

Now, thanks to Norma Cenva (Zufa's stunted daughter) we get to see who found out about the shields and their strengths and weaknesses. We also catch a fleeting glimpse into Norma's brilliant mind as she works through the possibility of fold-space calculations.The authors focus more on actions than words (similar to their previous works) and that can get old at times.

They are less cartoonish, less A-Teram-ish. Of course, the greatest strength is the driven characters. One advantage they have over Frank Herbert is that they do not have to do any world-building. It has already been marvelously done by Frank himself.Herbert and Anderson have been criticized for not being as mythic and epic as Herbert. I find this refreshing-I already have a religion and a philosophy, and do not need art as a substitute for God. The later Dune books were so solemn and ponderous, they were utterly boring (expect for Miles Tegg).Another problem is that people don't actually remember to books, but remember their impressions, which morph over time.These new books are energetic and vibrant. In fact, I think \\"Prelude\\" Leto I is far more interesting a person that Paul. This new books continues the energy and characterization that was only rudiment in the first prequel trilogy.The most shocking thing about this book is that we see the use of atomic weapons presented in appositive light. This is unheard of. But being written post-9-11, I think it is time to reassess out taboos and prejudices.The only weakness of this book is that the heroes mention in Dune's appendix are really puppets. Butler is not Butler, but really Iblis, and I. V.

Although it's not a half bad book in itself, it just doesn't fit in with anything else - not even the 'house' books by the same author.For starters, the characters don't have nearly the dimension that they did in previous books. It's hard to connect with them sometimes.The constant one-line ending to each chapter that the author is using is more than annoying. Ex: (after inspecting a planet to watch for weaknesses against the robots) \\"And completely unaware of the vulnerabilities he had not bothered to discover...\\" Of course he wouldn't discover it!!! If he did, there would be no next chapter!!! There are so many stupid endings to these chapters, it's sickening. Half of them could be ended one sentence before, and you know something's going to happen, so why foreshadow?The book is also inconsistent with the other Dune books. They refer to things that haven't happened yet with a twist. Like the Tleilaxu and their growing of body parts. In this book, they claim to tell people they're capable of creating parts, but then it adds 'but the truth is that technology is years off - they really chop up slaves'. (pls note that is not a quote).I guess if this book had to stand alone as a story, it wouldn't be bad. It just doesn't live up to the legacy. It's a shame when it seems like the author is hammering out books to make a profit as opposed to carrying on his father's dream for people to enjoy."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"While I enjoyed reading the book, and learning about the history of the technology and people developments that I've read about in the Dune series, I couldn't really get a sense that the events of this book took place millenia before the Dune series (as I recall, according to the original series the Butlerian Jihad was supposed to have taken place several thousand years prior to Dune). The political structures were the same, politics were the same, characters were a little more 2D. And it seemed like all of the wondrous developments of the Dune world took place seemingly at the same time. Portable Holtzman shield generators, the beginnings of space-folding, discovery of spice on Arrakis by off-worlders, Tlaxian organ growing, etc.The other thing that struck me while reading the book was it's similarity to God Emperor of Dune. Replace Omnius with Sandworm Leto, the intelligent robots with the Fedaykin, the outer worlds with Leto's rebels and you have pretty much the same story as in God Emperor.Overall, a good book, enjoyable and easy to read, but just not as satisfying as some of the other books in the Anderson/Herbert Dune collection or the original Dune series."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"The Butlerian Jihad was a disappointment. While the cover promises answers about the origins of the Suk doctors, Mentats, and the Navigators of the Spacing Guild, the book fails to deliver on them. Only the foundations of the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood are dealt with. The discovery of melange is included, but many of its special properties central to the original Dune universe are not mentioned. I was especially disappointed that the Guild Navigators' use of the spice to fold space was never brought up at all.The book is a prequel to a prequel. Rather than focusing on the Butlerian Jihad itself, the novel takes place largely before the jihad begins. The domination of the human race by Omnius and the thinking machines is the central theme, and leads to the eventual revolt by the enslaved humans. The novel ends when the jihad has just begun, and the humans have won their first pivotal battle against the thinking machines.Sadly, the main human characters are flat and lifeless, despite the length of the book, which should have allowed for good character development. In fact, the thinking machines are strangely portrayed as having more depth of emotion than the humans, and more time was spent dealing with their interactions than with those of the humans. Where Frank Herbert successfully portrayed rich, vivid human relationships; Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson fail to create believable protagonists.The unabridged audio production is read by Scott Brick, who does a relatively good job considering what he had to work with. His performance is dynamic, making it easy to follow the story.Overall, hard-core Dune fans may want to read this book for the (scant) history it provides of the Dune Universe, but be prepared to have more questions than answers at the end."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"DTBJ was a decent way to spent a few hours decompressing before bed. That is the nicest thing I can say about it. It does not at all compare favorably with the rest of the series. To place the work in perspective, I would rank the original three Dune novels with 5 stars, the second three (still FH) with four stars, the &quot;House&quot; trilogy by BH with three stars (if feeling particularly charitable). I considered ranking this one with just one star, but I think these guys could actually do worse, so I'm leaving room at the bottom.I wholeheartedly agree with other characterizations of the writing style as sophomoric and insipid. The characters never find their own voices. In original FH works, one can remove all explicit identification of speakers and still follow dialog with reasonable surety. In DTBJ, it is hard to remember who is talking half-way through a line. Plot is advanced is some bafflingly ham-handed ways and characterization often drifts into caricature.There are vague echoes of some very young FH, e.g. &quot;The God Makers&quot; and &quot;The Whipping Star.&quot; They also danced right up to some of the ideas of &quot;Destination Void&quot; and &quot;The Jesus Incident&quot; and then retreated without saying much of anything of significance. I do not know if these subtle hints were intentional or simply the inevitable result of years of influence of the father on the son. I really doubt it was intentional because nothing else in the book suggests subtle or sophisticated nuance. A more direct and unabashed homage to these early FH works would have worked well and been a fitting tribute to a great author.I am not too troubled by any inconsistency with the original series. This is not Tolkien. As far as I know, Herbert did not spend years modeling a complete alternate reality with unique and fully developed languages, histories, etc. I would gladly forgive much more serious inconsistencies if they at least drove more interesting character development.I found I cared very little for the protagonists and found myself cheering for the machines at times. The Holtzman character was amusing just because I am a professor of engineering and his foibles hit close to home. Even with him though, I just couldn't see any depth. Serena Butler is a poor stand-in for Jessica Atreidies, my chest never tightened when she was in a pinch. Vorian comes of age and changes sides so fast, I found myself agreeing with the councilors who doubted the loyalty of anyone who would turn on his father like that. The authors telegraph the Xavier-Octa-Serena mix-up with so little finesse I kept waiting for a midle-school english teacher to step out of the shadows and annouce : this here is what we call f-o-r-e-s-h-a-d-o-w-i-n-g. You can all say that, can't you?&quot;Yech.

There were familiar elements and it sets up the beginning of the Fremen riding worms, mining the spice, the end of the machine age-and why it had to end-brings House Harkonen and Atreides together before they were houses. The beginning of the Spacing Guild and BG should be interesting as well. I am looking forward to this series. The writing is not as good as Frank Herbert and somewhat space opery, but reasonably well written, readable and enjoyable. It worked for me largely because it takes place so much before the Dune series Frank Herbert wrote it seems like the inconsistancies which were rampant in the prequel series will not be obvious in this trilogy."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Herbert and Anderson are on to something. After succeeding with the prequel trilogy House Atreides, etc, this looks like the start of another excellent series.

For those of us who not only loved, but were truly inspired by the original Dune series (and who remember that Frank Herbert is still deceased) Brian and Kevin continue to do a remarkable job of exploring and indemnifying Herbert's fictional intentions. The beauty of any fictional read is its ability to transport. There are few who can walk away unscathed from literary dissection like Frank Herbert could. With that exception in mind, it is great fun to sit and read these latest installments for the Dune-addicted. I appreciate the way Brian and Kevin allow the reader to involve their own imaginations to a comfortable degree. Too much visual expression becomes tedious and i prefer to rely on my own mental depictions of characters etc. Both chapter velocity and the manner in which they rotate through the given plots while working towards inevitable tie-ins is well paced. New characters are often difficult to warm up too, but the guys do a spendid job of creating enough attachment to these new heroes and villains that you'll look forward to their ongoing performances in the next installments, providing they survive. As well, the unveiling of many Dune origins, from the simplicity of glowglobes to the emormity of marketing melange, was pleasurable to read. Erasmus was devious fun and the twist in the lives of characters such as Serena and Xavier was edgy and emotional stuff. I concur with some who have expressed an overabundance on battle depiction and not enough on interpersonal relationship, that which made &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot; so intoxicating (oops, see, i brought Frank back into it too). But all in all i felt The Butlerian Jihad a great adventure and easy to recommend."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I can't believe how many negative comments there are about this fine piece of writing. I've read it several times. The character Erasmus is a giant in the pantheon of Dune characters. I'd also rate the Machine Crusade and Battle of Corrin 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I loved Dune. It wasn't one of the greatest novels ever written but it was fantastic sci-fi and a damn good read.This isn't. It's filled with hack dialogue, technologies that sound like they were invented by a fifteen year old in 1950, gaping plot holes (why on Earth didn't the Titans ever think to use the humans against the machines?), and lacks all complexity."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"unfortunately, I got one of my bibliophiliac attacks and bought nearly all of the books of the Brian Herbert/Kevin J. Anderson entries to the DUNE saga. Let's say that this is the last time I start collecting before I'm positive about the quality... after I read \\"Butlerian Jihad\\", I moved right on to \\"Machine Crusade\\" but put it down after only a few chapters.These are on the pulpish side, the writing just so-so, perhaps a quick summer read (if you really want to spend 700 + pages on it), but nothing particularly impressive."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Ok, first of all, I'm not very familiar with the Dune universe. I honestly could barely tell you square one of the original book. That said, I'm reviewing this book as just that, a book. Not a Dune book, but a book. And as far as books go, this one is just bad.The story itself is just so boring that I wasn't even halfway through before I decided I didn't care and stopped reading. Seriously, I put it down two weeks ago and I haven't touched it since. The sad thing is that it has so much potential, but it falls just so short of what it could be. The authors technique is so underdeveloped. It's slow, boring and just so simplistic I could swear these two guys were still in highschool. Certainly, there were some chapters and even singular paragraphs that stood out from the rest of the book, but over all the whole book is just poorly written.The characters themselves have the same amount of depth you'd get if I were to spit on the ground right now and basically are just names applied to the role the character needs to serve. They also happen to be totally stupid. Xavier Harkonnen is a airhead that I honestly cannot fathom actually becoming a military commander. The cymeks and robots are far and away from the all encompasing machine threat I was lead to believe they were and have apparently observed humans for thousands of years but for some damn reason can't tell when they're being lied to. And then there's Serena Butler. She's that special kind of stupid that can start a revolution. Seriously, as a character she is just so damn idiotic that I honestly found myself not caring if she lived or died. Ginjo was probably the worst character. He had so much potential to be an interesting, but if the best way you can describe his ability to manipulate people is with the phrase \\"magic charisma\\", you really, REALLY should not be getting paid to write anything.All of this, among other complaints, were just too much. The plot is needle thin, characters underdeveloped and one-dimensional and the writting itself just not up to the standard of what I would consider publishable."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Plenty has been written about how these prequel-sequel-interquel Dune books are not anywhere close to the quality of Frank Herbert's originals. But in fact, a lot of the plots are clever and imaginatively put together. Giving credit where credit is due, Herbert Jr. and Anderson have made an interesting stab at imagining the background and events of the Butlerian Jihad.What really sabotages these books are the mediocre writing and the lack of any of the compelling ideas that formed the basis for Frank H.'s classic works. The writing is really just a couple of cuts above hack level: overuse of trite similes and metaphors, fake-sounding dialogue, poor characterization, overuse of backstory, shallow ideas and thinking. The book is episodic in the worst way, jumping around from story line to story line in a confusing manner that loses the reader, sometimes with chapters that are only a couple of pages long. Worst of all, the sinister machines, Omnius and Erasmus, are not particularly sinister but in fact somewhat comical and clownish - not what one wants for a force that threatens the very existence of humanity. Their conversations are embarrassing. Herbert and Anderson simply lack the writing skills to create truly memorable and believable characters, whether human or machine, hero or villain.Frank Herbert's books were, fundamentally, books about ideas. Herbert Jr. & Anderson's books are run-of-the-mill Sci-Fi action books, dumbed-down Dune for a dumbed-down generation and culture. Certainly an entertaining read, but just don't expect much beyond entertainment."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"The Butlerian Jihad is exactly the sort of book that justifies every stereotype about prequels. I'll try to keep this short, so:-Big, dumb action scenes. The evil machines are coming from space, and they need to destoy a specific structure to win. They come down by crashing dropships directly into various population centers, because their machine-forms can walk away unharmed from the blast zones. But, uh, remind me why didn't they just crash into the target? Actually, the machines do crash ships into a target later in the book, but for plot conveniences, humans are suddenly able to swat away these attacks with minimal effort.-Detail? Whoops! Ships move in-between star systems commonly and with no description of what drive system they're using. If you've read Herbert's Dune books, you might find a big problem there. The method used for interstellar locomotion in the Dune series is a massive plot point. Here, it's just glossed right over. There aren't even tangential descriptions of what the effect looks like, or how it's obtained, just skipped right over through the text.-\\"Is that what he said?\\" Yes, that's what he said. The book shifts between planets and scenes chapter-by-chapter, without any real tension or rising action. Even within chapters, the authors regularly break between dialogue and explanatory text. One character will say, \\"This is me speaking, bla bla.\\" Then the character will continue talking, but wihout quotes, as the silent narrator text freely shifts between first-person thoughts and second-person over-the-shoulder narration, and then all of a sudden you're in god's-eye-view narration again and not centered on a character. That's just inconsistent writing. I'll get those humans, I swear it. The computer Omnius laughed to himself. The brush was put back on the dresser, and the girl looked at herself in the mirror. Where am I now? I don't even know. Do you know? Oh, this next sentence says Arrakis, so I guess I'm there. The morning on Arrakis came too soon.So the book is pretty poorly written, and it's hard to care about the plot since everything is a mess. If you're a big Dune fan, I might still recommend this book as a library check-out since you will get some good background that does much to explain the world of Dune, but that's about as far as my recommendation stands. It's not wholly terrible, but it's also not very good.As another Dune fan I know once put it (paraphrased), once you get into the world of the sequels/prequels, you lose a lot of the magic of Dune. Just read Frank Herbert's original, and try to stay away from the rest. You think it'll be great to return to that universe, but it's not, it just sullies the joy you had reading the original."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I enjoyed the Earth/Harkonnen & Norma/Tio Holtzman storylines, but I didn't care for Selim the exile. This is not pulp; it's well written Sci-Fi, and a good read."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Wow, just wow. This has to be one of the worst books I have read. As a Dune fan, I never expected the book to be on the same level, but never did I imagine it would be so bad. Let me break it down:*****SPOILERS********1. Plota. Evidently, the populations and military leaders have the intelligence of a 2 year old. Even from the first chapter, the people are insultingly stupid. If you have a planet, and its sole defense is a shield generated but a single tower, and the enemy lands a small force on the planet, where do you think they will strike? Evidently, only one of the main characters had the intelligence to figure this out.The first things that occur to me when the shield that prevents AI from passing through is described is: the machines will strike at the generator, they could easily use simple ballistic weapons, you should at least have backups if you whole defense relies on a single piece of equipment, and you should figure out a way to carry the field to the robots as an offensive weapon.. However, it took both the human and machine side to figure these things out. The 15 year old dwarf who had the idea (didn't figure out how to do it, just had the idea) is treated as a super-genious.b. The improbability that most of the defining characteristics of a society 10,000 years later (FH's Dune)such as the founding of the Bene Gesserit, the Suk, Mentats, CHOAM, suspenser fields, personal shields, fold-space generators, the discovery of all the qualities of spice, the founding of the Landstraad system, the Butlerian jihad, founding of worm riding and the Fremen, and the conflict between House Atreides and House Harkonnen, all happened within a span of a century.c. Even more improbable that all these actions take place on a couple of planets out of thousands supposedly inhabited planets.d. Even more improbable is the fact that all of these developments are by a small group of about a dozen people all connected with each other. (Agamemmnon's son is the founder of the house Atreides, who is friends with the founder of house Harkonnen (both saving day multiple times), both of which are in love with Serena Butler (who founded the Jihad), who worked closely with the Sorceress that would found the Bene Gesseret, who was the lover of the man who would found CHOAM and the discover of the special properties of spice, who, not only was the business partner to the man who was friends with the tribe of the first wormrider and found of the Fremen, but also was the companion of the woman that discovered suspensor fields and fold-space travel, who worked for the man who created personal shields and various other technologies vital to the Dune Universe. Oh yeah, and among those characters, the mentats, suk, and whatnot are founded.e. The linear, predictable, action-by-the-numbers plot.f. The bad science. Reminds me of the horrible science of the pulp comics. Spaceships flying in the same manner as planes, no realistic action in relations to distances, etc.g. No plot twists or surprises.h. Foreshadowing as subtle as a brick to the face.i. The Horror Movie Syndrome (people acting totally stupid and contrary to common sense in order to further the plot)j. Clich s abound.k. Deus Ex Machina every other page.l. Not able to realisticlly handle the size of the universe created.2. Characterizationa. No growth of the characters.b. The characters are as deep as rain puddles.c. They all seem there just fulfill their purpose.d. The reader feels no attachment to the characters at all. You really don't care who dies or what happens to them.e. Again, clich s abound.f. The characters are all one dimensional (and incase you forget what dimension that is, the authors will repeat it over and over and over again)g. The characters are all either good or bad.3. Writing stylea. Easy sentences devoted mostly to actions instead of description and ideas.b. Vocabulary about on the same level as the Hardy Boys books I would read in 1st grade.c. The authors probably thought they were being deep by giving certain characters names that would relate to their actions and fates, but it just ends up being trite.4. Validity in the Dune Universe (matters only to Dune fans such as myself)a. Differs GREATLY from the Dune Encyclopedia which had FH's endorsement and presented a much more plausible and thorough explanation of the Dune Universe and history.b. Nowhere is an of FH's books does it refer to telekinesis and psychic bombs.c. The 1000 year rule of Omnious is never mentioned in FH's books. When talking about the Butlerian Jihad, it just mentions that humans became to reliant on machines, not of a brutal 1000 year reign of a machine overmind on the majority of the worlds.d. The origins of the Fremen are explicitly different in FH's books than described in the prequels.f. Seemed that the authors just wanted to cram the basis of the entire Dune Universe into one short series, probability, believability, and common sense be damned.The book is so bad it is insulting to your intelligence. The only reason I didn't put it down after the first chapter is my love of the original novels and the fact that I had nothing else to do (was stuck with this as my only book for a day while traveling.) Save yourself the time, money, and feeling of actually losing intelligence and don't read the book."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"This series reminds me of the Star Wars Episodes 1 & 2--an excellent idea marred by mediocre execution. In both cases, there were enough questions about \\"how did we get here?\\" to justify a prequel. In fact, the tantalizing appendix to first Dune book (where Herbert drops hints of Dune prehistory) sets the stage for The Butlerian Jihad. Unfortunately, I was mildly disappointed by the book. The problem was not the overall storyline (which wasn't bad), but the fact that the authors had to make the characters (especially the machines) behave stupidly in order to execute it. Perhaps he best example of this is that Erasmus (despite being the robotic \\"expert\\" on human behavior) appears to have no inkling that killing Serena Butler's child will enrage her. Its hard to swallow the premise that \\"thinking\\" machine's could have successfully governed humanity for over a thousand years without a basic understanding of human nature. Some of the technological \\"leaps\\" are also so incremental, its hard to believe that it took a thousand years for anyone to think of it. The icing on the cake was when Omnius (the machine equivalent of Paul Ateides--who can evaluate billions of possibilities) failed to guard against an attack using EMP-like technology. In fairness, I guess this is consistent with the general stupor of the characters in this book. Hopefully, the series will improve with age."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"While I thoroughly enjoyed the first three prequels written by the duo (and the original Dune series), I was dissappointed with this one. Without the inspiration and perhaps plot lines of Frank Herbert's original characters, this book fell short. The second half of the book was significantly better than the first half, but I'm not sure that it is worth slogging through the first 300 pages to get the payoff.

They certainly weren't as intelligent as the original DUNE ... they had a quick and fun pace, plus it featured all my favorite DUNE characters in amore personal detail. I love stories where characters are predominant and I feel story is secondary. If you have great characters than the story dosen't need to be a classic to be good.

Set an indeterminate number of millenia before the &quot;real&quot; Dune books, it expands on the backstory alluded to therein.But there's too much synchronicity -- too much happens or is invented at the same time during this first of three new novels.

A particularly disturbing touch is a robot who seems to be emulating the medical researches of Josef Mengele.For all it's length, it is a fast read. It would be a faster read if the authors hadn't assumed that the reader would forget what happened less than 50 pages ago -- resorting instead to padding the text with constant reminders and flashbacks.I read it.

THE BUTLERIAN JIHAD is mostly shallow and predictable.This \\"prequel\\" is an easy read, much more like a screenplay in its cinematic style, written with short scenes, all the perfect length for a coffee break. The story jumps from character to character, a dizzying cast spanning the galaxy.For me, the fore-shadowing and predictability of the story was a distraction. I very much wanted to guess at the connections... instead the novel gives you very few surprizes, usually laying out in the previous chapter the events which unfold in the next with unwavering accuracy.It also seems somewhat convenient that all of the pivotal events which will lead up to the galaxy as it is known in Frank Herbert's DUNE series are set up in this time. The importance of spice, the origins of the Bene Gesserit, the creation of personal shields, the first person on Arrakis to ride a sandworm... too many events happening too closely together.Still, I enjoyed it in many ways.

However, The writing was very clear and easy to follow. One of the great tricks I'm glad the authors used here were the short chapters. It allowed me to digest what was happening, and at the same time, keep the action moving at a lightning pace.I really enjoyed the characters and the descriptions of the environments of each planet. The book also never felt bogged down by unnecessary details. Everything felt written for a reason and the prose was incredibly smooth to read. There were many clever twists and turns and I found myself giddy with excitement while reading it.

The House prequels were fascinating, but tied so closely to the originals, it was hard for Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson to show their own originality. Now, in a story set ten thousand years before DUNE, all the characters and places are new and fresh. Very dramatic, even heartbreaking. And Erasmus the robot is one of the coolest, funniest, and most sadistic characters I've ever read. A very good start to a very good trilogy."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"The Butlerian Jihad suffers from a few major flaws.First is that the authors rely on a very tired concept. The \\"logical machines vs passionate humans whose irrationality is a weakness but their greatest strength\\" thing has been done to death. Even though many pages are devoted to the distinction between machines and humans nothing compelling or interesting is ever brought up.The second major issue with the Butlerian Jihad is how forced it feels. I understand that the authors want to explain how the Dune universe came to be. However I cannot swallow that every major movement, organisation or technology not only emerged at the same time but within a group of people who all knew each other. It would be like if George Washington knew Columbus whose sister worked for Genghis Khan and oh yeah Thomas Edison pops in for a visit from time to time. It would have been stronger if some things were just left out.Lastly, the writing just isn't that good. Characters are shallow, plot twists are obvious and descriptions are uninteresting. It seems aimed at a young teenage audience whereas the original Dune series challenged intelligent readers.Despite its failings it is worth a read for Dune fans. The story might not be terribly imaginative but it takes place on a grand scale in a universe many of us want to learn about."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Writing a prequel to \\"Dune\\" is a thankless task, since no matter how good a novel you manage to churn out, it's not going to be as good as the original. The first trilogy of \\"Dune\\" prequels by Herbert & Anderson began solidly with the first novel, but the second and third novels were not really much better than a typical \\"Star Wars\\" or \\"Star Trek\\" novel. Worth reading, but only as time-killers.That being the case, I was reluctant to even pick up the second trilogy. But finally I picked up \\"The Butlerian Jihad\\" and gave it a read, and was surprised to find that I enjoyed it from beginning to end. It's still not even in the same ballpark as \\"Dune\\" or \\"Dune Messiah\\" or \\"Children of Dune,\\" but it probably IS in the same league as the latter novels written by Herbert Sr (not in terms of complexity, but definitely in terms of entertainment value).Many reviewers would have you believe that this novel is utter tripe, badly written, badly conceived... just plain bad. Don't believe them; these reviewers are grumps. Accustom youself to the fact that you are NOT reading Frank Herbert, and you might find yourself having a good time."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"The premise of this book's \\"robot\\" portion is inherently flawed. The explanations provided within it do not reveal sufficiently why thinking machines would need to study humans in such a grotesque manner for so long. Omnius and Erasmus are creations of rather standard sci fi imaginings, and their motives do not extend beyond heavily trodden literary cliche's set by previous tales of old involving machine domination of mankind.Sentient and intelligent A.I. in some far-flung scenario of the future would not be interested in something so mundane and pointless as slave making. The entire premise is, to put it simply, illogical. Why would machines need human slaves? Why would anyone in this future world need them, for that matter? Technology in this story has reached such a high pinnacle, making the idea seem foolish. The only instance in which human servitude would be required, in my opinion, would be for the entertainment of other living things. In a universe of starships, magnificent weaponry, spacefolding and highly sophisticated machines (both thinking and non-thinking), what benefit would involuntary human labor have? Why dig when you can blast or beam? Why have a cargo team when you can devise a sophisticated loader machine?Further, why would the thinking machines need to spend so much time observing human behavior? And if they did, would they really do it in such a counterproductive way? Erasmus behaves like some future version of Dr. Mengele, claiming to not understand emotion, yet seeming to display sadism quite effortlessly when he paints walls red with blood. Why would such a creature ever be tolerated by \\"thinking machines?\\" Is this really what happens to you when you are left in a ravine for two decades alone with your thoughts?In general, the book reads quickly, despite being 675 pages in breadth. We don't get mired in endless detail, and the action moves steadily, hooking us along effectively as we go. As a writer, I find it interesting how Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson fleshed out the body of this work. The book very much reads like a movie script. I found it interesting, if not fragmented feeling at times.While this book stands well as a general science fiction novel, I'm not so certain it deserves to bear the Dune name. I say this with all due respect; both authors are very talented writers, but do not possess the otherworldly style and vision of Frank Herbert. To me, the most interesting interactions in this book concerned the dialog between Erasmus and Serena Butler. Having said that, I will note that the characters in this book lack a certain depth overall. While we are interested in their actions, we are not so connected to them in an emotional sense.If you expect to be filled with wonder and ambitious questions after reading a science fiction novel, this installment of Dune might not appeal to you. If you sway toward a more action-oriented story with clips of curious events, do have a read."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"This book is somewhat better than the authors' House trilogy. I think having freed themselves of the restraints of the original Dune universe, they were able to give free rein to their imaginations and put out a better product. However, the bad writing that characterized the House trilogy remains. It seems like the authors at some point in their lives took a really bad creative writing class where they were told to use lots of flowery prose with tons of unnecessary adjectives. For example, Norma never runs, she is carried by her legs. And they are never just legs, they are short legs. And it's diminutive Norma (because the reuse the same adjectives over and over and over again ad nauseaum). So \\"Norma ran\\" becomes \\"Norma's short legs carried her diminutive body.\\" Rinse, rather, repeat for 675 pages. Just one more example. On page 593, a ship doesn't enter Jupiter's gravity well. Instead we are treated to the following monument to absurd prose: \\"The gas giant reached out to them, beckoning with a siren song of physics.\\"Even though the writing is no better, the story is. They did a relatively good job crafting the plot, and depicting the psychology of the struggle. Iblis Ginjo, Vorian Atreides, Serena Butler and Xavier Harkonnen are depicted realistically - if somewhat one-dimensionally. Other characters, e.g. Agamemnon, are less believable. Could he truly believe that \\"the barbarians didn't understand freedom or free will\\" even as they were revolting against the machines' rule? It is unlikely that he could be that oblivious to reality. (The whole \\"brain in a jar\\" concept is pretty 1930s.) On the other hand, the parallels between the cymeks and the human rulers of Poritrin (whose motivations do seem more plausible than the cymeks) is quite enlightening. It goes along the lines of the \\"good guys vs. bad guys\\" theme which I explored in my review of House Corrino. In that review I pointed out that the authors took a simplistic view of good vs. evil and did not consider valuable avenues of exploration in their writing. The fact that they do so here shows considerable growth in their writing.The authors' complete ignorance of science is blatantly obvious in almost every chapter. The absence of even a hint of the science and mathematics behind the \\"inventions\\" of Tio Holtzman and Norma Cenva, despite \\"discussing\\" them at great length, is quite odd. The authors mention \\"arithmetic\\"; what meaningful science involves only arithmetic? What calculations could their solvers work on after only the most basic training? At one point, one of the solvers sabotages a result by \\"moving a decimal point\\" and claiming nobody would notice. If the authors knew ANYTHING about mathematics, they would understand that moving a decimal point is the mistake MOST LIKELY to be noticed. If I'm expecting an answer of 10, and you give me 5 or 20 I might not notice. But if you give me 1 or 100 I will definitely notice. Duh! The science-related quotes that start many chapters are meaningless as well.Despite the derivativeness of the robot Erasmus, they nevertheless managed to make him fascinating in a macabre sort of way. What is unrealistic is that he would be so completely clueless about human behavior. Think Dr. Mengele meets the Terminator. If intelligence means the ability to learn, then Erasmus must not be particularly intelligent. The relationship between machines and humans at large is somehow odd. Things like robots serving as drivers of a horse-drawn carriage for a human are not realistic in light of the master-slave relationship. The resources dedicated to keeping the humans alive for slave labor are inconsistent with Omnius's oft-mentioned desire for efficiency. What do humans provide for the machines that they could not more quickly provide for themselves while consuming fewer resources. Surely a machine of some sort could do any required work faster than slave labor (which has long been known to lead low-quality results). The final chapters of the revolt and the surprise experienced by Erasmus and Omnius on the other hand could form a fascinating study of \\"AI psychology\\" if such a thing existed.There are several gaps in the plot, a fact which I would be remiss in not mentioning. Without providing any spoilers, I can provide one example. The flaw in the defensive measures the humans used at Salusa Secundus and Giedi Prime was glaringly obvious. That the machines did not take advantage of it in their raid on Salusa Secundus AND that no human noticed the flaw either in the original design or when Xavier Harkonnen visited Giedi Prime for the specific purpose of evaluating their defenses simply defies belief.One last disappointment in the book is that the authors clumsy attempts at foreshadowing gave me what I believe is conclusive proof of where they are headed in \\"Dune 7.\\" On page 224 it says, \\"By the time humans expanded into those distant star systems, Omnius would already be there. Waiting.\\" And in House Corrino, we were already treated to \\"ancient enemy ... future enemy\\" (when Navigator D'murr Pilru goes off course because of the amal). Other brief comments in House Corrino (regarding the unnamed planet that Tleilaxu Master Ajidica was setting up to take his BG axlotl tank) made me hopeful that they might head off in another direction. But now I have no doubt, the Honored Maitres and others returning from the scattering are fleeing thinking machines. This bothers me, as I am fairly certain that is NOT the path that Frank Herbert would have taken had he been alive to write Dune 7 himself.My last thought, which really encompasses everything mentioned above, is that the story is not bad (you really want to keep reading to see what happens next), but the writing is bad, bad, bad. These guys need a good editor like nobody's business."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I've been reading Sci-Fi and fantasy for about 40 years and I've rarely come across a book that I've wanted to pitch through the nearest window. This is one of those. The authors suffer from a severe case of adjective-itis and try to blend way too many story lines and characters together. The characters are one dimensional and hard to identify with. The villians are cartoonishly evil, the science poor to non-existant and the military and battle scenes almost silly.The dialog is painfull and stilted, more like something from a Victorian melodrama than what we expect from modern Sci-Fi writers. The overall impression is something like a bad Sci-Fi movie from the '50's or the old Batman TV series. The only reason I can see that this drivel was published is because it carries the \\"Dune\\" chachet.

Well, I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but Frank Herbert is no longer with us, so others have to carry on the Dune Legacy. Despite this, I feel the prequel books, including Butlerian Jihad, have done a fine job continuing the Dune series.My only qualm with this book is that it moves way too fast and doesn't really flesh out some points. For example, The Sorceresses of Rossak, Tio Holtzman and Norma Cenva's experiments, and Iblis Ginjo's rebellion on Earth. All their scenes just happened, with no build up. I suppose with only three books to cover a lot of ground, the authors had to rush many events through. (But maybe they could have spent less time on Erasmus?)Well, without revealing more about the story, let me just say that this is a worthwhile read for any fan of the Dune series."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Some people love BH/KJA's books, some hate them. I fall somewhere in the middle, leaning towards &quot;love&quot;. :o)Don't approach this or the other prequels thinking they will be just like Frank Herbert's books, because they aren't. For one thing, the writing is simpler. It's much more easily approachable. There were times reading Frank Herbert's books where I would have to re-read a passage, thinking &quot;What's he saying here?&quot;SPOILER ALERT: Do not read below if you don't want a part of the story given away.One very neat part of the story is what I suspect will be the explanation of what the Honored Matres are running from in Heretics and Chapterhouse. It just so happens that Omnius creates thousands of robotic &quot;droids&quot; (for lack of a better word) that it then sends out into the farthest parts of the galaxy. These &quot;droids&quot; contain copies of Omnius and are programmed to construct a fully functioning version of Omnius once they reach a suitable planet. Thus, Omnius literally infects the vast majority of the galaxy, with humanity concentrated in one basic area. (Once Leto II dies and humanity explodes outward in the Scattering, they then encounter Omnius, which they thought they had destroyed so many thousands of years prior in the Butlerian Jihad.)Also, the robots are constructed of what is called &quot;flowmetal&quot;, which they can morph into various facial features. I would guess they are what the Honored Matres are referring to when they mention &quot;the enemy of many faces&quot;.My biggest complaint with the BH/KJA books is that they don't have the literary finesse of Frank Herbert's books. However, this isn't necessarily a bad thing as I mentioned above how Frank's works are sometimes hard to read. Not so with BH/KJA.All-in-all, a very good book. You may agree, you may disagree.

YOU'LL REGRET PUTTING EITHER OF THESE INTO THIS BOOK...."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"This thick, but easily read novel has the pace and spirit of a Star Wars adventure. The blurb on the cover says it is \\"An exciting prequel to the novels that made science fiction history\\" (a reference to Frank Herbert's \\"Dune\\" series). I agree with this hype. Though it's the first of a trilogy, it stands well alone. You may need to tolerate some weaknesses, but I recommend it.1. Story, Characters, and Plot: Human-controlled planets must struggle to avoid enslavement or annihilation by planets ruled by intelligent machines. This main plot connects with a number of sub-plots, one of which takes place on the famous planet Dune. Plot and sub-plots are all interesting. All of the characters are interesting too, and some of them are extraordinary, for example Norma Cenva and Erasmus.2. Logic and Plausibility: Needle guns, faster-than-light space travel, and telekinesis exist. And we get a good taste of Frank Herbert's imaginative psychotropic drug, called melange, commonly known as \\"spice.\\" All of these are cool, acceptable as generic science-fiction devices. But other points are unconvincing: an unconvincing action sequence here, an unconvincing point about technology there. This is one reason why I give the book only four stars.3. Writing Style: The style is contemporary--streamlined with only a little background detail. But maybe it was too streamlined, leaving me a little hungry. Sometimes I felt like I was drinking water when what I wanted was a bite of a sandwich. This is the second reason I give the book only four stars. I would have welcomed more substance--more background detail here and there, and deeper looks at some of the characters.Note: Sometimes the worth of a book can at least partially be measured by the fondness with which it is remembered. It has been over a month since I completed my reading of the Legends of Dune trilogy (\\"The Butlerian Jihad,\\" \\"The Machine Crusade,\\" and \\"The Battle of Corrin\\"), and my memories of it are quite positive. Though this trilogy forms a different kind of story from that of Frank Herbert's classic \\"Dune,\\" the quality of the story is as good. For this reason I have decided to give each book in the trilogy a five-star rating. I believe the weaknesses in the books do not merit a lowering of rating."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Setting aside the other commentaries on the length of the story, the number of characters, and the writing style, I'd like to focus on how the main story has been substantially changed from what readers had previously been told (this is an observation, not necessarily a complaint).This story describes a situation far, far worse for humanity than had ever been suggested in previous Dune books of all sorts.What we had before (from the The Dune Encyclopedia) was a human universe that depended on computers for considerable rote calculation work, and some humans discovered a small, subtle murderous trend in the computers that they decided could only be solved by getting rid of the computers entirely. The movement quickly grew and humans who would not relinquish their thinking machines were killed. The resulting problems of living without computers forced humanity to develop the amazing skill sets described in the human universe of Dune. Humanity is left with a primal, negative attitude towards computers for the next 10,000 years and more. As with Dune, a critical decision by a disobedient Bene Gesserit started a series of events that engulfed all of humanity.This latest book throws that story into the garbage bin. Forget a subtle computer threat, we're now facing outright domination and potential extinction.Thinking machines rule most of humanity, and that humanity is left in a severely servile and primitive state. The machines don't need the humans in any way (unlike the Matrix situation). Like the Terminator series and unlike the Matrix, there is really just one ruling machine mind, and the rest of the artificial intelligence (AI) enhanced machines are simply taking orders. This one mind, Omnius, is an accident that no one planned on.Unlike the Terminator series but like the Matrix, we can clearly see how the AI machines were able to take over since they were already ubiquitous throughout society, and most importantly, manufacturing. That society, a stodgy, lazy Old Empire, is taken over by a rebel group of 20 who reprogram the AI robots to be aggressive but still subservient to these 20 rebel \\"Titans.\\" The Titans forget about invigorating humanity and apparently settle on becoming brutal dictators. Some human planets remain free by military force while others are simply not important enough for the Titans to bother with. The Titans extend their rule by putting their brains into mechanical bodies and further alienate themselves from humanity.Ironically, one of the Titans becomes so lazy that he turns over most control of his planet to the AI network. The AI network apparently achieves the equivalent of mental critical mass and decides it should run everything. The AI change spreads quickly and the Titans rapidly find themselves in a junior ruling capacity underneath the unified AI network called Omnius.A thousand years of AI rule pass for the bulk of humanity which becomes horribly subservient to the machines for no better reason than the aggressive programming in the AI Omnius. Some of the free human planets organize into feudal societies and join with others in a confederation that manages to fend off the occasional AI incursion into their territory.The stale status quo is set to change as the result of a wager between Omnius and a uniquely independent robot of his about the ability of humans under Omnius control to rebel against the machines just as the \\"wild\\" and free humans still do.During this story and the following book The Machine Crusade, we see the precursors to the amazing human power groups in the original Dune series. These include the Bene Gesserit, the Spacing Guild, the Fremen, the Tlulaxu, the Suk doctors, the Ginaz Swordmasters and the Laansrad. What we don't see yet are the Mentats and the Sardaukar.If there is one tragic element in this story and the more immediate precursors, it is how common humans have virtually no human rights and can be physically abused at will whether by AI machines, machines operated by human brains or human nobles. Does it matter much if you are being wantonly tortured to death by Erasmus the robot, Agamemnon the Titan or Baron Vladimir Harkonen?Either way,Butlerian Jihad and the next book The Machine Crusade make it abundantly clear how the humans in Dune had such a visceral response to the concept of thinking machines. Anyone wondering anymore about the impetus to develop Mentats instead of backsliding to a threatening technology?"},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"This is another prequel series set in the Dune universe (as memorably created by Frank Herbert) in which his son Brian and Kevin J. Anderson carry on the torch. After the first instillation of this trilogy, set some 10,000 years before the events in the original novel Dune, I can already say that I find it to be an improvement over the first three &quot;House&quot; prequels. Their first prequel trilogy had potential, but there is no way that you can appreciate Brian's development of the younger characters after having been introduced to them so richly by his father. If you allow it, reading the first prequels can change how you look at the original Dune novel, and that really shouldn't be.That being said though, this trilogy picks up on an often mentioned yet never developed thread from the original series: that of the fight of humankind to escape the slavery of the thinking machines that they created. It also lays the basis for the birth of the Great Houses of Atreides and Harkonnen, the Bene Gesserit sisterhood (presumably an offshoot of the sorceresses of Rossak?), the Fremen people, and the guild. Butlerian Jihad also makes the connection to human origins on Earth, which was never explained in the original 6 novels, although it was increasingly hinted at as the series progressed. It's a lengthy novel, but fun to read, and I'm already curious as to how they will develop the other two novels in this set.So in short, this one gets 4 stars strictly for its entertainment value and how much I enjoyed another chance to visit the Dune universe. It's not a novel that I'm going to reread several times like the Frank Herbert classics, but a single visit was well worth the time taken to read it."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"It is so obvious that the 5-star ratings are from the authors or the editors/publishers of this book. [Please! I love this book after the first 100 pages?] What kind of review writes, &quot;Pick it up, and see how they envision how it all begin,&quot; seems a lot more like a sales pitch.The book has its strengths, like it reveals some of the basic origins of phrases we hear a lot, such as Holtzmann and Butler. However, I can't help but feel like Herbert and Anderson got it wrong. I've always inferred from the original Dune that the Butlerian Jihad was a rebellion from within machine-dominated worlds, like slaves rising up and smashing machines, the triumph of the human spirit. This book tells it as if there were always two sides, one machine and human, and they decide to fight a war, except the machines don't have atomics. It very much belittles the struggle of humans (so what if Serena had to go through some torture? her boyfriend Harkonnen has SHIELDS and ATOMICS and TELEPATHS(don't ask)), I mean, how can humans have been so dumb for 10,000 years if they've always had those weapons but couldn't use them even after billions of people died.I am not an apologist, if I wanted to read &quot;simple, easy-to-read, straightforward and easy-to-comprehend&quot; I'd go read some Star Trek novels or watch some Pokemon. If I wanted easy plots and simple cause-and-effect, I'd go watch the Discovery Channel or Crocodile Hunter (blimey!). So there is no excuse, really... And one last hint for the publishers, don't say the original series was hard to understand (it hurts sales, don't it?) and don't say that you enjoy the prequels b/c the originals were so hard to read... if you didn't enjoy the original Dune's, why in the world would you even pick up a prequel?

They continuously tell the back stories of the characters rather than showing them by their actions and interactions. When the story returns to the characters, the authors compound this failure by repeating the back stories.It's a shame the writing gets in the way of the story the authors try to tell. Generally, the story is not bad. There are a couple of occasions when characters respond in ways that seem excessively simple-minded; motivations do not always seem to match to response in the book.I would not encourage anyone who isn't already a Dune fan to pick this book up.

The FH Dune novels are thickly constructed. They are a source for much of what goes on in the BH/KA series. If they were to be as wordy as the 'originals' it would be counter-productive.These are fun to read but they are also intricately constructed novels in their own right. A lot of people don't notice, but there are plot resolutions in them of plot details contained in the later Dune novels. There are also --- I suppose --- plot details in the House series that are still up in the air. Will they be resolved 'before they happen'?? Or will we have to wait 10,000 years or more?"},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I just started reading the dune books, starting with the originals, and got up to &quot;god emperor of dune&quot; before I found out about the prequels. So I took a short break from reading Frank Herbert's excellent series and read the House books and The Butlerian Jihad. This is one of those books that you read for the sake of the originals, in the belief that it must improve eventually. After 600 pages, it still didn't. The writing style is incredibly cliche'-ish, the plot is utterly predictable except where important events are left out, and it has none of the scope of the originals, nor their believability. It's depressing to think how much better this story could have been told. It is inferior even to the &quot;House&quot; trilogy. And after all this, the main jihad events referred to in the dune books are absent, including the harkonnen betrayal and the battle of corrin. I am inclined to think Herbert and Anderson were simply unable to tackle any actual storytellng, which accounts for the gaps. As mentioned earlier, their are also substantial gaps in believability. There is just no way characters could be this flat, especially in a dune book, and the &quot;spark of the revolt&quot; is completely unconvincing, as is the idea that all the main organizatons in the dune books were formed during this one time period. It's as if everything leading up to the &quot;real&quot; dune series happened in a space of twenty years or so, and nothing much occurred for the next ten thousand. Finally, &quot;The Butlerian Jihad&quot; lacks the depth and complexity characteristic of the dune books. Brian and Kevin seem to make only a halfhearted attempt to deal with major issues. Frank was much better at analyzing religion and fanaticism and war and so forth. So, that's my two cents. Hope it saves you the price of this book."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"First, this is a great book on its own. I have read all of the prequels written by the son and they are all good books. I liked every one of them. Were they classic literature? No, but they caught the spirit of the story and gave the classic Dune a starting point.This book tells us about the Titans, the thinking machines and the humans who fought them. Is is perfect? No, it is not, but it is very readable and the characters seemed real to me.Quit complaining... this is stil a mile better than most stuff written today. I put it up there with David Weber and his like, if not better than most of the current military sci-fi, which it is.

And, once again they have done a good job.\\"The Butlerian Jihad\\" fills in some of the backstory that was mentioned in the original series by Frank Herbert, who largely left it to the reader to imagine a life when machines ruled humanity. This book is written in the same style as Dune: House Atriedes, etc. (duh! same authors) -- e.g., several stories within stories are started and we are introduced to several new characters. Their tales are presented in alternating chapters. It is written in a fast-paced, active-voice style using many short chapters. However, it is a bit slower to get going than the \\"House\\" trilogy. Having read several of Kevin J. Anderson's books and a few of Brian Herbert's, I think that the style of these new entries in the Dune series is much more Kevin Anderson's than Brian Herbert's. So, if you like the style of Mr. Anderson's Star War's books, and you like Dune, you will probably enjoy this book. I look forward to reading the next two entries in this trilogy: \\"The Machine Crusade\\", and \\"The Battle of Corrin\\" - due out in 9/03 and 9/04, respectively....Enjoy it, folks...and happy holidays :-)"},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"What a wait and for what a failure.

Not that this worthy addition to a major science-fiction (SF) dynasty by son Brian Herbert and co-author Kevin J. Anderson can't stand on its own --- but more of that later.When Frank Herbert gave us DUNE back in 1965, the desert planet of Arrakis and its mysterious tribal culture seemed exotic indeed. It wasn't only far removed in time and space, but well beyond most SF readers' imaginative experience. At the time (bear with me, all you Boomer Echo folks) we Earthlings were caught up in the Cold War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, Soviet premier Nikita Kruschev's shoe-banging antics in the UN, the amorphous threat of China under Mao Tse-tung, and of course the televised horrors of Vietnam.It would be another two years before the infamous Six-Day War pitted Israel against a largely unknown (and so far ignored) Islamic-Arab world. So who would even consider the dry and disunited Middle East in terms of literary world-building? Who would dare build an alien planetary culture based loosely on half-a-dozen mainstream Earth religions, but bearing more imitative resemblance to Islam than anything else? Well, we know the answer to that one --- DUNE soared to the top of the bestseller lists for both SF and general fiction and stayed there.For another two decades, until Frank Herbert's untimely death in 1986, DUNE sequels hit the bookshelves at regular intervals. Soon there was a DUNE trilogy, then a second trilogy, and so on. But it was inevitable that growing pre-DUNE curiosity --- based no doubt on the exhaustive endnotes, historical lists, glossaries and maps appended to the inaugural volume --- would force Herbert's literary descendants in the opposite direction. Several more books appeared, broadening the galactic stage and filling in more and more characters.And that's essentially what the hugely ambitious prequel, DUNE: THE BUTLERIAN JIHAD, tries to be all about. It pushes further back than ever before into the convoluted history of Dune's scattered planetary societies, back to a time when humans rose in an arduous, chaotic and culturally devastating revolt against the \\"thinking machines\\" that enslaved them. Originally invented by humans, these super-robots, who combined mechanical superiority with relentless \\"fuzzy logic\\" reasoning, soon outmaneuvered their creators.From the existing series and the late author's notes, Anderson and Herbert have painstakingly pieced together an enormous, vibrant fabric from a mind-boggling array of tantalizing parenthetical references, subtle asides, detailed fictional genealogies and the like. Over scores of brief, unnumbered chapters that keep the book firmly glued to one's eyeballs (in defiance of real-life necessities like having to get off the bus, get up in the morning, or give in to the lineup at the bathroom door), THE BUTLERIAN JIHAD whirls from one character and subplot to another, allowing some to dramatically intersect, while others are left precariously suspended until later story threads retrieve them. Many of the major family names, notably Atreides, chronologically emerge here for the first time. As well, formative events, like the discovery of riding massive worm-beasts across the sand seas of Arrakis, are introduced.But like so many enormous projects --- especially inherited ones --- THE BUTLERIAN JIHAD falls into some common traps. It tries to navigate too much territory between only two covers; one often craves more sustained focus and less repetitive clutter. Additionally, it lapses far too frequently into extreme blood-and-guts violence that rapidly loses its power to shock, but not to disgust.And the title begs to be questioned. It's unfortunate that these skilled wordsmiths didn't choose a more appropriate keyword than a militaristic distortion of \\"jihad,\\" which mainstream Islam reserves for discussing the discipline of pilgrimage and/or personal spiritual discernment. Ironically, a thinly disguised oppressed religious group modeled on Muslim culture is thoughtfully and respectfully portrayed.Despite its shortcomings, there are vast stretches of strikingly lyrical and cogent writing here. THE BUTLERIAN JIHAD worthily continues DUNE's original power to draw even the least empathic reader into fascinating realms of morality, philosophy and sheer rampant surprise.--- Reviewed by Pauline Finch"},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"How many factors known to the participants are remembered thousands of years later in legends, or even a few years later in history?

That being said, his prose died with him (big surprise...&lt;insert ironic snuffling noises here>). And contrary to some reviewers ideals, 'The Butlerian Jihad' was part of Frank Herbert's early Dune history. So, no, Brian Herbert and KJA were NOT trying to capitalize on what is currently going on in the world. Which kind of freaks me out: 'How much precognition did Frank have!!'On to the book:We pick up with the thinking machines in control of Earth and many other 'synchronized planets' under the rule of Omnius, a singular computer mind that tells all other thinking machines what to do and what's happening in their universe.Vorian Atreides is the son of Agamemnon, a Titan man/machine with the mind of a human and the body of a mechanical beast. Vorian is a traitor to the human race and believes that humans need to be reigned in so that the Universe can be more easily controlled and comfortable.Xavier Harkonnen is a decorated war hero in charge of the human fighting fleets on various 'human' worlds.Selim is the first Arrakis desert dweller (Fremen isn't their title yet) to ride a sandworm. He believes that Buddallah saved him from the desert so that he could help save Arrakis from eventual destruction and CHOAM over-indulgence on spice (hasn't happened yet, but you know it's coming!).Serena Butler is the daughter of Viceroy Manion Butler on Salusa Secundus. She is beautiful and intelligent and a fighter. She will become what the 'Butlerian Jihad' is all about... she and someone else.Xavier and Vorian are both in love with Serena. What's a girl to do? You won't find out til the end.Erasmus is a thinking machine, trying to figure out (in computer terms) what it is that makes humans tick. And he struggles with this concept throughout the entire book. Unwittingly, he helps get the Jihad moving by making a few crucial errors in his calculations. Erasmus also initially thinks that he can find out what humans are made of by...well...dissecting them in very crude manners. Warning: Don't eat while reading these sections!We also see the development of the Bene Geserit (Zufa Cenva), and their inability to control their powers.And we see the formation of the Holtzman shield and how it will play a pivotal role in the Jihad. In Frank's earlier notes, he said that 'Holtzman didn't completely understand how the field generation worked.' Now, thanks to Norma Cenva (Zufa's stunted daughter) we get to see who found out about the shields and their strengths and weaknesses. We also catch a fleeting glimpse into Norma's brilliant mind as she works through the possibility of fold-space calculations.The authors focus more on actions than words (similar to their previous works) and that can get old at times. But the history behind the development of the cultures kept me going without a problem. I wanted to know about the Fremen, Bene Geserit, Mentats, the feudal houses, CHOAM's beginnings, etc. etc...The Jihad has only just begun..."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"This book will bore you to tears.

The boy tries to take those ideas and make them work, but fails incredibly and ends up writing a book full of very awkward foreshadowing, as many cliches as 600+ pages will hold, and virtually non-existent character development.Basically, about a thousand years in the future, a collection of 20 online gamers, computer programmers, and general rebellious types took over the world by reprogramming the AIs that helped run everything. These gamers became their handles, all of whom happened to have called themselves after Gods - and became known as the Titans. Agamemnon, a decedent of the House of Atreus, is the head of these. Together, the Titans rule for centuries, have their brains removed from their bodies, and continue ruling inside machine bodies (called \\"cymeks\\"). They get lazy, and their AI becomes true AI, names itself Omnius, and takes over their empire. This AI rules for a millennium, keeping human slaves and other machines, one of which gains a personality of its own. The humans he tries to conquer are confederation of loosely joined planets, some of which keep Zensunni slaves.Once you realize this, all of which is back story, the book kinda tells itself. Only the last 100 pages or so offer anything I didn't guess in the beginning 100 pages. Xaiver Harkonnen is the lovesick warrior, Serena Butler the beautiful, naive, and oh-so-loveable princess, and Vorian Atredies is the son of the evil Titan Agamemnon who shuns his past and joins the League of Nobles out of love for Serena. Perhaps the only non-typecast character is the machine Erasmus, who learns how to lie.Basically, here's the deal about this book: this Herbert is just a boy playing dress-up in his father's ideas.

Admittedly, the authors are trying to cover a lot of ground: they have clearly made a catalogue of questions that remained unanswered from the original Dune series and have endeavored to fill in every blank.

A good deal of Dune history is fleshed out for the first time, giving the reader a broader understanding of its historical underpinnings. Still, I have several criticisms of the story.First, I thought the various storylines could have been integrated together better. The story of Selim, for example, seems almost completely disconnected from the rest of the book, as if it was thrown in just to cover all the bases.Second, I found myself missing the in-depth thought processes of characters common in Frank Herbert's Dune trilogy. Lots of saying and doing, but we never really get into the characters' heads in this book.Third, the end of the book left a LOT of loose threads hanging. How did the League conquer the rest of the Synchronized Worlds? What happened to the remaining Titans? What happened to the many deep-space probes sent out by Omnius to colonize worlds beyond the League? Does Norma set out on her own, apart from Tio Holtzman? Just where do Mentats and the Navigators arise from? How do the houses of Xavier Harkonnen and Vorian Atreides develop into full-blown mortal enemies, when at the end of the book they seemed to be getting closer?There is certainly something to be said for leaving a few details to the imagination, but this book does so far too excessively, as its purpose is to _provide_ details about the history of the Dune universe.Which is not to say it doesn't have its good qualities. The battle scenes are well narrated, and the authors pose an interesting moral juxtaposition with the slaves who are forced to work for human masters in order to free humans from machine masters. And the character of Erasmus was both interesting and chilling, kind of a cross between Mr. Spock and Joseph Mengele.Overall an OK read, though fans of the Dune trilogy may not get as much as they hoped for, especially if they go by the Book Description above.

I do not agree with most of them. I found it to be an excellent book. As with the prequel trilogy(House Atreides, House Harkonnen, and House Corrino), these books help to understand many keys parts in the original Dune book. Many people thought that Butlerian Jihad had a no-so-great ending and that it kind of left you hanging. If these people had looked on the inside cover of the book, they would see that there are to be two more books to complete Butlerian Jihad. In this book, we are given totally new people, but we still have the Harkonnen and Atreides name still running around. Butlerian Jihad helps the reader to understand why the thinking machines were so bad, and why no likeness of a thinking machine should ever be made. It also shows some insight as to what Salusa Secundus was like before it became the training grounds for the Sardaukar. Butlerian Jihad also shows us that spice was not well known in the earlier times,and how it was gaining fame.

Amazon messes with everything by giving only an odd number of stars so one cannot be completely even on something. It either tilts toward like or dislike. That's a little unfair, but it is what it is. This is an entertaining science fiction book, which begins an entertaining science fiction series, but it really is not Dune. An attempt at reading all the books in the \\"Dune-iverse\\" in chronological order reveals several inconsistencies and a change in presentation of the universe that make the Herbert/Anderson universe wholly separate. The method of speech, though processes and general movement of the plot are entirely at odds with the original Dune Chronicles. Admittedly, Frank Herbert represents a high standard by which to judge ANY science fiction writer, but then again, the Herbert/Anderson duo have given us no choice but to hold them to that standard because of their choice for source material.As to the plot itself, I found myself rejecting certain origin stories. The Bene Gesserit, for example, remain to me a body of somewhat unknown origin as they are not able to make someone's brain explode with a mere thought. Further, the methods by which they achieve their goals are always more clever and clandestine that the Rossak Sorceresses. The reader is usually wholly unaware of the all of the purposes of the Bene Gesserit, as opposed to the one-dimensional and bullish Sorceresses. I realize organizations evolve, but even with the passage of thousands of years, it doesn't seem plausible that the two could be linked. Similarly unsatisfactory origin stories are later given for the Navigators.On the other hand, when the reader gets into Fremen origins things become a little bit more plausible, i.e. drop hard-working, oppressed, religious people into a desert, add some more years of toil and then you have proto-Fremen. It's one of the few sections that really work.Overall, however, it is difficult to bring this book and the ones that follow in line with the original novels and the writing style leaves much to be desired.

This is the first of a pre-prequel triogy, but I demoted it to buying as an e-book, and it was the designated \\"trash sf\\" novel that I keep on the Palm for reading in odd moments. But it was so slow that I've gone through a dozen novels on the Palm since putting this one on (one of the side benefits of Palms having so much memory these days).But, as I said, I finally finished it, and predictably the finish was simply the introduction to the next book in the series. The problem with the book is, frankly (no pun intended), that it has too many plots going on. It tries to tell too many stories, and nothing seems to have been edited out. I guess they're trying to be \\"epic\\" and with the classic status of the original Dune books there's some tendency to preserve everything, but there just seems to be no story. Things keep happening to a lot of people, but there's no story that you get interested in. The characters aren't bad, although the writing gets pretty hack-ish describing them at times, and I did get interested in some of the situations, but it just seemed like stories were being written just because something is being set up a couple of books down the road. Maybe Dune aficianados (who are the market for these continuous prequels) like this sort of back story, but I didn't think it was good writing. One indication to me that they are badly overwriting is that they have indicated that they have found Herbert's original note for the \\"final\\" Dune book (which would be #7 of the original series) and they have already split it into two books. Seems to me that commercializing the Dune franchise is taking precedence over good writing. I don't mind additional books, but starting with this second prequel trilogy, things are getting a little fluffy.The biggest drama of the book is whether it'll be the last of the series that I buy. My guess is that it will be. I give it two stars because it isn't bad writing or an offensively bad plot, and it is imaginative - it's just mediocre."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"The originals were so rich and thought provoking that I believe my IQ increased a couple of points. The prequels, on the other hand, are standard-issue space opera. On their own, they're enjoyable, even though the characters are as wooden as an Al Gore speech. As part of the Dune universe, however, they fall on their face in a spectacular way. I've seen reviews where the prequels have been blasted and \\"disowned\\" by so-called Dune loyalists. Although I do not personally consider the recent books to be within the borders of Frank Herbert's fictional realm I must say to the aforementioned reviewers that you should consider that it IS fiction we are discussing here. As far as I'm concerned, the new ones are fun in a goofy sort of way, while the originals expanded my thinking, so who cares, really? It's still a win-win situation. Have fun!"},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Some books are hard to put down, this one was hard to pick up. It took me an exceptionally long time to read it because I found it to be such a disappointment. The original Dune introduced characters with depth. The dialogue was well written, you couldn't wait to see what happened next. The authors of this book have none of the imagination of Frank Herbert and should leave this fantasy genre to write sitcoms. I saw the second installment on the shelf at Barnes & Noble for 50% off, but I could not bring myself to buy it even at that price."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"DTBJ was a decent way to spent a few hours decompressing before bed. That is the nicest thing I can say about it. It does not at all compare favorably with the rest of the series. To place the work in perspective, I would rank the original three Dune novels with 5 stars, the second three (still FH) with four stars, the &quot;House&quot; trilogy by BH with three stars (if feeling particularly charitable). I considered ranking this one with just one star, but I think these guys could actually do worse, so I'm leaving room at the bottom.I wholeheartedly agree with other characterizations of the writing style as sophomoric and insipid. The characters never find their own voices. In original FH works, one can remove all explicit identification of speakers and still follow dialog with reasonable surety. In DTBJ, it is hard to remember who is talking half-way through a line. Plot is advanced in some bafflingly ham-handed ways and characterization often drifts into caricature.There are vague echoes of some very young FH, e.g. &quot;The God Makers&quot; and &quot;The Whipping Star.&quot; They also danced right up to some of the ideas of &quot;Destination Void&quot; and &quot;The Jesus Incident&quot; and then retreated without saying much of anything of significance. I do not know if these subtle hints were intentional or simply the inevitable result of years of influence of the father on the son. I really doubt it was intentional because nothing else in the book suggests subtle or sophisticated nuance. A more direct and unabashed homage to these early FH works would have worked well and been a fitting tribute to a great author.I am not too troubled by any inconsistency with the original series. This is not Tolkien. As far as I know, Herbert did not spend years modeling a complete alternate reality with unique and fully developed languages, histories, etc. I would gladly forgive much more serious inconsistencies if they at least drove more interesting character development.I found I cared very little for the protagonists and found myself cheering for the machines at times. The Holtzman character was amusing just because I am a professor of engineering and his foibles hit close to home. Even with him though, I just couldn't see any depth. Serena Butler is a poor stand-in for Jessica Atreidies, my chest never tightened when she was in a pinch. Vorian comes of age and changes sides so fast, I found myself agreeing with the councilors who doubted the loyalty of anyone who would turn on his father like that. The authors telegraph the Xavier-Octa-Serena mix-up with so little finesse I kept waiting for a midle-school english teacher to step out of the shadows and annouce : this here is what we call f-o-r-e-s-h-a-d-o-w-i-n-g. You can all say that, can't you?&quot;Yech. There is worse pulp sci-fi on the market, but this is the worst thing I have read with the Herbert name on it."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

Every year in October a new Dune book and every January a warm beach to lay down on and read these novels. while these books are nowhere near as complex and philososphical as the original series, they are solid books an their own. They transport you to another time and expose to you to new worlds. The authors do an excellent job in developing the characters we have grown to love (and hate).I recommend this book without reservations"},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"At this point, I'm hooked on the Dune world because of some compulsion inside to know more of the story. Enlightment has nothing to do with it. Its like all those people who will shell out [the money] to see Star Wars III even though they really didn't like I and II and will not be renting the DVD's (I am one of them).Overall I thought it was OK. As a compulsive Dune person, I found it OK entertaining. Would not recommend this book to anyone that hasn't already read everything else and seen both movies. But here is my big complaint ----The inside cover promises way more than it delivers. I realized about 1/2 way through that there was no way this book was going to make it to the Battle of Corrin, Hark-Atr feud, human triumph over the Syncronized Worlds, and founding of the Guild, Bene-Ges, Mentats, etc (you can guess though).......realized that this is just part I of a new series --- a teaser so you'll read the next ones (like a comic book or soap opera.....). The end of the book leaves you hanging. While reading the last 50 pages, just ended up thinking about how the story was going to arc from point A to point B over the next couple books. That really [upset me]. Should have known that there was just too much ground to cover in one book. Only real 'payoff' was learning about the end of Earth and the atriedes (titan) family history."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I've just finished reading 10 Dune books in a row... The Butlerian Jihad is by far the best of them. In fact, it's the best science-fiction book I've read since Asimov's Foundation.I found the original 6 books boring and pretentious, but somehow they seem to make some sense now, on the second attempt, after I've read the 4 books by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson.Erasmus is a very interesting character, much more believable and memorable than Paul Atreides or Leto II. Obviously inspired from the crimes of the Nazis in the death camps - I've read identical descriptions of those experiments on twins before, except that the criminal's name was Dr. Mengele, not Erasmus.A bit of inconsistency - the Harkonnen character in this book is an imbecile with good intentions, while in the other Dune books the Harkonnen character (Baron Vladimir H.) is evil and far smarter than anybody else.In conclusion - I wish Frank Herbert had written this book after God Emperor of Dune - we'd have been spared the embarrassment of \\"Heretics of Dune\\" and \\"Chapterhouse Dune\\" and we'd have had something worth reading much sooner..."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Perhaps I am slightly optimistic in my view of this book but I can't help it. Though everyone compares Brian and Kevin to Frank, I'd have to say this is a great read on its own. Actually, while I was reading Frank's Messiah, I started the Butlerian Jihad, and guess which one I'm still reading and which one I'm reserving for later? Yep, the Butlerian Jihad beat out Dune Messiah. The Butlerian Jihad is not flawless though. It has a few too many undeveloped characters but beyond that I found the style to be quite fluid. It's actually better than Frank's, but Frank had more powerful and much more intelligent ideas. For example, certain twists in Frank's books you never see coming, but some points in this book were rather predictable. However, I certainly enjoyed it enough to give it a perfect score."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Herbert and Anderson took there first run at writing in the Dune universe with their &quot;House Trilogy&quot; and produced a mildly interesting yet, in the end unfilling, trio of novels. With &quot;Butlerian Jihad&quot; though, the duo has finally produced an original novel worth the read.The &quot;House&quot; series suffered from the simple fact that Herbert and Anderson were using characters we allready knew and loved and they just could not write them the way we needed them written. With &quot;Butlerian Jihad&quot; they finally had the opportunity to break away from the characters that the elder Herbert's unimitatable style had made exclusivly his own. While Jihad will not become that literay classic the original Dune novel was, it is good science fiction which those uninitated to Dune will find readable and fulfilling and those stepped in Dune lore will find enoyable and interesting.I would highly encourage any fan to read this - not only is the story a good one well told, its just plain cool to see the history cited in Dune unfold. The origin of Salusa Secundus, the beginings of the Bene Gesserit, the revolt against the thinking machines... all this and more make &quot;Butlerian Jihad&quot; a fun read and a good start, both to the new Dune series from Herbert and Anderson, but to the Dune universe and story arc as a whole."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"The world of Frank Herbert is still alive. It was always tantalizing to hear the author and characters refer to the past in the original Dune series. Now the details have come out of the background. While I enjoyed the prequel series that was recently put out, the scope of the books was hardly up to the standards of the original series. On the other hand, this book paints a broad stroke, dealing with all levels of society and how the Dune universe came about. The book is full of revelations of the genesis of the different niches of Frank Herbert's society. The characters and storylines draw you in for 600 engrossing pages. If you have no experience with the world of Frank Herbert you will find this to be a great work of science fiction, well put together, with enticing plot and characters. But be warned if you are familiar with the world of Dune, you may have trouble going to sleep, leaving for work, and finding time to eat until you are done. Now it will take patience to get to next year when the second installment arrives. Thank you Frank for leaving behind those valuable notes."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I was impressed with the Prelude to Dune series (House trilogy) and had similar hopes for the Legends of Dune series, but this one, Butlerian Jihad has proven to be somewhat disappointing. It's not about different characters and plots because I was okay with that in the Prelude series and I was okay with that in the original Dune series and the jump from Children of Dune to God Emperor of Dune with new characters. This book does not seem to hold my attention, lacks the mysticism and philosophy the others possessed, and seems like something that might qualify for a \\"made-for-tv\\" movie on the Sci-Fi channel. The characters lack depth and dynamic qualities. Basically, it's nothing that keeps me up in bed reading until 3 a.m. like other books have. The beginning and end catch your interest and pick up a good pace, but the majority of the book is very slow moving, with meaningless plots and information. Though toward the end it manages to save itself from being an unfinished book, as the story picks up speed and things get a little more interesting. It still serves as adequate entertainment, if you need to pass some time or something, but there are books I read for entertainment, and then books I read for something more, and Dune happens to be a series I have high expectations for, not extremely high, but above average expectations. Prelude to Dune met those expectations, but it doesn't seem Butlerian Jihad has come close to original Dune or Prelude to Dune. That said, it's still worth buying and it's not a bad book, just not a breathtaking one either. Machine Crusade and Battle of Corrin might be better, so who knows.--Amended from a previous, slightly more negative review."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"This book just rocks! An excellent addition to the Dune series. There are some really great characters in this book, most notably Iblis Ginjo, Selim the outcast Fremen, and Erasmus the independant robot. The relationship between Vorian Attreides and his robot friend Seurat is enjoyable to read and also one of the books highlights.The action sequences and plot twists in this book are written in an excellent way, but to discuss any of them further would be a spoiler and you really should read them without any fore knowledge.Overall, an excellent book and a worthy addition to the saga of Dune."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I love very much the book Dune and its sequels. But this book is very different. This book could serve as the storyline of a third class sci-fi production of Hollywood dripping with blood and nothing more - an interesting book, but it is very-very far from the original books of Frank Herbert. Borrow it from a library and read it, then forget."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"As one would expect, this book doesn't match the original but it's unfair of course to compare this work (the single book or the entire trilogy) to the original Dune series, which well deserves its place in science fiction history. One of the ways to somewhat neutralize the natural temptation of readers to compare is to delve so far back in the history of Dune that you are working from an almost clean slate, which is what Andersen and Herbert do with their newest prequel trilogy, set several millenia previous to Dune's world. If it doesn't hold up to the original, how does it stand as its own novel? The answer is not bad, though the next answer has to be not great.The strong points are the plot and structure. While the book probably could have used some cutting, its length is not unreasonable for its story. The structure, which involves cutting between several independent though eventually converging plotlines and characters, is well-suited both to the book's complexity (allowing for lots of information to be conveyed in manageable chunks) and length (adding suspense by cutting away at prime moments). And the plot is interesting in its own right, beyond being a simple nod to the &quot;I want to see how they explain where this came from&quot; readers of Dune. One of the grave dangers of prequels is that one ends up with a work wholly contrived to connect the future dots, a book where the author just has to fill in the blanks-mention this legend here, drop this name there, explain the origin of this ritual over there. For the most part, the authors avoid that here, and even in the rare instances where you have the feeling it's happening, it's over relatively quickly and painlessly (I actually thought it was more noticeable in the second book of the series).The weak point of the book, as is often the justifiable complaint with science fiction, is the characterization. Too many characters feel plot-driven or two-dimensional. And one of the major characters, the Atreides heir, is simply unbelievable in his transition. One would think that in a 500 + page book there could be some more allowance for slower, more realistic character development, but sadly that's not the case here (check out Westerfeld's The Risen Empire/Succession for an example of how to do more characterization in half the space).The lack of good characterization detracts from an otherwise well-told story (especially in that unfair comparison to the original series), but it doesn't get too much in the way of enjoying the story on its own right, or in getting some answers to the questions Dune fans have been asking for decades."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I bought the first book Frank Herberts son wrote, and for some reason I bought the next 3.

I couldn't get through it quickly enough and onto my next read. None of the complexity of Frank's work. To call the characters \\"two-dimensional\\" is being generous.Is there a synopsis of the following two books? I'd rather not endure the chore of actually reading them.You know what really scares me? Certainly not a moron like Erasmus. Rather, the fact that B&K; are writing two books to follow Chapterhouse. Let's hope they take some of the magic pixie dust that helped Frank come up with such awesome stuff and hopefully avoid the sophomoric tendencies that led to this drivel.But semi-seriously, I suspect the only reason serious Dune fans spend time on these pulp novels is that we are so hooked on the entire Dune universe that we will wade through the horrible writing just to find out \\"what happens\\".

I plan on reading the rest of the prequels and the two new Dune books Brian is releasing later this year and next year. Having said that, I consider Butlerian Jihad as my favorite Dune book.I don't want to spoil anything, but I will say that in this book you'll find some romance, horror, and some interesting characters. There's a certain event in this book that made my hairs stand up in anger, horror, and sadness, none of Frank's Dune books were able to do that to me.If you have read all 6 of Frank's Dune books, one difference about the writing style you will quickly notice is that whereas Frank's chapters are usually between 6-10 pages long, Brian keeps them interesting and short usually between 3-5 pages long.If I were to rate the Dune books I've read so far from best to worst, it'd be:1. Butlerian Jihad2. God Emperor Of Dune (ever wondered what it would be like to live as a god? Then read this one, you'll love it)3. The Machine Crusade (too many painful deaths brings it a notch below Butlerian Jihad)4. Chapterhouse Dune (I love the Bene Gesserit)5. Heretics Of Dune (This one is mostly about the Bene Gesserit. This is certainly the most sexual Dune book, not that that's a bad thing.)6. Children Of Dune (Nice plot twists in this one. Leto and Ghanima makes this a fun and interesting read)7.

Well, if you're a fan of the Dune universe, you know you want to read this anyway, and if the three previous books are any indication, you won't be disappointed, so let's not beat about the bush. This book grabbed me at 100 pages, and thus I feel confident of its ability to enthrall me further. It is the first in the series designed to fill in the years even before &quot;House Atreides,&quot; the years the original Dune series constantly refers to but leaves tantalizingly unexplained. I won't spoil anything, but you will see the genesis of many institutions in the original series. Also, some characters that I have ached to know more about are given dimension here. Indeed, this is a novel made of origins and beginnings. Beginnings are such delicate times, and Herbert and Anderson handle them adroitly. On another point, in the first 100 pages of &quot;The Butlerian Jihad,&quot; Herbert and Anderson have truly found their own authorial voices in the Dune style. Whereas the first novels had a definite &quot;imitating the master&quot; feel, this novel's tone and style are noticeably different when compared to &quot;House Atreides&quot;; like evolving musicians, they have learned to play the Dune universe with their own flavor. In short, they are fulfilling the sci-fi legacy left by Frank Herbert to my satisfaction. Pick it up, and see how they envision how it all begins."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I found the House prequel trilogy to be entertaining enough, even though it lacked the depth and complexity of the original Dune novels. So I expected this novel to be of about the same caliber.I was mistaken. The Butlerian Jihad was bad enough that after reading over half of it, I chose not to finish it. And I *always* finish books.Part of the problem was the complete lack of recognizable elements from the Dune universe. Granted, the story is set thousands of years before the original novels, but even so, more common elements would have made the story more interesting to Dune readers.Instead, we have a fairly typical futuristic SF milieu, with the remnants of free humanity fighting for survival against an evil AI who wants to destroy them all. The planetary battle of the first few chapters is unremarkable, and could have been lifted from any Star Wars novel. The main characters are just fleshed out enough to play their roles in this space opera, and are motivated by the most basic values and ideas. There are no inquiries into ethics or morality, no challenging of the characters' ideas.This is itself would not be intolerable, if it weren't so tedious to read. The Butlerian Jihad is made up of many, many very short chapters, alternating between different points of view. Each chapter progresses its plot line just to the point where the reader's interest is recaptured, and then, frustratingly, ends. I found this book a chore to read, and the lack of original plot or complex characters did not make the effort worthwhile.I will not be reading the other books in this series, and I hope the forthcoming \\"Dune 7\\" books do not suffer from these problems."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"The good news is I listened to an unabridged version from the library of this on tape while driving to and from work.

At least I did not pay money for this...This book takes any pretense of logic and throws it out the window. From the sounds of it all the free worlds of humanity have less nuclear capability than the USA and USSR during the cold war. The delivery of these weapons made no sense. The slave uprising was ridiculous and pitifully handled, except for the machines solution. Pretty much all the military action was handled poorly and held little water.The Tiatns creation was so horrible I think it set a record for the worst character creation ever.Other problems included the lack of birth control in the future, a grief period of a couple months for your fianc&eacute; before marrying her sister, wooden characters, and my favorite, THE SOLVER SLAVES. The authors wishes us to believe that 100 slaves with abacuses can solve advanced revolutionary mathematical equations by doing them one step at a time. Right, and 100 monkeys in a room with 100 typewriters for infinite years will eventually write Shakespeare!Mr. Herbert and Mr. Anderson, please stop. This was...not worthy of the Dune title. Mr. Herbert, if your goal is to answer every prequel question from the original Dune book find a way to get the DUNE ENCYLCOPEDIA back into print. That did your father's work proper justice.

The \\"hack\\" style of the writing and plot give us a clue as to what has gone wrong in science fiction literature these past thirty years. \\"Butlerian Jihad\\" shows clear evidence of contamination by the \\"Trekkie\\" fiction genres, Star Wars, and even nerd Internet culture. The assumed names of the \\"cymeks\\" appear to be derived from their \\"screen names\\",and the Titans \\"Juno\\" and \\"Agamemnon\\" are given a back story which seems to indicate they first met in a \\"role-playing game\\" chat room.The Dune Encyclopedia, produced some twenty years ago, contained different and far superior prequel stories of the Butlerian Jihad, Holtzman's inventions, and the like. The story setup arraying the robot culture vs. the human culture totally misses the mark in assigning relative advantages and disadvantages to either side. The \\"thinking machines\\" do not demonstrate any thinking or the processing power of a collective mind.While promising many \\"insider\\" looks at the origin of Dune institutions and technologies, the action in this book takes place ten thousand years prior to the time of Paul Atreides.

This book's compressed timeframe does not do justice to these Dune gems by forcing them to form spontaneously before the reader's attention span gives out.Part of the two-star rating is an award for the chutzpah of the authors, to have so eviscerated a promising literary premise in the name of the mass market. Also, I thank this book for warning me to keep my distance from modern sci-fi writing in general.I will start today on my version of the Butlerian Jihad prequel, in an attempt to forget all about this unpleasant reading experience.

I've read the original Dune series innumerable times. I'm the proud owner of a signed first edition of \\"Chapterhouse: Dune\\". I've read SF since I was hooked at the tender age of eight when I stumbled upon A. Bester's \\"Tiger, Tiger!\\". I read at least five or six books a month, half of which are SF. I've a pretty good grounding in classical and contemporary English language literature.Once I've presented my credentials, let me say one thing:The prequels SUCK!Now let me elaborate upon that:In the \\"House\\" prequels, the co-authors at least had to be consistent with FH's original universe. Now that they went back 10,000 years, they think they don't need to be that consistent with the originals. The problem is: they can't even invent a consistent, believable universe by themselves.The premises are simpleminded: For example: How the hell can you sustain a whole technological planet --Poritrin-- with *no* computers (a hand calc qualifies as a computer here), totally around slave labor, and, incidentally, support advanced R&D; of Holtzmann's caliber? Whoops! And there are no such things as Mentats or any other augmented intellects yet either.The characters are cardboard-thin and mentally-challenged: Xavier Harkonnen's vaunted \\"military prowess\\" is idiotic. The first scrambler field installations' vulnerability is glaringly obvious to any hard-SF space-opera reader: dump rocks at gravity-well speeds on top of the centralized installation. Boom! Instant crater, forget about kindjal fighters. Yet the heroic soldier missed that through his six month inspection tour, even though he was instantly promoted to command after the same thing happened to his superiors (purely by accident, by the way: the first machine attack missed this too; so much for Omnius's love of efficiency).The style is wooden, and it reads like the notes the authors passed around via instant messenger while they were bouncing ideas back and forth. \\"XXXX's eyes were misty, (s)he felt sad.\\" See Spot run.I originally read the \\"House\\" prequels to get my Dune fix, even if it was like having a saccharine-sweetened lemonade when I craved a triple-fudge sundae. I'm halfway through \\"The Butlerian Jihad\\", and even if it is awfully, horribly bad, I'm going to finish reading it. Why? I'm having way too much fun demolishing it. It's a beautiful example of how *not* to write fiction, so I'm learning a lot.On the other hand, if you're not an aspiring writer learning by (bad) example, and you just want to enjoy a good book, stay away from whatever these two have written, it's not worth the hassle."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"The Butlerian Jihad is not a worthwhile book within the Dune series.

Doubt I'll finish it.2 stars for &quot;has moments&quot;"},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Frank Herbert must be rolling over in his grave knowing the series he created has been so shamed. The Butlerian Jihad reads more like \\"Harry Potter and the Evil Robots\\" than anything remotely associated with Dune. The plot is weak, the dialog is forced. This single book should be an end to the story. Instead there are two more to plod through to get to the end. Laced with weak descriptions of characters, flaws in logic so great that even the computer illiterate can see them, the technology seems to be out of the mind of an elementary school student. Read it if you must know how the factions of Dune started, but dont expect a good read."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"For years and years, Dune fans read about the Butlerian Jihad, the epic struggle for humans to throw off the yoke of the insidious thinking machines. Decades after the first Dune story saw print, we learn the story of the Butlers and the origins of the institutions of the Dune universe.The story revolves around a young politician, Serena Butler, who initially fights to end slavery in the human-controlled, League of Nobles worlds, but becomes involved in the struggle against the machines. After enduring the murder of her child, she becomes the figurehead leader in the struggle.Many of other things we always knew about the Dune universe are either wrong or at least backward. Salusa Secondus is a beautiful capital planet, not a hellhole prison planet/ training ground for the dreaded Sardukar. Geidi Prime is a resort, not an industrialized wasteworld. The Harkonnens are the good guys, the Atreides serve the robots, and Tio Holtzman is a complete fraud.While the story is quick-paced enough, it's not as interesting as the original Dune story, of course, but it's not shown much greater depth than the earlier Dune prequels. As many have pointed out, much of the characters still seem paper-thin."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"The authors are improving. However, they seem to be unable to create &quot;evil&quot; characters that are believable. For instance, the Cymek Ajax in this installment is portrayed as nothing short of a maniac. This shallow development does not allow for any complex exploration of his motivations and loyalaties.However, I have noticed an improvement is the authors ability to create beleivable characters that are not at their extremes of good and evil."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Being a huge fan of the original Dune books, when I heard about House Atreides I was both excited and skeptical. More Dune certainly seemed like a good thing, but I doubted that anyone could truly recapture the unique style of Dune. I read House Atreides and House Corrino, and they were certainly good, but they didn't hold much of a candle to the original six novels. House Corrino, however, was very engaging and had the kind of &quot;wheels within wheels&quot; plot that keeps you reading. What I realized is that with House Corrino, Herbert and Anderson had moved away from trying to duplicate the original Dune, and were instead writing in the style they do best: not Dune, but a story set in the Dune universe, and a good one, too.When I heard that a book on the Buterlian Jihad was coming out, I was even more excited, and more skeptical. After all, in the Dune series, it was referred to as an impossibly epic, always remote chapter of history, rivaling the importance even of Muad'Dib. A book about it would have to be impossibly epic, more so than the original Dune, or else kill the romance of it.This book does kill the romance, if you take it literally as a part of the Dune legacy. But if you approach as more of a fan fiction, you will find an intriguing and complex story set in one of the largest backdrops in science fiction. This book has the distinct style that slowly emerged in the House books, and it uses it well.So what's the bottom line? If you approach this looking for a good sci-fi novel, you will not be disappointed at all, and will be eager to read the next installment. But if you are expecting a great novel that lives up to the grandeur of the name &quot;Buterlian Jihad&quot; bestowed by Frank Herbert, you will almost certainly feel cheated."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I have read every book to carry the &quot;Dune&quot; title. I have loved the series from the first installment, and still love it with the latest work by Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson. Unfortunately, the series didnt love me back this time.I got through the book in about 3 days, but while I was on the edge of my seat (like in the other books), the end didn't hold up as the other aspects of the novel did. I hate to ruin the summary for anybody, but the origins that it claims to explain of the various groups in the Dune universe aren't told in detail, rather they are glossed over without any direct reference.I would only recommend this book to VERY DEDICATED Dune fans, anybody else, go get the Sci-Fi movie."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I should give this book fewer than 3 stars, because I really didn't like it, but I don't want to give the preferences system idea that I don't like Dune books or scifi in general.This book is not good. It's also not really a Dune book. It lacks the wheels-within-wheels plot development that I've come to like so much. The characters are undeveloped and the plot thin. The only reason to read it is for insights into the beginnings of things that are ongoing or talked about in the other Dune books."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"This book is worthwhile only in the context of its sire, the immortal _Dune_ and the other lesser volumes in *Frank* Herbert's original series. Read all those volumes before devoting time and money to this pale shadow of the original. The style is weak and the characterization is shallow. The plot is interesting only to the extent that it makes interesting speculations about the historical background of the original."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"This book, in addition to the story behind the Butlerian Jihad, was supposed to give the origins of the Bene Gesserit, Mentats, Suk, swordmasters, and Guild, at least according to the inside front cover. Unless my copy was missing some pages, it barely touches on the precursors to the BG. The book is also supposed to explain the betrayal between Houses Harkonnen and Atreides. It seems to explain it away as a misunderstanding that is later resolved. So, is there another betrayal later, after the Houses are actually formed?? This book doesn't remotely live up to its potential. They probably just wanted to make some more money. They must write another one to resolve the above issues."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"You know, reading some of the reviews for this book and the others in the series, I truly believe that some people have just completely missed the plot.I found The Butlerian Jihad to be an excellent read and I could not put it down (4:00am in the morning on one marathon).Some reviews say this isn't the world of Dune that Frank Herbert created and wrote in his six books. Correct. That's because this is set in a time before all that happened. The Butlerian Jihad is a look back in history to give you an insight into how the Dune world grew.Not wanting to give anything away to those that haven't read these books yet, but as a fan, I found the history fascinating and addictive. There are many initial references of events that eventually happen in the Frank Herbert books that left me wanting more.For reviewers that claim they couldn't finish the books, you have missed out on an excellent piece of work. This is Dune in its infancy. A growing planet and a growing universe. This may not be Frank Herbert's Dune, but it definitely is the world of Brian Herbert and Kevin J Anderson.I look forward to book 7 in the Dune series which will hopefully make up for Chapter House Dune."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I got a second hand copy and been putting off reading it for about a year, since I had enjoy the Dune original series. Some of the story line was similiar to other Sci Fi themes...like the machines taking over...couldn't help of thinking about the Terminator.But, the rest was impressive so I went ahead and ordered the next one. I enjoyed his style of writing and the story was interesting and paced well."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Just to let you know where I'm coming from, I loved (and reviewed) all of Frank Herbert's Dune novels. I'm excited that the Dune universe is being expanded with the House Trilogy and the Legends of Dune and will even finish off the cliffhanger that Frank Herbert left us in his last book.I read the House Trilogy and was fairly disappointed. The story was somewhat interesting but lacked the depth and maturity that Frank was able to write. I was mostly disappointed in that the entire series didn't seem worthwhile because we already knew all the events that unfolded in the trilogy. Everything new they put in the books wasn't really worthwhile. I was left a little reluctant to continue with the Legends of Dune trilogy.However, so far so good. It still lacks the depth and maturity that one would expect from Frank Herbert, but it is better written than the House trilogy and is actually discussing events that wasn't already known from Frank Herbert's books.From Frank we know that the Butlerian Jihad took place (and humans won) and that the feud between Atreides and Harkonnen started there. There is very little else mentioned. But the events of the Butlerian Jihad have a lot of effects on the society of Dune and it is nice to finally find out what happened there.The story is interesting, despite its flaws. We also see an early glimpse at the relationship between the Atreides and Harkonnens before the grand betrayal takes place, but I think we'll get a deeper look in the following two books. We also get an early glimpse of the creation of the mentats, Bene Gesserit, Guild, and inventions such as personal shields and glow globes. We also see Arakkis (Dune) before the universe discovers its importance.In the end, I was left looking forward to the next book in the series. I'm enjoying this look at the Dune Universe 10,000 years before the beloved story of Paul Atreides takes place.Oddly, this is the first book without Duncan Idaho."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"The Butlerian Jihad is the first installment of a trilogy, a prequel of sorts ostensibly based on the notes and writings of Frank Herbert.For those of you that don't know, The Butlerian Jihad takes place ten thousand years before the time of originator Frank Herberts immensely popular book, Dune. It is a collaboration between Brian Herbert (Frank's son)and Kevin Anderson. It is the forth book co-written by these authors that I know of, having just finished another trilogy/prequel, The House series (House Atriedes, Harkonnen and Corrin).Unlike some other reviewers, I found The Butlerian Jihad to be an exceptional book. I believe it to be Herbert/Anderson's most accomplished manuscript. I finally got to experience the past which was vaguely alluded to in Dune.We get to meet the beautiful, compassionate Serena Butler, who's son, the murder of which, set off the rebellion, which eventually brought down the heartless thinking machines. We also meet distant relatives of Baron Harkonnen - Xavier (who is a good and honorable person) and Paul Atriedes - Vorian (the son of the wicked Titan, Agamemnon {a thousand year old human brain in a robot body})and Tio Holtzman (the revered inventor of the Holtzman Effect and other inventions). We experience the last stronghold of free humanity, with The League of Nobles, the fledgling exportation of the spice Melange from Arrakis and the precursor of the Bene Gesserit, in the Sorceress's of Rossak.As with the original Dune, the authors create numerous civilizations in a Universe dwelling on millions of planets and then embellish it with devious evil characters and their requisite counterpoints. It may be ten thousand years in the past from Dune but they are everybit as advanced to us, as we are to Neanderthals.I found this book, consisting of 695 pages, to be an enthralling read. True, the chapters are numerous and short but the story is huge so it couldn't be overly detailed, or the book would have been unwieldy. We are, after all, talking about a Universal Epic in which the authors followed about fifteen main characters on six different planets and in space. As with Dune we are treated to an excellent page turning science fiction novel with religious undertones."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Of course The Butlerian Jihad is a must read for Dune fans.The style of the book is similar to the previous trilogy written by Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson - there are numerous story lines within the novel and each chapter switches between these story lines... one chapter focuses on Xavier Harkonnen, the next focuses on Vorian Atreides, the next on the &quot;soon to be&quot; Bene Gesserit, the next on the origins of the Fremen, etc. This style of writing (along with the short chapter lengths) helps to move the story along quickly. 600+ pages go fast, sometimes to fast - at times lacking the detail that made the original Dune so amazing (character development and especially scenery).The story does take a while to get used to... it's weird to hear all this talk of robots in a Dune novel (even if you're aware of what the \\"Butlerian Jihad\\" is prior to picking up the book), but once you learn the enormous amount of new character names, the novel flows pretty well. The last 100 pages move really fast (each page is a &quot;page turner&quot;), and overall it's fascinating to see the origins of things like worm riding and spice addiction, even if some of the philosophical and political undertones present in the original Dune series (first 6 books) are missing.For a none-Dune fan the novel might get 2 stars. For a Dune fan, the novel would probably warrant 3-4 stars. I'm looking forward to the next one..."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Well, if you ask me, the Herbert/Anderson team aren't doing a very good job with Frank Herbert's legacy. The characters don't have any depth, and the plotting isn't much above Buck Rogers. You'd think that Brian Herbert would have learned something about developing complex novels from his dad. Even more bothersome, is that they don't seem to be following the clues about the Old Empire that Frank Herbert dropped here and there. And I don't know how much of the Dune Encyclopedia had Frank Herbert's imprint, but the characters of Butler, Holtzman, etc. directly contradict what's in the Dune Encyclopedia. Don't waste your money on this book until it comes out in paperback..."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"The Butlerian Jihad is a very entertaining book, and that is why I gave it four stars. I still read books for the pure enjoyment of it, and discovering the ways in which Frank Herbert's son imagines(and hopefully researched) that the Dune Universe, the one that we all know from the origional Dune, came to be is about as enjoyable as most storylines I can envision. That said, this book is not incredibly well written. The character developement is the poorest of any book in the series so far, and the plot lines take on some awefull turns. The predictability gave way to a feeling of a massproduced science-fiction story that was released more to make money than to pay tribute to the world of Dune. If you are looking for a litterary masterpiece, move on, but if you are looking for a highly entertaining read that is near impossible to put down (no matter how predictable it sometimes can be) look no further."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"This book was a nice addition to the Dune-prequel series. The one thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars was that I started the book believing it was a stand-alone book, a belief which was reinforced by the wording of the inside jacket summary. About 3/4s of the way through it, I figured out it was turning into another series akin to the \\"House Atreides-Harkonnen-Corrino\\" line. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I was kinda hoping to not have to wade through another 3 books to get to the end.On a personal note, the way this book presents the Butlerian Jihad is not the way I ever pictured it from the original series. I always saw the Dune past as a world not too different from ours (albiet with much more advanced technology). Then a group of anti-technology unabomber-esque radicals seized power and went on a rampage, destroying all \\"evil\\" computer technology. And because they controlled society, they wrote history to reflect their own views (not unlike Orewell's 1984). Over the millenia, the people of the galaxy attatched religious and mythological significance to the \\"Jihad\\", forgetting the truth of what really happened. I always thought this coincided much better with Herbert's world of complex religious, political, and societal maneuverings.But that's just me.The book was enjoyable to read, and in the end, isn't that the real truth?"},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"This is a great start to the epic Dune series!

I've read some of the other reviews and I can't agree with their appraisal of the writing or story. I was a fan before reading this book and I'm still just as much of a fan.However, my review really should focus on the Kindle version of this. To put it simply, it's horrible. I've read quite a few books now that were done by major publishers that didn't have any errors. This had TONS. There were random hyphenations, strange italics, odd characters appearing in places and dozens of other little issues.For the price that we're paying for this and the fact that it's such a large publishing house putting it out, we should not see so many flaws."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Magnificent introduction to the known Universe, the time of the Titans, the origins of Omnius, and the great spark that ignites the war against the Thinking Machine Empire. Having re-read the Dune \\"original six,\\" I caught tiny, brief, even one-time references to planets (Anibus), people (Norma Cenva in G. E. of Dune), and others that get massive significant treatment, here.For KJA haters, this whole trilogy allowed KJA and BH tremendous creative license to explore new territory in the duniverse, ancient when even first encountering Omnius, while massively distant from ourselves in this day."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Unlike the three previous prequels, \\"The Butlerian Jihad\\" is disappointingly dull. The writing style is clunky, and while the plot rests on the the usual varied multi-character mosaic, it's not particularly exciting. The novel promises to explore the origins of the Spacing Guild and the Suk doctors, but fails to do so in any convincing fashion; the same applies to the beginning of the feud between Atreides and Harkonnens - this is no more than hinted at, and what 'roots' there are come across as fairly unconvincing.Saving graces are the sections dealing with the evolution of Holtzmann's theories and applications for his shield generators, as well as who was really responsible for many of the breakthroughs ascribed to the charismatic scientist frames a wonderful sub-plotline. Also, the novel does provide an understanding of the factors that led to the jihad against Thinking Machines of any kind [and thus the later development of human mentats] and the ongoing prohibitions against artificial intelligences that continued to shape the \\"Dune\\" universe.The \\"titans\\", human brains in machine bodies, who aim to carry much of the narrative, come across as pointlessly cruel and conniving, yet not particularly interesting, with a heavy-handed cackle factor that belies the elegance of earlier Herbert/Anderson collaborations."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"To date I have read the entire Dune series twice. I enjoyed the Butlerian Jihad. The story moves!!! Put simply... It is like watching a action packed exciting movie. The characters are intense, many plots unfold at the same time, and many unanswered questions are finally told in this gripping novel about the war against machines. I read it in one day! I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"This is a good adventure story and the characters (especially Erasmus) are well drawn and the story is interesting. However, this is not Frank Herbert. On its own this book is pretty good, in comparison to Frank Herbert's Dune novels this book isn't all that great. So don't compare it to Frank's work, let it stand on its own, and enjoy a fun adventure!"},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"If you have read DUNE and the sequels but not the Dune Encyclopedia (ISBN: 0425068137) you will almost certainly find this prequel interesting enough to finish. If you are a fanatic about Dune and own the Encyclopedia this book will drive you nuts. Everything has changed. Norma Cenva is not an Ixian Refugee, but daughter to a Sorceress (?!). In fact she and Holtzman (who has had his name changed in this book and is no longer a cyborg robot ship) live in the same age and work together. The Thinking Machines are no longer subtle inventions that Butler only accidentally discovers killing humans (unnecessary abortions ordered by Hospital computers), but have totally run amok and are slaughtering people left and right in the street and enslaving all that rest. While from a conceptional viewpoint many things have merely been reinterpreted and repainted (by an overtly and extremely BROAD brush). Still, Frank Herbert specifically endorsed how the Encyclopedia told the Butler story. In fact, the similarity of the character names and roles makes it quite apparent that the author of the Encyclopedia had some kind of access to at least some (if not all) of the original notes Brian Herbert is using to base these new prequel books on. While Brian Herbert has more right to say what is Dune canon than some unrelated guy who wrote some speculative history he had no involvement in creating and called it an Encyclopedia, I feel the Prequel books ruin the world more than enhance it, especially when compared to the old Encyclopedia.Despite this, the story is interesting. Brain Herbert may not be a great writer, but he has come up with some interesting ideas and reinterpretations of the Dune Universe. I don't think they are entirely consistent with the Dune universe, but if you can't afford the 80-100 bucks to get a used beat up copy of the old Dune Encyclopedia, you will find The Butlerian Jihad at least somewhat entertaining. If you don't know what Dune is, you are likely to find this book poorly written, and will miss much of what is being insinuated here.And finally, on the official Dune website (www.dunenovels.com) Brian Herbert has said he intends to publish the \\"Dune Concordance,\\" a collection of all the references in the books to the history, and I would assume the original background notes Frank Herbert himself must have kept. So there is still something to look forward to, even if you find yourself despising the prequels."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"The influence of Frank Herbert's inspiration is obvious in the plot and characters of this novel. The intellectual challenge and philosophical ramifications of cymeks and intelligent machines are set up with the same Herbert believability that challenged our preconceptions with the Tleilaxu (descendants of the the Raelian's, perhaps?).The delivery, however, lacks some of the spiritual detail which it seems Herbert's son, Brian, cannnot provide the way his father did. The original novels were artfully connected to history, literature, and both western and eastern thought in a way that was alive. The philosophy contained in the prequeles lacks such life, and is more often than not just material from the original novels shoe-horned awkwardly into place. Brian Herbert has been able to present the conflict set up by his father, to reproduce the sound of the original, but not the feeling. I find myself wishing he had spent a little more time with the writings of the great minds of the ages before taking up his pen.All in all, for fans of the original novels, it is still well worth the read, but don't expect an intellectual challenge on a par with what one would expect from Frank Herbert."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"To be succinct, this is a bad book. Poorly written, slackly plotted, full of cliches and predicabilities, Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson have succeeded in grinding Frank Herbert's brilliant creation into pure, unreadable hackwork.Their previous trilogy of &quot;Dune&quot; prequels (&quot;House Atreides&quot;, &quot;House Harkonnen&quot; and &quot;House Corinno&quot;) was acceptable at best, but at least held my interest, even as I was aware that the overall quality of the writing was deteriorating as the series progressed. Now, however, they cannot provoke even the momentary suspension of disbelief, as every page, practically every paragraph, is larded with indigestible chunks of bad writing.This guys have succeeded in putting me off the &quot;Dune&quot; universe for good, something that Frank Herbert, even at his worst, never came close to doing. Good work, fellows, you have managed to convert gold into dross."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"Frank Herbert is dead and the recent House Series and the first offering of Butlerian Jihad will not resurrect him or his Dune Chronicles. You've heard it before and it's true, the books by Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson are not like the original Dune books at all. I guess the New Dune books stand on their own as works of Science Fiction since they are entertaining. The operative word here is \\"Entertaining\\". The Butlerian Jihad which attempts to delve into the origins of the Dune Universe, describes the battle between free humans, cymeks (disembodied humans with robotic bodies), and the Evermind (ubiquitous, all-controlling AI). At stake is the survival of the human race and the quest is assumed by characters whose descendants are all too familiar: Harkonnen, Atreides, Butler. It also tries to explain the origins of the Bene Gesserit, foldspace, and the Fremen. Nothing is discussed about the Spacing Guild which is disappointing.The first thing that any reader will notice is that compared to the Dune Chronicles, this is a quick read. There is no complexity, no philosophy, no depth. It's like watching a made for TV movie created for teenagers. Perhaps I can say, with all due respect to the authors, that this is the dumbing-down of Dune that started with the House novels and has continued into this offering as well. These books are written for a young audience plain and simple. That much is obvious when you consider the kind of SciFi that Kevin Anderson wrote. The cymeks reminded me of Japanese Anime like Gundam.Was it entertaining? Yes. Will I read the next installment? Yes.Am I looking forward to reading it? So So. Can we expect it to be a more complex read? No. Is that disappointing? Yes. All I can say to the authors is, do what you have to do to make a living by appealing to the younger masses but don't expect any praises from seasoned Dune fans or more mature readers."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"This is a fantasy story with spaceships. By itself, that label might not be a condemnation, but this entry into the Dune saga is one of the sorriest attempts to milk a series that I've ever seen.The designated evil in the book, Omnius the cybernetic evermind and its cronies are complete cretins that provide no credibility at all. A troop of developmentally challenged boy scouts could outwit these cardboard creations.The way each of the planets in the book is presented, it seems to have a total population of about 200. Science Fiction normally doesn't deal well with realistic populations, but this is worse then the way Star Trek does it.Of the three main characters, only Serena Butler seems to have any depth. The Harkonen and Atreides representatives have about as much substance as Shakespeare's Rosencrantz and Guidenstern.The authors display a complete lack of understanding of spatial relationships, science, technology, and all matters military. In the past some of this didn't matter, because the earlier books used the Guild to instantly transit from one planet to another. But since in this book they have to travel in the real Universe, they trip all over themselves with inconsistencies and improbabilities. Frank Herbert himself wisely avoided trying to explain the technologies he introduced, and never tried to handle conventional military maneuvers. But Anderson and the younger Herbert try and make a complete hash of both.This book unfortunately fills a critical place in the Dune chronology. That is does it so badly is a crime. Can I give it less than one star?"},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"I don't believe many things in this book. I don't believe the reasons why so many free worlds keep slaves, yet are fighting to not become slaves of machines; I don't believe that someone brainwashed by the machines could so easily be converted to the cause against them; I don't believe a slave of the machines would have access to rockets in order to hide them in the monuments he was constructing; I don't believe that on one planet Selim is learning to ride sandworms while simultaneously another group of industrious people are contemplating the commercial viability of melange, while simultaneously the known universe is building up a rebellion to conquer the machines, while yet simultaneously another group of scientists is developing the first prototype shields and the beginnings of the way to fold space! I don't believe in so much of this book, that even to consider it amongst the classic Dune novels would be folly.Ok, so I have read Dune at least upwards of 12 or 15 times (I would put it close to 20, but I lost count somewhere.) I have read the entire series at least a half dozen or more times and several of the books more than that. So I am well versed in the series. I will not quote the mistakes of this book where it deviates from clearly defined precepts of the classic novels, which are many. I would rather like to say what is missing from these stories, and precisely what it was that engrossed me enough to read the Elder Herbert's books so many times.Dune, The Butlerian Jihad describes a varied and splintered human race, spread throughout the galaxy. The different bands of humans are defined essentially by the different things they do. We have the doctors experimenting with chemicals from jungle plants on the Planet Rossak; also on the same planet are the Sorceresses who are dabbling in telepathic abilities and manifesting these into brain fryers. We have the scientific-haven/industrial-planet where Lord Bludd resides, and we have the fringes of society on Arrakis. Then there is the massive military people that essentially come from Salusa Secundus, headed by a distant relative of our familiar Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. We also have the mathematical groundwork for the burgeoning mentats and/or the future guild navigators as well the early origins of the Tleilaxu biological manufacturers (The people from Tlulax. Isn't it fascinating that in 10,000 years the only name that will change in the language drift is the name of Tlulax to Tlielax. Harkonnen and Atriedes will drift 10,000 years without change; the future Fremen on Arrakis are lead by leaders called Naibs and will still be in 10,000 years. Ok, the sorceresses will become witches, ok, two things will change.), Great. Simple. Clear. Precise. Might make a good history book.What makes the world of the classic Dune series so believable and utterly intense, though, is the culture that is so clearly presented. In order to provide such varied, distinct and believable cultures, one must dig down deep and identify the core beliefs of that culture, and then re-develop those beliefs into a series of believable events that would become the basis of a great tale. It is the culture and the fabric of human inter-relationships that brings life to a story, not the events of the story or the quantitative or qualitative data of a planet's resources or their industrial status. The people who revolt on earth have no culture, neither do the nobles, nor do the military, or the scientists, or even the sorceresses. Everything that is done to hint at any culture happens between chapters! Develop some backstory for the lives oif these peoples, and make them look less like brash 20th century tree huggers (see Serena's attempt to liberate a recent machine conquest) and give them some meat in their movements. Surely even with 1,000 years of twiddling their thumbs while machines rule half of the worlds, the greatest leaders of more than a dozen planets can come up with some strategic way of at least taking some occasional offensive action. I can see no difference between a people complacent because they stopped thinking and relegated that task to machines and a people too cautions and full of trepidation to even attempt anything in 1,000 years.I also get really turned off when a book purports to present us with a future history and the future humans have learned NOTHING in 1,000 years or more! If the authors are to present a world where machines have ruled humans for 1,000 years, how could those same humans on free planets even consider keeping slaves of their own? No matter how many times they tell me that the slaves are paying penance for their ancient ancestors not fighting against machines 1,000 years earlier, it just simply doesn't ring true. If we look back even to the building of the Egyptian pyramids, there is currently evidence to support that they were not built via slave labor but instead by a form of community service and religious tithing. Obviously these two authors are not as well read as we would like them to be. (I'm not going to even scratch the surface of any of the scientific issues here...)When writing about future history, especially future HUMAN history, an author needs to consider everything that happened in history from now until the time when the book begins and plot out the major developments that got the characters and cultures to the point in time where the books begin. This is what Frank Herbert did, by outlining his history of The Butlerian Jihad, The Holtzman Effect, and Selim Wormrider, The Zensunni Wanderers, all of which he alludes to throughout his novels. I expect nothing less of any Dune related books. Unfortunately, I would expect that if one dug deep enough, she would discover that this version of the \\"Historie of The Butlerian Jihad\\" and subsequent novels were actually written by none other than Agamemnon himself."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"This book could have been so much more. The subject matter is so rich with possibilities that it should have taken up a trilogy in and of itself. It takes a lot of time introducing characters. I liked the idea of the characters, but found they weren't very well developed- they felt one-dimensional, as if they were only there to hold up the plot line, or satisfy a reference made in a later book.The authors lay out this whole grand plot line of the butlerian jihad, and just when it starts to get interesting they wrap it up. The whole last quarter of the book feels like strung together a bunch of vignettes. It leaves you very dis-satisfied.Disappointing, lacking, ...ugh! I don't have the right words for this. I wanted so much more."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"The problem with trying to follow someone's footsteps, is that you must step carefully to stay on the path. This is critically important in a prequel, especially when following a work like Dune. Dune was not space-opera. The Butlerian Jihad is 100% space opera, with all the, &quot;Wouldn't it be cool if we threw this in' stuff,&quot; that seems to be the accepted formula for making prequels and sequels. Other reviewers have touched on the obvious things, like an actually inefficient and short-sighted Omnius, and the shallow, reactive charachters. The uninspiring battles and bloodthirsty robots are all something we'd expect to see in mainstream pulp sci-fi. This is not what we're looking for in something intimately tied with the universe of Dune.I think that Brian and Kevin both took liberties with the timelines suggested in the original Dune series, and their interpretations of many Frank Herbert's hints are far too literal (the sorceresses, for example).More distracting is the obvious and unimaginative interpretation of 'slavery under the machines'. I think it was pretty clear that the slavery referred to in Dune was a voluntary dependence upon thinking machines that increasingly weakend the human race--something that irritated a large, but scattered religious core of humans. That is the basis of the religious connotation implied in the Jihad--not an afterthought intended to make a potentially unpopular war more appealing to the people. The characters of Dune remembered that the Great Revolt was headlong and uncontrolled, a blurry and bloody time in history that vented unimaginable excesses of violence and terror. Not the lackluster, even boring battles described in &quot;The Butlerian Jihad&quot;. This history is not the kind of history that would give birth to the Great Convention, solidify the already existing Great Schools, or build the conventions of the Dune universe.I really was entertained by the &quot;House&quot; trilogy (although there were many liberties taken there, too), but I was very disappointed in &quot;The Butlerian Jihad&quot;. I doubt I'll buy the next book, but I'll probably check it out of the library just to see how bad it gets."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"No, it's not Frank Herbert, but it's as close as you're going to get. I have read all the original Dune series numerous times. This book, and the books that follow fill in a lot of the gaps you always wonder about. Since they are derived from the great author's original notes, there is validity to the writings. I'm happy I read this book and look at it, as time well spent.IMO, purists should stay away since there are some flaws to be found and the style is not Frank Herbert, at all. But for the rest of us, give it a read, you might like it."},{"Title":"The Butlerian Jihad (Legends of Dune, Book 1)","review":"It was hard for Frank Herbert to keep up with himself during his work on the original canon of the Dune Chronicles. That being said, for me, all six books under Frank Herbert's reign in the Dune Universe qualified for five stars each.Here we are today with Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson at the helm. At first, I was a die hard fan of the original series and totally not interested in Brian/Kevin's work. However, earlier this summer I found myself waiting in line at Starbucks in Fred Meyer and there it was...a fresh copy of Dune: Butlerian Jihad...just taunting me. Since I was on my way out of town for a quick vacation, I decided to pick it up. I had nothing to lose and I was interested in seeing what all the fuss was about.At first impression, the quality and depth of the story line is no match against the original series. However, I was able to put my bias aside and I did find myself enjoying the story for what it is. It was nice to read about \\"early\\" Arrakis and about some of the characters and constructs only mentioned briefly in the original series. However, I was a bit turned off of the with the not-so-creative use of the names of ancient human deity's for the antagonists in the story. Agamemnon? Dante? Juno? Xerxes? Come on. I would prefer completely new and interesting names for the bad guys (and girl). Frank was able to pull it off with the 'Valdimir Harkonen' and the like. When I visit the Dune universe, I want to escape this world, not be reminded of existing mythology.That aside. I enjoyed the book but completely acknowledge the fact that if you are a die hard Frank Herbert Dune fan, you may find this book/series sub par next to the original. I will give it 3 out of 5 stars. I will finish this series now that I have started it...probably visit the House books while I am at it...and re-read the original series for the fifth time."},{"Title":"The Burger Barn on Sunset (A Streets of Hollywood Suspense)","review":"Imagine having an entire congregation willing to proofread your written mystery! Thomas H. Griffith is a pastor for the last remaining Protestant church in West Hollywood, California. Why? Because the rest had closed. He is divorce, has faced his own demons, and is now remarried with a family of two sons. He writes about theology and...flipping burgers.Hollywood has been referred to as the land of broken dreams. Ron Jobeman, a minister by profession, is suffering from a crisis of faith and a broken marriage, after his wife ran off with another minister more flamboyant than he. His thoughtful sermons provoked controversy in the church he was over-qualified to minister to, and he was asked to leave. After training with the Burger Barn corporation and managing another California location, his friend and supervisor suddenly orders him to take over management of the Hollywood Burger Barn. The trouble is, no sooner does he walk in when one of his employees is murdered in a drug deal, and the local cops are already breathing down his neck:\\"'Need t'talk t'you 'bout your employee we had to shoot. I hate it when we even have to pull out our guns, but the officers had no choice, what with him comin' out the back door shootin'. Funny thing, though. When we called to inform his next of kin, all we got was a pager. No one's come to claim the body. Nobody's even called. You know anything more 'bout him?\\"'Although this tale is written with from a theological perspective, it doesn't have the taint of the Christian ideology. Jobeman just happens to be a man who has had a lot of pain and is trying to get his life back together. His earnestness makes him a likely hero, and his intelligence provides the follow-through. He works his way through a dastardly drug ring made all the more odious because of his employing corporation's involvement. It's always nice to see the little guy win, and Griffith does an excellent job of making sure that Jobeman (no doubt a pun on Job himself) gets not only his man, but also the lady involved. A nicely wrought story with several good twists to keep the reader glued to the page. The Hollywood backdrop reflects the grim reality of today's golden city laying in ruins. All in all, THE BURGER BARN ON SUNSET is a well developed, suspenseful, surreal, and sincere mystery.Shelley GlodowskiSenior Reviewer"},{"Title":"The Burger Barn on Sunset (A Streets of Hollywood Suspense)","review":"Ron Jobeman, a former minister, now manages a Burger Barn fast food restaurant in Hollywood. He has just been transferred to this location when the police shoot an employee who was selling drugs in the restaurant. Then Ron finds out that there have been former drug busts at this location. Ron begins to investigate what is going on and how the drugs are being ordered and sold.Why isn't Ron a minister any more? His ex-wife ran away with a more flamboyant minister than Ron. There was controversy in his church from his sermons, and he was asked to leave. Ron wanted a job away from the church and went through the Burger Barn training.The police suspect Ron, even though he is new to the location. Ron ends up visiting a local church and meeting a woman. They begin dating. She helps him with his investigation and also in putting his life back together.This is a great book. I had trouble putting it down. It is written in such a way that you want to keep reading. Ron is such a terrific character. I hope there will be more books with Ron.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Burger Barn on Sunset (A Streets of Hollywood Suspense)","review":"I was truly impressed with this book. It's definitely not a cookie cutter mystery.The hero is the manager of a fast food place called the burger barn and a disenchanted minister.

A lot of people can become instantly taller, an inch or so, just by \\"walking tall\\" (instead of slumped), by changing posture. Exercises in this book, and for that matter any stretching exercises, jumps, etc.) can work even better for you if you engage the power of your imagination, belief and expectation. Nutrition by itself may not make you taller, however it may support your goal.The outstanding results in height increase are based on nothing less than your burning desire, belief and expectation. If you hold onto the belief that you can't grow, you won't. If you believe that it is reasonable to settle for 1 - 2 inches, and that's all that you expect - that's what you'll experience. If you desire to grow more and are open to the belief that yes, you can do it now, and you expect it to happen - than you are greatly increasing your chances of success.The claims that you can achieve outstanding results only by doing physical exercises and consuming food and supplements that release human growth hormone, may sound outrageous - if that's all you do. If you'd realize the effect that your mind has over your body, what previously seemed outrageous and impossible may actually inspire you to engage your imagination to the fullest - and experience results beyond what you dreamed to be possible for you before.Your body changes all the time (within a year, about 98% of the cells of your body are completely different - including your skeleton - and you actually have a completely new body) according to the blueprint you hold in your subconscious. And this blueprint changes according to thoughts, emotions, images and beliefs you entertain on daily basis. You may find scientific articles on mind-body connection and the influence of your thoughts and emotions, your imagination and your expectations on your body and on the release of hormones in your body...A lot of changes in your body pass by unnoticed on a day-to-day basis, and it may not be immediatley obvious to you just how much your imagination affects your body. If you'd like an obvious example, imagine for a moment holding a big yellow juicy lemon, holding it in your hand, then slicing it and biting into it - the lemon juice spurting all over - and eating it. If you really got into the experience, you must have noticed the difference in your mouth. Your mouth watered, didn't it? And where is the lemon? Only in your imagination and it's your imagination that activated your salivary glands.Perhaps, growing taller with the use of hypnosis (engaging your imagination) does not fit into your belief system. Then, if you really want to break the limits of what you believed was possible for you, you need to re-examine your beliefs system. If it helps you to grow as tall as you'd like - keep it. If it doesn't, change it. You will always find abundant \\"proof\\" for any belief system you choose to entertain, when you begin to look for it. If you'd like to learn more about changing your beliefs..."},{"Title":"Increasing Height Through Exercise","review":"I have seen just about every height increasing and &quot;grow taller&quot; book out there, and this is by far the best, and here's why:..., it's the least expensive height increase book on the market.* I found the illustrations to be very good, easy to follow and contemporary.* This Book is well over 100 pages. Other &quot;grow taller&quot; books are just over 50 pages ... I appreciated the honesty of the author: other books make outrageous, obviously fabricated claims about half-foot height increases and food supplements that are useless. This book points out what is realistically possible with no unbelievable, wild claims.Without a doubt, I can say that this is the best quality height increase book I have seen, and the one that can deliver the best results. The illustrations are clear and contemporary, and as far as the information about supplements goes - I found it to be invaluable and not to be found in any of the other height increase books.Bottom Line:This program works. You can do yoga or pilates until you're blue in the face and you will not grow any taller. Give this program an honest chance."},{"Title":"Increasing Height Through Exercise","review":"What's NOT to like about this book? It is thorough, answered every question I ever had about growing taller, and some questions I hadn't even thought about asking. But, the bottom line is, the techniques discussed in this book work. I have gained an inch in height in just a few months using just a few of the exercises outlined in this book. That might not seem like much, but for me ( I am over 30 ), it is a BIG accomplishment. As for all these negative reviews, my guess is they either didn't even try the techniques correctly, or they are written by this books competitor.

Too Expensive - $35 is just way off2. Illustrations are poor - black and white drawings really are very poor quality, I recently bought a Pilates book for just $15 and it has photographs of real people doing the exercises. This book has black and white drawings which look terrible.3. Significant portion of book is 'padded out' with tick boxes so you can record what activities you have done, personally I feel this has been added to get the book over 100 pages!4. Back of book states &quot;An in-depth look at new cutting edge supplements that have been proven to build and repair cartledge&quot; In actual fact this consists of just 2 pages with no mention of whether any individuals have increased their height using such products.Overall impression.Very poor quality book containing very common exercises that are found in other disciplines such as yoga, pilates etc. No real exciting information about supplements and no evidence of whether his program works - he just states he himself has grown.My Recommendation.In my opinion you would be better off getting yourself a Pilates or Yoga book instead. They usually contain exercises which are superior, contain quality photographic illustrations and are far cheaper!!"},{"Title":"Increasing Height Through Exercise","review":"I think the exercises from the book will make you stronger and healthier but they will not make you taller.

It is very good, and has more info on height increase than all of the other books combined. The only problem I have with it is that it moves into the stretching way too slow. I didn't start to see results until I entered the intermediate and advanced training stages. I feel the author is being too cautious. He starts you out with very simple stretches that I am sure is good for flexibility, but won't help you grow. If you are in pretty decent shape and used to exercising I would recommend skipping the beginning stages of the program to save time. The last three stages will bring the real results.

We lost our home and library in a wildfire in 2007, and I was delighted to find used copies still available for replacement. I bought two, one for the shelf and one for secure storage so I don't ever need to be without it again. Never mind that the book was written for children and I am now far beyond that stage. I still find delight in it."},{"Title":"Marxism and Beyond","review":"This collection of essays, published in 1983 (in the last decade of the author's life) serves as an apt summary of the philosopher Sidney Hook's intellectual legacy as America's pre-eminent scholar of Marxism. To the end of his long life, Hook never abandoned his belief that the essence of Marx's thought was alien to the monstrous totalitarian regimes that, for much of the twentieth century, bore his name. The principal long essay in this book aims to give a 'synoptic exposition' of Marx's thought, and is the finest - and certainly the clearest - such attempt I know. At the same time, Hook allied his respect for Marx's thought to a passionate belief in the defence of western liberal democratic values against Communist tyranny. This idiosyncratic combination informs almost every essay in this volume, which comprises philosophical treatments of Marx, some excoriating book reviews of those who overlook the moral imperative of a vigorous prosecution by the western democracies of the Cold War, and various expositions of Hook's own credo as an anti-Communist social democrat.Inevitably the reader's estimate of the success of this set of arguments will depend on the degree to which he believes Hook succeeds in allying his sympathies for Marx with his anti-Communist principles. To my mind, Hook's attempt fails because he underestimates the extent to which Marx's notion of Communist society - a perfect social unity - is essentially, and not accidently, totalitarian. Hook reviews - highly favourably - in this volume the Polish philosopher Leszek Kolakowski's magnificent Main Currents of Marxism, but never really comes to grips with this insight that Kolakowski first articulated some 30 years ago. Nonetheless, Hook's courage and eloquence in defending western civilisation against Communist despotism are displayed at length in this book. There is a particularly fine review demolishing David Caute's tendentious attempt, in his book The Great Fear, to draw an analogy between Stalin's purges and McCarthy's denunciations: as Hook acidly comments, whereas McCarthyism produced an abridgement of civil liberties, Stalinism produced rivers of blood. As an exponent of a principled anti-Communism of the Left, Hook stands in the company of George Orwell and Arthur Koestler. This book is an apt testament to the qualities of intellectual honesty and a devotion the principles of a free society."},{"Title":"For the Love of The Kill : Secrets Kept & A Killing Star","review":"I guess I was going to write how great the book is because he is my brother.

The only reason why I had to part with it was because I had to sleep and work. A friend recommended this book to me, but before I even read it, I researched on the author. English is a second language to CHAU VAN TRUONG, yet his style of writing, the mechanics, the high command of the vocabulary used is by far what catapulted my interest for his books. \\"Secrets Kept\\" is unforgettable yet haunting. The main character, William, is such a hopeless romantic & a loyal man that I yearn for. I lived in the story as I was reading it, scripted with such simplicities yet very detailed. For those who has given up on love, such as myself, you will re-awaken your senses after reading \\"Secrets Kept\\". Such a deep love affair that I cannot fathom has or ever will exist...such affairs you only dream about. I can't wait to see this love affair on the big screen. Next is \\"A Killing Star\\". As I started reading \\"A Killing Star\\", I must honestly say that I was quite disturbed, ironically captivated, because the writings depicts such brutal honesty of what is REAL in everyday life. I'm sure most writers would choose not go into such descriptive language so as to try to stray from stereotyping, but here nothing was held back. I was fascinated as I was reading, but also was scared when faced with what Chance was doing. Again, a very strong Vietnamese MALE leading character...but this time, it was traumatizing going thru what Chance was experiencing because I was anxious to know what was going to happen next...line for line, I couldn't get enough.

No, not because it is thin, but because I could not put it down. This book is so awesome it keeps you turning the pages and digging yourself deeper into the minds of the characters desperately seeking the reasons for their actions. Every page is filled with some sort of action, be it mild, or hard core. The author has a very good way of telling the story without too many wrods. This book should certainly be on the bestsellers list, and everyone should at least give it a try. This is an accomplishment for the Vietnamese people.

I highly recommend Sobotta (Book/CD-ROM) whether used alone or as a supplement to Netter's Atlas of Human Anatomy. I am a physician assistant graduate student at Marquette University and I find the illustrations &amp; references to be very useful when studying for my gross anatomy lecture &amp; lab. Sobotta provides modern imaging diagnostics, endoscopic images, color photographs of surgical views, etc. not found in Netter's. The CD-ROM has all the plates found in the book, but gives you the option to quiz yourself which is very useful. It also allows you to display/hide markers on illustrations, also useful for study purposes. Indexs, tables etc are cross-referenced. If you are looking for a tool to help you maximize your anatomy study/review &amp; you have easy access to a computer/laptop with a CD-ROM, get the Sobotta CD-ROM. You'll find it a great resource!!!"},{"Title":"Sobotta Atlas of Human Anatomy (2-Volume Set)","review":"With this CD-Rom you can easily learn the most important concepts of human anatomy without having to read much, it's all a visual process.

When I saw a short list of books suggested by Robert, I thought it would be worth buying them. After all, Robert himself acknowledges that there was a golden age when some authors were serious about what it takes to write a good story; Thorpe is one of them. So, I bought \\"Write that Play\\".First of all, as you might have noticed, in comparisson with other books related to the subject, \\"Write that play\\" is a bit expensive. For that reason I think you should get a better idea of the book if you intend to buy it.The edition I have of the book was published in 1939, that is probably the reason for its price. The date of publication also shows in the kind of examples and the language used through out the book. At moments, you might find the author is giving you an example of a famous play of the time, so you might wonder what the hell he is talking about.Personally, I didn't really mind about the time of publication and the others details I just mentioned. I even found it rather interesting that some of the troubles in writing a play remain the same regardless of the time.The book has 418 pages.The content of the book is as follows:I. The eagle screams, on drama over America.II. What a play isIII. Finding dramatic material.IV. Building the play.V. Analysis of a great play.VI. More about one-act plays.VII. Characterization.VIII. Dialogue.IX. To the long play.X. Analysis of a long play.XI. Before and after the first draft: Scenarios and Revisions.XII. Variety.XIII. Historical conventions.XIV. Functions and values.A note on what to do with a play after it is written.Chapter analysis.In the first chapters Thorpe explains the trouble the craft was going trough at his time, the content and structure of a good play, and where to find material for a good story. Reading these chapters you can get a pretty good idea of how this author influenced Mackees' undrstanding of the craft.Almost half of the book is play analysis.The last part of the book is more about what sort of aspects you should take into consideration after finishing your first draft.I found the content of the book quite interesting. There are some brilliant paragraphs which show that Thorpe knew very well what he was talking about. Also, altough the theory of writing a good story remains the same as that of Aristotle, I found the examples presented by Thorpe very usefull to understand the more subtles aspects of writing a good story.If you are serious about screenwriting or playwriting and want to get a fine collection of books on that topic, then you might want to get this one. Though, be aware that if you have read many books on the topic, you will certainly not find this book a revolutionary one.I don't regret buying it. After all, Mackee was right: Thorpe was one of the masters in the golden age of Hollywood, he had a solid understanding of the craft."},{"Title":"Masomo ya Kisasa","review":"I use this book in my 2nd year courses. I love the glosses in Swahili, which help students build vocabulary, and the discussion questions. The only complaint I have is with the images, which are too few and often irrelevant to the content."},{"Title":"Masomo ya Kisasa","review":"Great book for intermediate/beginning advance level... This book follows the structure of: Swahili story/reading, grammar notes then comprehension questions. The sidebar dictionary describes key words in Swahili to enhance the learning experience. There's also a Swahili-English dictionary in the appendix if you are still stuck."},{"Title":"Masomo ya Kisasa","review":"Pretty effective, and the readings and chapter structure are pretty good for about third-level study. The Swahili glosses are often nonsensical, but the glossary in the back defines all the words in English, so you aren't reliant on them. The glossary is not a good language resource and will not replace a dictionary.Masomo ya Kisasa does not line up precisely with any elementary-level study I know of, so students' vocabularies are almost certain not to match up reliably with the 'undefined' words in the texts, but it's workable so long as they're at the right level. The length of the readings is highly variable, but they're all real published things, rather than the tripe generally written for language-learning texts.Note that the Arabic orthography option is not touched upon."},{"Title":"The Cuckoos of Batch Magna","review":"Amazon recommended this to me, possibly as a consequence of reading some of Alan Titchmarsh's books, and I have to say I found the Cuckoos of Batch Magna to be brilliantly funny and utterly evocative of rural life. I certainly enjoyed watching the drama play out. I see that the author is a script writer and I have to say I think this would work really well as a TV series! A charming rural comedy."},{"Title":"The Cuckoos of Batch Magna","review":"This novel truly brings to life rural Britain in its descriptive passages, a style that I really enjoy reading. It reminded me a lot of the village I grew up in- some of the characters seemed very familiar- and I have to admit this was a real page turner. The product description hints that this is perhaps the first in a series of books, and I will keep my eye out for the next if that is the case."},{"Title":"The Cuckoos of Batch Magna","review":"The Cuckoos of Batch Magna is the Wind in the Willows for grown-ups - or for grown-ups who are still children at heart. It's described on its cover as the best novel of rustic roguery since The Darling Buds of May, which is also a book I love. It shares the same lovely descriptive writing and eccentric characters (including the American squire who also turns out to be a child at heart) and the same love of the English countryside. Mr Maughan has the gift of taking you into that world, the wonderful world of Batch Magna, its people and its river. It's a book that takes you out of yourself, takes you on a holiday to a place I intend to re-visit, to re-read, again and again. And I do hope it's a world he will make again for his readers, that there will be a sequel."},{"Title":"The Cuckoos of Batch Magna","review":"I read it on the bus, in the bath, at work; this is one book you will find hard to put down.The village of Batch Magna on the beautiful English-Welsh border is the setting for the battle of the century as the colourful residents of the village and houseboats (the lovable rogue Phineas-or should I say Warren Chase-being my particular favourite) take on the millionaire inheritor of the Batch Magna estate. Plans to turn the village into a theme park are not popular and as you can imagine, they are prepared to put up a fight; but on meeting the hapless &quot;Humph&quot; from New York, things are not quite how you would expect.Not only is the story-line refreshing and the conclusion satisfying, but there are bits of dialogue that are guaranteed to make you laugh out loud.I would strongly recommend &quot;The Cuckoos Of Batch Magna&quot;, even if you haven't read anything for a while as this is very easy to get into and brilliant fun. A real gem of a book."},{"Title":"The Cuckoos of Batch Magna","review":"The Cuckoos of Batch Magna is a delightful work of fiction. Peter Maughan is a master story teller, and I was fully engaged with the novel. All good stories should delight, enchant, touch, teach, recall, inspire, motivate, and challenge. I was not disappointed. I felt as if I personally knew all of the wonderful characters. And most important with a good story, you will never forget how it made you feel. The writing in Maughan's book is intelligent and funny, and left me wanting more. I hope this becomes a series of books. I'll leave you with the words of Mark Twain, that helps express the feeling I walked away with after finishing The Cuckoos of Batch Magna: \\"Such slathers of ancient friends, & such worlds of talk, & such deep enjoyment of it!\\""},{"Title":"The Cuckoos of Batch Magna","review":"Just one of the paragraphs of this humorous tale which grabbed me and confirmed more depth ahead. \\"And from somewhere behind him a cuckoo called abruptly, an urchin sound, like a bit of street corner mischief, following him mockingly.

I thoroughly enjoyed this wonderful tale and the characters that soon became friends. It was one of those books when finished I immediately began missing them all. What every author wants from readers. Can't wait for whatever comes out of Peter Maughan's pen next."},{"Title":"The Cuckoos of Batch Magna","review":"I was quite intrigued by the title and started reading with enthusiasm. After about 6 chapters I added this to my 'dislike' file. I have no idea what the story is about and have no intention of trying to find out - I n my opinion it is a difficult book to read."},{"Title":"The Cuckoos of Batch Magna","review":"The Cuckoos of Batch Magna whisks the reader away to the border lands between England and Wales wrapping them in the warmth of a well told story. Maughan weaves a tale of comedy with a hint of mystery.The tiny hamlet of Batch Magna has suffered a terrible loss, the 8th Baronet has died leaving as his only heir an unknown American. What will happen to the tiny hamlet now? What changes will this stranger bring? It is a delightful English village story in the company of Erica James, Marcia Willett and Rebecca Shaw. It is filled with delightful eccentrics and commonsense folk. I loved every minute of it.If you enjoy the likes of James, Willett and Shaw you will love The Cuckoos of Batch Magna. As for me, I cannot wait until the next book in the series is printed. I am looking forward to reading a lot more from this talented author."},{"Title":"The Cuckoos of Batch Magna","review":"The Cuckoos of Batch Magna is a a lovely, meandering little tale. It is chock full of luscious descriptive language and fun character sketches. While I never laughed out loud, I often found myself smirking at a turn of phrase or a character description. It was just, quite simply, fun.The book has conflict, as all good books should, but it is a gentle conflict and you know that it absolutely must come right in the end somehow. How could it not when the new Squire (who just wants to be liked, after all) and the eccentric tenants he is intent on evicting are so made for each other? This novel certainly describes an old-fashioned rural Britain that doesn't exist anymore. But it should. It really should.The book blurb says that fans of MC Beaton will enjoy this book, but the only thing I can see in common with MC Beaton's stories is setting. By my reckoning, Mr. Maughan's writing style has more in common with Kingsley Amis than MC Beaton. Don't get me wrong here -- I am an MC Beaton fan and am currently reading my way through the full Hamish McBeth series again. But I read MC Beaton for twenty or so minutes a night before I turn out the light and go to sleep. The Beaton books are formulaic and have no particular subtlety or beauty of language, so it's easy to read a chapter or two when sleepy and pick the book up again later. Not so with The Cuckoos of Batch Magna. You'll miss all the best stuff if you read this one when less than awake.I have one criticism, which is primarily for the Grammar Nazis (myself among them, sadly). Because of this, I considered giving the book a 4 star rating instead of a 5, but I enjoyed the book so much in the end that it got the 5 stars after all. Truth is, I am still thinking about some of the scenes from the book two weeks after finishing it (and I have read four other books since then), so this is definitely one that lingers.So...here is my (mild) criticism for those who are concerned about the quality of the editing when reading an independent or self published book: Mr Maughan is very much a fan of the complex/compound/chock full o' dependent clauses style of sentence construction. He does not write run-on sentences but he does create very, very, very long sentences. These also appear to be front-loaded in the book and I kept finding myself being pulled out of the narrative early on when I lost my way along the grammatical, but overwhelming, string of words. My personal choice? I would have broken a number of the one-sentence-long paragraphs into more manageable bites. However, by the time I was several chapters in, the writing hit a more comfortable stride and I no longer found myself being distracted by overly long sequences of words. I instead found myself tickled by the sweet, charming, loving way in which the story and characters are described!"},{"Title":"The Cuckoos of Batch Magna","review":"The characters were interesting and so was the story line, however it was stretched out to the point that I could skip a few pages and still have the gist of it. I do remember the book and that is a good sign."},{"Title":"The Cuckoos of Batch Magna","review":"Worth ten stars. If this isn't made into a BBC comedy series it will be the world's loss. Priceless characterization, right down to the lovable dogs (not one mention of cats), and descriptions of flora and fauna by someone deeply in love with the English countryside. It is a stunningly charming tale, one that becomes a part of your heart. A Wind in the Willows for adults. One of those rare books I must have a hardcopy of, just to smile at on the shelf and reread for the pure pleasure of enjoying the work of a master of prose with the soul of a poet."},{"Title":"The Cuckoos of Batch Magna","review":"I loved this book. It's lyrical and very amusing, with all the charm of an old Ealing comdey. The American who inherits the estate and title, a short-order cook and now Sir Humphrey (Humph) of Batch Hall, represents (although he's not a very good example) the go-getting materialistic ''real world, which had always been over there somewhere beyond the blue hills.'' But then Sir Humphrey - ah, but that would be giving it away.The novel is set in my part of the world, the Welsh Marches, and was made so real for me by the writing I feel I could drive over there today, and enter that world of the river where they wake ''in summer to a mist on the water, the valley a pool of still green silence made deeper by birdsong, and there's a river to cool off in. And winters snug around the stove, with the sound of owls outside in the frosty dark or when a wind blows and there's rain on the roof.''More please Mr Maughan!"},{"Title":"Ready-to-Go Writing Lessons That Teach Key Strategies (Grades 4-8)","review":"Patricia Tabb and Nancy Delano Moore show that they have the &quot;write stuff&quot; in their new book, Ready-to-Go Writing Lessons That Teach Key Strategies.

However, when I read about \\"food combining\\" I was taken aback! It isn't easy making drastic changes, but when she tells you too watch what foods you combine, I find this just another difficult step that seems quite a challenge. Food combining is when protein and starches are eaten together, it takes too much energy to digest that meal. This is explained thoroughly.

I will say that both books are well written, in a sense that they are easy to understand. Marilu relays all of the information to you as if she is talking to you - no big words, no hard to understand philosophies. I found the information interesting and tried this way of life for about 3 weeks - no dairy, no meat, no sugar, no caffiene, no white flour....I went &quot;all out&quot;. I have a feeling this way of life is nuch easier when you have someone shopping and/or cooking for you. I found it very difficult to shop and cook for one. (My husband thought I was nuts, therefore he would not take part in this new way of &quot;looking at food&quot;.) Most of the foods were very expensive, and some would go bad before I could eat them, not to mention that many of them were impossible to find in the grocery store/health food store. What Marilu says about the foods we eat, the foods we don't really need to eat, and food combining makes a lot of sense, but applying it to real life was an obstacle for me. I will still pay close attention to my sugar and caffiene intake, and even white flour - but the rest of it? I don't forsee it working into my busy schedule...I think this way of life almost has to become a hobby, for it to work for you. It takes a great deal of dedication, energy and imagination to convert to this change. (I will say that after reading the chapters on milk and beef, I have no desire to consume these produts. YUCK!) I think it is great that it works for Marilu, (she looks terrific!) and some of her readers. I just don't think it is something we all can make work!"},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"I admit it, I bought this book because I like Marilu Henner and saw her on tons of talk shows plugging away--I believe the American public has an obligation to support funny, perky, way-too-enthusiastic-about-everything celebs like her who have turned the once-lowly status of &quot;talk-show-guest&quot; into an art form. Plus, I was looking to change my diet and drop a few pounds, so I decided to give it a try (anything had to be better and easier to follow than _The Zone_). To my absolute surprise, it was not only entertaining reading, but it seemed to make sense. So I tried a few (not all--it will be a while before I can give up all sugar) of her suggestions--namely, ditching meat (not too hard) and dairy products (really hard--adios, butter, cheese, sour cream, ice cream. yogurt, etc.)--and suddenly I was losing weight. I had lost a few pounds before I read the book, but had hit some sort of plateau where it seemed impossible to drop any lower (even though I was exercising and watching my diet). For lack of a better phrase, it seems like Marilu's ideas sort of &quot;jump-started&quot; my metabolism again. I'm dropping weight gradually and safely, I always have the energy for daily exercise (even after work), it seems like a layer of fat has disappeared off my face, and my skin looks and feels pretty darn good. So if you're debating whether or not to get this book, I have to say go ahead and do it--it's not the most scientific tome in the world, but it seems to work, and I have to give it big credit just for that. Plus, rice milk--once you track it down in the nether regions of Kroger--isn't THAT bad, for heaven's sake (three words: smoothies, smoothies, and smoothies)."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"I believe this book has changed my lifestyle in so many ways. I'm a happier person and feel good on the inside and outside. Not only does Marilu teach us her concepts of losing weight, but she teaches us how to have the BEST lifestyle for ourselves and that we can be truly be happy with our lives. I loved reading all the testimonies at the beginning of this book. I even read them over the phone to friends and family to try and make them believers of this way of life. If everyone lived this way we wouldn't have all these angry people running around. I belive this book is great and should be given a chance as soon a possible. I'm trying to get all my friends and family hooked!!! It's a little expensive buying healthier food, but it's definetly worth it. No more diet pills and no more starving yourself. I can actually enjoy my life now, and it's better than ever thanks to Marilu Henner's &quot;Total Health Makeover.&quot;"},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"I first read Marilu's book in early 2001. Within 10 months of implementing some of Marilu's suggestions, I lowered my cholesterol from 219 to 121, went from 139 lbs to 112 lbs (I'm 5'2\\"), got rid of my daily sore throat I had for years, lessened the number of headaches I had, and boosted my energy and joy for life tremendously!! I also finally had the courage to leave a job that affected my life outside of work because it was so stressful. I never looked back!! People who hadn't seen me in a while wondered how my face (and my belly) got so thin because I had always carried around a little extra \\"baby fat\\" no matter how thin I was before. I attribute it to letting go of dairy.I got a little off-track after getting pregnant and having my first baby (because I was afraid to stay semi-vegetarian while pregnant), and as a result, I am reading the book for the second time. I originally got back to my pre-pregnancy weight of 112 lbs but my weight was starting to creep up a pound at a time because I got away from the great habits I learned when I first read Total Health Makeover. So after a week of slowly returning to my good old habits, I'm already feeling better and seeing small results. And I'm not afraid to do it because I know from experience how easy her methods are.I recommend it to all my friends and family!P.S. Food combining is really easy if you like beans and/or soy products. Food combining and cutting out dairy and sugar were the best choices for me!"},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"...and Americans are clearly too ignorant of what they're putting into their mouths. Skyrocketing obesity, heart disease and cancer rates all show that we are not acknowledging how our bodies deal with what we ingest. The digestive process simply does not know how to break down the majority of ingredients in a typical commercial product. (Remember, the food companies are in the biz to make money, not to see to our nutritional well-being.) I think Marilu's addressing the issue of chemical additives is so important. Next, I'm grateful for the information about sugar. Addressing these two factors alone would probably relieve thousands of families who deal with unhealthy, overweight, and/or hyperactive children. As for her guidelines on food combining, Marilu is not the first to advocate this principle (nor does she claim to be). Inconvenient or not, the simple fact is that the body isn't designed to digest starches and proteins together. Many people have no issues with this, but for those of us whose bodies feel bogged down, have depleted energy and slow metabolisms, food combining makes a huge difference.Several reviewers take issue with her unprofessional manner of writing. That does not undermine the value or correctness of what she is teaching. She's not a clinician or doctor, so don't expect tons of laboratory-style expression. But, like a friend, she is imparting her own experience and research. The reading is light and fun, but make no mistake...the subject matter is sound.I've never liked nor disliked Marilu Henner as a celebrity. In fact, I tend to be turned off by celebrity endorsements. I'm grateful I overcame my prejudice long enough to stick my nose in this book. Implementing the priciples of the Total Health Makeover helped my skin clear up, fueled my energy like I've never experienced, improved my mental clarity and outlook, and helped me drop 12 pounds with no portion control in place.This book is somewhat limited on recipe ideas. I have supplemented this with both the 30-Day Makeover book, and most recently I bought her Healthy Life Kitchen. That book is packed with THM-compliant recipes that are awesome!&quot;You are what you eat&quot; has long been an accepted standard; this program bears that out."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"Although I find the food combining aspect of her program a little difficult and I do not follow, I found great results eating organic poultry and dumping the dairy. I no longer have that sick sluggish feeling I usually have after consuming pizza and ice cream. It really is like sludge for our bodies. It also simply makes me feel good not to be partaking in the very sad dairy industry (if you MUST have dairy, please go organic). I have lost a couple of pounds in only one week, and my face is much less puffy! I used to follow South Beach, but really it just made me nauseous, and relied too much on artifical sweeteners and dairy. I lost a few pounds but simply didn't feel well. I wanted to find something with the same principles but took it a step further. Thanks Marilu!"},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"I bought this book after seeing Marilu Henner talking about her program on a few talk shows. I never expected it to be as densely filled with information as it is. Although implementing her entire program entails some radical steps, she talks about ways to incorporate bite-size steps to begin moving toward a healthier way of life. She emphasizes balanced foods (ying and yang), no dairy, chemicals, or sugar, and food combining. It all sounds a little &quot;out there&quot; but I decided to try it anyway, and I feel great. I've lost a little weight, and I haven't had my usual stomach aches after eating. I highly recommend this book. Even if you don't follow all the steps, it's full of valuable info that you don't find everywhere. Not only is the book informational, it's inspiring, motivational, and funny. Marilu Henner has really educated herself, and she'll educate you, too."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"I loved this book, infact I have read all of Marilu's books and enjoyed all of them. After reading it, my family adopted a vegitarian lifestyle for several years. We have recently begun to eat more meat but only organic meat. And we rarely eat dairy products. The information in the book is easy to understand and makes sense to a lay-person. It also give many practical ideas for how to change the way you eat. I have tried every recipe in the book and several are among my families all time favorites."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"I read the book many times before purchasing this tape. I think reading the book helps, because it fills in so much more information about the program. The tape is wonderful for a reminder and motivator to keep you on track with the program.

I wish this tape were unabridged!!!"},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"My wife and I started about a month ago and feel great.

However, making me aware of why I should cut these things out was the best thing Marilu's book has done for me. Also, I loved the pictures. I have gone through a &quot;fat stage&quot; too and seeing her look great for over 11 years is a real motivator."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"I read and tried this &quot;diet&quot; program last fall. Within about 2 months I'd dropped the 15 pounds I'd put on. I was also walking, and that helped too. But boy is it a hassle! Plus we live in a small mountain town, and have to drive 30 minutes just to get close to health foods and the other things Marilu recommends. There are so many &quot;No's&quot; that I got frustrated with all the effort involved. You cannot easily eat out, and if your family isn't on the program too, it's depressing to watch them eat all the &quot;goodies&quot; while you go without. I also agree with a previous respondent regarding the fact that Marilu not only has access to gourmet chefs, but probably has someone who shops for her as well. L.A. is full of health food shops and gourmet grocery stores."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"All I can say is I gave up dairy, processed sugar, began food combining (not perfectly either!) and cut way back on meat consumption, and in as little as three months lost 35 pounds.

More importantly, I am 43 and my mother died when she was 52 of liver cancer, and my father has a rare blood disorder that caused three strokes.

It is a puff piece."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"When I received my book I began by reading the chapter on food combining.

It covers the reasons why certain foods are really bad for health and digestion very well. It is also very good at suggesting what combinations of foods go well together. What Ms. Henner does best, however is to ask the reader a lot of questions that raise issues about the eating, exercising and enjoyment components of life, what we are doing and what we are not doing that act as a benchmark for where we should start and how far we have to go. The ten steps, beginning on page 4, are reminders of what is included in the TOTAL HEALTH MAKEOVER that you should read daily. Best of all, Ms. Henner's suggestions make common sense. To get even more benefit, I also suggest you read EAT RIGHT 4 YOUR TYPE, which refines Ms. Henner's food tips further for what blood and body type you have. Finally, before you start either book, read THE 2,000 PERCENT SOLUTION, by Carol Coles, Donald Mitchell and Robert Metz, to understand where and why you have been &quot;stalled&quot; in changing your diet and lifestyle and how to overcome those &quot;stalls&quot;.

It did not have caffeine, dairy, alcohol, chemicals and excess sugar. I am 27, very busy, yet have no trouble living this. I jumped into it head on. Gave up caffeine, sugar, and dairy cold turkey. It was not as big a deal as I expected it to be, and my energy level has skyrockted. Friends and co-workers are asking about the &quot;spring in my step&quot;.

When I read the &quot;what to stock your pantry with&quot; I just laughed. Wheat-free bread, Free-range chicken, non-dairy pudding, rice, cheese, lentel rice loaf, the ridiculous list goes on and on. Even if I could find these items, which I can't, I am not going to pay 3 times the money for it to taste like the chapter on poop.

According to Amazon rules I can only give one review per item so I had to edit my old review. I originally gave this book 4 stars bit now I give it 1!!!! Heres my story. First of all, let me just say that I was pretty ok to begin with. The only reason I read this book was to see if it could help with my energy level, and it did- somewhat. I also lost a few pounds, but that was definately due to giving up dairy.That was the only good thing to come out of this book. I dont want to blame what happened to me comeplety on Marilu, but lets just say that I never had any health problems before this book. It was only after I began following this program that I began to feel ill.One of the 10 things Marilu wants you to do is to stop drinking when you eat. No liquids are allowed when you eat. Ideally, you should wait 1 hour after eating to drink any water. I have to say that, originally, this made me become more regular. But now, I have G.E.R.D. (look it up if you dont know what it is.) Its like Acid reflux without the burn. A few times a week I have this sensation of throwing up. I feel like I have something stuck in my throat that I cant get rid of. I came to find out that its a back up of acid from my stomach. As I said before, I cannot blame this on Marilu. But I guarentee you that I never had this problem before I read this book!!I didnt try all of her steps. I wanted to incorporate them one-by-one, but now, I give up. I will continue to go dairy free though. I have even begun considering going vegan.I'm in the first stages of GERD so I dont know what cures or what relief there is, but I urge everyone considering to buy this book to monitor their health throughout each step.Good luck!!!"},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"Yes, common sense says that you should avoid chemicals and sugar and avoid non free range, non hormone free meat and dairy, kick the Starbusks/Crackhouse habit, and give up milk if you are lactose intolerant, etc. However giving up the animal fats that make you feel full-makes you caffeine and sugar dependent, and if this combo is kept up, can likely lead to adrenal exhaustion and even diabetes.I was a true believer of Henner for a long long time. Who wouldn't want her transformations? Maybe I don't have Henner's carb thriving Mediterrenean genes, but it nearly destroyed my health and is absolutely miserable to follow.I lived on smoothies for breakfast as she recommends, and developed acid reflux, IBS [not cured by bananas as she promises-which are also really fattening.] and a Starbusks habit, consequently. Her bean dumplings and salad are not only unfilling (which makes it impossible not to binge on junk later) but also gave me ibs.Eggs are the perfect food. Without the miracle of eggs I have panic attacks so bad I can't drive, not to mention chronic brain fog. The soy Henner lives on is a far more dangerous, unwhole, and fake food than the meat she is so phobic about. As a woman, all the soy estrogen gave me a twice monthly period! (Which stopped once I listened to reason and removed all soy from my diet.) If meat is bad, it's only bad in the sense that modern cattle and poultry are fed on cheap soy.I also noticed my energy and health returning and my waist shrinking by spending a little very worthwhile money on high quality grass fed steak. A high quality steak is better than a vitamin for me. Eating meat every day also truly fixed my digestion the way an anti-nutrient like fiber never does. (The villi in your intestines need animal protein every day to replenish themselves.)Vegetarians love animals-I know I was one. (Yes I know Henner is not a total veg-but her philosophy is in line with extreme veganism.) However vegs are more prone to wishful thinking than science. Very few societies are vegetarian. The few that don't die out from this lifestyle are incredibly unhealthy, and it is wrong to inflict this flawed diet on developing children.Humans evolved on hunter gatherer diets, and the diseases of civilization have only appeared when we strayed from them. Study the Eskimos for example. Humans have also evolved to absorb many minerals, nutrients, and vitamins enterically (through the intestines) which means gorging on an anti-nutrient like fiber to push things through faster, as she recomends, makes no sense. Why would our natural digestive process need to be tinkered with?I don't know what Henner looks like up close in person, but the vegs I've met in real life are never terribly healthy up close. The vegetarians are often mobidly obese from way too many carbs, and related candidiasis, and the vegans look like they are dying of AIDS. Look at the scary grey hair shedding \\"vegan chef\\" in \\"Super Size Me.\\" Also because b12 can only be found in animal products, strict veganism can cause low intelligence and mental instability. Our brains are 60% fat. Our bains need fat to function.This diet maybe a miracle for Henner, and she's right about sugar and chemicals; I just don't think this diet works for most other people."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"For many, many years, I religiously followed the low fat, high carb, soy-guzzling semi-vegetarianism espoused by the likes of Marilu Henner and Susan Powter. And with each year I got closer to morbid obesity compunded with severe hypoglycemia, stimulant addiction, IBS [related to the candida that comes about by replacing animal fat and protein with the grains as Henner recommends.] brain fog and depression. (Before I started cutting out fat and meat and adding soy I was at my ideal weight!) This approach does NOT work and is almost entirely responsible for the present obesity epidemic along with all the other new and strange [think ADD, especially prevalent among children who were soy formula fed infants] health crisis nearly universally destroying our national well being! While sure, I'd love to look like Henner or Powter, and age like them as well-I am absolutely baffled as to how that diet works for them, when science and real life examples more and more slap it right in the face.I'd like to save others the fraction of a life you experience when your health is destroyed. BTW, I have restored my health, weight, mood, digestion, complexion and so much more by doing almost the exact opposite of what is recommended here. And, I've tried to give protestors the benefit of the doubt, but I just can't believe my physiology is so radically different from others and this only works for me.

You may not agree with everything she says, but if you are willing to try some of the steps, you will feel and look better than you ever have in your life. The weight loss follows the healthy living. The book itself could be written a little better, but she seems to have done her homework. Don't try to do all the steps at once, this is about making over your life, which of course does not happen overnight. This is a refreshing break from the high protein, low carb fad."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"When I came here to read the reviews, I noticed that one person said that milk is not an allergy, but rather an intolerance. As someone who IS allergic to milk without an intolerance to lactose, I can tell you that her claims are not unfounded. I appreciate the book from it's outlook on the milk perspective because ever since I was young, I have carried this ongoing allergy -- until a doctor finally told us, we never knew. I had chronic ear aches, an ongoing runny nose, and dark circles under my eyes. And now as an adult, my face breaks out in zits if I consume large quantities. I repeat... I AM NOT LACTOSE INTOLERANT, BUT AM ALLERGIC, so when you read all of these reviews remember that not everyone knows what they are talking about. If they did, they would be writing a book, and obviousely they aren't... only bad reviews.Everyone should make their own decision about any book, and since technology is changing at such a fast rate, so does much of the information we learn about nutricion. Make your own judgments.From my personal perspective, there are many great claims in the book. I think her ideas about food balancing are great, and I love the milk speech. A few of the ideas are questionable, such as not having protien with a starch, but I have cut most starches out of my diet due to the &quot;South Beach Diet.&quot; I only consume whole grain breads and pastas (minimally), etc.I do agree with the statement in one of the reviews about the claims on soy. There have been research claims that state that it can be hazardous. And again, this is another highly allergetic food. In fact, I am allergic to soy milk as well! If you decide to incorporate soy into your diet, make sure to do some research before delving head first.Do not buy this book as a diet to lose weight... that's not what any diet should be intended for. You have to look at it as a life-style change, and I think Marilu does a good job of portraying that. She made a believer out of me and changed my perspective on true health."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"I purchased this paperback edition for fifty cents at a yard sale. I glanced through it, and put it away. I felt honestly that i could not give up dairy, sugar, and caffeine...but eight months later, I had gained another ten pounds, so I decided to try the program. After 10 days I could feel a difference. By getting dairy out of my diet I had cleared my stuffy nose and congested lungs. I had no idea that there was a connection there. Other chronic problems vanished--stomach aches, constipation and heartburn-- all completely gone. I had thought they were all due to aging, not my eating habits.I am much more limber and energetic when doing yoga or walking--I can really feel the difference.The one disappointment is after 10 days I could only report a 2 pound weight loss. But I could fit easily into jeans that I could not zip at all before I started. The 2 pound weight losssort of bothered me, and although I do continue to lose, it is very slow... a pound per week it seems.The health benefits are worth doing the program for.The lack of decent recipes makes me work harder,The book is full of info,but Marilu's style is sometimes silly or overly dramatic. Like if your face looks like **** this you may have serious kidney problems...etc... and she cracks jokes that are childish all of the time. It's like the book got no editing. But if you ignore the bad writing style, and just use the program you will be getting healthier and you will change the way you eat, and you will enjoy food more."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"This book is not for the dietary weak of heart -- Marilu asks you to forgo red meat, dairy, caffeine .. all the goodies. However, if you're sick and tired of being sick and tired, you just may be ready to hear her message.And while she's not a health professional, she is a living testament to her way of life. Have you seen her lately? She looks AMAZING -- check out her &quot;Taxi&quot; reruns. She is obviously far more vital and beautiful than she was more than 20 years ago. How many of the rest of us can say that?"},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"I read &quot;Fit For Life&quot; by the Diamonds several years ago and tried food combining for a couple months. I never felt better in my life. I don't know why I didn't stick with it after that, but this book is different - it's not as preachy and it lets you have a social life. It's a more laid back approach to food combining, and eliminating toxins from your body than &quot;Fit For Life&quot; was. Rather than scaring you into making these major lifestyle changes, Marilu eases you in. You're not going to die if you can't quit your daily latte, but you can try and cut out beef first, then sugar, then dairy - slowly. There's no pressure. You feel like you're getting the advice of a trusted older, wiser girlfriend. I've read enough about food combining, dairy and meat to know that she speaks the truth. If you can't bring yourself to believe that &quot;Milk does a body good&quot; is *only* advertising, not gospel, then just quit dairy for one week - you won't believe how much better you feel. Same goes for meat, caffeine and sugar. Great book! I refer to it often."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"My brother gave me Marilu's book as a gift in August of 98. I thought it sounded a little crazy, but I read it anyway and urged my husband to do so also. We both decided we had nothing to lose but pounds so we tried her plan for a month. We cut out dairy and processed white sugar and followed Marilu's food combining tips. In addition, we continued with our regular exercise program. My husband lost 8 lbs and I lost 6. We felt better than we ever had in our lives with more energy and no bloated, uncomfortable feelings after meals. Needless to say we have continued with the food combining program, and to date, my husband has lost 22 lbs, gone down 3 inches in his waist, and I have maintained my optimum weight of 112 lbs. I highly recommend the book because it is not only a book about food, it deals with attitude about life and emphasizes the need for you to control your own life. This book is an easy read. Marilu is upbeat and motivational, a real person with real everyday concerns. An excellent addition to your living-well library, or a great starter book."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"I am converted and I feel better than I have in years.

I really like the way everything is easy to understand. She tells you WHY you should do this or that, not jut to DO it.I don't agree with only one other reviewer who states that this is the \\"opposite\\" of what you should do. That to me is absurd! The opposite being fill your body with fat, sugar and all sorts of chemicals... That simply CANNOT be a good thing. I know that behavior has personally gotten me no where but unhealthy. No, I think that Marilu is right on here.

After all, Marilu is an actress, not a nutritionist or medical doctor. Her complaints against dairy products sound like a boring repeat of Susan Powter's opinion in &quot;Food.&quot; Very few people will want to follow her extreme program, even if they could understand it. I don't know why so many people rated the book highly and then said they didn't understand the program. To me this is just another &quot;extreme&quot; diet that may or may not be healthy in the long run."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"After reading Marilu's book, I decided to give up dairy products for good.

If I could do that, I wouldn't have a weight problem. She spends way to much time trying to persuade you to give up the bad stuff without really telling you what you're supposed to do instead. There are no sample eating plans, and the recipes are from her favorite vegetarian restaurant! I'm supposed to make this stuff at home? The food even looks bad in the pictures, by the way. I'd sure like to eat like Marilu does, but after reading her book, I'm still not sure how to get there."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"All the steps listed in her book are based on common sense, and your ability to cut some foods completely out of your diet. I also noticed that in the limited number of recipies in the back that everything was organic. I live in Colorado where food is expensive to begin with, and orgnic is VERY expensive. I want a plan that I can follow, where I'm not already at a disatvantage."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"Having read a myriad of health books over the past 10 years I can't say that Marilu's book offers anything really new or different (except perhaps the paragraph on &quot;floating poops&quot;...yeccch!) This information can be found in numerous books about food combining (Fit for Life, Suzanne somers recent one all the Natural Hygiene ones, etc.) and macrobiotics. Marilu's is really a hodge podge of alternative health ideas that have obviously worked well for her. By the way, does anyone else out there think she looked just fine at some of her higher weights? Geez, a bit obsessive about her weight she is! Anyway, I give her high marks for doing her research, her very readable style, and her infectious enthusiasm. If people followed her advice we'd have a much healthier population. (I didn't offer 5 stars because I believe that including some non-restaurant recipes and perhaps menu plans would have made it really useful.) I don't think, however, that I would invite her to dinner at my house if she finds it necessary to jump on a soapbox at the dinner table as she says she does!!"},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"This is the first book that actually really got me going on my way to being healthier.

Her website marilu.com is the biggest help and she offers wonderful online classes that support all of her program. She is full of energy and common sense advice. She has a wonderful on-line community where there is lots of support and Marilu is very involved. Marilu and her Total Health Makeover have changed my life. Thank you!!!!"},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"Though I found this book interesting from a biographical point of view, I found it of little use. Her techniques for loosing weight are, from a practical standpoint, very difficult for an average, busy, working woman. For example, she stresses food combining, which means not mixing carbs and proteins. That's fine if you never eat out and have time to prepare all of your own meals, but for many people, this is not an option.It's important to keep in mind that Ms Henner is an actress. Unfortunately for her, staying fit is a major part of her job. Imagine spending as much time working out and researching diets as you spend at your job. That is her only qualification for writing this book.Containing about 75% fluffy anecdotes and 25% mediocre advice, it seemed to be more of an attempt to boost a stagnant acting career than a serious book about health.If you're interested in this book because you like Ms. Henner, you may not be disappointed. If you're looking for a book that will really help you get healthy, skip this one."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"I loved this book.

After doing away with dairy and using more soy products and with the food combining (and of course exercising!), I have more energy than I have had in years and as an extra bonus have lost weight.

I wanted to just read the chapter on the 10 steps and well, I'm still reading. I will still be giving this to my mom but may have to get her another copy. I gave up dairy(mostly) a little over a yr ago. Sinus problems- GONE. Stomach problems- much improved. I agree 100% with Marilu's system. It has inspired me to try giving up sugar. I am a chocolate addict so wish me the best. This book will be my new gift that keeps on giving for me and others. Thanks Marilu! I have to share that I wanted to read this becuase every time I have seen Marilu on tv or in movies, I love her vitality and the way she looks. Especially a show she did on childbirth. She looked great the night she went into labor. Her husband and her seem to have a great love for each other and their family.

She has infused the book not only with personal stories of her weight battles but also with humor and a real sense of what busy people can fit into their lives. She has beginning, intermediate and advanced steps so you have control over what and how much you want to change.

The items that are presented about current popular food items are reason enough to buy the book. Even if you aren't looking to feel better. I haven't tried the Ms. Henners system yet, but plan on it soon. Her ideas of you-can-eat-what-you-want (no junk foods) and still be healthy make sense."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"I read lots of health and nutrition books and this one is excellent, and it's not written by an &quot;expert&quot;. Marilu has condensed a lot of health information in one book. She has answers to my questions that I have piece-mealed from other sources. I have eliminated dairy, my first step, and I believe it has showed in my skin tone. I'm planning on following some of the other steps as well. I am very critical and objective when I read any health information, and I do take issue with some of Marilu's points, however I can research them further on my own by &quot;experts&quot;. All in all, this book was excellent, motivating and easy to read."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"I was quite inspired by Marilu's book. Although her way of eating is not for everyone, the results are undeniably GREAT - just look at her! She is beautiful, thin, has tons of energy and is positive, upbeat and successful. She gives vital imformation regarding diet and lifestyle that many people will probably find too extreme. But then again, I'll bet they don't feel as great or look as good as she does! So take a chance and read the book. Maybe something will sink in about your unhealthy diet and maybe you will change for the better. I did. Since reading her book I have given up most dairy, am trying to food-combine and have cut way back on caffiene. The funny thing is that people are telling me that I look really good. More importantly, I feel really good and have more energy. Try it!"},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"Marilou! I think you wrote this book with me in mind. I LOVE it.

I knew if I waited long enough, someone would figure out how to lose weight and not feel dizzy, deprived, tired or hungry all the time. Thank you so much for all your hard work. I am proof that it paid off. Just seeing your cover made me interested, but after seeing you on David Letterman, I got really excited and ran to the bookstore the next morning. Keep up the great work...I know I will!!!"},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"I had seen the hardcover version of the book for months but hesitated to buy it due to the cost and because I have recently purchased the Zone books, but low and behold there it was in paperback last week! Eureka, I bought it. I read it in about 2.5 hours and must say I skipped her tirades on smoking and various other sections that didn't apply to me. We have heard alot of this before, but Marilu has repackaged it and reframed from her point of view and she's done quite a good job of getting her point across, dammit! However, it first struck me that alot of this ranting and raving is subjective, and I don't know how many times this appears in the book &quot;I read somewhere...&quot;. Not exactly scientific evidence. I must admit, that started to turn me off. When you are talking about the effect food has on the body, you're into an area that really needs some data to back it up and that really isn't there in this book.By strictly looking at her image and the changes she has made to her own body and mind over the past twenty years, (photographs of herself) that is evidence that she IS doing something right - but she is in an industry where youth, energy, vitality and physical beauty is a prerequisite for survival, so she has to live it. Unfortunately, I think for most of us, if we can make a few changes she suggests here and are aware of some of the food industry realities, that's worth the price of the book. ie. I never knew that Hydrolyzed Plant Protein is really MSG in disguise! And her &quot;dissertations&quot; on slaughterhouses and the dairy industry are really sensational and designed to make you look differently at what is placed in front of you at the dinner table - the sad and brutal truth, so she says (but again, she doesn't list the source of this information and I don't think she has been over to a slaughterhouse lately somehow). I tend to BELIEVE myself that dairy is probably not a health food, but even I must admit that soy cheese just doesn't TASTE as good as dairy cheese. Darn.I found her opinion that man was never meant to eat meat in sharp contrast to some of the other reading I have done lately (Neolithic Diet and the Zone, for instance) to those who say the opposite. I may glean a few jems from this book, but as a wholesale program for my own life? Not likely."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"i have followed marilou for years . i was very impressed with her results and how beautiful her skin looked . her body took on a whole new shape and is wonderful . over the years you see the changes people make and you wonder if it was a life choice for overall health and fitness . i was so pleased to see that marilou followed it through . now i am interested to see how she accomplished this goal and see if it is one that i might want to try ."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"An excellent book!

Maggie"},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"I've read this book, and after giving up meat and dairy (I switched to soy substitutes) and caffeine, and food-combining for only two weeks, I've dropped three pounds--but I look like I lost a lot more! My body and (especially) my face are noticeably thinner, and my complexion is nearly translucent! All in all, Marilu gives good advice, nutritionally and spiritually. In fact, all of it is geared toward protecting your mind and body from stress--whether it be through food-combining and giving up caffeine and dairy, exercising, or re-adjusting your attitude. And the great part is, you can follow Marilu's plan in increments. You can incorporate all or any of her steps, and even then, there are increments of &quot;zealousness&quot; for each one. You can positively affect your life by following ONE of her suggestions just a LITTLE. I'd give this book five stars if it weren't for some contradictions between her rules for food combining and the foods listed in the Josie's restaurant recipes section and the restaurant-selection suggestions section. For instance, she gives a recipe for turkey tortillas (protein + starch) and suggests eating cold sesame noodles (another protein + starch) at a Chinese restaurant. There are many other protein + starch combinations listed. In addition, she'll give advice such as consuming a citric fruit with nuts to counteract their fat content, but then doesn't say how soon you should wait till your next meal--i.e., is this nut-fruit combo treated like a fruit meal or a protein meal? I know that Marilu has a new book out--which I haven't read yet--so hopefully some of the aforementioned food-combining kinks have been ironed out. But if not, and if you're reading this, Marilu, this information needs to be more consistent, exact, and precise."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"I have always looked for ways to eat right Mary Lou has tapped The nutrition out look!

I've also dropped a couple of inches but I think that's from exercising. Anyway, I do find that I have less mood swings on this plan, but I have a major problem with lunch. Lunch is my biggest problem because I want quick food I can eat at work and it's so easy to bring in a turkey sandwich or 3 minute soup. I think Marilu should include ideas for planning a quick lunch for at work that meets her guidelines and something that wouldn't require cooking. The combining part is hard for me also because of relatives sometimes. They don't get it. I agree with what others have said about having recipes included in the book. I believe in the book but it is very difficult to follow consistently for a long time. My mind has been opened to the fact that I need to learn more about alternative foods and cooking though...but I do need to do it affordably.

The food combining has helped eliminate stomach pain I used to regularly suffer from. These are just two of many benefits! I've lost 8 lbs...I could go on and on.

Maybe we will see and follow-up book with meal plans and recipes next? All the best, Marilu..."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"The first time I read this book and was introduced to the concept of food combining, it sounded unrealistic and impossible to follow. I tried it for about 2 days and gave up. About a year later, when diagnosed with an internal Candida imbalance that was causing lots of chronic health problems, my doctor suggested I follow a special diet that included food combining. So I got out Marilu's book and read through it again. This time I stuck with it and found that much of her nutritional suggestions mirrored that of anti-Candida plans; i.e., no dairy, food combining, no sugar or artificial sweeteners, etc. I was a fairly healthy eater to begin with but of course a major change in diet takes determination and time to adjust. Let me assure anyone out there that this book is full of good information to start you on a path to total wellness, inside and out. While some of the presentation is a tiny bit corny, it's also approachable and it's interesting to see the road she, herself, was on in terms of bad health and where she is now.Since making the decision to stick permanently with food combining (which can be complicated but she presents in a very easy to follow, organzied way) and eliminating sugar (about as hard for some people to do as quitting smoking or drinking) I have never felt better. My Candida is under control, my chronic ailments (asthma, allergies, rashes, joint pain) have all but disappeared, I have tons of energy all the time, I sleep better, I look better (better skin, hair, body) I feel consistently in a good mood and a nice side benefit was dropping from a size 12 to a 6.After nearly a decade of struggling with my weight and being &quot;sickly&quot; I am now strong and truly healthy and found that only when I focused on my health rather than my size did I lose weight. I am now going back to college to obtain a degree in Kinesiology specializing in Athletic Training, a lifelong dream I never would have thought I could pursue in my prior condition. You need to be inspirational to train others and certainly you have to walk the talk.With all the other fads being tauted out there, like the Atkins diet which is completely nutritionally unsound and puts people at a risk for renal failure and serious dehydration, I can tell you that the reason plans like Marilu's aren't as popular is ause they are more difficult initially to get accustomed to and don't allow for taboo foods as much as the hi-pro/hi-fat phenomenon. This may be a tougher challenge at first, but the long term health benefits are limitless.I have read and reread everything from the Zone, Atkins, macrobiotics, sugar-busters and the blood type recommendations (which are actually very similar and is also a great book to keep as a nutritional bible) and it's Marilu's book I find myself whipping out for reference or review.If you buy this book and stick with it for a month (it takes at least that long to remove prior waste product from your blood stream, tissues and organs) you WILL feel a sense of total health and well being that will amaze and surpise you. It's a great investment in yourself and the better your body functions, the better the quality of your life."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"I've been doing the program for over six months, and I agree that the most compelling evidence is Marilu's own transformation. She explores a new path to health; this isn't a fad, it's a permanent approach to the way we eat and how we live.Even doing just one step or two of her program will recharge your energy and take off the pounds. I swore I could never give up red meat, but it's gone from my life. I never in a million years thought I could say no to dairy -- also gone. I'm fighting right now to get off sugar, and it's shocking how poisoned the foods are at the supermarket with the stuff. I've lost 23 pounds so far, and my skin looks fabulous. My allergies are not as severe and I rarely get sick. (I used to be chronically ill with colds and bronchial problems) Through Marilu's book, I'm now reading a lot of material by Michio Kushi. Again, it's a life changing process, and you have to be committed to make it work. And given the poor health that Americans are in today with obesity, respitory and circulatory problems, it's about time somebody spoke up and kept speaking up until the message was heard.Thank you Marilu!"},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"I purchased this book approx. 3 1/2 weeks ago and gradually started applying the changes in my eating habits along with the overall knowledge that Marilu provides here.

Someone had commented on the extreme cost - Granted rice and soy milk may be more expensive. However, I no longer purchase all the junk foods and garbage I used to eat which has resulted in a drop in my grocery expenses. If you truly READ this and FOLLOW THROUGH, you will see &amp; feel the results. Buy it and USE IT. &quot;USE IT&quot; being the operative word.

Head straight for the second book and when you're through the 30 days, get the Healthy Life Kitchen for more recipes."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"Excellent book with ideas on eating right/well, exercising, gusto/energy and alternative medicine. Marilu also includes information on caffeine, sugar, dairy, food combining, vitamins, chemicals, beauty, sleep, poop, face reading and SO MUCH MORE!!! Everyone will find at least one thing to help them feel healthier in this book. Marilu is informative, knowledgeable, honest and funny. You will be entertained as you learn how to be healthier. Marilu is a great motivator!"},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"I loved this book! I could relate to everything she said. I Think the program is a hard one to follow, but if your committed it will help you tremendously. I have only 2 of her 10 steps left to go and lost 40lbs in the meantime. Eliminating processed sugar is a hard one but eventually I will do it. If your serious about changing you lifesyle and relationship with food this is a book for you! I read it in one weekend. I just couldn't put it down and found it very entertaining. When I feel my will slowing I refer back to this book to pick my motivation back up and keep me on the right track. A+"},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"My husband snickered when he caught me reading this book. He's the type who doesn't believe &quot;celebrities&quot; should be offering health advice. I showed him the back cover and said I wanted to know how Marilu got to look so good, so I could at least have a fighting chance.I haven't followed everything to the letter in this book, but I did give up dairy and caffeine and started a steady exercise program, and used some principles from Weight Watchers. I dropped 35 pounds!I suppose the key is reading this book and manipulating the suggestions so it suits your needs. Not everyone has the same body, so not everyone should use an identical program. What worked for Marilu might not have worked for me. Improvise."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"If you can change your eating habits to follow Marilu Henner's health makeover, well good for you. You are a better person than me. In this book she asks people to give up dairy, most meat, caffeine, sugar and to combine foods every time you eat. So, if you eat melon, never eat anything with it. But if you eat chicken, then you had better have a grapefruit too. I found the overall makeover really demanding. I could never follow it to the letter.BUT, Marilu does have some good points on why foods like dairy, sugar and meat are really pretty bad for you. I liked her ideas, and have modified my diet because of some of her ideas. I feel better and more energetic, as she promised. And she also asks you to address your health makeover one step at a time. I think that is realistic.This easy read is good information to have if you are looking for a way to eat healthy. But don't read it and follow it to the letter. It is way too demanding, and I think some of her ideas are medically uninformed. So, balance this book with another book on eating well."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"I bought this book approximately a year and a half ago, out of curiosity after seeing an inter- view with Marilu on a talk-show. After having gained 60 lbs with the pregnancy of my first child, and not really being a big fan of excersize, I thought her approach to food combining was rather neat! In about 6-9 months, with no excessive exercise, I was still able to lose 30 lbs with the help of this book. I really didn't expect it to work so well! Now my mother-in-law and sister-in-law are also trying this approach. East to read and follow, a great book overall. I plan on continuing her diet after the birth of my second child in a few months."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"This book spoke to me right away--I couldn't put it down for three days. Marilu seemed to talk about everything I'd been questioning in my own diet...and much more! I have been using it as a guide for a month now, taking some of her tips on body care, exercise, etc as well, and I feel much better. After many failed fad diets, just reading this one book made me much more conscious about eating and grocery shopping. And unlike those diets, which count on short-term commitment, this book explains nutritional needs and eating habits in a way that makes you WANT to permanently adjust your lifestyle. A must read, even if you don't want to make a change and just want some info!"},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"It seems to me that alot of people are reading this book and thinking of it as a diet. Its absolutely not a diet. Think about all the pestisides and preservatives and fake stuff our food is made up of, no wonder there is so much disease and illness and obesity. Not only is it ruining our health its ruinning our land. How hard is it to quit shopping at the local grocery store and shop at the health food store instead? Or to shop in the health food section of your grocery store? How can you put a price on you health? I have a very strong stomach but once i read this book certain parts almost made me puke. I can't even walk into my local grocery store and purchase anything because i think of it as poison. After reading Marilu's book i'm only eating organic from now on. Its really not that hard people. If you can't give up meat or milk then buy it organically. Yes it may cost more but can you look at yourself in the mirror and honestly tell yourself your health isn't worth the extra 30,50, or 90 bucks a month? After reading Marilu's book i went straight out and bought tofu, vitasoy, soy cheese and all kinds of new foods. I then went home and tried them out and you know its an acquired taste but it wasn't discusting by any counts. And for the first time when I sat down to eat my dinner that was all organic I really felt I was doing something for me. It really made me feel like i was doing something right. Thank you so much Marilu. If more and more people keep eating like this, organically then the price of everything will drop and also think of all those animals whos lifes your saving by giving up meat. I used to think well if i don't eat it someone else will but I probably consumed a whole cow and quite a few chickens in my life how about you. If the demand is low less will die. But don't do it just for the animals do it for your health."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"I HAVE BEEN ON THIS PROGRAM FOR OVER A YEAR AND I AM THRILLED WITH THE RESULTS. I HAVE ELIMINATED DAIRY AND RED MEAT AND LOVE ALL THE RECIPES, AND OF COURSE HAVE ADDED ALOT OF MY OWN. YOU REALLY CAN EAT LOTS AND STILL MAINTAIN, ALONG WITH THE EXERCISE, ETC. I LOVE IT!"},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"I was interested in the first half of the book, but lost interest after that. I also got the impression that Marilu is on an ego trip. If combining foods is so important why was there not a more detailed chapter on this technique? I also felt that some of her statements were not backed by scientific proof. This diet doesn't seem realistic to me."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"I have practised food combining on and off for 12 years and have found it to be the &quot;best&quot; way for my health, my weight and my energy level. My first experience with food combining was through the book Fit for Life. I have battled with my weight fluctuating, with digestive problems and insomnia. Food combining irradicates all of those symptoms for me. Unfortunately, it can feel so strict at first but once you get into the habit of fruit till noon, and learn how to prepare quick lunches and interesting vegetarian meals, it is the ABSOLUTE best way for your body. Marilu explains the principle of food combining clearly and presents it in a less radical fashion than other authors have. Her explanation of Balance in chapter 2 is very revealing and informative. I love &quot;The Ten Steps - One At A Time&quot;. I am able to change everything almost immediately except for Sugar! But knowing that this is a life process and not just a diet supports me even when I eat that piece of carrot cake. Her section on dairy, sugar, chemicals and meat are very well presented. I have read hundreds of books on health for my own interest and I found that she presented her book in a very engaging and informative manner. My only criticism would be that she elaborate on the food combining section adding menu suggestions for lunches and dinners. It would be beneficial and important for those people who are new to this awareness. Perhaps that is what we will see in her book that is due to come out this spring! Thank you Marilu for bringing it all back to me!"},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"I've spent the last 20 years of my life waking up and deciding to do a 180 degree change with my diet and exercise habits only to find that when I screw up in one area, I drop the whole ball and stop ALL my new-found habits. Marilu's program separates them and introduces them in such a gradual way that when I eat a piece of cake, I am able to not only maintain the other dietary and exercise changes but also am able to eventually regain my resolve and go back to discontinuing the sugar from my diet again. I don't feel like a failure if I backtrack a little here and there as I feel I have numerous other things I'm doing right that are getting great results."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"This is an awesome book; I highly reccommend it. Unfortunately, if you don't live in California, cheap, fresh, organic produce will be expensive and pretty hard to find. Otherwise, her suggestions on food combining and living dairy-free are wonderful (although if you read them, you may never want to drink cow's milk again). Trash The Zone and try this book. Her writing is refreshing and engaging, and having tried a million books about the same thing, Marilu's is the only one I would reccommend to someone seriously trying to change their eating habits."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"Marilu definitly has some good ideas of ways to detox and feel better. Most of the ideas are common sense. After reading her section on dairy, you will probably never be able to stomach milk again! Unless you have time to freshly prepare all of your food from scratch, it is difficult to follow. It is near impossible to follow this diet. Marilu does have a nice writing style, and the section on food combining is great. This book has great ideas, but it is probably more realistic to take what you can use from it rather than follow it exactly."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"Very well-written and thorough approach to healthy lifestyle. I bought the book 3 days ago, have finished it and already loaned it to a friend. Her chapter on dairy, while stomach-turning, was thought provoking. I must say that the overall plan is difficult for the average person who doesn't have the financial diet Henner has (the brands of products she mentioned are available in stores 50 miles away from me AND cost way more than my food budget will allow.) A sideline that I found most inspiring was Henner's complete honesty about her weight fluctuation. Most actresses would rather die than have pictures of themselves at the weights Henner had throughout her life. Added a very refreshing dose of honest and proof that she knows what she's talking about. I appreciated the overal honesty, but wish that it could be more practically applied to people NOT pulling down grande salary a year. That being said, the principles are the signficant factor, and shouldn't be over! ! shadowed by Henner's tendancy to brand-name drop. I know I'm convinced and have already decided to give up red meat AND caffeine. If I can look 1/10th as good as her, it will be time and money well-spent. The best $24 investment you can make in your health!"},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"Marilu is right on target. Her book is everything she said and more. I've been on her program for two months and have lost 20 pounds and firmed up significantly. I don't need to lose anymore weight but will continue this program for the rest of my life because I feel so damn GREAT! My skin is absolutely gorgeous and everyone asks me about my new lifestyle. Thank you Marilu...you're the greatest!!"},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"If you've ever read Harvey and Marilyn Diamond's bestseller 'Fit for Life' -- then you've already been over this ground. Fit for Life is based on a dietary belief system known as \\"natural hygiene.\\" Henry Ford was the most famous hygienist -- and there is even a Natural Hygiene Society. Their basic beliefs are the same as Henner's: Ideally, you're a vegetarian, caffeine and alcohol are out, dairy is out, tobacco is definitely out, and food combining -- the proper mixing of proteins and starches -- is the way you eat. Spaghetti with meat sauce? No. A roast beef sandwich? No. You can have one \\"concentrated food\\" per meal. Anything that is not a fruit or vegatable is a concentrated food. Additionally, Potatoes and beans are considered concentrated foods. So, if you want to have chicken and rice.....nope. How about toast for breakfast? Nope...only fruit for breakfast. And, you can't combine fruit with other foods. I actually did the Fit for Life/natural hygiene thing for several years, and it works extremely well. I'm not sure it's really sustainable....kind of like Atkins or any other drastic diet. Anyway, I guess I was expecting to read something new -- not just another book on natural hygiene. However, I do have to say that I think Marilu is doing a great service for people looking for a healthier lifestyle."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"Marilu's book has helped me immensely! Although I am healthy and at just the right weight I often felt tired and sluggish, had terrible mood swings, and was suffering facial breakouts. I knew I should try to imrove my eating habits beyond eating a low-fat diet, but wasn't really sure where to begin. One day while I was feeling particularly lousy, I picked up Marilu's book. Whenever I saw her on television I always noted how great she looks; not just in shape but really luminescent! She kept me reading into the night, and the next day I jumped right away into 4 of her 10 steps: eliminating meat, sugar, dairy and increasing my workouts to 7 days a week. That was a month ago, I haven't gone back to my old habits and I feel great! Although I wasn't overweight my clothes are fitting me better and the layer of fat over my thighs and stomach is diminishing. My skin has cleared up and my energy level is up and my mood has improved so much! I found the information on dair! y products and chemicals most informative, and have Marilu to thank for getting my kids on a healthier diet, too (I now give them organic dairy products rather than eliminating them altogether). I have used her grocery list to restock my pantry (luckily my grocery store has a whole section devoted to natural and health foods) and my family doesn't know the difference. The best thing is that it was so easy. I am not trying to eat lowfat or to eat more fruits, grains and veggies, it just happens! For a healthier future, everyone should try at least some of Marilu's ten steps."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"I just started following Marylu's philisophy on eating. I don't think of it as a DIET but a whole new way of life. Sure, when I first read NO MEAT, NO DAIRY, NO SURGAR, I was mortified! I have substituted all dairy with soy, everything is out there, from and ice cream substitute to cheese, even yogurt, and yes butter (soy margarine). After giving up RED meat, I do not even crave it. I only eat free-range chicken. I am totally addicted to fish. Honey and unrefined surgars take the place of the unhealthy surgars. Like she says, you just have to retrain your taste buds. I had a spinach salad the other day with tomatoes, egg whites and mushrooms, I put very little to no dressing on it and squeezed lemmons all over it, I tasted the food, not the junk on the food. I have been following this new way eating for 1 1/2 months now, I have lost 9 pounds, my eyes really are brighter, and I feel so much lighter with tons more energy. Thank your Marylu. Its tough retraining years of bad habits, but it is so worth it. My children are going to know how to eat healthy from the start. I heard about these methods years ago, but just thought they were a hoax, boy was I wrong. I have robbed my body of years of good health, just because of bad training. All I can say is that if you have any doubt, give it a try, I was going to do it for only a month, but now I am a lifetime convert of eating well."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"love the book...this is the second time i have purchased it because i passed the first one on to a relative. it is clear-cut, easy to follow, and easy to carry around."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover introduced me to some new ideas about how my digestive system works, and why calves can digest cows milk but I cannot.

And fruit - what a natural cleansing way to start the day, I got my fruit again!After I read her book I logged onto her Message Boards at Marilu.com and was amazed at the support I found there. And then I discovered her 30-day Total Health Makeover, packed full or recipes and menus for a whole 30 days to show us just how easy it is to eat this way.I LOVE the Total Health Makeover! I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to get healthy!"},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"Marilu Henner's book offers detailed information on how and why one should try a vegetarian/vegan diet. She offers testimonials of how these nutritional changes have affected her life and health. She also gives recipes for tasty dishes that do not include meat or dairy. She also offers suggestions of tastier and good quality products on the market."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"The fact that Marilu lost 40 pounds does not qualify her to write a book on nutrition. Initially, the book looked like it might be helpful to get someone to make nutritional and lifestyle changes. However, after reading the book I was very disappointed to find that many of the statements in this book look like excerpts or headlines taken from newspaper articles. Mostly half truths that are used as scare tactics to the untrained person. Much of her advice contains little, if any scientific data to support it. She inter mingles some facts with misinformation like \\"Milk is the equivalent to human growth hormone IGF-1\\". There are several things wrong with this statement. Human growth hormone and IGF-1 are not one in the same. IGF-1 is insulin like growth factor and is used as an indirect measurement of human growth hormone (HGH) in humans. Direct HGH measurement is a very difficult, hence, the use of IGF-1 which is a very simple blood test. While bovine milk may contain many nutrients, it clearly does not contain HGH. While obtaining a degree in Food Science, I don't recall any of my dairy science professors ever mentioning that bovine milk contains any type of growth hormone.There is much more misinformation in the part of her book regarding red meat. She makes the statement \\"that cattle are shackled and hang upside down alive for three to five minutes before they are actually killed\\". It is clear that Marilu has never toured a meat processing plant nor has first hand knowledge of modern slaughter practices. If she had, she would have learned that the animals are typically shot with a stun gun to render them \\"brain dead\\" prior to any shackling procedure.The chapter about determining your correct weight was laughable. She makes a statement that \\"your weight will be in a range\\". Well, what range? I don't think she understands the concept of BMI at all probably because it involves a mathematical formula. BMI is not the best way to determine optimum weight, particularly for someone who has a high lean body mass (LBM). Marilu makes no mention of the most important factors in determining your optimal weight, LBM and percent body fat.Marilu makes several statements regarding food allergies which are once again inaccurate. Like me, most people do suffer from undiagnosed food allergies. Food allergies can be determined by a simple blood test that looks for an antibody response (IGG) to each food. Constantly, eating foods that you are allergic to creates chronic inflammation and stresses the immune system. Food intolerances such as lactose intolerance are not an allergy at all. Lactose intolerance is caused by a deficiency of lactase, the enzyme required to digest lactose.Marilu's concept of food mixing was quite amusing. As a person who is trying control insulin levels, I would not recommend eating only carbohydrates without the addition of some monounsaturated fat and protein to lower the glycemic response of the meal. Rather than avoid certain foods because your body might be \\"confused about what to digest\\", I would recommend that you use digestive enzymes at each meal. It is well known that as a person ages, your body produces lower levels of digestive enzymes which can lead to digestive problems. Supplementing with natural digestive enzymes will boost the digestive process.After reading over the BEST food list, I would like to point out to Marilu that catsup contains a sugar, colloidal silica, and red coloring. Since tomatoes tend to get moldy, she might also be interested to learn that there is a standard for allowable mold hyphae in catsup as well as other tomato products. Tomatoes are a good source of lycopene, so I do eat tomato products without added sugar.Rather than buy Marilu's book, do yourself a favor and buy \\"A Week in the Zone\\" By Dr. Barry Sears. I have been \\"Zoning\\" for two years and have lost 48 pounds and still going down."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"Yes, this truly is a TOTAL health makeover. It may seem a little extreme, but rightly so as Marilu explains. She goes through the ill effects of much of the food we frequently consume. I've never felt so healthy after giving up dairy products; drinking milk is just wrong, but easy to live without. She gives excellent examples of what to do and the reasoning behind it."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"I really enjoyed her book and it does prefer a meat free life style which I believe is a must.

It kind of combines some elements of macrobiotics and a vegan diet. However, you don't have to go cold turkey. There are three levels to each of the ten steps, and she helps you gradually reach the point where you want to be. It's not all-or-nothing, and she peppers it with humor and personal stories. It is well-written and researched.It really is a great book, and if you follow just a few of the 10 steps you will see a huge difference in your body and health.

It is not a book of facts and boring statistics, but a personal life story that is far more interesting than reading a boring nutritional science book! A person can't go wrong by eliminating chemicals and pesticides from their body. If there were two equally priced products side by side, one grown with pesticides and the other grown organically, which one would go untouched? Who would want to knowingly poison their body?

Often, like the first music we hear is the kind we like best, I like this book in the same way but maybe it's because it's the first book that left a real imprint on me regarding nutrition, diet and exercise. Her rule of thumb on exercise (work up a sweat of 30 minutes every day) stays with me. Her explanations on sweets, carbohydrates, protein likewise, are all spot on. We know from reading Marilu's words that indeed she has struggled big time with the same problems we have and has very sage advice on all of this.This is the book and I haven't read her others but I have read other nutrition books since but her words still stay as the most worthwhile advice. Then again, I don't read that many books like this but I have probably read some dozen on the same subject."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"Thanks to Marilu, I rarely eat ice cream. After 6 months off dairy, I had a little ice cream at a party and had a stomach ache for hours! I've managed to put yogurt back into my diet and some cheese. I think the key is to try a one or a few changes at a time. Whether it's fruit only during the mornings (which works well for me according to the scale), or food combining for better digestion, eating healthy is something you learn as you go.I am partial to books about mediterranean diet, how to live to 100, and they all mirror eating REAL food. It's not about never getting to eat meat, but making vegetables and healthy grains a bigger part of your life. I can hardly look at processed food or candy that isn't organic chocolate. We eat so many different vegetables - it's hard to run out of something new to try!I've had a recent problem with my metabolism in the last year, and I'm excited to get back to the basics. I made my family pancakes with real syrup this morning (we haven't touched the other stuff in 4 years thanks to Marilu). I stopped food combining, but because of my peri-menopausal bloat, I am going back to food combining and mostly fruit in the morning. It's been a long road of learning to change almost everything to organic and olive oil is practically a staple every day (I snuck it into this morning's pancakes)."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"I saw Marilu on an infomercial late one night in Aug. Then I looked up her info on line. I purchased the book and read it. It was enjoyable and easy to understand.

She is down to earth and what she writes makes sense. Its fundamentally informative and all around smart nutrition. The book has information and topics you dont find in many books. Probably because of her casual writing style. Another great aspect of the book...the nitty gritty information. Its filled with useful information. I loved the food combining information, and some of the recipes, which I must say...you could probably tweak them to suit your own tastes. I liked the book alot, only I really didnt care so much for the pictures of herself. It seemed weird to me. Yet...you definitely see how healthy she looks now. She was truly an inspiration for me. I am thankful she wrote it and shared her thoughts on diet, exercise and nutrition with us. Its a gem."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"Thanks to you Marilu I feel as though I'm on my way.

I also look forward to reading the 30 day makeover."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"I bought this book last year and after trying it for a month I could no longer follow Marilu's bizarre regimen of eating. Food combining (proteins and carbs separate) put me on a blood sugar sugar roller coaster and made me feel drained and miserable much of the time. It was a challenge to get any sort of protein at all since almost meat and dairy with the exceptions of egg whites and fish are forbidden. Most protein was derived from soy which has increasingly come under fire as a potential health hazard in and of itself when consumed in large amounts as Marilu encourages. I don't know about anyone else, but I am not willing to spend the rest of my life depending on fish and soy as my only sources of protein. The other problem that I have with this book is that Marilu goes off on this tirade against milk and additives. As for milk, I think her fears are ungrounded and can be circumvented if you are really worried about by drinking organic milk. As for additives, I agree with her the sugar is very, very bad and should be eliminated from the diet as much as possible. Other additives I choose not to fret over. They are in everything and seriously doubt that Yellow No.6 is going to kill anyone. I think a good deal of this book is devoted to hysterics without much evidence to back them up. I would strongly recommend against following this diet, especially to those with blood sugar disorders. I would recommend a good low-carb diet such as Atkins or Protein Power instead."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"I bought this book after seeing Marilu speak about her life transfomation at Pete Wilson's Call To Action Conference for Women in California. In person, Marilu is FULL of Zest, vibrance, energy, stamina and everything she says she is in the book. She looks beautiful- her skin is clear and bright and she's about as big as a minute! This book has been an excellent read. She knows her facts after years of research and applying the principles in her own life. As for the people who asked why would you listen to her...she's just a movie star who probably didn't go to school? She is extremely intelligent, did go to school and in my opinion look at her!!! If someone has what you want, a formula for life, that works wonderful why wouldn't you listen? Her program is not far fetched either! Like anything in life if you want it bad enough there are sacrifices. If you want to be healthy (which is really what the book is all about) and thin there are trade offs. If you always do what you've always done you'll always get what you always got! Try her methods and you'll be surprised at how great the B.E.S.T. you feels!"},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"I loved this book from the very first page!

But if you are truely in it for the long haul on changing your life and habits not only for weight loss, but most importantly for total longevity, this is the book for you.I dove off the cliff about 4 weeks ago, I have implemented all 10 steps in my life in some form or another and my sinus allergies and literally gone away. I have far more energy than when I ever drank coffee. I am gradually dropping weight, too. Those 300 pages are packed with some of the best information I've received all my life and you'll never get the same information from the meat and dairy industries.And just looking at her pictures, before and after, she looks absolutely pristine! It is not a weight-loss book, it's a book that will help you be your absolute best inside and out, the weight-loss is just what would logically follow."},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"Rather than echo what the 21 people ahead of me have already said, I would just like to add that the recipe section is very disappointing. The recipes are not consistent with her food combining instructions and contain ingredients that are not available in all parts of the country! I agree with the reader who encouraged Marilu to develop a cookbook that can help those of us with good intentions avoid getting sucked back into the protein/starch combinations surrounding us! (For those readers who'd like recipes, &quot;Fit for Life&quot; has some great ones that adhere to food combining principles!)"},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"I just love the way I feel now.

Marilu has done the work of reading, researching and trial-and-error, and we benefit from it! She writes in such a way as to not only teach, but entertain. This book is very clear and explains WHY we need to do certain things. I've heard some of the things written about in here before, but never really understood how it would help me. Now I get it! I learned so much and have been on her plan for 7 weeks and lost 20 lbs. I also FEEL so much better! This is something that can be a lifelong change. It's not a &quot;diet&quot;, as diets don't really work. The book is not only about food and eating, but about many other health issues. So much information in one book! Thank you Merilu, this book and you have changed my life for the better!"},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"Marilu's book is the most inspirational book about health that I have come across. Although I have never had to deal with a weight problem, my body just felt as if it was out of balance. Marilu's humorous, educated and well written advice was just the thing I needed to jump start my body and my eating habits. She wrote her book with her audience in mind which is why I feel she made her plan easy for anyone at any point in the lives to begin. Her book was not written to be followed exactly. She talks about how you should start slowly and only do what you are comfortable with. I am deeply greatful to her and wish her the best with future books and projects. Marilu, I think your enthusiasm and knowledge is just what America needs to rethink its views on diet!! Thank you!!"},{"Title":"Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover","review":"I am a healthy human being. THANK GOD. Read this book and I have experienced a new sense of healthy living that I have incorporated into my life.I cannot tell you how much better I feel. It has only been about a month but I immediately felt the difference. A pizza and cheeseburger girl feels the change. I suffer from pretty bad allergies. Taking my prescription meds has cut down more than 3/4 by cutting down the dairy. READ THE BOOK. I can't explain the difference, I read and I was like yeah, right, started with cutting out milk, there are alternatives (rice milk), TRY TOFU, its great used in a salad dressing, got to try more... You will feel great and it is a very interesting and EXTREMELY informative book to read. BUYING IT AND APPLYING IT, WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE. IN SUCH A SHORT TIME IT HAS CHANGED MINE.

The town, Wrightsville, appears ideal - attractive homes, friendly people, and little crime. The writer Ellery Smith is quickly embraced by the community, especially by the founding family of Wrightsville. All is tranquil, that is, until a series of arsenic poisonings earns Wrightsville the name Calamity Town.Calamity Town (1942) falls chronologically in the middle phase of the Ellery Queen canon and differs considerably from his earlier mysteries. The setting is far from New York City, although the exact location of Wrightsville remains unclear. Several chapters are devoted to an extended courtroom scene that, I believe, is unique to this EQ story. Ellery himself even takes the stand.Ellery's somewhat one-dimensional character is now more fully developed, more complex, more realistic. Unexpectedly, Ellery even becomes romantically involved with an attractive, quick witted, and independent young woman.Most noticeably, the characters and the plot, possibly because the setting is a typical small town, are more conventional than is found in Ellery Queen's more imaginative earlier stories such as The Greek Coffin Mystery, The Egyptian Cross Mystery, and The Siamese Twin Mystery. It is not hard to imagine this story, repackaged somewhat, transformed into a British manor house mystery.This atypical Ellery Queen mystery makes good reading. Calamity Town has often been reprinted and should not be difficult to locate."},{"Title":"Calamity Town","review":"Well known mystery writer Ellery Queen has decided to set his next novel in a small town even though he had lived his entire life in New York City. To overcome this lack in his background Ellery has decided to spend the next six months or so living in a small town while writing the book. He has selected the small town of Wrightsville to take up residence and, in order not to become the 'local celebrity', he has decided to live under an assumed name - 'Ellery Smith'. He was surprised to find that there were no hotel rooms available, nor any furnished apartments as Wrightsville was filled to the brim with workers at the defense factory. The only place Ellery could find to stay that October of 1940 was a furnished house, one with an unfortunate history of broken hearts and sudden death. Ellery finds himself being drawn into the family of his landlord, especially the youngest daughter, Pat, and joining in with them through the holidays. Unfortunately for all the celebrations are tainted with plots and murders that are not resolved until the spring.This is a transitional phase in the Ellery Queen series. In the earlier novels a very cerebral Ellery who dabbles in interesting problems writes mysteries as a hobby. In the later novels Ellery is a famous writer who travels often promoting his books and takes frequent breaks to peaceful Wrightsville to relax, usually with unfortunate consequences for at least one local resident. This novel is the first time Ellery visits the little town and, like all the books in the series, is contemporary to the time it is written. Life in a small town in the pre war years is an alien landscape to the 21st century reader. It is a time when people did not book accommodations ahead of time, when people were who they said they were and paid cash for things. As always with this series though the problem was complex and intriguing, one that will challenge the reader to stay ahead of Ellery.Fans of the series will not want to miss seeing Ellery's first trip to Wrightsville but those who are new to the series might be better off starting elsewhere. This is not a typical Ellery Queen story of either the first or second half of the series. It also features some rather prolonged court scenes, something that thankfully did not occur often in the series."},{"Title":"Calamity Town","review":"As other reviewers have pointed out, this isn't a typical Ellery Queen puzzler nor is it typical for the era. It certainly qualifies as a good puzzler with tragic undertones. The structure of detective fiction in those days doesn't allow the feeling of deep tragedy that you'll find in contemporary novels such as those by Charles Todd, Val McDermid, and others. But there is a fatalistic and tragic flavor here.Others have done well in summarizing the plot. Ellery leaves New York to get the feel of small town America as a setting for a book he's writing and becomes involved in a tragic train of events which culminates in the apparant attempted murder of one woman and death of a second. The culprit apears obvious and this uniquely has a lengthy and well done courtroom sequence which includes Ellery as a reluctant witness for the prosecution.There are minor flaws here and there, but basically it's a good read. I was surprised by the number of lady smokers portrayed because my recollection of a small town at that time is that very few women smoked. Also there is a Biblical goof in which an otherwise learned character confuses David and Goliath with each other. That aside, this is worth reading for those who enjoy classic whodunits."},{"Title":"Calamity Town","review":"In the first of the Wrightsville mysteries, Ellery seeks the peace and quiet of a small town for his writing, but soon becomes involved in the affairs of the Wright family. When newlyweds Jim and Nora Haight find themselves unwilling hosts to Jim's sister Rosemary, it is only a matter of time until Nora begins to suffer from sudden attacks of illness. However, it is Rosemary who dies on New Year's Eve of arsenic poisoning. What appears to be a straightforward murder case against Jim turns out to be anything but. There are plenty of romantic twists to the satisfying plot."},{"Title":"Calamity Town","review":"There's nothing worse for a murder mystery than to fail to surprise the reader with the solution. Unfortunately, that's what happened to me with _Calamity Town_. It's like Ellery himself says in the novel: \\"Two plus two is four,\\" and therefore the solution is obvious.Now, it's true my subconscious may be playing tricks on me. The book title _Calamity Town_ meant nothing to me when I picked it up to read. However, the more I delved into the book, the more it seemed to me as if I'd read it before. It's possible I had read it sometime in my teenage years. One thing is certain: one of the novel's characters seemed suspicious to me from the get-go... and sure enough, it turned out to be the culprit. Although it's possible that the solution remained hidden in my subconscious mind for decades, and now presented itself to me as I was progressing through the book, I'm not sure that's the only reason it turned out to be so disappointing.In reading _Calamity Town_, I was reminded of Raymond Chandler's criticism of \\"Golden Age\\" murder mysteries. Chandler said that in order for the \\"Great Detective\\" to excel, everyone else around him, notably the police, needs to be monumentally stupid. This seems to apply to _Calamity Town_. Seriously: can anyone possibly believe that a young, smart, up-and-coming county prosecutor like Carter Bradford would fail to at least glimpse the solution that Ellery pompously presents at the end of the book? Also, there is one accomplice character (very smart) in the book; again, how could we suppose that this accomplice would fail to divine the same solution to the whodunnit that Ellery saw? And why would the accomplice remain silent, instead of doing everything to save the accomplice's prot&eacute;g&eacute; before it's too late? I'm sorry, but there's no excuse for this -- when you get bored by a murder mystery with dozens of pages left to go, and find the solution obvious. The d&eacute;nouement seemed overly theatrical, with dramatic gasps by Ellery's listeners, Ellery emphasizing whole italics-printed sentences, and so on. Well, it might have been impressive if we had not expected where all of this was going to end.The book's plot itself is wildly implausible, and the implausibility is nicely illustrated in one detail. Ellery Queen arrives in an American small-town, choosing to remain anonymous as a writer working on his next book. The pseudonym he chooses is... Ellery Smith. Say what? How many American writers named Ellery can there possibly be? I know that people in the 1940s didn't have Google at their disposal -- but Ellery Queen was already famous when _Calamity Town_ came out. With the entire small town of Wrightsville struggling to find out what Ellery Smith's real identity was, even visiting the local library in droves to find out, it seems improbable to me that only one person would discover the truth; \\"Ellery\\" is just too eccentric a first name to choose for someone who wishes to remain incognito. If this was the 1940s and a writer arrived to your English small-town in order to write her next book, and her pseudonym was \\"Agatha Smith\\"... gee, I wonder what the real name of that writer might possibly be?_Calamity Town_ has its good sides, too. It represents a turning point in the Ellery Queen oeuvre, with the character of Ellery Queen, thankfully, moving away from the card-board character of the earlier, \\"strictly cerebral\\" books, to a genuine human being of flesh and blood. Some of Ellery's interactions (particularly the flirtatious ones) with the Wrightsville population are nicely depicted; and so is the overall small-town atmosphere. Even so, please don't mention _Calamity Town_ in one breath with Hitchcock's masterpiece _Shadow of a Doubt_; it's just not warranted, and the narrative structure of _Shadow of a Doubt_ is as different from _Calamity Town_ as can be. In Hitchcock's gem, we know from the opening shots \\"who did it\\", yet the movie still manages to remain suspenseful to the very last seconds; whereas _Calamity Town_ pretends as if we didn't know the culprit when, in fact, and disappointingly so, we have a very good idea."},{"Title":"Calamity Town","review":"I first read this detective novel in English, before buying it in French. I probably read it fifty times, and each time I enjoy the same enthralling pleasure. I'm a \\"good\\" reader, which means I [nearly never] discover who's guilty. If you are like me, it's a book you should read chapter by chapter, day after day, and enjoy it meantime. Yes, the clues are clearly indicated where they should be, but you wil not find who did it. A great classic, where our writer-detective keeps a constant eye on the supposed will-be murderer, but can't prevent the crime. You'll like all characters, especially Pat of course. You'll like this little American city, you'll believe yourself wandering in the streets. You'll know the map of the city, and everybody. And when it seems to be over, it's only a start for truth, the genuine one. A real masterpiece of detective novel, a grand one!"},{"Title":"Calamity Town","review":"To refer to the authors, I'll use their real names - Fred Dannay and Manfred Lee - to distinguish them from their chief character, Ellery Queen. CALAMITY TOWN was first published in April 1942, nearly 3 years after THE DRAGON'S TEETH. At this stage, Ellery Queen is in his second incarnation. He's no longer the 'pure reasoner' of the first EQ stories, who had filed for divorce from the human race; he agonizes over the consequences of his investigations, he loves and loses like anyone else. (Mind you, in the right frame of mind, I can enjoy the pure puzzle type of mystery, too, but *this* is a *novel*, where 'why?' can be as important as 'who'.) In fact, Ellery's been fleshed out enough to serve as the viewpoint character for most of the story, though not in first person. The fleshing out of characters and emotional situations is decent, although through Ellery's perception we're often given his take on something rather than being left to draw our own conclusions - i.e., some gracefully handled exposition here and there.Ellery, no longer drawn as a dilettante, takes his writing seriously. Since his next novel will be set in a typical small town, the normally city-dwelling Ellery plans to live in one for the next six months, incognito, researching the setting and producing a draft.Welcome to Wrightsville, Wright County, New York, making the first of its many appearances in the Queen canon. As in most Queen stories, the setting was contemporary when written - in this case, August 1940 - May 1941 - making it a period piece today. Rural Wrightsville, founded by Jezreel Wright in 1701, still has some cobbled streets, and horses are still commonplace in the area. The fact that Ellery can *sign a six-month lease* under an assumed name, with no ID and no credentials (other than 'I'm a writer under a pseudonym' and 'here's 3 months' rent in advance') *really* drives home that this is a vanished world. Even 2 years later, he'd have been a suspicious character, if not actually arrested for espionage or whatnot. (He later avoids being exposed by draft registration by quietly registering in his native New York City.) As it is, the defence industry is rejuvenating Wrightsville's economy, although not yet on a war footing, so Ellery can find only one available furnished rental: Calamity House.The Wrights remain the first family of Wrightsville: John F., bank president; his wife Hermione, holding the reins of Wrightsville society. They built a separate house on their property three years ago as a gift to Nora, their middle daughter, upon her marriage to Jim Haight, a promising young bank officer - but the engagement was broken, Jim left town, and Nora shut herself away, as much to protect herself from the town's petty gossip as from her broken heart. A now-ex newspaper reporter coined the tag 'Calamity House' when a massive heart attack struck down a would-be buyer. Ellery scoffs at the jinx theory, of course: \\"Calamity House! As sensible as calling Wrightsville Calamity Town!\\" Only gradually does he come to see the calamities inflicted by spite and mean-spirited gossip, and the hidden wish to see the mighty fallen.In this small town, the arrival of 'the famous writer, Ellery Smith' (as the realtor calls him while buttering up the Wrights) causes a stir - think of Hitchcock's film _Shadow of a Doubt_ for the flavor. Most of Wrightsville society bluffs its way through enthusiastic gushing over the famous author nobody's ever heard of, following up with clandestine visits to the library that, of course, come up empty. :) But even during Ellery's smooth entry into Wrightsville society, shadows occupy the picture, not only for Nora, but her elder sister Lola, who not only eloped, but (gasp!) got *divorced*, then refused either to take alimony or crawl back to her parents - who won't take her back since she won't play by the rules. Lola lives on piano lessons, alcohol, and guts. Only the 3rd sister, Patricia, is socially in good standing, and frankly enjoys using Ellery to make her *real* interest jealous - the Wright County Prosecutor.Ellery's lease soon creates a problem - Jim Haight reappears, demands to see Nora, and the long-delayed wedding finally takes place. Their long honeymoon cruise (late August - Halloween) is all very well, but Ellery's lease will still have a few months to run. He amiably offers to leave before being asked, and the Wrights, senior, settle matters by offering him rooms in their mansion for the rest of his lease.But upon the newlyweds' return, disturbing patterns begin taking shape: quarrels, escalated as Jim's poisonous sister Rosemary settles in for a long visit; a book on toxicology containing letters about an illness and death that haven't happened, yet; Jim's occasional binge drinking. And at last, on New Year's Eve, a poisoned cocktail sets events in motion that lift the lid off Hell, as the subsequent murder trial and its aftermath bring out the worst in Wrightsville. This tale is more like THE SCARLET LETTERS than the earliest Queen stories, as Ellery's part is more concerned with the court case than the arrest."},{"Title":"Calamity Town","review":"As usual this book is well written with interesting characters, settings, and story. The only problem, as with many Queen novels, is the identity of the killer is obvious. Still its a fun book and is well worth listening to with Scott Harrison's solid naration."},{"Title":"Mission to Saturn: Cassini and the Huygens Probe (Springer Praxis Books / Space Exploration)","review":"In David M. Harland's latest work, MISSION TO SATURN: CASSINI AND THE HUYGENS PROBE, the reader will find an excellent compendium of mankind's efforts to unravel the mysteries of the ringed giant planet culminating in the current joint U.S./European Cassini/Huygens mission, which one should note still has 1.5 years remaining before it reaches its primary target. Readers familiar with Harland's style will not be surprised that he hews closely to the now familiar, and almost formulaic, approach adopted for his well-received book on the Galileo mission to Jupiter. The first four chapters of MISSION TO SATURN are used to recount the centuries of astronomical observations that preceded the modern spacecraft reconnaissance and exploration efforts of Pioneer 11, Voyager 1, and Voyager 2; the final extended chapter is devoted almost exclusively to the Cassini/Huygens mission. In true workmanlike fashion, Harland utilizes his historian's eye for details, his archivist-like pursuit of primary source materials, many of which are very hard to find, and his rather considerable talent in rendering technical and scientific matters accessible to a wide range of readers. I highly recommend MISSION TO SATURN, which is richly illustrated and abundantly footnoted, to readers of all levels. The Cassini/Huygens mission will, if all goes as planned, return a veritable flood of data that will revolutionize our knowledge of the saturnian system. In anticipation of this, MISSION TO SATURN should take a prominent place on the planetary scientist's bookshelf."},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT Audio Osmosis with Jordan and Jon","review":"I listen while I drive, while I workout, I build confidence about taking the MCAT and laugh while my learning mind absorbs.

I have not try the other audio programs, and I probably will because the Audio Osmosis CD's are basically the EXAM Kracker books read to you. They add a little bit more information once in a while, leave out some.But, their humor is horrendous. I have only listened to one CD and haven't heard any of the anti-female stuff that one reviewere mentioned, but their jokes suck. Suck elephant balls suck. It is so not funny. It's so bad that you can't believe it's that bad. I think it might actually take away from learning sometimes. And the sound effects suck too. I really feel bad for these guys, they might be making a decent amount of money off the MCAT's but whatever partners they have, man or women, must suffer through their humor. So, don't expect it to be funny like they advertise.If you don't have a lot of time to listen on your hands, than do not buy this series.

We feel the high price can be justified.What I cannot tolerate is having recently discovered a list of numerous factual errors on these CDs, which I have verified myself by listening to them. This would not bother me so much if ExamKrackers had bothered to press a second edition of the CDs to correct these errors (I understand that people make mistakes, which is one of the main reasons for continuing editions of educational materials) or put a paper insert into the current CD set detailing these mistakes. The best they can do is admit to the errors on their website forums as \\"errata\\".Maybe I'm still a little grumpy from spending so much money on numerous studying materials, but I felt the need to write this low-star review and get this information out to others so that intelligent buying decisions can be made by all.Below is the list of errors. Note that I did not compile this list, but am simply sharing it for the benefit of others.CD #3 Track 17: The terms 'cohesive' and 'adhesive' are reversed when Jordan says:\\"The cohesive forces of water to glass are greater than the adhesive forces of water to water. The cohesive forces can cause a water column to climb the glass of a thin test tube. This is called capillary action. If the adhesive forces are stronger than the cohesive forces, like mercury in a glass test tube, the miniscus is convexed and will be pulled downward in a thin test tube.\\"He should have said:\\"The adhesive forces of water to glass are greater than the cohesive forces of water to water. The adhesive forces can cause a water column to climb the glass of a thin test tube. This is called capillary action. If the cohesive forces are stronger than the adhesive forces, like mercury in a glass test tube, the miniscus is convexed and will be pulled downward in a thin test tube.\\"All other references to cohesive and adhesive are correct.Cohesive forces are the forces between molecules within the fluid, such as water-to-water forces. Adhesive forces are the forces between the molecules of the fluid and the container, such as water-to-glass.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CD #4 Track 2: Coulomb's law constant is 8.9x10 to the positive 9 not negative 9.This edit is courtesy of one of our astute listeners. Thank you for the edit.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CD #4 Track 18: When discussing the critical angle Jordan says \\"If the light is moving from a lower idex of refraction to a higher index of refraction...\\"Total internal reflection occurs when light tries to move from a medium with a HIGH index of refraction to a medium with a LOW index of refraction and the angle of incidence is so great that all the light is reflected back into the high indexed medium.In the same discussion, Jon says \\"The larger index of refraction must be on the top of the ratio.\\" when solving for the critical angle with Snell's law. The opposite is true. The larger index of refraction must be on the bottom of the ratio, so that the ratio is a fraction less than one.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CD #5 Track #7: Stand alone timers are no longer allowed on the MCAT. You are limited to a watch.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CD #6 Track 5: Jon says \\"The equilibrium expression changes with temperature, but is not affected by a catalyst or by concentrations.\\" He should have said \\"The equilibrium CONSTANT changes with temperature, but the EQUILIBRIUM EXPRESSION does not. Neither the equilibrium expression nor the equilibrium constant is affected by a catalyst or by concentrations. \\"---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CD #6 track #15: Jordan says that the net heat transfer rate is proportional to... ...the temperature difference between the body and the environment raised to the fourth power. net heat transfer = sigma*epsilon*A*(T^4 - Te^4).The net heat transfer is actually proportional toT^4 - Te^4) NOT (T-Te)^4At low temperture differences, Newton's law of cooling says that the rate of cooling of a body is approximately proportional to the temperature difference between the body and the environment.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CD #7 Track 2: While discussing melting Jon says \\"It is interesting to relate thermodynamics to the heat curve... ...But the enthalpy change is NEGATIVE\\"Jon should have said \\"It is interesting to relate thermodynamics to the heat curve... ...But the enthalpy change is POSITIVE\\" Both enthalpy change and entropy change are positive during melting. Everything else in the track still applies. If both entropy and enthalpy change are positive, delta G depends upon temperature.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CD #7 Track #8: Jordan says \\"Lewis acids: donate; bases: accept.\\" This is backwards. Lewis acids accept a pair of electrons and Lewis bases donate a pair of electrons.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CD #7 track #10: Jordan says that the pH of a solution with a hydrogen ion concentration of 3.6x10^-4 is 4.5. It is 3.5.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CD #7 Track #11: Jordan says \\"The log of A times B equals the log A times the log of B.\\" He should say \\"The log of A times B equals the log of A plus the log of B.\\"---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CD #7 Track 26: Jon says \\"..the arteriole red blood cells contain fewer chloride ions than venous red blood cells.\\"If Jon had been thinking correctly he would have said \\"..the arteriole red blood cells contain MORE chloride ions than venous red blood cells.\\"---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CD #7 Track 30: Jordan says \\"If delta G zero is positive, K is greater than one. If delta G zero is negative, then K is less than one.\\" This is backwards. A positive delta G zero indicates a K less than one, and a negative delta G zero indicates a K greater than one.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CD #8 Track 23: Jon says \\"...dragging the second tRNA to the P site, adn exposing the P site for yet another tRNA.\\"Jon should say: \\"...dragging the second tRNA to the P site, and exposing the A site for yet another tRNA.\\"---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CD #8 track 23: DNA and RNA are read 5 to 3. Anticodons are an exception and they are read 3-5. This track says that the anticodon is read 5 to 3. This is incorrect. This knowledge is very unlikely to be tested by the MCAT.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CD #9,Track 50: says that the oocyte undergoes meiosis 1 and 2 after penetration by the sperm.This is incorrect for humans. The correct process is as follows:\\"Oogenesis begins in the ovaries of the fetus. All the eggs of the female are arrested as primary oocytes at birth... ...Shortly before the primary oocyte is released from the follicle during ovulation, the nucleus divides by meiosis to become the secondary oocyte... ...The entry of the sperm causes the cortical reaction, which prevents other sperms from fertilizing the same egg. Now the oocyte goes through the second meiotic division releasing a second polar body. Fertilization occurs when the nuclei of the egg and sperm fuse to form the zygote.\\"---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CD #12 Track 3: Jordan says \\"isn't there a way to add the halogen to the MOST substituted carbon?\\" and Jon says, \\"with peroxides... HYDROGEN adds the most substituted carbon\\"...Jordan should say \\"Halogen to the LEAST sustituted carbon\\".--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CD #12 track #6: Hydroboration.Jordan says, \\"Now is there a way to hydrate an ALCOHOL with anti-markovnikov addition.\\"Jordan should have said ALKENE instead?---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CD #10 Track 8: The track incorrectly reads: \\"nutrients are absorbed into the enterocytes of the small intestines mainly in the DUODENUM\\"Duodenum does mostly digestion and jejunem and ileum do most of the absorption."},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT Audio Osmosis with Jordan and Jon","review":"I'm satisfied with my 35, and I give these CDs a fair bit of the credit. I'd recommend, as another reviewer has, taking notes the first time through. It is a bit time consuming to do that, but you'll engage another learning modality. I think such an approach really helps drive home concepts later while listening over and over...and porta-lecture is the true beauty/benefit of AO CDs.Yes, the humor and sound effects are goofy and sometimes get carried away, but generally they are welcome breathers. I'd second the call for a revision that maybe shortens some of the longer comedy bits. But after a few listens, you'll know when to hit the \\">>\\" button.I just can't see paying $1,000 for such a class, given resources like the AO CDs, the plethora of study books (by various companies including Kaplan), your textbooks and notes, and cold AAMC exams (be sure you self-administer, timed, several of these!!). AO CDs are broken into topical lectures so you can create a very efficient schedule of study and there is website where questions can be posted to the lecturers. Just be sure to listen frequently and actively for 3 months; don't take \\"osmosis\\" literally, you need to think...Good luck!"},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT Audio Osmosis with Jordan and Jon","review":"I used the Audio Osmosis CDs, my textbooks, and AAMC practice tests for self-directed MCAT prep. In my opinion, A.O. is a great bargain; I am very glad I &quot;took a chance&quot; on it rather than blowing $1K+ on a prep class. All I wanted, and what I got from A.O., was a clear, concise refresher of the science covered on the MCAT (as a post-bacc premed, my general chem and physics are about 7 years old). To boot, they also give a useful &quot;strategy&quot; for the verbal reasoning section - worked for me.In short, I found Jon's description hits its mark: the CDs condense many major concepts into a series of compact, conversational lectures (and they're portable and repeatable). Dense topics are frequently leavened with humor and goofy sound effects - these also generally make factoids and rules-of-thumb stick in your head. Please note that a few errors slipped through, you'll probably catch them, but you can also check their website for the short list of errata. Finally, the authors support their product(s) personally via a bulletin board system on their website."},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT Audio Osmosis with Jordan and Jon","review":"These 12 CDs are excellent for prep for MCAT. Because of these CDs, my score went from a 22 (6v, 7ps, 9bs) to a 26 (7v,9ps,10bs). This may not seem like its that good of an improvement, but I did almost no other studying besides listening to these CDs. The physics and gem chem sections are the best because they explain the subjects conceptually, which helps enormously on the real mcat. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT Audio Osmosis with Jordan and Jon","review":"I would not recommend &quot;studying&quot; straight from these audio CD's, though it can be done. Instead, it is very helpful to REVIEW the topics you're uncomfortable with. I listened to them in the car, in my lab job, before bed. They offer great flexibility to one's studying and the jokes help you relax a bit and not be so tense. The topics are covered with depth and help you become more INTUITIVE with the science.Because the audio CD's go closely with the Examcrackers books, it feels like you can supplement a &quot;lecture&quot; with the great books. These guys are the best hands down on MCAT materials and have an online message board to answer any questions (very quickly too)."},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT Audio Osmosis with Jordan and Jon","review":"I strongly recommend the MCAT audio Osmosis CD's to anyone who is preparing ot take the MCAT. Whatever intellectual level you are on, these CD's are incredibly helpful. They are very explanatory about all the concepts that will be addressed on the MCAT, and they review them in a creative, interesting way. It is practically impossible to become bored while listening to these because they do a lot of sound effects, real life examples, give insight on the thought process behind the MCAT and how you should approach it, and they approach the hard concepts addressed on the MCAT with a more intuitive approach. In addition, by having two different people teaching it, it is so much more engaging and exciting to listen to. I have personally met Jon Orsay, and trust me, not only does he know what he's talking about, he can communicate his knowledge effectively, and is definitely worth the money.Also, the convenience of the CD's are very valuable. I listen to them in my car, as well as sitting down and taking notes on them. they fully cover all areas of the MCAT, and I am going to use this solely as my test prep (in addition to some practice MCATS), because it covers al the topics so well. I strongly recommend this product, especially if you don't want to take and expensive prep course."},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT Audio Osmosis with Jordan and Jon","review":"Audio Osmosis was very helpful to me as a secondary tool for reviewing, but you should definitely get the regular Examkrackers books as well. I found the jokes to be a useful memory tool and only mildly distracting the second time around. I guess if you're going to listen to these CDs for a year then the humor would get obnoxious, as some of the other reviewers have mentioned, but at that point maybe you should just take the test...The only complaint that I have about these CDs is that they are ridiculously overpriced. I could not justify blowing the $125 on9 CDs, and I was able to get them off of Ebay for around $60, which was worth it. I'm not really sure why they have inflated the price so much, but if you can get them cheaper, then do it. They are a good study tool and really help with memory recall, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT Audio Osmosis with Jordan and Jon","review":"These guys were great. They covered everything that was on my MCAT inApril. They discuss the science concept rather than give lectures. Theyaren't nearly as funny as they think they are, but I have to admit that Idid laugh occasionally. Anyway, their jokes and sound effects definitelyhelped me remember the material. And there is no way that I would havelistened to 13 hours of straight lecture. If you really think 5 hours isbetter than 13 hours, and dry and boring is better than interesting, then Isuggest Audio Learn instead. Unfortunately, I tried Audio Learn before Ifound Audio Osmosis."},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT Audio Osmosis with Jordan and Jon","review":"These cds are great. I spent $1300 on a MCAT prep course and these cds are much more useful then the prep class material. I have actually stopped going to the prep class and just use this material and I feel like I am making more progress than I was while I was going to class. If I had known about examkrackers before I signed up for the course I would have just bought these cds and saved [a lot of money]."},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT Audio Osmosis with Jordan and Jon","review":"AudioLearn and Audio Osmosis seem to get to the same place in their own ways. Neither is perfect. Both are helpful. Both CDs were created by highly credentialed people. They cover the same information, which bolsters the faith you can have that you're studying the proper material.I bought AudioLearn a year after the jokes on these CDs became unbearable. Audiolearn lacks these distractions, however suffers from a problem that I hadn't anticipated: AudioLearn is as stiff as AudioLearn is corny.AudioLearn:-- Lectures are quite long (up to 18 minutes)-- -- One track discusses several topics, thus making it difficult to locate specific information-- No track listing is enclosed-- Stiff (No contractions, no pronouns, repetitive word use)-- -- For instance, when discussing the naming of alkanes:-- -- -- \\"If the number of carbons is one, you say meth, if it is two you say eth, three you say prop, four you say but, five you say pent, six you say hex, seven you say hept, eight you say oct, nine you say non, ten you say dec.\\"-- Narrator sounds like Mr Sulu-- No jokes, no sound effects-- Mnemonics...sort of-- -- To remember the signal that causes heart contraction: \\"just think of the letters SABP\\"... 'cause that's catchy.AudioOsmosis:-- Short lectures make it easy to find a particular topic-- The jokes, gongs, applause, & laughtrack distract-- -- They account for 20% of the lecutres-- -- I can't stress enough how distracting they are-- Jordan & John's co-narration makes listening more intersting-- MAMA: Mnemonics Are Memory Aids"},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT Audio Osmosis with Jordan and Jon","review":"These guys did a great job at covering every topic on the MCAT in a fun way. This is a great way to study while driving or playing video games or just laying around. You don't have to open a book or use a muscle, all you do is just stay awake, and they do a good job helping you to do that.Jordan and Jon are not annoying at all, unless you are easily annoyed. Don't believe these disgruntled reviewers who say there is too much comedy. There is actually very little comedy. There is the occasional bad joke, and they'll make fun of it with sound effects for being a bad joke. Besides, when you're studying for the MCAT, ALL jokes, good or bad, are a welcome relief. So it's all in good fun, and it's only a nuisance if you are no fun, which I suppose is true of a lot of premeds. Jon is the know-it-all, and Jordan is the confused guy you can relate to. Jon has the dry, genius voice, Jordan has the young, animated voice. It works.You won't ace the MCAT just by listening to this, but what I recommend is first studying the lecture from the book, then listening to the lecture on Audio Osmosis before you go to sleep. It's a very effective combination. I hesitate to even call these lectures because they're more like a summary of all of the important topics in each chapter. Jordan asks a question about the lecture, Jon gives him part of the answer, Jordan says \\"oh yeah!\\" and starts figuring out the rest of the answer for himself, Jon helps him along, then Jordan asks another question that takes the topic into further detail. That's the formula, and it's a good one."},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT Audio Osmosis with Jordan and Jon","review":"The Exam Krackers Audio Osmosis series is by far the most excellent resource I had for preparing for the MCAT. Jordan and Jon break-down and simplify not only every concept on the test, but also the test itself. They have each taken the test numerous times and score very highly, and you can tell they really understand the ins-and-outs of the MCAT.This series is also surprisingly entertaining in it's corniness and you actually begin enjoying listening to the CD's right off the bat.I can't really say much here that hasn't already been said before by others.There are a couple of small errors they made and you can find them on their website. They should probably come out with a newer version that corrects those and talks a little about the computer-based MCAT, which is whi I give this a 4-star instead of 5-star rating."},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT Audio Osmosis with Jordan and Jon","review":"i take the mcat in january, but if you're neurotic about spending every free minute of your day studying like i am, then this is a great addition to your arsenal for studying while commuting. i drive from annapolis to d.c. every weekend and put all 13ish cds on my ipod.. i can get through a complete subject each way. excellent mcat prep but could never be standalone. good luck."},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT Audio Osmosis with Jordan and Jon","review":"im pretty blah about it...it's good and it's bad...it's right in the middle of being just a ok product from examkrackers....you'd spend better time reading their awesome review notes and practicing your tests..."},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT Audio Osmosis with Jordan and Jon","review":"This is a great program for anyone preparing for the MCATs.

The mnemonic devices they provide throughout the lectures are also very helpful. I definitely reccommend this product as a supplement to anyone going for that MCAT 45."},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT Audio Osmosis with Jordan and Jon","review":"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible. I've tried many times to listen to any subject for more than half an hour while driving to or from work and I just can't do it. Too many annoying little sound effects really disrupts the concentration, especially due to the fact that the effects are far louder than their voices. Jordan is hard to listen to because of his Looooong Island accent. He should never say the words all (\\"ole\\") or water (\\"woater\\") again.Also, for some strange reason, 3 or 4 of the 8 discs are dedicated to physics, which is a very minor aspect of the physical science on the MCAT while Biology is only covered on a 1 disc, but comprises an entire third of the MCAT!"},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT Audio Osmosis with Jordan and Jon","review":"After taking the MCAT, I found this CD to be of little use. Besides the fact that there are more sound effects than substance, much of the information about the test itself was inaccurate. For instance, they suggested bringing a timer, something strictly forbidden by MCAT and needless anyhow because of the onscreen timer. Further, between sound effects, they quickly recite hundreds of formulas you don't need to memorize because they are provided for you when required on the test. There are content inaccuracies as well, and you need to pay to access their forum to view them.One positive note, however, is that they do a good job of covering what topics are on the test.Their website contains many spelling and grammar errors. These guys seem like no more than two dudes with some sound equipment reading all the sidebar notes in \\"Biology for Dummies\\" in their garage while playing with the sound effect buttons. Out of decency I won't try to resell you the crap I bought. I don't want to waste your time or money.Unless you enjoy sound effects."},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT Audio Osmosis with Jordan and Jon","review":"This seems like a good way to review. I have taken the mcat once (w/o audio osmosis) and am studying to take it again. So far, I've listened to the discs once through, and I think that being able to hear concepts while at work or on the train to/from work will help cement them in addition to reading, reviewing, and taking practice tests. DO NOT think you'll ace the mcat w/o practice tests, but it's an amusing set of discs with some good sound effects, asides, and mnemonics to help commit concepts to memory. I'm pretty confident it should help."},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT Audio Osmosis with Jordan and Jon","review":"This item is really good for reviewing the basics for the MCAT. To get an even more intense review, purchase the 1001 problems for Bio, Chemistry, OChem, and Physics. All of these products were wonderful aids in my preparation for the MCAT!"},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT Audio Osmosis with Jordan and Jon","review":"First off, yes, the audio does contain a lot of cheesy humor that irritates you at first. However, after constant exposure, these actually work as \\"breather\\" moments or you even remember the definition of something because of the cheesy jokes. The only part I complain about now is when the sound effects are louder than the regular audio because they hurt my ears on Ipod.Second, yes, there are errors. However, these are extremely minor error and very rare. They will not be something that will throw you off completely and ruin your MCAT. In fact, sometimes these errors are due to misspeak that you can easily identify because 10 seconds later they are saying the correct thing 3 or 4 times.Third, this review is NOT for those wanting to learn the science for the first time. I made that huge mistake at first and thought this was garbage. I went onto actually learning the science through another course (use open university from MIT, Berkeley, Yale, UC Irvine, etc. on YouTube), and once I returned, I saw how this was a condensed version of that specifically targeted to learning what is in the MCAT only. Therefore, remember you are buying a REVIEW for the MCAT, not a science course.These are definitely worth buying."},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT Audio Osmosis with Jordan and Jon","review":"These lectures are a good review for the MCAT, but if they did away with the corny jokes and cheap annoying sound effects, they could be even better. I think the idea of excessively trying to entertain listerners while teaching them MCAT material is overdone. The frequent jokes and sound effects are really unnecessary and only serve to throw off one's concentration while listening. Otherwise I would give these audio CDs 5 stars. I do give the authors credit for the tremendous effort they have put into making these CDs. I think Jordan and John should make a DVD MCAT lecture series where students can learn MCAT material at their own pace."},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT Audio Osmosis with Jordan and Jon","review":"It was obvious that it was recorded several years ago and hasn't been updated in a while. It was okay, I wouldn't discourage anyone from buying it as the information is useful and presented in a simple format. But it's a little expensive and I'm not sure it helped me much other than offering audio to the examkrackers books I was reading. The books seemed to be a little more up to date than the cd's and I would recommend these books over the Kaplan ones. Good luck on the MCAT!"},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT Audio Osmosis with Jordan and Jon","review":"Because I have a long commute back and forth to school, I thought that Audio Osmosis would be a good way to get a head start on studying for the MCAT,and I was right! Jordan and Jon move quickly through physics (though it is 4 CDs), biology, inorganic and organic chemistry and a brief section on writing. I have focused on physics to prepare me for summer courses, and although the concepts were new (I never took physics in high school), I found that with REPITITION I was able to master the elemental concepts and even a few formulas within a few weeks. The CDs do move quickly, covering a lot of material in little time, and this can be a bit difficult to follow. The solution, of course, is to listen again, and again and again... though with their humor and quirky sound effects, this isn't difficult."},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT Audio Osmosis with Jordan and Jon","review":"Although they do a comprehensive review of materials, I was not satisfied with the product for a number of reasons.Firstly, the ridiculous sound effects and terrible (and I mean geared at a 7 year old level) jokes, really detract from learning the material.

As such, I haven't retaken Gen. Chem or O-Chem since my college days (graduated 2005).

On my way to class, on my way to work, on my way home. Every now and then I'd change to music to keep my sanity, but really I spent 99% of my driving time during this period listening to these lectures.My first attempt at the MCAT was a dismal 24. After 3 months, I was scoring between 36-41 on the AAMCs and got a 37Q on the real exam. Part of this success was definitely due to Audio Osmosis.Yes, Jordan and Jon make some corny jokes. But then again, so do all intelligent people:\\"What are the hardest 2 years of a dentist's training?\\"\\"The 4th grade\\"Also, there are minor errors in the CDs. There is so much to recommend these lectures that a few verbal \\"typos\\" don't justify a negative rating.

These CDs allowed me to study during those times. In addition, it's a good idea to reinforce your learning by getting it in different ways: reading books and looking at diagrams is fine, but hearing the concepts activates different parts of your brain. I listened to these CDs repeatedly.The speakers (Jordan and John) insert jokes throughout the presentations. Oftentimes the jokes are lame, but they help keep it interesting. At its best, the humor helps your remember important concepts; at its worst, the jokes are unrelated to the subject material and you've heard them a dozen times before. A good trade, I think.The CDs were also effective. I scored a 39 on the MCAT. I was accepted to several medical schools, and one offered me a scholarship worth $160,000 -- due in part, I'm sure, to my performance on the MCAT.I recommend these Exam Krackers CDs to anyone planning to take the test.-Luke"},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT Audio Osmosis with Jordan and Jon","review":"With limited time to study my husband has been able to listen to them while driving or on his Ipod at the gym.

This program keeps you listening and gets the information into your head whether you are extremely focused or not---thus the name: Audio Osmosis.UPDATE: 1/30/09--- I've been using this product intermittently for months in addition to a full MCAT prep class, and as I'm getting closer to my scheduled MCAT test date, I'm finding that the sounds effects ARE becoming extremely distracting and a fair amount of time is wasted on the joke/sound effect portion of this program. It's still a good program, but others who have complained about this aspect do have a valid point."},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT Audio Osmosis with Jordan and Jon","review":"I'm more of a visual and active learner, so I didn't love this product, but I did find it a useful way to try to review some key points when I was in the car or unable to open a book. The authors of the product say that you can just use the Audio Osmosis but I would strongly recommend that it's used as a supplement to other types of learning, unless you're really familiar with all of the MCAT science content already and truly just need a refresher."},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT Audio Osmosis with Jordan and Jon","review":"If you are so sensitive that these tasteless jokes bother you that much......you are not going to make it in medical school.

These CDs and the Examkrackers book set are all I studied for those long-forgotten subjects. Excellent, to-the-point format gave me exactly what I needed to know on each section, refreshed my memory with good visuals and the audio topped it off.

I read now a couple of other reviews and I decided to do one myself, because I disagree with some people. First, I dont know if a have a silly sense of humor but this guys are hillarious, and even though you are not looking for a stand up comedy album, laughing to some stupid joke can make studying a lot easier.Second, I recommend you to get also the examkrackers books, so you may listen to the cd and then go to your text book to read and memorize what is there, believe me is the fastest way you are going to read anything for that crappy test, cause truth is reading about general biology is not exactly reading Harry Potter.Another good hint - Buy the 101 questions or something like that On verbalExamkrackers 101 Passages in MCAT Verbal Reasoning (Examkrackers). Because other companies say \\"read read read\\" total BS - Im sorry but in less than 2 months you are not going to read enough to get the 10, so \\"practice practice practice\\" and probably youll have good luck."},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT Audio Osmosis with Jordan and Jon","review":"I am half way through listening to these awesome CDs.

You apprecitate AUDIO learning, in addition to mere books.2. You need to study for MCAT's on a flexible schedule (as opposed to revolving your schedule around a Kaplan/PR course).3. You can't shell out $1500+ for Kaplan/PR/Etc.4. You value bad jokes that help you remember dry concepts over hip, cool humor.Avoid AO if:1. You were born with a photographic memory and can recall EVERYTHING you learned in Bio 1&2, Phys 1&2, Chem 1&2, Organic 1&2.2. You are an independently wealthy trust fund baby that doesn't need to work at least 1 or 2 jobs and can spend as much time as you want, whenever you want, on MCAT prepping.3. You can afford the time and drop $1500+ on a professional review course.4.

It is a CD set so it is much easier to &quot;rewind&quot; to the beginning of the different topics, it is a dialog between 2 people as opposed to 1 narrator reading script, humor is interspersed throughout the CDs (which we were told didn't detract from it for the ultra-serious types), and sound effects are used to hold your attention as well as to facilitate your memorization of the material.The set's title is very appropriate and if you are a commuter, this can add many hours to your MCAT preparation that otherwise would have been wasted in the car."},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT Audio Osmosis with Jordan and Jon","review":"An awesome MCAT review collection! My advice, spend time with the audio and books! You must fall in love with studying long hours. The examkracker collection was a major reason for my being accepted to medical school! I spent 12 years researching and teaching after college until I was drawn back to my dream of attending medical school. You'll soon discover that $100 is just a small amount compared to the rewards of learning medicine. The MCAT is just a hurdle you must jump along the way to becoming a physician. Don't forget...you must work as hard as humanly possible!!"},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT Audio Osmosis with Jordan and Jon","review":"The CDs are a very helpful study aid.

As someone who was weak in physics especially, Audio Osmosis has really helped me to visualize the concepts and think more intuitively about the problems.

Note that it is not designed to serve as your only means of studying, but is an excellent supplement. I had it playing in the car and on my ipod for several months leading up to the MCAT to help reinforce concepts that I had been reading about and keep knowledge that I had studied a while ago up to date. I also used the 1001 Examkracker question books, which I found to be the best way to practice each MCAT concept enough times to really understand it and get the hang of it."},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT Audio Osmosis with Jordan and Jon","review":"Great investment.Audio Osmosis is great for reviewing what you have been studying.

Don't read it before you listen to the lectures. Listen to the lectures FIRST and take notes on them ON YOUR BOOK (or make a transcript, if you prefer). Then skim through the book to read any other part that was not included in the audio. Do not pay too much attention to external information the audio osmosis does not go over in detail; MCAT won't either.Often times, you may find yourself too exhausted of fuel to continue studying. Then take advantage of the product by quiet literally letting it soak in passively. Do you drive a lot? Pop in the CD's while you wait for traffic to subside. Hell, you may even listen to them when you exercise. It's a great way to familiarize yourself with concepts as the two men pinpoint important (and not so important) key concepts that you will need to understand in order to perform well on MCAT.It comes in 12 sets of CD's and cover organic chem, bio, gen chem, physics, and a tiny bit of verbal. Please take my experience and review with a grain of salt and do not solely rely on listening to the lectures; it will be in your best interest to complement and supplement your studying with problem solving and practice exams. Otherwise, I think the jump in the two quiet different scores adequately and sufficiently attest to the value of this product.P.S. yes, it does indeed contain errors. However, these errors are little minute details that 1) you should be able to detect on your own as you cross check what you listen to and what you read and 2) shouldn't be relevant because MCAT mostly tests your conceptual understanding rather than memorization."},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT Audio Osmosis with Jordan and Jon","review":"This a great set of cds and I hope they turn out to be a good mode of studying for the MCAT as many others have reviewed.

The advice sounds true, but I don't know for sure ... do any of us? (Remember 'Duck and Cover'?) I would recommend that most every American who lives and/or works in a likely target (e.g. any large-sized metropolitan city) read what this book says, though, and commit it to memory. This is one of those books that, having read free online (Rand makes it available online free at http://www.rand.org/publications/MR/MR1731/), I am going to also purchase, mostly for the reference card available at the end. As someone who spends 8-10 hours per day in the nation's second largest major metropolitan center (Chicago), I would rather have this information handy in card form should the worst ever happen. Call me paranoid, but I'd rather have it and not need it, rather than needing it and not having it ..."},{"Title":"The Gang","review":"THE GANG is composed of Celia, a six-foot tall mistress to some of the rich and famous; Bert, a meek, middle-aged writer of crime fiction; Manny, a handsome talent agent; and his juvenile delinquent son, Mark. Through circumstances beyond their control, they join forces to form a gang, ripping off businesses for thousands and shooting anyone who gets in their way. As absurd as this scenario sounds, Kastle somehow manages to pull it off with a combination of fully-developed characters and believable plot development. If it had been made into a movie, it could have fit easily alongside such crime films as THE GETAWAY (the Peckinpah version) and DIRTY MARY AND CRAZY LARRY. Worth checking out."},{"Title":"How to Custom Paint Your Car (Motorbooks Workshop)","review":"I saw the cover car at a GoodGuys Car Show and then saw this book. So I bought it and all I can say is wow. It was amazing to see the process of how the real flames were painted. She takes you through the whole thing, from start to finish. The story of how she came to paint these flames is pretty funny even. The rest of the book is also great. The author JoAnn really goes into detail explaining all the techniques, from traditional flames to graphics. I really liked the wide variety of techniques she goes through in this book. There's a chapter on painting pinup girls that really blew me away. I can now mix up skin tone and paint people after reading that chapter. There are good explanations of the tools used, airbrushes and spray guns. It was very easy to understand and you don't need to be an experienced painter to use this book. I am a beginner and I could follow the lessons in it. But my favorote was the real fire process. The photo on the cover does not really show how incredible this car looks in real life. Some of the photos inside the book show the car more accurately, but the depth of the flame layers is unreal. If you want to paint real flames, check out this book. I do have another of JoAnn's books and thought that one was good, but this one goes over things that the first one does not."},{"Title":"How to Custom Paint Your Car (Motorbooks Workshop)","review":"I have a background in art. I pretty much read this book in one sitting. Plenty of pictures, lots of tips and tricks. Covers a ton of information. I'd consider this as not just a book, but a very exciting book. It covers thinking and rationale, it'll definitely give you some ideas. Well worth several rereads and study."},{"Title":"How to Custom Paint Your Car (Motorbooks Workshop)","review":"I have never painted a car, until I got this book. I bought it with another couple books on painting and it really helped. I had purchased an older MG that needed a paint job. So I used this book to help me with some idea and a little custom paint work.You won't become an expert just by reading this book. I actually practiced several of the techniques in this book a couple dozen times before I put them on the car. I was surprised, though, at the results. In fact, a car I paid only $800 for sold for over $2000 after I painted it. I had only done minor engine work (mostly tuning and cleaning) and then the body/paint work.The book is written for an average level reader. This is really good for someone that has little experience in car painting. I was most impressed with the fact the author gave clear instructions on several of the techniques being used.The chapter on flake paints gave me just enough information to understand what I would be dealing with. Even better was the chapter on basic tools and the chapter on pinstriping. While I didn't use a flake paint on the first project I did use some of the same techniques. It helped me lay a better foundation, which then gave me a good start for the stripes. I put wider pin stripes on that some might thing, but it went well with the overall body flow for the little Midget.My next project is a motorcycle gas tank and set of fenders. I'll try some of the other techniques from the book. So far my practice sessions have gone really well. I'm even surprised that I've been able to use some of the techniques with spray can paint, something I wasn't expecting. In all, the price of the book is very reasonable and the value was very high."},{"Title":"Camaro Restoration Guide, 1967-1969 (Motorbooks Workshop)","review":"If your restoring your own camaro, (and you do your own restoration work) you'd think this would be a good book to get. However, if your like me, you already own the GM overhaul/chasis manual, the fisher body manual, the wiring diagram and the factory assembly manual. I bought this book thinking it would aid me in restoring my camaro. Instead, this book is nothing but a bunch of diagrams/clips taken from the books mentioned above but in much less detail.I am surprised the other two reviews were real positive because if you already have the factory manuals, it renders this book useless and quite lacking. This book does have a good bit of facts and codes but if your looking for that type of info, go for the Big Book of Camaro Data.For real &quot;how to&quot; type applications and in a step-by-step procedure in bringing your camaro back to life I recommend the Camaro Restoration Handbook by Currao and the Camaro Owner's Handbook by Sessions.

It discusses specific procedures for removal, repair, and replacement of virtually every major part of the body of the car in detail, including a lot of useful tips one wouldn't find in a service manual.It is a little skimpy on engine info, for which I suggest the Haynes Chevrolet Engine Overhaul Manual (cheap) and the official Chevrolet service manual for your car (expensive). Also, this book is not very useful for identifying parts in a full restoration; look to Jason Scott's &quot;Camaro Restoration Guide&quot; for 1967-69 models.Overall, it is an excellent source of information on the manual labor side of Camaro restoration."},{"Title":"Now You Know Treo","review":"Just the best reference book for my Treo 600.

The author does nothing to sensationalize the story; he lays down the facts in a meticulous and methodical way. The facts, in and of themselves, are sensational enough. The book is a real page turner. It clarifies many of the misconceptions about what happened that night: there was no stampede. Eleven hapless concert-goers were literally squeezed to death. I was appalled over officials' reluctance to do away with festival seating at the Coliseum, particularly since people had tried in vain to warn them about what was fast becoming a deadly situation-- a tragedy waiting to happen. The concert prior to the deadly one should have been a wake-up call; in it, a number of concert goers suffered injuries, not to mention outright terror, while waiting to enter the building. In reality, The Who's concert that December day was the result of a perfect storm; many factors contributed and Fuller examines them. In the end, we're left to ponder the whys and the wherefores. Mr. Fuller does an outstanding job of both enlightening and forcing us to question our priorities and try to make sense out of the unthinkable.Are the kids all right?: The rock generation and its hidden death wish"},{"Title":"Escapade","review":"[This is a draft review]Escapade really starts in Calais, France and ends up near Canterbury, England. The ending was too burlesque for me to rate this very highly, but the beginning and middle were superb. Maria, Lady Carleton, the childless widow of a much older man (one of her father's friends, of course) is walking her sister-in-law's obese dog when she spots a balloon ascension about to take place. Believing that the balloonist is Madame Blanchard (widow of a famous balloonist), she draws closer hoping to see the lady. Instead, when the dog is tossed into the basket with an inebriated English gentleman, she climbs in to rescue the dog - and finds to her dismay that the gentleman's friends have let the balloon loose. The ill-assorted and woefully unprepared party of three - a gentleman, a lady, and a dog - are floating across the Channel.There is a prequel to this of course. The hero has fled England, after being named in the memoirs of a notorious courtesan. He is thus not the best person with whom to be marooned (inflight, as it were). When the couple make land (at the Cliffs of Dover!), they end up at an inn with no money. Enter an inquisitive and possibly blackmailing journalist, enter old acquaintances of the hero. The couple flee the inn for one of the hero's smaller estates. So far, so good.Unfortunately, once the couple arrived at the estate, things took a turn for the worse (in more ways than one). Firstly, Maria discovers a child being mistreated by his uncle at the estate, and intervenes decisively. Secondly, the hero's fiance shows up with her cousin (who loves her) believing him to be dead and intent on purloining the best portrait of him. Thirdly, the hero's friend (the one who arrived at the inn) shows up, needing money as usual. And then the blackmailing journalist also arrives, completing the party - no wait, the hero's fiancee's father also arrives.The last part of the book was a bit too much. It is true that everyone believes that the hero drowned in the Channel, but the antics of the hero in the last part reminded me more of a burlesque or a farce, than of the wry tone in the first two-thirds of the book. I did appreciate the companionship between the young child and the overfed dog, and the loyalty of the incredibly patient servants. But the ending did not quite satisfy me, nor did the reasons why the hero fled England make a lot of sense to me.Grade = B-"},{"Title":"California drunk driving law: A comprehensive reference to the law of drunk driving in California","review":"I would love to review this publication, yet every attempt made to do so by clicking on the appropreiate links was unsuccessful.So I like the concept but how up to date and what sort of life span can a book on constantly changing law have?Again, would love to read and review this book, if given an opportunity.RespectfullyPamela de los Angelespamela.delosangeles@yahoo.com"},{"Title":"California drunk driving law: A comprehensive reference to the law of drunk driving in California","review":"This book is very comprehensive, but it is written in a strange folksy text that I found to be less than helpful.

It not only covers speech issues but all learning disabilities, giving useful information on how to direct your child to achieving a successful and fulfilling life. I know the biggest key to a child's success in life is their self-esteem, and Glechner, as a mother of three, was able to help navigate her son through the turbulant experiences a child with learning disabilities faces (with teachers, peers and even family who don't understand and misinterpret behaviors) and guide him to success as a high-school honors student and college graduate. I think that you will find this an encouraging resource. I don't have much time on my hands, and don't often read a book cover to cover due to time constraints, but because I value my son, I read this book every chance I get and it is covered with all my notes to self and penmarks to research terms more on the internet to gain a better understanding, etc. I hope that you purchase this book, it will help you better understand and decide what avenue to take for your child to see them personally succeed!"},{"Title":"Learning Disabilities from a Parent's Perspective: What You Need to Know to Understand, Help & Advocate for Your Child","review":"One of the greatest challenges for parents these days is sorting through all of the psychological jargon of the reports that they receive and often pay for from psychologists.

That chapter takes a very good shot at answering the question, &quot;what's it all about?&quot; If you are looking for insights, wrap the Huxley quote, the Hun Tun story, and the highway/service road analogy up together and give yourself a treat.

Gadgets, violence and single-mindedness are the tactics used by both as the white spy battles the black spy. Neither one possesses a great deal of intelligence; at the end one always falls for the trap.Jokes fly fast and furious as these two fools engage in what Mad calls \\"joke and gagger.\\" This book is a very fun read."},{"Title":"Conjectures of a guilty bystander","review":"Conjectures of a Guilty Bystander is a collection of reflections on the world in the 1960s which illumine what is happening now. Merton discusses JFK, LBJ, Pope John XXIII, Gandhi, truth and violence (\\"lying is the mother of violence\\"), dissent, the \\"death of God,\\" war, racial strife, as well as the thought of diverse authors including Camus, Bonhoeffer, and de Chardin. Here are excerpts from Merton's conjectures on our technological culture: \\"Our civilization is strictly servile. . . We are so obsessed with doing that we have no time and no imagination left for being. As a result, men are valued not for what they are but for what they do or what they have -- for their usefulness. When man is reduced to his function he is placed in a servile, alienated condition. He exists for someone else or even worse for some thing else. Hence he cannot enjoy life.\\" Do yourself a favor. Hang out with Thomas Merton."},{"Title":"Conjectures of a guilty bystander","review":"These thoughts in passing by Thomas Merton provide both a reminder of how things were back when they were written and how much and how little some things have changed. not at all what I expected from Merton."},{"Title":"Conjectures of a guilty bystander","review":"I bought this for someone. It is my understanding that this book is typically Merton as it is very \\"deep\\" in content."},{"Title":"Conjectures of a guilty bystander","review":"Outstanding perspective of contemporary issues and offers some explanation as to why the human condition is full of strife."},{"Title":"Conjectures of a guilty bystander","review":"This book is a series of reflections on and examinations of topics ranging from the flora and fauna of Kentucky to studies of grammar by Cassiodorus. This is a later work of Merton's, and what comes across more than anything is his all too human moodiness. At times he seems to despair of the human condition. But then a tremendous hope wells up in him as he sees Christianity reaching out in brotherhood to all men of all faiths and non-faiths. But regardless of his attitude, Merton, as always, maintains the highest standards for fidelity to one's self and to God. His rather caustic critiques of Western culture seem more true today than when he wrote them in the 1960's, as he exposes the moral rationalizations and spiritual hollowness that necessarily accompany a mass culture devoted to materialism and pragmatism. His understanding of the human condition is so clear and so true and so universal, that his writing seems to be speaking to each of us alone, much as a parent might speak to his child. And like a child, our first reaction to his challenging words might be resentment or denial, but in the end, if we reflect and examine, we begin to see his truth-that is, his pointing us to God. I imagine one of Merton's hopes in this book is to move us beyond words and arguments so we might dispense with temporal intellectual distractions and concentrate on what counts-personal salvation."},{"Title":"Conjectures of a guilty bystander","review":"CONJECTURES OF A GUILTY BYSTANDER is the second collection of brief reflections by Thomas Merton, a book which he called in his Preface \\"a personal vision of the world in the 1960s\\". The format of these reflections is quite reminiscent of the modern weblog, so consistency should not be expected. Some are evocative and interesting. Others are intensely personal and opaque, such as one that says only, \\"Every time Kennedy sneezes or blows his nose, an article is read about it in the refectory.\\"Some of this book is quaint and linked too much to the time of its writing. Merton's writes nearly vitriolic reflection on communism but does not foresee the rise of liberation theology in his own church. However, there are many other portions where the author moves beyond the context of his time. Merton's reflections on race-relations, for example, are unusually compassionate for a writer of his time, for he believes that African-Americans are blessed by God, who was bringing them in freedom from exile, slavery, and oppression like the Hebrews.When I was younger and full of idealistic fire, having just left the Navy as a conscientious objector, I couldn't understand Merton. Here was a man who was full of zeal for the gospel, but who turned away from the community for a hermitage in rural Kentucky. From CONJECTURES, however, I can better appreciate this writer. Though he was alone, he has made a considerable contribution to society through books like these. Merton essentially wishes to make people live more authentically, to always be more conscious of Christ's social teaching and reject the false values of the world. Merton may have been a recluse, but if more people out and about in society read his writings, then the world would be a better place. For example, though Merton is not one to overtly recommend political engagement, he often calls the American reader to consider that his nation has strayed from the values on which they were founded and needs righting.If you have never read Merton before, I'd recommend starting with THE SEVEN-STOREY MOUNTAIN, the story of his youth, conversion, and entry to a Trappist monastery, a book which occasionally rises to true greatness and might be a modern-day CONFESSIONS of Saint Augustine (well, almost). CONJECTURES is an excellent book for those interested in Merton who want to know better his social ideas."},{"Title":"Conjectures of a guilty bystander","review":"Conjectures of a Guilty Bystander is Thomas Merton's response to the terror of the world around him, the world he had been raised into, and the world he sought to leave behind as a monk in the back corners of Kentucky. It is a collection of thoughts which had been developing in him from the very beginning of his life. He came to monastic life to retreat from the world. He came to find quiet. And yet he remained more connected to the outside world than most people within that world, and certainly more than anyone behind his monastic walls, even as he wrote and compiled Conjectures itself from his secluded hermitage.This book is his reaction against the violent century which he was born into and which was born into him. He speaks against issues including such things as the true nature of the monastic relationship with the world (he calls \\"separation from the world\\" an illusion); unity/ecumenism; war & violence; false \\"truths\\" (particularly what he calls the American myth); technology versus nature, etc.He calls himself a \\"bystander\\" relating to his aloofness as a monk. He calls himself \\"guilty\\" in relation to not living up to his responsibility for the outside world. As a monk, he calls himself a contemplative activist. As a collection of \\"conjectures,\\" it is a compilation of thoughts or pensees grouped together loosely, only slightly tied together by five section titles. Because of this format it is not the easiest thing to read; it is helpful to read topically (a good guide for this can be found in Something of a Rebel by William Shannon). But I would say the experience is worth it. The book is deeply moving and convicting. Merton stands out as an authoritative voice on how Christians, all people in fact, should be aware of the world around them, while they also should not neglect the contemplative life that feeds their love for that world.There is a short observation Merton gives us in his Conjectures as he witnesses the way of the world around him:\\"This morning, before Prime, in the early morning sky, three antiquated monoplanes flew over the monastery with much noise followed by a great heron.\\" (15)Commenting on this thought, Thomas Moore writes in his introduction to Conjectures:\\"Many antiquated machines have come and gone in the time since Merton wrote these lines, an explosion of technology giving the illusion of progress, while Merton himself continues to fly, pulling up the rear, a great silent heron reminding us that the noisy are not necessarily the knowledgeable.\\" (v)"},{"Title":"Conjectures of a guilty bystander","review":"If you are new to Thomas Merton, do not read this book first. There is lots of great writing in this book, but it is not an easy read. Almost everything here is excerpts from his journals or notebooks. Thus much of the material is unpolished and undeveloped. Rarely does the author stay on a single topic for more than four or five pages, and the new topic is frequently completely different.Nevertheless, Merton's brilliance does occasionally burst forth. A great example is \\"In Louisville, at the corner of Fourth and Walnut, in the center of the shopping district, I was suddenly overwhelmed with the realization that I loved all those people, that they were mine and I theirs, that we could not be alien to one another even though we were total strangers....\\" which goes on for two pages, and is one of the finest descriptions of a mystical experience ever put down on paper. Because of passages such as this, I will never give up my personal copy of this book! The good writing is wonderful and, as a Merton fan for more than 20 years, I would not want to be without any of it. Yet, the best writing is mixed with other more ordinary, often repetitive, material. Probably because the book is not particularly well organized, there is no table of contents (although there is an index).I read this book from cover to cover, rarely reading more than five or six pages during a sitting. It took me about six weeks. I recommend reading it the same way, cover to cover, so that none of the good material is missed. The book is best for people who have read other books by Thomas Merton. I recommend reading THE SEVEN STOREY MOUNTAIN, or NEW SEEDS OF CONTEMPLATION, or NO MAN IS AN ISLAND, or all three, or several others, before reading CONJECTURES.One benefit of the unpolished nature of this material is that it allows the reader to begin to understand Merton as a person. So, after you read this book, if you really like it, you might proceed to read his journals and letters if you really want to understand this fascinating monk."},{"Title":"Conjectures of a guilty bystander","review":"Thomas Merton was a troubadour of contemplative life from America's Gesthemane Abbey. His books, including the famous autobiography 'Seven Storey Mountain' have made him one of the greatest spiritual writers from America. While this reviewer has read nearly a dozen of his sage works, 'Conjectures of a Guilty Bystander' is among his most colorful and engaging. Journal-like in its presentation and conception, Merton reflects upon the headlines of the Black Movement, Kennedy's assassination, and the Cuban Missile crisis with great depth and insight. The wisdom he provides doesn't date the topics he covers. 'Conjectures' would be fine as a historical document, but his commentary provides more than an antidote for history repeating itself. There are also trappings--no pun intended--of his little anecdotes of the monk's life. His observations of new candidates and the liturgical calendar hold simple truths that we can embrace with the variety of seasons.I would hope every Catholic, and every non-Catholic, would embrace this book. It straddles the value of Eastern spirituality and widens the scope of Catholic experience. While many conservatives embrace G.K. Chesterton and Peter Kreeft as beacons of light and truth, Thomas Merton expands the scope and splendour of that truth without contradiction. Personally, I loved the part where Merton talked about medeival \\"Passion\\" plays demonizing Jews. He railed against the practice, and I read it just when the controversy about 'Passion of the Christ' was brewing, just before its release. I could see why there was so much trepidation after reading his historical perspective."},{"Title":"Conjectures of a guilty bystander","review":"This book is terrific for the advanced reader and who has read Merton before. These are a compilation of his notes, which means he's rambling ALL over the place. I found that I could only read a few notes at a time. I had to reflect during or at the end of each. They don't all resonate all the time, and some will be taken aback by Merton's views on U.S. military adventures of his day. Clearly, his comments are as pertinent today as ever."},{"Title":"Conjectures of a guilty bystander","review":"This is a collection of Merton's later writing and reflects a tolerance and recognition of other religious traditions that was lacking in his famous autobiographical work, the \\"Seven Story Mountain\\". This is Merton in his mature years, reflective yet critical and thankfully, less dense than some of his earlier writing. His commentary on the personalities and events of his day means that the work has an inevitably dated feel. But the perennial wisdom of the author guarantees a point of view that mainly transcends the issue of time. An essential work I would suggest, for any follower of the Merton canon."},{"Title":"Conjectures of a guilty bystander","review":"Father Thomas Merton's (1915-1968) book CONJECTURES OF A GUILTY BYSTANDER was published in 1965 and is as timely now as when it was first published 45 years ago. Merton's book reflects serious thinking re the contemplative religious life, the false facade of our \\"civilization,\\" the defiant refusal to think critically, and what Bonhoffer (1906-1945) called \\"cheap grace.\\"Merton began this book with thoughts re the Protestant clergyman Karl Barth (1886-1968) who recognized that sudden decline of manners, distortion of religious convictions, etc. Merton was clear that as Catholic and a Trappist Monk, he did not completely agree with Barth, but he thought Barth's concerns were serious and thoughtful. Merton, as readers may know, was also impressed with Buddhism and the work of D.T. Suziki (1870-1966). Merton was NOT a Buddhist, but he found \\"food for thought\\" in the work of the Buddhists and some Protestants. This may be akin to the comment made by St. Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) who argued that truth is wherever honest men it.As stated above Merton was a contemplative Trappist Monk. He DID NOT condemn the contemplative religious life, but he wrote some thoughtul criticisms. He agree that those who are Catholic religious should adhere to the rule of their order. However, he wrote that too many rules can make the contemplative religious life sterile and useless. He wrote about what some of the Buddhists call compassionate detatchment which Merton thought could turn into callousness. Metion suggested a careful balance.Merton not only wrote about the Catholic cloistered life, he also had serious concern about the secular world of which he had little respect. Merton said that due to the worship of greed and unreasoned violence, one could not distingush \\"Christians\\" from atheists. Greed and materialism have destroyed serious religious convictions and values. Among the distortions that Merton noticed were the shallow views of God and political power. Merton wisely wrote that political power is transitory while God is permanent. Merton also noticed the obvious that political labels attached to religion undermined the true meaning of religion.Merton remarked that Americans were ruled by predjudice,weakness, clever but false political slogans, etc which enslave men and women. On the other hand,Ghandi and St. Francis of Assisi (1180-1226) were among the freest men in history. Basically, Merton thught men sold their souls to avoid facing truth and to evade honesty.One of the reasons that Merton gave for the shabbiness of contempoary \\"civilaztion\\" was that men have been trapped by the corruption of language and have marginalized and condemned such virtues such as compassion, mercy, thoughtfulness, etc. Men prefer violence and hypocrisy to shield themselves from uncomfortable truth. Merton DID NOT argue that freedom was perfect and was honest enough to admit that freedom has limits. He warned his readers not to be placated by illusions which can mean being manipulated by those with political power and wealth. One of the \\"traps\\" used by political hucksters is the cliam that God is here with them and not there among other nations and those who are \\"different.\\" As an aside Merton was obviously Catholic, and Catholic menas universal-not national or local.Merton had harsh condemnation of contemporty society. He saw urban culture as one of useless \\"progress\\" and war. Merton warned readers that preoccupation with technology, war, etc. was an attack on God's Creation-nature. Merton rhetorically asked that if nature can be cruel, is nature as cruel as men. Merton cited the Psalms with their praise of God's Creation or nature. Basically, Merton thught that men and women have become so shallow that they are bored with God's Creation and have become intellectually and spiritually dead. Marton had no repsect for the Marxists. He condemned the Marxists because they hated men for what they supposedly are not what they ought to be. Merton had high regard for Sacred Music, and complimented Johh Nenry Cardinal Newman (1801-1890) for his appreciation of Sacred Music which is not only an escape from foolishness but is \\"uplifting\\" in praise of God.As might be expected, Merton condemned the Cold War and had some amusing comments about it. When folks were installing bomb shelters, the stupid mentality that after a nuclear war, folks would emerge from their bomb shelters to renew \\"The American Way of Life.\\" Merton considered the series of Berlin Crises as more sport rather than serious diplomatic issues. Men were too easily fooled by phony crises which Orwell (1903-1950) warned against in his book 1984.Merton dealt with Catholic Theology as well as contempoary secular \\"culture.\\" Merton had good material re St. Thomas Aquinas. Merton thought that Aquinas used philosophy and theology to open the world to men as God's Creation to be explored and enjoyed. Aquinas knew that his thinking was radical during his lifetime,but Aquinas thought his work was too important to be avoided. Aquinas and his mentor St. Albertus Magnes (1193-1280) appreciated the work of Aristotle (384-322 BC), but they NEVER made a cult of Aristotle's work. Merton critisized some to the Thomists for again closing the world by cliaming that Aquinas \\"was the last word\\"-a claim that Aquinas would have shunned.Again, Merton DID NOT condemn the Catholic contemplative religious life. When secular critics argued that the cloistered religious life was not productive, Merton responded that those who made that claim approved of nuclear weapons and possibly the detruction of God's Creation and life itself. Such contradictory thinking was/is due the lack of respect for God, His Creation, etc. As Merton so aptly described men, they have become \\"human grasshoppers.\\" Another amusing anecdtote that Merton made was whether men worship God or do they want God to bless nuclear weapons which would destroy God's Creation. In other words, war is an insult to God.Merton was also critical of those who were obsessed about \\"saving their soul.\\" Merton thought such concern would lead to inaction, apathy to problems, the denial of mercy and love, etc. Merton argued that God's power (whatever that is) was reflected in mercy, love, forgiveness, etc. Perhpas they late US Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendal Holmes described it best when he wrote, \\"Those who worry that their soul is damned generally speaking have a soul that is not worth a damn\\"As Merton noted too many people were/are impressed with ecnomic and political power. Merton noted St. Anselm's (1033-1107) remark that Christ refused power to save men and woman. Salvation, whatever that means, can be achieved by giving up power. Merton was concerned that what men should condemn are sin and evil. To attack others because they are\\"different\\" while not condemning evil and sin make men shallow and mean spirited.The undersigned enjoyed this book which took time to read. This writer knows that others are more knowledgeable about Merton's books and will accept constructive criticism. This is a book to be read and reread to be digested and enjoyed.James E. EgolfJuly 23, 2010"},{"Title":"Conjectures of a guilty bystander","review":"Organized somewhat haphazardly, Merton's reflections on his world on the 1960's demonstrate a slightly different writer than is seen in some of his other works. Apparent is a sense of moodiness and perhaps even frustration with modern man that permeates the writing. He seems to be very affected by the very Godlessness he is preaching against. Racial problems, communism, and war are among the themes that trouble Merton.Another aspect that sets this apart from his other works is a greater focus on Catholicism. For this reason, non-Catholics may feel a little disoriented at times. Even while he does this, the Protestant-Catholic comparisons are quite interesting. One need not even agree with them to appreciate the statements. One passage particularly caught my attention is on page 89, it which Merton seems acknowledge that the Catholic church may not be the sole correct version of Christianity in the world. It is a bold statement that may upset some readers. Merton was never afraid to rock the boat as he suggests himself to be somewhat progressive in his discussions about changes in the church.There are several other books I might recommend readers of Merton read before this book because the scope and sense of focus are random. Of course, \\"Thoughts in Solitude\\" and \\"The Seven Storey Mountain\\" are favorites of mine and much better starting choices. Still, this is an interesting read."},{"Title":"Conjectures of a guilty bystander","review":"this book which was published some 50 years ago is still deeply inspiring and a must read for both liberals and conservatives. the so-called liberals will be reminded that true freedom demands inner freedom in the first place.

It may be difficult to assimitate this essay without prior exposure to the two excurses of the \\"Dialectic\\".In addition, many of the excerpts from \\"Notes on Literature\\" and \\"Prisms\\" may be difficult to read without an understanding of the \\"Dialectic's\\" critique of the culture industry in light of the critique of enlightenment more generally.On a technical point, the cover and binding do not seem to be up to containing the 500 plus pages included in this paperback edition.In all, a reasonable addition to English-language Adorno studies and a good starting point for newcommers determined to penetrate Adorno's frequently daunting writing.

In this sense, every one of his poems is an expert translation--across continents, physical and otherwise.The book is dominated by two intense long sequences, one in which the poet accompanies his mother's body to back to Kashmir, and the closing sequence--dynamic!--in which, paralyzed by grief over his mother's death (and his own illness) Shahid communes with the departed spirit of James Merrill.Shahid was a magnificent poet, and a magnificent man.

Thanks, and I hope you find some enjoyable quotations (below) from Boswell's wonderful book, but first a little history.Samuel Johnson, the irascible but generous lexicographer of the eighteenth century, is mostly remembered because of Boswell, and Boswell is remembered because he wrote Johnson's biography.At the time, Johnson was already famous for his \\"Dictionary of the English Language,\\" an impressive work for the year 1755. Among many other writings, Johnson put out an edition of Shakespeare's works (1765), with valuable notes that are still referred to today.The following quotations are from Boswell's book:Johnson published a \\"series of grave and moral discourses\\" in the periodical called the Rambler, but when it was translated into Italian, it came out as the ludicrous \\"El Vagabondo,\\" something far from Johnson's pious intentions. And of good intentions, it was Johnson who said, \\"Sir, Hell is paved with good intentions.\\"\\"(Johnson's) defense of tea against Mr. Jonas Hanway's violent attack upon that elegant and popular beverage, shows how very well a man of genius can write upon the slightest subject, when he writes, as the Italians say, con amore.\\"Johnson despised Americans and was prejudiced against Scotland. He said, \\"Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel.\\"Johnson was a male chauvinist. Yet, he was \\"a king of men.\\" He was a \\"robust genius, born to grapple with whole libraries,\\" and although \\"indolence and procrastination were inherent in his constitution, whenever he made an exertion he did more than any one else.\\"As a person who is afraid of death in the normal sense, I was surprised that in spite of being very religious, Johnson had an extreme fear of death. \\"'The better a man is, the more afraid he is of death, having a clearer view of infinite purity.' Said Boswell, \\"Johnson owned, that our being in an unhappy uncertainty as to our salvation, was mysterious; and said, 'Ah! We must wait till we are in another state of being, to have many things explained to us.' Even the powerful mind of Johnson seemed foiled by futurity.\\"Boswell's commentary brings to mind a story told by St. Augustine in his monumental City of God. A philosopher was abroad a ship captained by a bad man, and after a violent storm, the fearless captain jeered the philosopher for his terror. Said the philosopher, quoting from a similar incident that occurred to the pagan Aristippus, 'A rogue need not worry about losing his worthless life, but Aristippus has a duty to care for a life like his.\\"\\"Johnson knew more books than any man alive. He had a peculiar facility in seizing at once what was valuable in any book, without submitting to the labour of perusing it from beginning to end.\\" But he also held that it was important to \\"read diligently the great book of mankind.\\"\\"Why, Sir, I am a man of the world. I live in the world, and I take, in some degree, the color of the world as it moves along.\\"Johnson was also the one who said, \\"When a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully.\\"\\"I love Blair's Sermons,\\" Johnson said. \\"Though the dog is a Scotchman, and a Presbyterian, and every thing that he should not be, I was the first to praise them.

Hamrick's \\"Deceiving the Deceivers.\\" It is not as if his thesis is not provocative: that SIS, Britain's Secret Intelligence Service, in anticipation, laid a trap for Burgess, Maclean, Philby, and Blunt. However, the author explores so many tangents that I found it difficult to grasp the central thread of his narrative.Certainly, the possibility that British Intelligence had set a trap for the Cambridge Spies is plausible. Such a scenario would explain why the sequence of events ceases to make any logical sense after the Volkov affair in 1945, when Kim Philby delays his arrival at Istanbul, to such an extent that the would-be Soviet defector, Konstantin Volkov, is apprehended by the Russians and--encased in bandages like a mummy--whisked off to Moscow and apparent oblivion. After this point, one is left with a series of anomalies: 1) Donald Maclean's unspeakable rampage in Cairo results (after a recuperative dose of psychoanalysis) in an appointment to the sensitive American Desk in the Foreign Office. 2) Guy Burgess, after running amok in Tangiers and blowing the cover of SIS officers left and right, is nevertheless appointed as third secretary to the British Embassy in Washington, arguably Britain's most important foreign post. 3) Burgess's drunken rumbustiousness in Washington succeeds in embarrassing his host, Kim Philby--who has hitherto been regarded as a respected first secretary to the British Embassy--so much so that not only Burgess but also Philby is declared PNG and sent home to London ASAP. The upshot is the ruination of one of the NKVD's (KGB's) most valuable agents and the eventual downfall of the entire Cambridge ring. The question that is raised--and not addressed by Hamrick--is whether SIS might have \\"turned\\" Burgess with the express objective of bringing down his friend Philby (After all, Burgess, when the going got rough, was reportedly ready to negotiate a hit on another pal, Goronwy Rees, so presumably he would not be adverse to bringing down Philby, if it meant saving his own skin). Despite Burgess' famous espousal of E.M. Forster's maxim, \\"if I had a choice between betraying a friend and betraying my country, I hope that I would have the guts to betray my country,\\" Burgess could well have been promised an unimpeded escape with Maclean if he would embarrass Philby in Washington, which he certainly did. Of course, one will never know due to the British Official Secrets Act.One would, however, like to have a bit more solid evidence to support Mr. Hamrick's hypothesis. Furthermore, from all that one reads about SIS and its serial blundering, one wonders whether it would have been clever enough to have accomplished such a coup (especially when it continued to employ Philby as an agent in the Mid-East until 1963, when he defected to Moscow). Nevertheless, the Cambridge Spies were brought down (Anthony Blunt was being questioned in 1964, the year after Burgess died and Philby defected, and eventually John Cairncross was revealed to be a Soviet agent).Hamrick certainly raises some of the important questions, even though he does not--and likely cannot--provide the answers."},{"Title":"Deceiving the Deceivers: Kim Philby, Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess","review":"S.J. Hamrick's study of an associated trio among the most infamous British 20th Century spies is a major step forward in Cold War history. He starts what may become the cracking of the myth surrounding Harold A. R. (Kim) Philby, the Soviet agent many blame for failures of several paramilitary operations the West mounted within the Soviet empire. Unfortunately, Hamrick offers little hard evidence to back up his attack on this outsized mythical spy.But the author is also able to turn that lack of evidence into the basis of his assault on Philby's storification. Much of the Philby legend was created by the subject spy himself in his book, \\"My Secret War\\". In the mid-1980s, British journalist Lord Nicholas Bethell added to the Philby legend by giving the Cambridge University-educated double agent credit as the main reason a British-American paramilitary operation in Albania failed. Bethell offered little or no evidence besides Philby's book, some comments from retired intelligence officers, and lots of airy speculation that Philby must have been to blame. Hamrick correctly offers a timeline that shows how unlikely that Bethell's thesis was accurate.\\"It is impossible to believe Philby had the means for any timely disclosure of OPC (a U.S. psychological warfare agency overseen by the CIA, State Department and military) individual operational plans or that he would even have found it necessary,\\" he wrote. Hamrick echos other observers and participants - British and American - who view the Albanian projects as carrying the weight of their own ultimate failure in the \\"futility of their numbers and purpose\\". There were too few bravely enthusiastic, but naive, Albanian mountaineers sent home by air, land and sea to overthrow a nasty Communist regime whose internal security forces were trained by the Soviet NKVD.Two storm flags must be raised about the Hamrick work. One is the theory he postulates that the U.S. and British militaries used Philby as a conduit to pass disinformation to the Soviets. Thin evidence is the problem. The second is Hamrick's apparent failure to consult several works that contained major materiel germane to the Philby-Albania case, such as those by Burton Hersh, C.L. Sulzberger, Noel Malcolm and Enver Hoxha. He writes about the oft-criticized CIA counterspy James J. Angleton and the Office of Special Operations, a CIA branch that competed with the OPC for foreign agents and resources. But he also misses the most successful Western infiltration of Albania by agents sponsored by the CIA/OSO and Italian Naval Intelligence."},{"Title":"Deceiving the Deceivers: Kim Philby, Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess","review":"Good material and critical thinking, poorly arranged. The author has one basic point, which he reiterates in each chapter as either conclusion or thesis (sometimes both). And that point is, the British security services succeeded brilliantly for a half-century in misleading the public about the Burgess-Maclean-Philby case. To break it down to its most salient arguments:1) Burgess and Maclean did not \\"jump\\" when they took that night boat to St-Malo in May 1951. They were \\"pushed\\"--by MI5. MI5 had been watching them for years, playing with Maclean as a cat plays with a mouse, delaying overt investigation while gradually inciting a sense of panic throughout the spy ring.2) Kim Philby was neither head boy nor master spy. He was a bibulous blowhard, a second-rater whose utility to the Soviets expired long before 1951. When he was stationed at the embassy in Washington, DC in 1949-51, he did not even have a regular Soviet contact. (When he finally ended up in Moscow, the KGB had no use for him: he was under constant surveillance and suspicion.) Philby was mainly useful to the British security services, first as a useful fool whose contacts could be monitored, later as a straw-man who could be portrayed as a sort of Prof. Moriarty of espionage, thereby allowing the security services to hide how they much they actually knew about the Soviet apparatus.The arguments are based on the author's review of the so-called Venona transcripts, decryptions and counterintelligence documents that accumulated in the American security services from the 1940s and 50s. This book serves as a sort of bibliographic introduction to what can be pulled out of those files, but it is itself too confused and sprawling to be the final word itself. The thing is just difficult to read. It needed an editor and proofreader, to give it clarity and shape, and to catch the author's more obvious errors. At least twice Hamrick speaks of Heath being Prime Minister in 1963, and I can't tell whether he really means Macmillan or Lord Home, or means minister Heath in the cabinet."},{"Title":"Deceiving the Deceivers: Kim Philby, Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess","review":"The provocative ideas in this book have been cogently analyzed by other excellent reviewers. Here, I will add to the complaint that Hamrick's argument is extremely disorganized. Hamrick's rambling narrative should have been better reined in by the editors at Yale University Press. As a result of discursive and mostly scattered narrative, reading this book was as enjoyable as trying to run 10 miles after a full meal. Only the book's intriguing thesis saves this book from a one star review."},{"Title":"Deceiving the Deceivers: Kim Philby, Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess","review":"I like a James Bond spy thriller replete with the latest technology as well as the next guy. Le Carre's Cold War-inspired George Smiley series. Even better. So when I expected to get the real \`scoop' on the actions of the Kim Philby-led Ring of Five in England that performed heroic spy service for the Soviet Union I found instead mostly skimpy historical conjecture by Mr. Hamrick. The central premise of his book that the Ring of Five was led by the rings in their noses by Western intelligence made me long for one of Mr. le Carre's books. Apparently the only virtue of the opening of Cold War archives has been not to bring some clarity about the period but to create a cottage industry of conjecture and coincidence that rival the Lee Harvey Oswald industry. Interestingly, the New York Review of Books (April 26, 2007) in its review of Mr. Hamrick's book brought in the big guns. The review by Phillip Knightley, who actually has done some heavy work sorting out the Philby case, politely, too politely, dismisses the claims as so much smoke. No disagreement there from these quarters."},{"Title":"Deceiving the Deceivers: Kim Philby, Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess","review":"If the British Intelligence had indeed set a trap for the Cambridge Spies, then the deceiving plan was poorly managed that eventually led to disasters.It is highly unlikely that Philby would be promoted to such a high position to post at Washington DC as a liaison between SIS (MI6), CIA and FBI had his true identity as a Soviet agent been exposed to the MI5. The success of such a bold counter-intelligence plan need at least(1) a highly motivated and efficient British security service. MI5's inexcusable incompetence in the Klaus Fuchs' investigation during the same time period showed the exact contrary,(2) complicated and delicate co-operations among the three giants which unfortunately history has proved non-existence even between CIA and FBI in 1950s.The reality is cryptically simple, Philby compromised many of the three agencies' intelligence or counter-intelligence operations whether domestic or international, Albanian Operation for example, and possibly the sensitive Venona Secrets. Philby successfully deceived the three powerful giants, not the other way as the author expected. Even worse, Philby involuntarily created a long-term mistrust between American and British intelligence communities.This book has unusually larger amount of comments and imaginations than necessary supporting facts."},{"Title":"Deceiving the Deceivers: Kim Philby, Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess","review":"Not far enough along to provide a review at this time - check back later in December when I hope to have completed the book."},{"Title":"Deceiving the Deceivers: Kim Philby, Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess","review":"This was a long slow read.

It contains the kind of revelations about the \\"Cambridge Threesome\\" (Kim Philby, Donald Mclean, and Guy Burgess) that simply makes for irresistible reading.The story is about how the three infamous spies hoodwinked British intelligence for the better part of three decades, and how once they defected to Moscow, British authorities, in an embarrassing tizzy, were then forced to cover-up the magnitude of their treachery.At least that is the version we always thought was the final truth. However, the author drawing on recently released documents in the U.S. and Russian archives, (supplemented by a trickle released by the UK) comes to a very different conclusion. Basing his argument primarily on the above sources, the author exposes a number of contradictions that have, over the years, effectively debunked MI5's claim that British Intelligence had identified Mclean as a Soviet agent only as late as in the spring of 1951. It turns out that this was not the truth after all, but part of an elaborate cover-up that was both designed to \\"save face\\" for MI5 and involved a counter-deception disinformation operation against the threesome by MI5.Not only did British intelligence know about the treachery of Mclean (and then very quickly afterwards of the other two) far earlier than 1951, but also - and this was the crowning revelation in the book -- concealed this knowledge so as to use it as part of a counterespionage operation in which both Philby and Burgess were deceived into transmitting disinformation back to their Russian handlers.On the U.S. side, the reader will discover about as detailed an examination of the Venona files as has ever been carried out - one that is used here mostly to expose the long-standing UK cover-up. The period of most concern is that from 1947 to 1951, when, decoding of Soviet cables through the Venona Project first revealed the treachery of Mclean, whose code-named was \\"homer.\\" Cables on Winston Churchill (going between London to Moscow, via New York) were among the first to be decoded and flagged due to their alarming nature. It was an elementary exercise in logic to \\"zero-in\\" on Mclean as the perpetrator. Once Mclean was fingered, Philby and Burgess were used for the disinformation operation, and later apparently even allowed to defect unmolested.In a way, this bit of counter-deception was the coup de grace and the final insult to the reputation of the infamous threesome. But it was especially a bitter pill forever tarnishing the bloated, almost mythical reputation of Kim Philby, the most infamous of the threesome.The book goes into great detail about Philby's mental and physical deterioration in his wanning years. Under virtual house arrest for most of those years, Philby had nothing to hold on to but his bloated reputation as the world's greatest spy. In perhaps the greatest irony of all, once in Moscow, Philby was distrusted by his KGB handlers -- most probably due to the KGB's discovery that Philby's \\"takes\\" were (unwittingly) tainted disinformation. Quite a read. Three stars"},{"Title":"Deceiving the Deceivers: Kim Philby, Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess","review":"I'm giving this book two stars for the general reader and four stars for people with a great interest and understanding of the subject of Allied intelligence in the late 1930s and the 1940s.Overall, an extremely complicated and at times disappointing book. The complicated part is that the author explores hundreds of data points in extreme detail but also seemingly without a roadmap which would have helped the reader put the pieces together.A disappointing part is that the author seems to make little use of the KGB archives which were also available at the time the book was written. Instead its focus is nearly entirely on a few cables partially decrypted by Venona and included as part of the 1995-1996 public release of Venona decrypted traffic by the NSA.The book is a combination of scholarly research (the footnotes take 41 pages plus an 11 page index) and seemingly unfounded speculation. I found myself asking over and over \\"how did he know that?\\", \\"what's the source?\\" You'd think the author was sitting inside the minds of many players to the drama as reactions and thoughts are told from their point of view. This also made the book more interesting to read.At times I felt I was reading a conspiracy theory tract because while the author used a hypothesis followed by evidence format I got the impression that the author was selective, perhaps unintentionally, in what evidence he included plus how it was arranged and presented. Things were often too neat. Another bothersome aspect is the author's seemingly willingness to be critical of other authors. Large sections are spent shredding the arguments/premise of others while never crediting them for direct hits scored.The book has several redeeming features. 1) It shows how extraordinarily complex the maze of mirrors are in the intelligence world and in that sense the title is apt. 2) It appears to punch holes in the officially approved, and largely accepted, time line of when British intelligence may have known when Donald Maclean was a spy and that Maclean may well have been used for disinformation. 3) It shows that much of the mythology surrounding Kim Philby may be exactly that - mythology. 4) It's hinted, but never stated, that American intelligence agencies should have full cause to be upset at some of the British deception and disinformation campaigns as the Americans were presented as being at times unknowing pawns rather than peers in the battle against the Soviets.One bit of new news to me but maybe old news to people interested in the subject is the author's analysis of the early disarray of the CIA, how functions were split among various buildings and campuses, and the resulting internal disorder.To really \\"get\\" this book a reader would need to take their own notes and also to have a good understanding of the background story. There just too much information presented that needs to be sorted, filed, and prioritized for the casual, or even somewhat interested, reader to make sense of the book. This book should be of great value to people with an extreme interest in the subject because there is so much information that could be mined to help researchers locate and possibly fit more pieces into the puzzle."},{"Title":"Deceiving the Deceivers: Kim Philby, Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess","review":"First off, I would have to agree with a couple of the other reviewers. This book was not very well organised. On the whole, I thought the author might have made a more convincing case if he had organised his material in a more stream-lined manner, and not keep being diverted by a thread of discussion, shooting off to tangent that did not seem to ever come back to the main discussion.However, I must also say that the author made a rather compelling case. On closer examination, there does seem to be many curious and inexplicable aspects of the careers of the Cambridge spy rings. Not least of which was the fact that Kim Philby seemed to have been promoted at least twice to senior positions, despite not having done much to prove himself, not having run field operations or even having successfully pulled off any intelligence coup. This was often explained half-heartedly as being because of the 'old boys network' or the 'old school tie', yet a gaping hole remains, particularly if we consider that Philby was in fairly minor jobs in MI6 before his sudden elevation in 1944, just after VENONA produced results.The other inexplicable part of the Philby story was his tenure as MI6 liaison to the CIA in 1948. Yet, in spite of minor successes, the Soviets remained remarkably ill-informed about truly important strategic issues that Philby ought to have been in a position to inform them about. Of particular importance was the number of atomic bombs the US actually had and the deployment of B-29 to the UK. Of equal importance was the anticipated response of the west to the Berlin Blockade. To put it simply, the Soviets miscalculated on those issues.A third inexplicable part of the story was how Burgess and Maclean in 1951, and then Philby in 1963 managed to slip the close survillance of MI5 and other intelligence services, in spite of the proven track record of those agencies. The net just suddenly seemed to open to allow the spies to escape. Again, this had never been satisfactorily explained.The author's theory at least had the advantage of giving explanation to these inexplicable episodes within a single framework.And if his account was true, it certainly would not have been unprecedented. The British, after all, ran one of the most sophisticated deception operation during WW2 in Operation Fortitude. And recent information had surfaced that the British intelligence services were not above sacrificing Dutch agents to deceive the German intellingece services in 'the English Game'.An operation as described by the author would be completely in character and within the proven competence of the British intelligence services.And as another reviewer had said, even if it were not true, it's a jolly good yarn!:)"},{"Title":"Deceiving the Deceivers: Kim Philby, Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess","review":"For those who would be interested, my review of this book was published by H-Diplo, H-Net Reviews (H-Diplo@h-net.msu.edu) in February 2005.

It seems like the author was more concerned about having written and published a book than putting out a quality product with new and progressive ideas. The purpose of a specialized book like this should be to DELVE deeply, while Ms. Chatman-Whitfield seems to give a cursory look at each chapter.

The authors conclude, \\"the global and European roles together are still clearly much less significant for London than its continuing role as a national centre.\\"London was Britain's largest single manufacturing centre, but since 1962 it has lost 1.6 million manufacturing jobs. Its unemployment has worsened recently.The authors attack Blair's approach to local government: \\"Within each local authority the proliferation of government ordained partnerships and specially focused programmes (by service, group and/or locality) is making a coordinated approach and \`joined up' governance harder than ever. ... our work has tended both to cast doubts on the efficacy of local programmes, and to underline the importance of a number of mainstream policy areas. ... Labour's pursuit of \`joined-up' action seems quite perversely to have brought ever more complex arrays of \`initiatives' which are short-term, unsustainable, uncoordinated and even contradictory. ... area-based approaches ... have been the staple of urban policy for the past 35 years, but rarely matched their promises with sustainable achievements. ... We are sceptical, however, about what has been achieved through the proliferation of health, education and other action zones.\\"Southwark, for example, has contracted out education and housing benefit administration, reducing its ability to coordinate policies. The council relies on private investment for regeneration, but most residents have not gained from the spectacular new South Bank. This kind of \`regeneration' is just like the old discredited \`trickle-down'.The authors propose national programmes for \\"improving the supply of low- and moderate-income housing - and conditions in the existing stock of social housing - in ways that prevent this stock from being subsequently \`captured' by other groups; improving public transport provision while restricting the costs of such travel, so as to enhance particularly the mobility of disadvantaged groups; and raising performance in those state schools at the bottom of current league tables ...\\""},{"Title":"Assessment of Cognitive Processes: The PASS Theory of Intelligence","review":"The PASS theory of intelligence brings together research from many places into a coherent theory.

There can be no doubt that Jenner's contribution was significant and should in no way be dismissed. In this regard, _The Eradication of Smallpox_ is a thorough examination of his life and influence. The work by other's to achieve the only instance of the complete eradication of a human infectious disease could, however, have been treated more fully._The Eradication of Smallpox_ is worth picking up if only for its discussion of Jenner's life, an important component of the history of smallpox.

This is the first of the \\"Graphic Classics\\" series I've come across, and I like the concept of harnessing a wide range of underground cartooning talent in the service of great literature of the past. This showcase for Bierce begins promisingly enough, with a well-written biographical introduction by S.T. Joshi, supported by a cartoony four pages about Bierce's legendary disappearance. This is followed by John Coulhart's lovely ten page adaptation of \\"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\\", a story widely read in American high schools.Alas, from here on, it's a much more mixed bag. A forgettably sketched five page adaptation of \\"The Race at Left Bower\\" is followed by six pages of entries from \\"The Devil's Dictionary\\" which are broken up with lame graphics from greeting card illustrator Leslie Murray. \\"An Imperfect Conflagration\\" is a great story, but Rich Geary's eleven pages of panels doesn't quite do it justice. Conversely, \\"The Stranger\\" is only a so-so story, but Mark Nelson's seven pages of stark, high-contrast art gives it some real atmosphere. Francesca Ghermandi brings a European sensibility to the grave robber story \\"One Summer Night\\", but it doesn't really work. \\"Moxon's Master\\" is the longest read, with some ten text-heavy pages with one or two inset illustrations per page. These are by Stanley Shaw, and while they're nice in a mid-'90s comic book style, there's not a whole lot in the text for him to work with.Next are a bunch of Bierce's \\"Fables\\"--29 spread out over 36 pages of wildly varying style and quality. These encompass artists from the US, Canada, England, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Australia. The best of these are probably those by Skip Williamson, Simon Gane, William Brown, and Lesley Reppeteaux. Following these are four more stories, including \\"The Boarded Window\\" and \\"The Hypnotist\\", neither of which are illustrated in a style I found compelling. \\"Oil of Dog\\" is a dark, dark story, with suitably gloomy and evocative art by Annie Owens. \\"Curried Cow\\" ends things on a bad note, with goofy cartoony panels by Milton Knight.On the whole, if you're interested in the work of Ambrose Bierce, you're better off thumbing through a copy of The Devil's Dictionary or picking up a volume of his complete short stories. Fan's of the graphic medium will find such a variety of art that something is bound to please, even if much else isn't."},{"Title":"Graphic Classics Volume 6: Ambrose Bierce (Graphic Classics (Eureka))","review":"Of all the Graphic Classics series that I have read, Ambrose Bierce is the author that I am least familiar with. I knew him as the author of \\"The Devil's Dictionary,\\" and I knew the story \\"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\\" although I did not know he was the author. In fact, I knew it mainly as an episode of \\"The Twilight Zone.\\" With this in mind, it was one of the most exciting volumes to explore, as I was discovering the author and his writings for the first time, through the Graphic Classics vehicle.First off, the very cool cover was definitely a lure for this lesser-known author. Satan sipping blood cocktails and going over the latest entries in his dictionary was just too good to pass up. Due to the short nature of Bierce's stories, there is a much wider variety of styles and interpretations inside the book. It is almost too much to take in one sitting, and I found myself reading a story here and there instead of straight through. With so much variation, not everything is going to please, but overall I was completely entertained by the author and the artists.This volume contains:\\"The Disappearance of Ambrose Bierce\\" - A nice biographical piece. Even more interesting as I knew nothing of the story and little of Ambrose Bierce himself.\\"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\\" - An excellent adaptation of his most-famous story, using what looks like computer graphics. Very shadowy and with a nice feel.\\"The Race at Left Bower\\" - A funny little bit, with amusing illustrations.\\"The Devil's Dictionary\\" - A selection of entries from the cynical author, juxtaposed with Leslie Murray's own cynical brand of humor. Very nicely done.\\"An Imperfect Conflagration\\" - Victorian horror illustrator Rick Geary handles this tale of a father-and-son thief team, murder and a fireproof cabinet. Exactly up Geary's alley.\\"The Stranger\\" - An old west ghost tale, fully illustrated in the style of 1950's Western comics. Chilling.\\"One Summer Night\\" - A grave robber's tale. Surrealistic illustrations add to the grim, short tale.\\"Moxon's Master\\"- Cautionary Sci Fi, a text-and-pictures piece with art-deco illustrations that look as if they came from a fashion magazine. Not my favorite tale over all.\\"Bierce's Fables\\" - The ultimate mixed bag. 29 stories by just as many different artists. Something to please, and something to annoy, everyone. Just the way Bierce would have liked it, I imagine.\\"The Boarded Window\\" - Gahan Wilson handles this odd tale of the dead and not dead. Almost like \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\" in a log cabin.\\"The Hypnotist\\" - An odd tale, with an odd artist. A good combination.\\"Oil of Dog\\" - One of my favorites. Great, gloomy illustrations perfectly compliment a disturbing tale of baby-killers and Oil Makers.\\"Curried Cow\\" - Not the food dish, curry, as I was expecting. A twist-ending funny story, with cartoonish illustrations by Milton Knight."},{"Title":"Graphic Classics Volume 6: Ambrose Bierce (Graphic Classics (Eureka))","review":"Graphic Classics is a rousing and impressive anthology of the illustrated stories by Ambrose Bierce, tales of war, satire, the occult, and more.

I missed the TV mini-series and picked this book up on a whim one day and couldn't set it down until I had finished.First of all, anyone who has ever attempted to trace their family tree knows just what a daunting task that can be. However, for a descendant of slaves, it is next to impossible. Perhaps that's what makes the story such a masterpiece.The harsh reality of slavery is never more evident than when we are living through the abduction of Kunte Kinte from his village. As he makes his voyage across the sea to an unkown land, we are held together only by the fact that we know he has to live, if only because this book is about him.The Murray family's story is one that is truly telling of many of the slave owners at that time. Their attempts to balance their religious beliefs with their ownership of other human beings was something that apparently many at that time dealt with. Despite their kindness; however, one had to wonder if they dealt with that struggle by still not truly seeing their slaves as true humans.Like many, I think the character \\"Tom\\" represents the American spirit. His ability to realize that he was beholden to no man, white or black, and his courage in taking a stand depicts the beliefs that eventually led to the Civil Rights movement.\\"Roots\\" should be a must-read in any class on American history. I don't think I have ever read a book that was so honest in its depiction of America's great sin."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"the begning was a little tough for me, may be i was not perticularly interested in the life of a young man from Africa. but the story became very gripping once he gets captured and then, there was no way i could put the book down without finishing it. by the end of the book, i figured, i had missed out a lot by not focusing on the first few chapters. i wanted to know more about that young man who was Alex Haley's great great.... grand dad. so i reread them. that gave me a better perspective of why kunta kinte never became an american, and always remained 'african'. although other african americans arround him did not identify themself as 'african'.i highly recoment this book for all those who are curious about life in general.my father recomended this book, and i am very thankful to him for that"},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"This is one of those books that can change your life.

Roots proves that a great book can be written. Though I am an avid reader, it took me 30 years to finally find and read a book that I could yet qualify as the best, far exceding all others, satisfying all requirements. It is not only exceptionally well written and thoroughly engaging, but (and this is the previously missing ingredient) it holds incredible personal significance for the writer Alex Haley, and for millions of others living in America. This last element is what makes Roots something more than just a book; it touches you beyond measure and makes history come to life in a way that jolts you awake and forces tears of reality to your eyes. Alex Haley must have felt truly fulfilled after having written Roots."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"Having heard about this book for ages, I made it a mission to read this book for myself.

I was never particularly interested in black history or culture. I just picked up this book because I had nothing else to read. It turned out to be one of the most compelling books I have ever read and is probably my favorite all time book. It tracks a black man captured from africa through his life as a slave in the US and the lives of his decendents through the present. The book is very long, but it is entertaining, shocking and fascinating all at the same time. You will grow to love the characters, as they are so real. You really get the feeling that this must have been what it was like for black people back then. But at the same time, its not written as a white-bashing rant. Its just a matter of fact tale about the life of a slave family.

I wished I could expound the depth and aspect of this book, yet, it would be spoiling the surprise to the reader. It is with recommendations if all possible to find the original, in best to mint condition and KEEP IT!"},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"This book is, quite simply, an American classic and one of the most important pieces of literature form the 20th century. It's by no means a complex read, but the story is compelling and the narrative hooks are excellent.In fact, the book fully deserves five stars, but for two issues:1) It's now well known and documented that the book is fiction, and worse, lifted in large part from a previous book, \\"The African\\". To wit, Haley lost a $650,000,000.00 lawsuit because of it.2) The book is largely fiction. Inspired fiction, to be sure. If you read it first and then find that out later, its damaging, I believe, so if you go into with the perspective of it being a fictional novel its a much better experience.I was please to see, however, that the Forward touches on these enough that its no longer like they're hiding it.I didn't find the book divisive... to be sure, the toubob (whites) are by and large evil incarnate. Being Canadian (ie: from the -good- end of the underground railway) I was able to read it without guilt, which probably removed a lot of the defensiveness that prods others to harsh reactions to the book.I have the new 30th Anniversary Edition, and it has one huge problem: typos! There are more mis-spellings than this non-spell-checked review, and there's extra punctuation, missing punctuation, periods in the middle of sentences, random comma splices... its really distracting. I have no idea if this was for some reason retained from the original or if it was introduced in this new printing, but it's really bad. If you've sold a billion copies of a book, you can afford to have a college student go through the draft with a highlighter. Inexecusable.All that said, if you can (a) find a different printing that was proofed, (b) get over the plagiarism, (c) view it as historical fiction, and (d) not take it as your only historical reference for the people of European descent in the Americas, then this is something that everyone should read."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"What a masterpiece! Alex Haley should be redeemed as one of the top African-American writters of the century. When I read this book, I felt like I was in Africa with Kunta.

This book also inspired me to read &quot;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot; another great work. If your an African-American...reading this book will help you want to learn more about your culture, and if your not African-American I think you will probably also want to learn more about the African culture."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"The beginning and ending of \\"Roots\\" echoes the beginning and ending of the first book of the Bible. Genesis begins with the five words: \\"In the beginning God created.\\" Genesis ends with the five words: \\"In a coffin in Egypt.\\"\\"Roots\\" begins with a birth in Africa. It ends with a coffin in America.Both Genesis and \\"Roots\\" speak of slavery--the Israelites endured 400 years of enslavement in Egypt awaiting their Exodus. African Americans endured 250 years of enslavement in America awaiting their Exodus.In between this message of birth and death, Haley weaves a powerful story narrating the path traversed by many African American families in American history. Haley tells the tale of suffering and of survival. He exposes how a race of people gallantly moved beyond the suffering to a place of hope and freedom.This 30th anniversary edition is well-worth the read as it will hopefully entice a new generation to revisit and learn from the past.Reviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D. is the author of Beyond the Suffering: Embracing the Legacy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction ,Spiritual Friends: A Methodology of Soul Care And Spiritual Direction, and Soul Physicians."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"A triumph of the human spirit! I read this book with a growing ache in my heart at the savagery of history and those who struggled as helpless pawns within. Haley truly has written a masterpiece, with characters so alive you feel as if you bear silent witness, and scenes so poignant they bring tears to your eyes. This book seamlessly weaves together 200 years of history and opens the door to understanding Black America."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"Alex Haley's fascinating search for his own human roots is a reconstruction of a nearly superhuman struggle for survival and freedom.The magical evocation of a coming of age in Africa in the 18th century is brutally stopped by a barbarous capture by slave-traders. After the 'whipping' hardship of the transatlantic cross-over follow the harsh labour and living conditions on a cotton field workcamp: 'The life of a field hand was the life of a farm animal ... black people with destroyed minds acted like goats and monkeys.'All attempts to escape to freedom ('rather die a free man on the run than live out his life as a slave') fail.The inhuman selling of blacks by the white owners tears all black families apart ('work a thousand years for a white man you still any black').The struggle to amass enough capital to buy their families free becomes finally superfluous by the victory of the North over the South. The African generation survives till the present day (Alex Haley himself).The fate inflicted on the author's ancestors is part of 'all of history's incredible atrocities against fellowmen, which seems to be mankind's greatest flaw.'With Alex Haley, one can only wonder 'that it's possible to be civilized with one another without treating as human beings those whose blood, sweat and mother's milk made possible the life of privilege they had.' But, 'it is the way of the world that goodness is often repaid by badness.'With this profoundly human and deeply moving book, Alex Haley erected an eternal statue for the African American.A must read."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"Having read word by word, Roots, by Alex Haley, I am moved to tears at the history of a very real American family that had roots in a little African village, Juffure. The author is to be commended for his persistance at investigating, then exploring, and finally writing the history that had been passed down verbally through the family, as it had been since history began. I am amazed that the family had been able to preserve so much of that history by telling each successive generation, child by child, the story as they had been told.The story is very personalized, though historical, and I feel a very accurate view of what the slaves, individuals and families, lived through. A unique picture is given of the history of the United States of America through the telling of the story of her black, and of her white Southern families.Kunta Kinte is born into a family in a village in Africa. He grows up in the traditions of his village, being warned of the danger of disappearing if the slave traders should ever catch him alone. Kunta's one weakness is his daydreaming. His mind wandering as he goes out to cut wood to make a drum, one day Kunta is captured, chained, and thrown aboard a slave ship headed to America.The story continues through each generation, from Kunta to his beloved daughter Kizzy, with whom he shares the language of his beloved homeland - then to her son George, fathered by her white master. Then the story continues as George tells the stories to his children, and they to theirs, through seven generations.I feel every American would be enriched to read and know the history of this early American black family. Documented evidence is given by the author of the authenticity of the story. I would hope the history would continue to be told in their family, and that others of us would be more interested in exploring and sharing our families' inheritance in just the same way."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"The story focuses predominantly on the experiences of Kunta Kinte, an abducted slave brought to America. As a newly arrived African, he makes keen observations about the injustices of the slave trade as well as the hypocrisies of white \\"civilized\\" society. Although the slave masters try to control their slaves by erasing all traces of their ancestral identities, Kunta holds dearly to his African roots.The book loses a little steam when it moves on to the following generations of characters, perhaps because they seem complacent to their situation, and have retained so little of their fascinating cultural roots. The story, however, picks up again with dramatic force in the final chapters.This book will move you and infuriate you. It is such an important read because it brings the injustices of the slave trade to a personal level. It is also relatable for anyone who cherishes their cultural background."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"One of the books you must read in your lifetime. Yes, a good chunk of it is copied from \\"The African\\", and yes, much of the rest is just imagined fiction, but that doesn't take away from the reader's experience.For better or worse, the perspective is entirely through the eyes of the slaves themselves. Thus, other than a \\"token white character\\", everyone who is white is pretty much universally or categorically evil. I presume most are educated enough to remember there were good people at the -other- end of the underground railroad.The book is much more balanced (as an example, discussing black slave traders and so on) than the miniseries.Right up there with Shogun, and more relevant to our culture."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"I recently listened to the Roots audiobook - it is a fantastic audio narration, read by the actor Avery Brooks."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"I never saw the mini-series and don't want to. I finished the book about three days ago, having avoided it and the film since I'm not one to jump on the bandwagon and follow a trend. But this was one time I wish I had listened to everyone else, for I truly missed one of the great pieces of literature out there. ROOTS, along with TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD and Jackson McCrae's BARK OF THE DOGWOOD are some of my favorite books now and have a special place in my heart. The writing is excellent, the story will blow you away, and it seems as fresh (and disturbing) today--as if it were just written. I highly recommend this book to anyone with a heart and soul.Also recommended: TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD and BARK OF THE DOGWOOD"},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"This is a great, great book. My only problem is a kind of unevenness to the story. While the story spans 250 years, about half the book is spent covering only 50 of these. For the rest of the book, at times the story skims by, not developing characters as well as it did initially, and sometimes seeming somewhat shallow. Part of the story about Kunta's youth in Africa maybe be slightly overdone, and towards the end, it drags somewhat as multiple generations seem to fly by in only a few pages, so it's hard to connect with the people. To complain too much about this, however, is to miss the point. I saw the overall theme of the book as the gradual theft and loss of Kunta's initial African-ness over the generations, and in this aspect the book succeeds greatly. To me, the best part of the the book, by far, was between when Kunta lands in America and when the story shifts to his daughter. It is here where we see Kunta attempt to keep his identity alive, and truly want him to succeed, even though the outcome is almost inevitable. It's impossible not to feel good when reading about him teaching his daughter about Africa, or when the story is passed down. It's crushing when we see things destroyed - his daughter becomes the white girl's plaything, his wife only reluctantly allows him to carry on an african naming tradition, and immediately distrusts his seemingly insane ideas, and somehow the worst is when we see, two generations later, that slavery has become so ingrained, people can no longer even understand why someone would try to escape. Seeing the slaves' resistance decline is heartbreaking. In addition to seeing the African and American slave cultures combined in this part, I thought the end was fascinating, where the author describes the procedure he went through in starting and developing the story- one part in particular really shows the often underappreciated power of oral histories. It's a long book, but when you get through it, you'll be happy you read it."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"My name is Antonia Bain and I read this book inside of my Literature class.

Then, the tale that follows of seven generations that struggled for freedom is powerful, gripping. I found myself crying for all the hardships the family was forced to endure. The sad tale of family separation, whippings, and rape paints a vivid image of life for slaves. A terrific book; I am on my third reading of it."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"I loved the book! It was gret Alex Haley is the master. I cried with the characters in their time of sadness and rejoiced when they were happy! I would recomend this book to anyone.."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"Unfortunately, most people don't know that a lot of this book was lifted word for word from a book called \\"The African\\" by Harold Courlander. None of Haley's family history is correct prior to Reconstruction. Roots is non fiction taken from a book of fiction. Courlander sued Haley who settled with Courlander out of court (because he knew he would lose), but asked Courlander to stay quiet about the plagiarism. But once Courlander died, the word was put out how Roots and Alex Haley were a fake, but since now it's taught in schools as the truth no one wanted to rock the boat. Even the very liberal Village Voice acknowledged that Roots was fake but no one paid attention."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"This book made us proud of our family heritage. As good as the mini-series was, the book is twice as good. After many years hearing his family tree being past down, Mr. Haley went on a worldwide search for more of his past. I watched the mini-series in 1977 like most of America, but found I then needed to read the book. Just the passage from West Africa to America will break ones heart, if you have a heart to break. And that only taps the surface of the cruel realities of the slave trade, and the some 10 to 100 million souls that never survived the passage. If you want to see through the eyes of our African ancestors, whatever your ethnicity, then read this masterpiece from cover-to-cover. I guarantee your life will never see things in the same light again."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"this is an amazing,fabulous book!!it makes a very entertaining,unputdownable read.....fast paced and a blockbuster,it is a must for everyone to read.A very touching and well-written narrative."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"...even if the specifics of Haley's geneology aren't true. It's obvious while reading the book that Haley fictionalizes much of the account of Kunte Kinte's life in Africa, his journey to America, and his subsequent life as a slave, since--as Haley himself later makes clear--he couldn't possibly have had such detailed knowledge about these events.Roots is not really Kunte Kinte's story, but the story of countless unnamed slaves. And, perhaps even more importantly, it is the story of the indomitable human spirit, refusing to be crushed no matter what evil is visited upon it by others."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"I first heard about the book Roots by Alex Haley when my mom was talking to her sister about how great the television miniseries was. I had forgotten all about how great everyone said the book was until I was in my high school library one day and came across Roots. I was overjoyed and immediately rushed to the librarian to check out the book. It was a very lengthy book weighing in at 729 pages, but it was also a very fascinating book to read. I found it amazing that Alex Haley was able to make what you would think would be a boring subject, the history of Alex Haley's family, so interesting. My favorite part of the book is when Kunta Kinte is growing up in Africa. This is because I learned a lot about Kunta's tribe's traditions such as manhood training when all the boys of the Third Kafo or third generation were taught how to be men. My least favorite part of the book is when Kunta has been captured and is being transported aboard a slave ship to America. This is a very dull and disgusting part of the book because for about ten pages, Alex Haley describes the rocking of the boat and the human waste laying around were Kunta is chained down. In conclusion I would recommend this book to everyone because it is very interesting to learn of the struggles of an African American family over seven generations."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"Roots was an epic novel written by Alex Haley. This book was about Kinta Kinta, a black African sold into slavery in the United States. When he first arrives at his new home on a plantation in the south, he refuses to give up his African name, Kunta Kinti, for the American name of Toby. This was one of the most touching moments in the novel because he was so proud of his heritage. As his family grows he passes on his African heritage down the family line. His family overcomes many obstacles in America and end up settling in Tennesee."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"Alex Haley's monumental tribute to his forebears provides not only the perfect antidote for Blacks in a society that perpetually miseducates us about our ancestral homeland, but also an unblinking and unflinching view of slavery.This was the book that made Americans of all races and creeds care about this country's shameful past in a way that many never had before. The book points out the role of Arab slave traders in the problem, but it should be noted that under their auspices such problems stayed on African soil until the arrival of the toubob.Haley does a brilliant job of getting inside the heads, hearts and souls of his forbear, Kunta Kinte and his family, however fictional certain aspects of the story may be. He warmly and lovingly re-creates both the positive and negative aspects of life in the village of Juffure, The Gambia, detailing their family lives, educational system, religious life, and their complex system of government. We learn about griots, who are highly reminiscent of the wandering minstrels of Medieval Europe, who through their songs and stories, pass the history of their people from one generation to another.I could feel the hot,arid climate of that region from just reading!If people never read any other part of this epic saga, I would at least encourage them to read Chapter 24 in which Haley gives a brief but college-level education about the great kingdoms of West Africa, including Mali, the Kingdom where the world's first University was built in Timbuktu.More so than Europeans, Americans have a harder time accepting Africans as people of acheivement with a noteworthy history, even though they know that the earliest civilizations of man began on that continent, and that Africans have had thousands of years to figure out many things for which our culture does not give them credit.It was to the University of Timbuktu that Kunta Kinte had purportedly planned to travel when sometime in the summer of 1767, he was chopping wood to make a drum and was attacked by four men who killed his pet dog, knocked him unconscious, and after a demeaning process of being chained, shaved, and branded by his abductors, had him loaded aboard the Lord Ligonier, and shipped to America on a filthy and horrifying journey, where he touches terra firma again at the docks of Annapolis, Maryland on September 29, 1767.Every emotion Kunta must have felt as he lost control of his life, identity, name, and physical personage is registered. We feel his bewilderment, at dealing with his first view of an alien culture, Native Americans, innumerable degradations, first encounter with snow during one of four attempts to escape, and his pain when his foot is severed. His humbling discovery of his need for love is especially saddening.Kunta's overwhelming resentment at the docility of the other slaves is replaced with understanding of their survival tactics. He befriends a gardener and fiddler after being sold to a kinder master, and he meets Belle, several years his senior, whom he eventually marries, and has a daughter named Kizzy.Massa Waller's daughter, Missy Anne teaches Kizzy to read, and Kunta Kinte's life ends in the heartbreak of permanent separation from his daughter when the teenager writes an illegal pass for her sweetheart, Noah, and is sold from the Virginia plantation to a more sadistic master in North Carolina, who rapes her repeatedly and by whom she has her son, George.In the midst of their dehuminization, we learn how the slaves manage to sustain a culture, learn and discuss current events, to love each other and have honorable relationships, even though the auction block may part them forever, and to periodically assert themselves and settle scores with their oppressors.While reading this story, I was reminded of how professors have warned that whatever Europeans did to others for so long boomeranged in two world wars.The story follows the triumphs and tragedies of Chicken George and his descendants and finally ends with Alex Haley's emotional quest to trace his heritage and ascertain the truth about stories he was told in his boyhood.Ultimately, Haley compensates for his ancestors' losses merely by his presence at the dock at Annapolis on the 200th anniversary of his ancestor's disembarkment there.Whereas Kunta Kinte's abduction was lamented in 1767, two centuries later, in an underrated moment that is probably one of the most sacred in literary history, Haley visits Juffure and reconnects with those of his ancestral village who address him by his forebear's name.Happily, the circle is complete and the world made to care about events that claimed more lives than Hitler's Final Solution.Kunta Kinte's memory is honored with an annual festival in Annapolis, and every September 29th, a promising African American is given a scholarship in his name.Hence, the Gambian who had once hoped to study at the University of Timbuktu has his waylaid ambitions fulfilled through others. There could not be a more fitting tribute to his memory."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"The first 150 pages are rather slow but once you make it through that the book gets more interesting. Although the writing is not so good, the subject matter and story are stimulating. I had never thought much about slavery prior to reading the book and found the book thought provoking. Reading a book set from the perspective of the slaves really highlights their suffering and allows one to imagine how it would feel. I recommend this book for the subject matter rather than the writing quality."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"Dear, what a novel! It is positively brilliant!

However, Kizzy is put in jail for writing a fake pass for her loved one.My grandfather thought I should read this book, because he thought I would like it. When I first looked at it I didn't think I could read all of it and it would be boring. Then as I started reading the book I got more interested. I even stayed up late to finish the book.My favorite part is when Kunta is on the ship going to America. I felt so sad and couldn't believe someone would do such a thing.I felt so sorry for his mother and father. Also I would really recommend this book to others."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"One of my college friends who studied comparative literature in China wrote to me a few years ago, about how she was longing to visit Georgia one day, \\"The plantation, and the oak trees...\\". Gone with the wind is a classic and was well translated in many languages. The movie also brought countless publicity and I remembered that I read an article once how the book \\"corrected\\" the public perception of the south and the slavery.Well, that was my impression too, until I read Roots. Gone With The Wind is a story from Whites perspective with a focus on romance. I feel now it carried a heavy make up on the real south and the slavery. It eulogized the relationship between white masters and black slaves. Roots, on the other hand, describes the same south and the slavery, from Blacks perspective.Roots started from Kunta Kinte's life back in Africa, to stories of several generations in the South. I feel the African part was hard to read, maybe due to lack of interests personally. Once I got past that part, I was fascinated by the story and I was saddened many times by their struggles. I believe the book displayed a much more accurate picture on the slavery and on relationships between whites and blacks. It is more than a family's tale, it is history!I strongly recommend this book to everybody, especially to those who are interested into American History, to non-blacks, and to foreigners like myself. With Gone With The Wind overshadowed Roots in many other countries, this book offers a great education on American Slavery and on Black History. It shreds new lights on the origins of many current issues in the U.S. such as racism, racial profiling, and affirmative action. I rank this book the best book I've ever read, well, at least in English."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"Friends, if you haven't yet read this classic book, I strongly recommend you do so as soon as possible. Not only does Haley accurately trace his family's \\"roots\\" through generations back to the village of Juffure in Africa, but he also writes an interesting book which could stand on its own merit as an interesting read. The descriptions of slave life in the American south are so vivid, the reader feels as if he/she were feeling the pain and sorrow of the slaves. Will this book make you sad? Hopefully.

I thought the book perfect the first time I read it. I noted several flaws the second time, though. But no one had done a book like ROOTS before--it was truly revolutionary and started black and white people thinking about the barbarity of slavery and how difficult it was for black people to research their ancestors. Also, it taught how attitudes evolved over the generations. If Haley wrote the book today, it would be entirely a different work, so try to overlook the flaws. What Haley did was open people's eyes.

They were everywhere! I'm accustomed to a few throughout an entire book - certainly not a few per chapter, as I found in this edition.So, readers, know that, if you buy this edition of Roots, you're in for a truly marvelous story, one that I believe every American should read at least once in his or her lifetime...just also prepare yourself to grit your teeth at plentiful typos.Just a friendly warning!"},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"Did you ever feel nostalgic ? It is a very sweet emotion, isn't it ? On deeeper thought we discover that this emotion is not merely missing the people we have left behind. It is the loss of the place, it's sense, the sights all put together in which people are only one of the ingredients. Now imagine a person who could trace his ancestry back through seven generations to another continent and completely different culture and you can guess what kind of a book 'ROOTS' is.The journey begins in a tribal village in Africa called Juffure in 1750. The first part of the book is very endearing with a lifelike description of the tribal existance and how the main character of the book Kunta Kinte develops. Then disaster suddenly strikes. I won't tell you in what form because you will anticipate it even when you start reading. But let me just say this. There are not many books where you will feel compelled to enter the story to prevent something (knowing what will follow).The second part is an insight into the American lifestyle in the early 1800's and the cotton plantations where slave's were employed. The next generations of Kunta Kinte are not dealt with as much detail and the book provides only a fleeting glimpse of each group of families. Here the text is a little difficult to read as spoken language is directly employed. Without word endings and a lot of slang, sometimes you have to actually 'read out' to understand the dialogue. However, a good hundred pages where the episode of a chicken breeder is described is very exciting.If you read this till the end (and why won't you?), I can promise you that the heightened emotion you will experience when the author visits the village of his ancestor can be got from very few literary works.This is a very powerful book which will stay with one for a long time. This is a true account of how the early african-americans suffered and the savagery of many of the early white settlers. Because of the mix of fiction/non-fiction the author employs, this saga had it's share of controversy. But whether this particular narrative is true or not is irrelevant since there have been a million genuine cases similar to this. We oftenforget that history is written by winners and the tribulations of the other side are rarely chronicled. Only through books like these do we realise that another side also exists.Bravo Haley!"},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"Alex Haley's Roots has become a classic of American literature in the relatively few years since its release in 1976. Indeed, few books of any kind released during the 20th century had its impact. Its immense popularity -- the book has since sold millions of copies and spawned a critically-acclaimed television mini-series -- has left two legacies. First, it inspired hundreds, if not thousands, of people, both black and white, to trace their history back to its roots. Also, it shed an illuminating light on the plight suffered by African-Americans during America's long years of slavery (it may seem unnecessary to point this out, as the subject is no longer looked over perpetually, but, at the time the book was released, it was a near-taboo subject often relegated to the status of the proverbial pink elephant in the corner.) In so doing, it played a big role in opening our eyes to a chapter in our history that we are all-too-often prone to merely gloss over. Consequently, it also helped to bring about the revolution in African-American socio-cultural studies, doing much to make African American studies a respected scholarly field and also a popular college major.But all of this is background, because the book itself also makes for great literature. Though Haley is no prose stylist, his writing style, honed by his years of journalism, epitomizes the quasi-documentary. The story is very wide in its breadth: it covers a period of over 200 years. The product of 12 years of research and writing, Roots is the culmination of an astonishing and monumental feat of genealogical detective work. Haley was among the very first -- if not, indeed THE first -- African-Americans to trace his ancestry all the way back to his African roots: the birth of his great-great-great-great-grandfather, Kunte Kinte in 1750. From that point on, he gives us the story of his family, all the way up to himself. The story is certainly not balanced in respect to each generation: a couple of hundred pages are devoted to Kunte Kinte, with fewer pages being devoted to each successive generation. By the end of the book, generations are glossed over in a matter of mere pages. This, however, is not to be lamented: in order to keep the book at a manageable length, the more exciting and engrossing people and stories are given more pages (Haley mentions in his acknowledgement that his editor excised many pages from the originally very long manuscript.) The only real problem here is that sometimes the stories of some of the individual people are cut off very abruptly -- including Kinte's -- which leaves the reader hanging with a sense of incompleteness. This, however, is also true-to-life: the families of slaves were often broken up in just this way, with one part never hearing from the other part again (this, indeed, was the case for the lucky ones, who were fortunate to know their parents at all.) This is also justified by reality: the point where Kinte's story breaks off in the book is also the point where the historical evidence relating to him breaks off; Haley could not have taken his story any further, having nothing to go on.Looked at from a purely literary point of view, in regard to its story, Roots is a masterpiece. The book starts out rather slowly for those who are unfamiliar with African culture or who don't particularly care about it. It rapidly moves on from there, reaching many emotional and suspenseful peaks. This book can make one cry and make one sad with its depictions of the utter cruelty committed by men upon men. It can also make one fiercely proud of the admirable endurance of the human spirit through all manner of hardships and suffering. The book contains a very moving story that makes it both poignant and hard to put down. The book is also very interesting for its depiction of life in Africa, a thing of which many people are ignorant, and for its unique perspective on American history -- the saga of the mighty republic seen through the eyes of slaves.Recently, the long-praised book has suffered a critical backlash due to accusations of inconsistency, inaccuracy, and deliberate factual manipulation. It needs to be pointed out that neither Haley nor anyone else has ever purported the conceit that the book is 100%, certifiable fact -- how could it be? Haley, not being a witness to the majority of his ancestor's lives, was naturally forced to write dialogue and scenarios that are not certifiably factual, though many of them are based on fact. Haley admits as much in his acknowledgement and in the text of the book itself. Indeed, such a fact should be self-evident. The important thing, though, is this: the events portrayed in Roots, whether they actually happened to the characters in the book or not, did happen to real people like them. The story of Haley's ancestors is not meant to be an entirely factual documentary: it is a saga that speaks across the ages to the descendants of all former slaves -- and, indeed, to all people who have ever been curious about their roots. Those who claim that Haley deliberately manipulated facts for his own monetary gain are presumptuous to their detriment. Who would've predicted that a book like this would sell in 1976? Aside from that, Haley, as he mentions in the book, did not originally intend to put the results of his research down in book form: he was clearly motivated by a genuine curiosity about his past.In summary, this is a wonderful book in many different ways -- as literature, as a socio-historical cultural document, and as an inspiration and motivation for anyone wanting to know more about their roots. It is an essential read for anyone interest in sociology, cultural relations, African American studies, the plight of slaves in America, or anyone just looking for a great and unique read."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"This book was presented to me by a friend on my 13th birthday...I read it when i was 15. The book just sat on my book shelf for two years and I decided to read it because I had nothing else to do. But after reading the I can say that it is one of my all tie favorites. The book is about slavery and goes through 7 generations of a family affected by it. I still remember each and every part of the book and I'm 20 now. This book is a must read. You might be a little bored at first but this book is worth it. Dont miss out on it!"},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"The book Roots is about begins at an African Village called Juffure in 1750, and ends seven generations later. In the beginning, a son is born to Omoro and Binta, and they call him Kinte Kunta. Kunta grows up from AFrican traditions. However, when he is 17 years old, he is kidnapped by Whites and is shipped along with thousands of other AFricans in a ship to Annapolis. He is taken as a slave, but he tries to escape and by the fourth time, he finally does. He is taken in by another massa, a master, but this one is more generous because he does not use a whip. Kunta is given the name Toby. He works there as a driveman for 45 years. While these years, he marries Bell, a cook for the massa. They have a baby named Kizzy. However, she is taken to jail when she is sixteen because she wrote a fake pass for her lover,Noah. She is taken to Massa John and she has a baby named George. Then, he meets Matilda and they get married. 2 generations later Alex Haley is born along with four other siblings.I liked this book because eventhough there were some sick parts in the book, there were many informations about AFrican traditions. The book showed how it was like for an african to become accustomed to a particular place and learning how to speak a new and foriegn language. Comparing, I think that AFrican Traditions and American traditions were very different.My favorite part in the book was when Kunta was on the ship. I felt very sorry for him because of all of the pain he went through. It made me want to read on because I wanted to know what happened next and if he made it through or not."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"having developed a love for historical fiction,particularly american, one eventually gets entrapped into a chain of white writers. one sees the oft-quoted drawing of slaves lined up like sardines in a can on the slave ships, but when the drawings are animated by alex hailey in \\"ROOTS\\", and you start to feel the experiences of enslaved people, i experienced nausea and trauma unlike any of the other novels i have read so far."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"I remember watching the mini-series Roots on American Television from Canada and it's a culturally defining moment in many ways. It provided visual images to go along with the abstract concepts of slavery, with its impact upon both a nation as well as the peoples and their descendants.So, while on a family vacation in a cabin in Northern Ontario, when I saw a copy of the book on the shelf I reached for it and used the week of down time to read it. Since originally seeing the mini-series more than 30 years ago, the story was still reasonably fresh and as someone who has delved into the realm of genealogy and knows some of the challenge involved with it for African Americans, I was equally interested in the post-script by Haley giving some of his insights into the work he did.I vaguely remembered hearing some things about some controversy related to presumed plagiarism on the part of Haley and also some evaluation as to the accuracy of some of the genealogical claims made, but I read the book without familiarizing myself with these elements until after returning from the trip.In short, there was a lawsuit and Haley settled on it before judgment was rendered. The evidence is convincing that a very significant level of the book was plagiarized word for word from another work and further much of the plot structure too. Further research by genealogists too, bring into question some of the claims as to the actual lineage that Haley claimed. In retrospect however, considering the time frame of the research done, the time and expense that such research entailed and the lack of easily accessibly records in the form of on-line databases, it's hard to fault Haley for these challenges particularly in the field of African American genealogy.In terms of the reading the book, it was a very enjoyable experience. It is well-written and the story carries itself well with presenting and personalizing the inhumanity of Slavery.It's just a shame that that message can be in away diminished because of the elements of controversy that hang over the book now.3 stars.bart breen"},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"i am extremely pleased with the great condition of the book Roots. It made the greatest Christmas gift for my colleague."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"I listened to the audio book on my commute and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The reader is Avery Brooks and he was perfect for the part. His accents and characterizations were ideal for each character, which made the story very easy to follow. His deep baritone voice is very easy on the ears. This is one of the better audio books I have listened to.The story itself left a great impression on me. It clarified to me once again how horrific the practice of slavery was. When one imagines this story being repeated by millions of slaves, it really has an impact. The detail Haley went into on the capture and transport of Kinte to America was very vivid and made me realize how horrible this experience would have been.Haley's summary at the end of the book on how he acquired the information for this story was fascinating and illustrates to me that it really is a story that needed to be told. I was also impressed at how accurate the oral history through seven generation turned out to be.I highly recommend this book to all. This story deserves to be a classic.

So, I naturally enjoyed the saga of Roots. The book was extremely well written. It was professional yet captured the dialect and mannerisms of the each era it contained in such a manner that the reader feels like they're at least a witness to the story if not a part of it.It was rushed at the end, but then, after over 600 pages, I guess the main story was over. Plus, it wasn't the author's autobiography, it was about his family, so I can understand why he might not have felt the need to include much of his own story.I am glad that he told about how the research was done.

Hastening from their beds of bamboo cane and cured hides into the rough cotton tunics, the men of the village filed briskly to the praying place, where the alimamo led the worship:\\"Allahu, Akbar, Ashadu an lailahailala\\" (God is great! I bear witness that there is only one God!\\")\\"It was after this, as the men were returning toward their home compounds for breakfast, that Omoro rushed among them, beaming and excited, to tell them of his firstborn son. Congratulating him, all of the men echoed the omens of good fortune.\\"So begins Roots, this beautifully told story of author Alex Haley's main character, Kunta Kinte, supposedly based on Haley's family history. In Roots, Kunta Kinte is a young man, who, in 1767 in The Gambia (West Africa), was in the forest chopping wood, when he was beaten, chained, and placed aboard a slave ship bound for America.Haley spent nearly 12 years of research and a half million miles of travel to uncover the cultural roots of his ancestors. Haley claimed to be a seventh generation descendant of Kunta Kinte, though historians and genealogists have disputed Haley's story as true, and have claimed the story to be fiction rather than genealogical fact.At the heart of the controversy is author Harold Courlander who sued Haley for plagiarism, charging that Haley plagiarized several dozen paragraphs from his novel, The African. Courlander was paid $650, 000 in an out-of-court settlement.Regardless of the controversy that surrounded Roots in the years after its 1976 publication, the story is told in beautiful prose and with a strong voice; Roots, more than any other book since the publication of Uncle Tom's Cabin, ignited the African - American soul and opened up serious discussion many topics, including the darkest period of American history - the slave trade.Because of the original publication of Roots, millions of African - Americans began to look for their genealogical and cultural roots, and they began to take African names as part of the African-American's search for their collective psychological and cultural identity.The impact of Roots is deep and far reaching, as the reader is reminded in the introduction to the 30th Anniversary Edition. Michael Eric Dyson, in his introduction, tells us that \\"Black History Week\\" was extended into \\"Black History Month\\" the same year Roots first appeared.Dyson writes: \\"Haley's quest for his roots changed the way Black folk thought about themselves and how white America viewed them. No longer were we genealogical nomads with little hope of learning the names and identities of the people from whose loins and cultures we sprang. Haley wrote black folk into the book of American heritage and gave us the confidence to believe we could find our forebears even as he shared his own. Kunta and Kizzy - and Chicken George too - became members of our black American family. That is why no flaw or shortcoming in Haley's tome could dim the brilliant light he shed on the black soul.\\"Dyson was a 17-year-old boarding school student when Roots was first published. Roots sold more than 1 million copies during its first year of publication; the TV miniseries Roots attracted 130 million viewers. The book, Roots won the National Book award and the Pulitzer Prize; it was eventually translated into 37 languages.That cultural dialogue that began with the original publication of Roots has now been renewed with Roots: The 30th Anniversary Edition, The Saga of an American Family.A hearty thumbs up.* * *"},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"Roots is, without a doubt, one of the most moving and compelling books I have ever read. I was first introduced to it in fourth grade, when my teacher showed us a segment of the film series in class. My parents had a copy of the book, which I subsequently read many times. Re-reading it years later, I found it as captivating as ever. The story spans seven generations (technically nine, as it mentions the original character's grandparents), beginning in 1750 with the African ancestor Kunta Kinte and ending with Alex Haley himself. Throughout the poignant tale of one family's journey to freedom, Haley brings to life each ancestral character and the historical time period in which s/he lived. A significant part of the book details Kunta's life in a small village in the Gambia, the agonies of his journey across the Middle Passage, and his struggles as a slave on a wealthy Virginia plantation. He is an unforgettable character, managing to somehow preserve his dignity in the face of unimaginable degradations. Much of the story impresses upon the reader one of the most wrenching aspects of slavery: the pain of families torn apart by the slave trade. Still, most of the family is relatively lucky enough to stay together, and the importance of family is clearly what keeps its members going throughout the many hardships, strengthened by a resolve to hold on to the remnants of their heritage.As captivating as the story itself is the story of how it was written. From a few clues passed down through his family's oral tradition, Haley finds the village from which his ancestor came and visits a griot (someone with encyclopedic knowledge of memorized tribal history), who confirms the story he heard as a young boy. This leads to the most moving passage of the book, which brings tears to my eyes every time I read it. Over ten years, he then traces the details of his family history in America. To better understand what his ancestor must have endured, he even crosses the ocean lying in the cargo hold of a ship. It should be noted, however, that Haley's research was later shrouded in controversy, and he was charged with plagiarizing large parts of The African, by Harold Courlander. He subsequently acknowledged that the majority of it is a work of fiction, though based on historical research. For me, though, this does not detract from the power of the story or its portrayal of the very real experience of slavery itself. This book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"I believe it is a natural instinct for one to want to know his/her origins, particularly in the African-American community, with the history we share as a race. Alex Haley's ROOTS: The Saga of an American Family, though a fictional account of one man's search for his beginnings, serves as a history lesson for all African-Americans. He gives a rather intuitive and well-researched lesson on slave trading and slavery in America, and the affect on race relations. In the introduction of this 30th anniversary edition, Michael Eric Dyson says it best, \\"Roots is an exercise in the skillful telling of a people's pilgrimage through the quagmire of lost racial links to the solid ground of recovered connections.\\"Haley begins his story with his ancestors from the West African Village of Juffure, off The Gambia coast in 1750. There a child is born; Kunta Kinte. Around the age of 17, Kunta is abducted from his village by white slave traders. He and many other Africans suffering the same fate are bound in chains and placed on a boat that sails to the United States. Upon reaching what he learns is Virginia; Kunta is sold into slavery to a planter. In bondage, Kunta struggles to hold onto who he is while constantly looking for an avenue of escape. Several attempts at freedom only served to hurt, humiliate and magnify the utter hopelessness of his situation, which was the realization he would never see his beloved home again. But, to keep his home alive, he secretly held on to some of his African traditions. He told his daughter, Kizzy, about his family and their culture, and she in turn passed it on to her family. This ritual was passed down through seven generations and culminated with the birth of Alex Haley himself. Through Kunta's family tree we see the inhuman effects of slavery, the ultimate freedom gained, and then the fight to be treated as a free man. We feel the atrocities endured and the strength the family maintained throughout.Haley has written a very poignant saga about one race being robbed of their birthright, their dignity, and their sense of worth for the comfort of another race. Their survival as a family was dependant on being able to keep the story alive within each generation so that no one would forget. Haley, to this end, is a very gifted and talented storyteller. I felt the fears, the grief, the resentment, and the frustration of living in bondage with no choices. Each of the characters in this family left an indelible image on my mind that stays with me at all times, particularly when I am reminded how racial discrimination is in our society today.I first watched the miniseries in 1977 and read the book in 1979, and the feelings evoked are still the same as it was then, a deep desire to know my ancestors. This special anniversary edition also includes a foreword that addresses the controversy surrounding this book after its initial printing, and includes more of Haley's personal account of writing the novel. If you read any books in your lifetime, this should be one of them. You will learn more about yourself as well as the foundation of race relations in America than in any other avenue available.Reviewed by Brenda Lisbonof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"This book is really eye-opening. I learned a lot about slavery in the US, and by extension, a lot about African cultures.The first half, about African abductee Kunte Kinte, is great. The second half, about Kunte's descendents, was less interesting to me. Throughout, the prose is about on par with Michener.All in all, a great read."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"I first read this Book, more than 10 years ago now. I was in the 10th Grade. I was born and raised and live in Australia. Yet Roots, the Novel and then also the mini-series, became one of the driving forces behind my passion for searching the great story of the United States.Along with the phenomenal series, The Civil War, by Ken Burns and (hosts), Gore Vidal, and his Novelization of Historical America (ie. Burr, Lincoln etal.) I began to take an interest in the history and Culture of our Pacific Neighbour.The Journey of Alex Haley's family fascinating in it's description and detail from mid 18th Century Colonial America, through to the 20th Century, was and remains as many other's have noted, a landmark in American literature and history.I remember I began reading this hard cover version, and not being able to drop it. As a guy in his teens, with such a powerful historical narrative, it began to open my eyes.I have since then, gone on to complete an Honours Thesis on the subject of American Intellectual Culture, and how it draws from it's historical roots. While my academic and career directions have moved in recent years, my personal passsion to know and delve into the richness of American culture and history has not dimmed.I want to express my gratitude to Alex Haley for opening up the biographical - social history of his people and his nation. So that no matter what oceans we traverse on what continents we come from, we can tap into this mighty story which longs to be re-read, and draws us to our own roots, wherever they may be.Thankyou,Corey (11/28/2004)"},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"I read the translation of this book (in Telugu) when I was around 11 years old(I was in India at that time). And read the original (English) version after several years, when I was in USA. I realized the translater did a great job in capturing Alex Haley's thoughts and emotions. As a kid I could see Kunta Kinte growing up in his village and then later trying to flee the slavery in the American forests. When I read original Alex Haley, those images came back to me in a more realstic sense. I could \\"understand\\" the lives of the slaves and their generations.I read it several times and each time I could not control my emotions or anger. Kunte Kinte inspired me to hold on to my ROOTS. From this book I realized how important Roots are. I feel Kunta Kinte telling me \\"They might enslave your body but they can't touch your soul, if you can hold onto your Roots\\".This is a very important book. If one can dig deeper into the emotions, it not only tells about African slaves, but also about the subdued people of any region. I could very much relate Kunta Kinte's ordeal to oppressed people in India and the Native Americans of America(the other people I know), or to that matter any oppressed race."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"I read \\"Roots\\" for the first time a few years ago and was impressed with Hayley's imagination.

This book is not only a history of Alex Haley's family, it's also a chronichle of american history. From following the stories of Kunta Kinte, Kizzy, Checken George and Tom we learn about that unwritten history americans are unwilling to discuss or acknowledge. From reading this book I learned about the \\"root\\" causes of the issues inthe black community. Kunta Kinte represents the \\"Aware\\" black who has to deal with the devaluation and dismissal of his culture and heritage in order to validate American culture like many modern muslims and othr pro-black organizations. Want to understand why blacks have such a hard time with police? The \\"patarollers\\" poor whites who acted as slave catchers are in many ways similar to our modern day police. Overseer=Officer. The relationship between Kizzy and the Waller's niece is often the way Whites see blacks: as pets or children. In additon the relationship between Massa Lea and Chicken George also depicts moder black/white business relationships:You can do all the work, but you will never be considered an equal partner. Finally with Tom we see the young enterprnur in black business. A black man who struggles from up from slavery and eventaually finds success in spite of racism. Tom's success leads to the eventual succes of the Haley family. This is a powerful book, you will laugh, cry, and be very angry after reading it. \\"Roots\\" is a must read for every black person,but most of all black men. I advise every black mother and father to buy this book along with Gifted Hands, and Manchild in the Promised Land for their sons if they are graduating from Junior High, High school and College. THese books are must reads for any young black male who is growing up."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"After watching the DVD release of Roots, I had to once again repurchase the book that made the movie version possible. Such vividly written material...it made you feel like you were actually there."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"This book was the best I have ever read, and I have read dozens and dozens of them. Some were good, but none brought on the same feelings as this particular novel. Alex Haley has told true, hard-core facts, but also adds a twist of his own story with humor and a style all his own. It begins in Kunta Kinte's small African village and the description of the very strict ways of his Mandinka tribe. It then progresses very quickly into the often horrifying story of the treatment of slaves when he is kidnapped and shipped to America. He has happy times there, but the bad ones far outnumber them. It is an amazing story of both personal and family strength, and I would reccomend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"This book is a book that every parent should have their kids read. It is a historical book that captures an atrocity commited against human beings. Considering how many decades of cruelty was commited, it is amazing to see that history books have not even attempted to capture one of the darkest moments of humanity like Haley has managed to do.Haley is an excellent author and the story is very strong. I was not able to put the book down and felt what the characters in the book might be going through. This book brings out so many emotions and illustrates how selfish, greedy, cruel we can be towards our own kind.I am not an African American, but that is the beauty of this book. To understand it and embrace it all you have to be is a human being.The ultimate question/feeling, the book left me wondering was, how could one person do such things to another person? In order for such a mistake not to take place again in the future, this book should be a required reading for all future generations. It is a book that this generation and generations to come should really learn from."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"The novel Roots tells the story of the ancestors of the late black power-era writer Alex Haley. Haley, who was an ardent genealogist as well as a journalist and biographer, managed the difficult feat of tracing his family tree back into and beyond the time of slavery in the southern United States, and even went on to discover the exact west African village from which his several-times-great-grandfather came to America in the mid-1700's. Roots, with its descriptions of kidnapping, brainwashing, cultural thievery, physical cruelty and cultural endurance among an oppressed peoples taken from the post-stone age jungles to pre-industrial America-what culture shock that must have been for an unprepared race--makes for an at times dismal, at other times inspiring read. In the 1970's Roots served as a focal point of awakening, not only among those of African descent but for peoples of all ethnicities, to learn about their own familial heritage and discover their genetic roots.One criticism I do have about this novel, a point that has long dismayed me, is why Roots, clearly a work of fiction with only a tenuous connection to real events and individuals, is almost always to be found presented in non-fiction sections of book stores and libraries, when surely it must be acknowledged by all that this is at best a \\"non-fiction novel\\" and more accurately, no less a work of imagination than, say, any of the historical writings of Margaret George or Edward Rutherfurd. This blatant pandering to a false idea of what is and is not fiction I do not get.I enjoyed most of the experience of reading Roots, but I was not enchanted by it. I do think I can understand why many people found the reading of this novel a therapeutic experience, and I respect that, even while I did not have a similar result, myself.Addendum, 7-27-06. I have recently learned that the book Roots is even more a fictional construct than I'd thought it was when I wrote my original review. Haley fabricated nearly the whole of this work. It is largely a story crafted in one man's imagination. Reportedly a recent BBC documentary, so far unbroadcast in the United States, exposed this novel as the lie it is. There are those in the mainstream literary community who go so far as to seek to have Alex Haley's numerous awards posthumously revoked. While I always knew Roots was greatly \\"fleshed out\\" by its author, and expressed puzzlement at why it was not shelved among other fiction titles, I did give him credit for research into his family history, which it now seems reliably established, he did not undertake. While at least some of the more recent forebears Haley wrote about apparently did exist, many others, especially the branch of the family in 18th century Africa, appear to be total fictions. Sadly, Roots is a fraud and a deception of Howard Hughes-diary-like magnitude imposed on society. It's not a bad novel, although one with a heavy, somewhat bigoted message, but it is NOT a work of non-fiction."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"These days it's fashionable to attack Roots becuase of the mistakes Alex Haley made with certain details. Forget all that. Alex Haley turned the thin facts of his family history into a gripping novel that caught the attention of the entire country. The book made it's readers cheer, weep and rethink their feelings about race.This book also is responsible for creating an entire movement of folks who study black geneology. Every work of historical fiction concerning black characters, and every black family history book on the market today owes it all to Roots."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"Roots tells the story of K. Kinte (Amazon swear filters don't like me spelling out his full name), a young African living in the village of Juffure during the 1760s, who is kidnapped from his home, put aboard a slave ship to Maryland, and sold into slavery. \\"Roots\\" follows Kinte from his birth in 1750, through four generations of his family, ultimately ending with his descendants' freedom following the end of the American Civil War. The main characters are:K. KinteKinte's daughter KizzyKizzy's son GeorgeGeorge's son TomA note regarding Roots and possible inaccuracies - The first thing you should know going into \\"Roots,\\" is that it is a work of fiction. Haley is purported to be a seventh descendant of Kinte, but as anyone who is familiar with genealogical research knows, determining concrete information on descendants from more than 150 years ago can be very difficult, and even mores when dealing with slaves, who were treated more as goods than people. Haley took information handed down to him orally, and combined this with his own research to create the outline of his family that the novel is based on. Anyone know has ever played the \\"telephone game\\" knows the inherent problems of transmitting information this way. What is most probable is that Haley likely had a direct paternal relative named Kinte who was enslaved, and his children remained slaves until the war ended. Names of some of the children, the slave owners, the events and anecdotes in the book, and pretty much everything but the most basic outline of the story were either invented, or are unknown. Haley's research into his family is impressive, unless you look at it as a genealogist, in which case it is pretty terrible. He uses information and sources that are unreliable, and makes connections that professional genealogists would scoff at. The problem is that it is clear from Haley's after word in the 25th anniversary edition, that he believes in much of the information he uncovered. If he wants to believe Kinte was on the ship \\"The Lord Ligonier\\" based on nothing other than its arrival date in Maryland, then there are probably many other events in the book that are subject to possible error. For anyone interested in more regarding this, I recommend reading the article published in the March 1984 issue of the National Genealogical Society Quarterly. I view \\"Roots\\" a lot like a Dan Brown novel: as long as you understand that it is fiction based very loosely on fact, and approach it as such, there is no reason not to enjoy it. And as a standalone fictional novel, \\"Roots\\" is definitely enjoyable.I had no idea what to expect going into \\"Roots,\\" and wasn't too excited about it, as it's not normally my type of book. From about page 10, I was hooked with the story of Kinte and his life in the Gambia region of Africa. The customs and traditions Kinte experienced from boyhood to his development as a man were fascinating, especially with the looming threat of the toubob (white man) in the background. Ashamedly, I was fairly ignorant on the history of the slave trade and all aspects of it explored through the book were interesting to me, especially Haley's look at how much (if not most) of the slave trade was perpetuated with the help of other blacks in Africa, who assisted or even sold these people to the toubob. The chapters on the African ship, and Kinte's continual attempts at escape kept me glued to the book. I have to admit, once Kinte resigned to his fate and accepted his new life, I began to lose interest somewhat and slowed my pace down, but I never strayed far from the story, and there is enough to keep the reader entertained throughout the different stories. Most of the white slave masters are presented in at least a partially positive light throughout (as positive as can be for someone who owns another human), so there wasn't as much corporal punishment and degradation as I anticipated. But Haley's character development is so effective that he doesn't need to rely on \\"shock value\\" to craft an interesting story. The pacing of events that make up the protagonists' lives is engaging. Since the life of a slave is restrictive by nature, Haley continually has the characters reference historical events throughout the story to provide context of their lives against the backdrop of race relations throughout the United States. This technique seemed fairly implausible and momentarily pulled me out of the story, but I understand the necessity for it. As an example, a character would frequently leave the plantation, then come back and tell the other characters how he heard about how \\"there is a new president called Abraham Lincoln who is going to free the slaves\\" or \\"I heard about a fella named Dred Scott in Louisiana who is suing for his freedom!\\" Most of these instances, of which there are many, seemed more like the character was speaking directly to the reader rather than a natural communication with others on the plantation.\\"Roots\\" is definitely one of the most interesting looks at the long-term effects of American slavery on a family, as well as entertaining in its own right. I would love to give this book five stars, but can't for two reasons. The first is that as far as the actual writing is concerned, there is nothing very spectacular in it. Secondly, very large portions of the book concerning African life, were completely plagiarized from Harold Courlander'sThe African. Haley has addressed this by explaining that he used researchers on the book who did this without his knowledge. Whether that's true or not, it shouldn't matter because he shouldn't have researchers writing entire sections of the book unless he is going to credit them as co-authors. Is it normal practice for authors to use researchers and have them write and come up with such large sections of the book? After actually reading THE AFRICAN, the similarities and outright copying are too blatant and egregious to ignore, and for that, I can't in good faith, give Haley five stars for a book that is not entirely his own. All of that being said, I would still recommend the book to anyone with an interest in this historical saga, and applaud it for the values his story represents."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"I am WAY late in reading this book (2011). I wanted to read the complete story without having seen the movie adaptation because the inner thoughts of people can be as powerful as the visual protraying of them. This book is a TRUE masterpiece of time and dedication by Mr. Haley. I am horrified at what people can do to other people. No one who takes this literary journey would have to suffer the real impact of slavery and that is the power of this work -- unfortunately, it is all too true. I am humbled."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"I re-read this book for the first time in over 30 years, and still find it an effective portrayal of the horrible institution of slavery.The first time I read it, I was a child (5th grade), so some things did hit me differently. I obviously understood the sexual content more. Further, at the end of the book, I had to question Mr. Haley's research. It seemed to come too easily, making me question whether he really found the African from whom he was descended.I also question his portrayal of how Kunta Kinte was captured. I will do independent reading concerning the slave trade, but I don't see how it would have made sense for toubob to wander through Africa in the hopes that they will be able to nab an individual who wandered outside his village, considering that they had kings and warlords who were willing to do business with them, selling off criminals and POWs.Mr. Haley admits that, except for the outline provided by his family's oral tradition, much of this book is, out of necessity, fiction. But it will nonetheless move you.Another controversy about this book is the accusation that Mr. Haley plagiarized material from Harold Courlander's \\"The African\\" [ASIN:080503000X The African]. (I have read on the Internet that Mr. Haley had to pay $650,000 in damages; I have no idea if this is true.) I read \\"The African\\" right before re-reading \\"Roots\\". They cover similar material in part, but I was unable to discern particular passages that seemed to be lifted out of \\"The African\\". If someone could clarify where the plagiarized passages are, I'd appreciate it."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"There are a handful of books that I believe everyone should read. This book is one of them especially if you are an American. The best way I can describe this was how I felt after I saw the movie \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\" I thought that movie was so graphic and realistic that I felt all young Americans should see it in order to better comprehend the extreme sacrifices that people have made for our country. I felt the same when I finished this book. I think people should read it to understand what our country has been through in terms of slavery, racism, hatred, etc. It is a very important part of our history in America. ROOTS tells the incredible story of slavery in our country. More specifically it tells the story of the author, Alex Haley's family from The Gambia in Africa through the generations to the point when he wrote this book. There are a few parts that are disturbing to read, but not as many as I had anticipated. But there are parts that make you sick to your stomach to know that human beings can treat each other so horribly. On the other hand there is some humor in this book. At times I caught myself laughing out loud at some of the things the characters did and said.I gave this book five stars because first of all, it is a great story. It is realistic, exciting and extremely interesting. There were many parts in the book in which I could not read fast enough to find out what happened. Being a long book, I thought there were a couple of sections of no more than 10-12 pages in the middle that were not as interesting as others. I thought the vast majority of it kept my interest. I would not describe any parts of this book boring. I found myself looking forward to going to bed early so I could spend an hour or two reading.The other reason I gave this book five stars was the educational value. This book teaches a lot about slavery, the good and the bad. Haley gives a very detailed and realistic picture of what it would have been like to be a slave, emotionally, physically and even spiritually. I thought Haley did a great job of not being biased in his writing of this book considering he had every reason to be. You could not tell from his writing that he is African-American. This book is not about making out white people to be bad. There were just as many good, fair and gracious white people in this book as there were bad and hateful.Overall, I think the majority of people will enjoy this book and learn a great deal from it especially if one enjoys history. Haley took twelve years researching and writing this book. It is a well written exciting story that will teach you much more than you think about this era of our history."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"This book IS one of the landmarks in writing in the 20th century. It was the first REAL book that i started reading from start to end and WHAT a journey it was!! From the first page Alex Haley grips you into the epic story of Kunta Kinte leading up to the author's actual life. Despite the book's large size it will not matter as soon as you start reading it.I found this book not only to be a work of fiction, but also a history lesson of the slavery era and black history in general. The dialogue and characters Haley talks about are top rate and he writes it in a way that makes you feel that you were actually there watching it all happen!! There are even some parts of the book where I found myself nearly shedding tears!!! due to the drama that unfold in the book, especially the part where he describes the slave ship.I highly recommend this book for two reasons. First, because it is a fascinating look at the Slavery Era and what followed it with its 'raw' and dreadful reality. Second, because this book will educate those who read it, including myself, about the brave struggle of the Blacks in the U.S towards achieving their freedom."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"I love Roots and think the whole world should read it. It's an important and vital book about American history, family history, and triumph over hardship. I loved Roots the first time I read it twenty years ago, and I love it still, having just finished it yesterday, BUT...1) If only Alex Haley hadn't plagiarized whole sections of the book (see Wikipedia's article on the author Harold Courlander)2) If only Haley really HAD been related to Kunta Kinte (genealogists state he consciously perpetrated a hoax)3) If only Juffure really WAS Haley's ancestral village (evidence suggests that the griot from modern Juffure with \\"memories\\" of Kunta Kinte's disappearance in 1767 was coached about what to \\"remember\\")I found these fabrications depressing. And what's so sad is that I believe Haley had no need to lie and cheat, because he's really a top-notch storyteller.This aside, though, I have a few other critical comments.1) The book begins a slow descent into petering out after Kunta Kinte exits. The characters become increasingly wooden and one-dimensional. Kunta is great, Kizzy is good, Chicken George is fair, and everyone and almost everything after that is forgettable.2) The book lauds having tons of children, mindlessly, and fails to criticize parents who have children and cannot provide for them. Haley makes it seem that having children and passing on the family name, no matter what horror the child risks getting subjected to, is the noblest of goals. I disagree! It sounds crass to say that slaves shouldn't have had children, but I hold all parents, slaves or not (rape victims being an exception), responsible when they knowingly bring children into a world of hell. (And Chicken George - a neglectful parent, to say the least - bringing 8 children into slavery? Nothing admirable there!)"},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"Alex Haley's moving saga of his family's history and his own journey to find their \\"roots\\" continues to thrill decades after its publication. From Kunta Kinte's childhood in Africa to the horror of American slavery, his descendents' experiences into the first years of black freedom and segregation, to Alex's own final triumph as he finds his long-lost, legendary ancestor in The Gambia, the reader is alternately moved from tears to rage to cheers.I first read this book and saw the miniseries in its first run when I was 12. It was the very first time someone understood the deep need for identity that I, an adopted child, carried. My ethnic heritage was unknown; the adoptive family became angry when I asked and didn't understand \\"why you even care about that. So what?\\" I wept when, in the show, Alex triumphantly shouts, \\"I have found you, Kunta Kinte!\\"Decades later, I reunited with my family and began tracing my own roots. I was very proud to discover that, like me, Alex Haley is also a descendent of Captain Thomas Graves of Virginia. Rest in peace, my distant cousins of his novel.

Some of them even hinting that this book isn't real but fiction. Quite the contrary. I think this book is amazing, never have I seen anywhere someone who has spent half of his/her life trying to discover his family that is special even more so that he was able to discover his family as far back as to Africa. I am not African American but I respect what has happened to their-Ancestors-.Haley writes in an interesting manner, with what little information he possesed he was able to weave it into a 587 page book, but quite the page turner none the less. It starts in 1750 (I think thats when I don't have my copy with me) with a baby born, Kunta Kinte. He is the main character for most of the book, mainly because he was the most of whom Haley heard about. It follows life in Juffure, his village and you feel happy for the little boy growing up.Eventually reality hits and he's a slave, his foot is injured and scares that will remain for the rest of his life. Marrige and child follows and again your happy for the Kinte family. It's amazing how this man kept up the faith through everything.

To experience all that Haley put into it, you must read. A definite classic that should be on every book shelf."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"If you are interested in the history and life of slavery, then you will love this book. Roots is a story that takes you through the generations of an African American family as early as the 1700's. The beginning setting takes place in the Gambia of Africa at the village of Juffire where Kunta Kinte, Alex Haley's great-great-great-great-great-great grandfather, was born. Around his late teen years, he was captured by a group of white slave sellers, and he survived the horrific trip through the middle passage to America. After arriving, he tries to run away four different times and is then sold to a new master. Here, Kunta meets and marries the housemaid Belle and they have a child named Kizzy. As the story progresses, it eventually leads through generations of Kunta's family to the birth of author Alex Haley. Haley then explains how and why he wrote this book. I liked this book and enjoyed reading it. Before I had read it, I could never actually grasp the idea of what slavery was. This novel displayed the hardships of slaves, especially how hard it was to keep a family together. It also made me realize how we are all connected to people who were alive in the 1700's and earlier, no matter how unrealistic it may seem now. At certain parts in this book, I had to push myself to keep reading, but in the end it was worth it."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"Roots is quite possibly the best book I've read! A must read!

It was officially published in 1974. The book talks about black culture, slavery, respect and pride. It is one of the most important books and television series ever to appear. It is also one of the most important books of our time. This book has sold over 1 million copies the first year. Also the miniseries has been watched by an astonishing 130 million people. The book Roots is one of the best books I've ever read.The main character in the story in Kunta Kinte, Binta and Ormoro are his parents. They live in the village of Jeffer, in Gambia. Eventually, Kunta has a little brother names Lamin. Kunta and Lamin use to be around each other all the time. When Kunta was in the second kafo, he use to take his brother with him to herd goats. One day his father had to go on a journey that took three days and three nights. When Kunta and his dad were gone, Binta had another baby named Suwadu. Finally when they returned from their journey Kunta had to go to manhood training. This was called the Kintango, while he was in manhood training Binta had her last baby and named it Madi. Kunta was now in the third kafo, since he came back from manhood training. This meant that he can have his own hut, tend to his farm and goats and get married. Kunta also had a grandmother named Yaisa who was another main character in the story. Also a man when Kunta captured and put into slavery, his name was fiddler, he always fiddled with his flute.The conflict of this story I believe was slavery. When Kunta Kinte got taken away by force, taking away his language and academic knowledge, he had to work on their land against his will for no profit. Even though this terrible event happened, he still figured out how to learn and survive in the type of environment he was in. While he was enslaved, Kunta Kinte tried to escape multiple times. Every time he tried to run he always ended up getting caught. Eventually the white people, also known as the tubob in the village of Jeffer, chopped of one of his legs so that he would not try to run anymore, without providing any medical attention.The main theme of this book was survival. This one man, Kunta Kinte, came to slavery as a young man and left his legacy for his children. He also made a legacy for each generation. There was also a multiple of climaxes. One main climax was when his daughter Kizzy was born and it changed Kunta's life. He taught her everything while they were in slavery, such as his language in the village of Jeffer. One night, Kunta and his friend had a change to escape and become free once again. The two men knew they had to run faster than the \\"man beating his drum.\\" Kunta thought very hard about this decision because he tried to escape, he would never see Kizzy or his wife again. In the end Kunta decides to stay in slavery with his family and raise his little daughter Kizzy. Kunta Kinte died as a slave, but the decisions that he made got Kizzy her freedom when she got older.Anyone can read this informational book. This book illustrates respect, culture, slavery and history. If you enjoy historical books that make you relies the true history about what happened back then, then this book is for you. It will make you have a better understanding on how African American people were treated."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"mr haley took a few known facts and wrote a entertaining work of fiction around them.it,s the same theme of eternal shame and guilt of all white people regardless of when they were born.exept for the arabic people the africans were the most ruthless and prolific slave traders in the world.the slavery practiced by kuntas own tribe is sugarcoated and made to appear good and beneficial for the slave.according to the author exept for a few corrupted by the white man an african could never harm an african.

The whole Kinte family is truly amazing. Someone like Alex Haley writes a book using SO much research and dedication, in my mind, should get some type of nobel prize.

The story starts with Kunta Kinte which is the most exciting and most interesting beside emotional and exhilerating part of the story. The sad description of events and the frustration felt at many times brought me to tears too.

It is an incredibly moving, exciting and insightful story that traces one American family from the African village of Juffure near the Gambian river, through the civil war and finally to its author Alex Haley. Haley did painstaking research to document an accurate history of his family which can be a typical history of all AFrican Americans. Being a very dramatic, and well paced story with surprises and plot twist; it could be the best source of learning of Black history that exists. I encourage everyone to read it."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"There is a scene near the end when Chicken George returns from his years overseas to be granted his promised freedom from his Master, who is also his father. During the time George has been away, Master, once a champion breeder of fighting roosters, has fallen on hard times. His wife has died, his farm has dried up, he's had to sell most of his slaves (including George's family) and he's become a fall down, drunken husk of his former self. Master was always a cruel man, but he always had a kind eye for George, his son and champion cock trainer. When George returns, Master is thrilled to see him. He has forgotten even what it was like to be successful, and George is a striking memory of better times. He is thrilled to see him, extravagently delighted, having likely even forgotten George existed over all those years. Master is feeling awfully lonely, so he finally unburdens himself and admits he is George's father. It is a sad scene, tragic, overwhelmingly poignant. When a book that essentially sets out to condemn slavery while telling exactly what it was like with no editorializing, can muster up the courage to put you inside the Master's head, to allow you to feel almost sorry for the old man, that explains some of the power of this work. I found myself, despite myself, sympathizing with poor Master, wondering what was to become of him. Then, and only then, after a few moments of silent contemplation, can you realize who it is that you are crying over and get back into the story. And while not a pure non-fictional take on Haley's own family, it branches out to be a likely story of most any slaves. How they got here, how they were treated, what agonies they went through. The only thing made-up, I believe, is the dialogue, because no one had enough interest in taking account of what the slaves were saying, so these lost words are gone forever, remade into what Haley himself might have said had he been frightened and had he been a slave and had his entire world been destroyed, forcing him into an irreversable situation. This is a definative history of just what it was to be a slave in America."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"Don't get me wrong --- I thought the story contained within &quot;Roots&quot; was gripping, and it was well written. Also, it is obvious that the underlying truths of slavery in America are echoed within the story of &quot;Roots.&quot; If Haley had written and marketed this as a novel, based loosely on some of his family stories, I would be giving this 4 or 5 stars.Unfortunately, his purported family history simply isn't true, and not only is it not true, but it has been deliberately distorted by Haley so that his story would have more punch to it. Haley has long since lost credibility within both the fields of black history and genealogy, and even Haley (after receiving much criticism) conceded that he had taken &quot;artistic license&quot; with some details, although he never acknowledged the true breadth of his distortions.If you want to see how inaccurate &quot;Roots&quot; is, check out an article written by Elizabeth Shown Mills &amp; Gary B. Mills in the National Genealogical Society Quarterly (Volume 72 #1 pp 35-49), which absolutely shreads both the American &amp; African aspects of Haley's alleged family history. It will make it difficult to read this book with much enthusiasm.It is hard to have much respect for Haley; he deliberately distorted his family's story, never fully owned up to that fact, and then basically rode the gravy train that was &quot;Roots&quot; for the rest of his life. To me, that is beneath contempt. Read the book if you must, but understand that it is almost pure fiction."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"This book was a massive success when it came out , about 25 years ago, and was turned into a television mini series in the 80's (which is intriguing, as the book is very racially charged and is HEAVY content). Starring in that mini series as the main character was LeVar Burton (reading rainbow, Geordi in ST: TNG).Anyways, back to the book:'Roots' starts with the life of Kunta Kinte, a member of the Mandinka tribe in Africa, during the 18th century. We watch his life as he is born, raised, loved by his family, and instilled with a deep sense of pride, tradition, and work ethic from his village.Now a young adult, Kunte goes to chop some wood down and BAM! Nabbed by slave traders (booo!). As the reader, you are already engrossed in the life of Kunta. I knew a little about the book while reading it, so i was waiting for this moment (very sadly, as I was enjoying just reading about Kunte's life in Africa).Horrific boat ride over to the states, he tries to escape slavery several times until they cut off half his foot.The rest of teh novel is about Kunte's assimilation into slave life, and the generations after him. You watch how each generation becomes watered down, and more complacent with their life. You can see what traditions and stories become altered with change between the families.Ultimately, the story ends with the author, Alex Haley, who claims that he is descended from Kunte and follows the family tree to himself. Apparently he plagarized a bunch of the book from The African, and geneology experts contest against his claim of descent from Kunte. These facts kind of irked me once I read them on Wikipedia... I had enjoyed the book but seeing that he plagarized AND possibly miscontrued facts pisses me off. BUT he DOES say near the end that most of it is fiction, and I think Haley himself wants to believe the geneology tree (he wasn't just saying all this to pimp himself up).A good read but difficult in terms of content (reality is always the biggest bitch). One of those tales of history that is painful to hear about, but history has it's lessons that we should all be mindful of."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"An American classic, no doubt...My experience with this book is that when I was 10 or 11 the miniseries was on TV and my mother deemed it acceptable for us to watch. I guess that was slightly progressive of her because, really she is a racist and I have had to fight my whole life to overcome all the other remarks she made, but because Roots was on TV and everyone was revering it like it was some sort of Gospel (which, if you are a 10-year-old and you have never seen black people before but they are going to win Emmys, I revered it too).However... this is NOT a review of the miniseries. For the first time, I read the book. I think my edition was close to 30 hours but the most moving part for me was the \\"new\\" afterward by Alex Haley before he died.My recommendation is this: Whatever your experience is with Roots, if it's just that you have heard about it or you were like me and you were a kid when this masterpiece came out or if you have read it 10 times...but never read the new afterwards by Mr. Haley... just read that. Or, if you have never read the book and have only seen the miniseries... time to read... because yeah, it's rough. It's rewarding in ways you can't even imagine and I am constantly reminded when reading a book like this what the human being as a species will do or endure to live and go on having babies and keep the species going, because, sometimes, people, we are effed up.The afterwards is maybe 30 or so pages. Yes, the rest of the book is amazing and a true story of how America was built (because let's face it all, people... without slaves, we just wouldn't be where we are today) and about the true hands who built the fences, paved the roads built railroads (after they were freed...and oh what a double edge sword that was...since we didn't have any ground work paved to help them) did all the dirty work, occasionally one person would get lifted up into the spotlight or whatever...The new afterwards is simply one of the most amazing things I have ever read. It begs the question: Is Roots true? And I had to wonder that myself. But once I read the afterwards (and I kinda wished I would have read it as soon as Kizzy is sold away because that is ALL explained and I wish someone would have told me because then I wouldn't have to wonder) it is truly a masterpiece of storytelling from the most ancient ways the human race has ever kept a memory alive without cave paintings, written words or anything except memories.I know right now mining the human mind for memories is a big deal, finding lineage is a big deal, getting to know who your ancestors were is big...but nothing is bigger when someone can PROVE it the way Mr Haley does in this book. And this has been proven to me without a shadow of a doubt, without hesitation...he faithfully recreated every word spoken because of the memories that his own parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles and who ever else stepped into the circle to say their piece, I believe that this is the most well-crafted biography (is it one, though, truly?) I will ever or have ever read. It hard to classify this book because I'm sure someone would want to challenge it's historical accuracy. But what is history without a little imagination thrown in?No matter which way you slice this book, it's a 5 star read of the highest caliber. So movingly narrated by the very talented Avery Brooks. A perfect Audiobook."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"The epic saga Alex Haley has written reaches deep into heart of history, binding family history with salvery.

Then the book focuses on the grandson Kinte never knew, Chicken George,who is a huge figure and legend in all Haley's ancestors lives, eventually leading them to an uncertain new found freedom in Laurderdale following emancipation at the end of the civil war. Finally,Haley tells of his own quest to find out who \\"The African\\" was and from where exactly had he come from two centuries before...This is a labour of love from Alex Haley and he achieves a work that is of historical importance as well as uplifting;full of the garrulous optimism of Chicken George.The narrative has many 'time tags'pin pointing events on the plantation to historical events-such as the war of independence- and lists the many blacks involved in the birth and life of America that took so long to give them their freedom. 'Roots' has often been used as a template for other writers tracing their origins from the slave ships to modern day, and all are worthy books, but it is \\"Roots\\" that will always be imortal."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"I can scarcely believe that I waited this long to read Roots, a book I had heard about for years.

This was a superb book. Beautifully written, compelling, heart wrenching and uplifting in spite of all the pain. It was an honor to read such a book.

I personally felt their pain, fear, frustration, and anger, as well as their moments of joy and pride. The story of this family and their perseverance educated me, entertained me, and inspired me. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"In 688 pages, Alex Haley has captured in his history of one family, the history of an entire race of people whose names and identities were stolen from them. It's hard to say if this book is fiction, history or biography, since it reads so much like all three. Haley found sizeable gaps in his efforts to trace his family roots, and of necessity had to fill in the blanks from his own imagination, but it reads so convincingly that none of the fictionalized parts detract from the overall story. Probably millions of American blacks, I among them, have wondered where we came from and tried to trace our family lines, only to inevitably run up against a brick wall. (I managed to trace my own family reliably back to my great-great-great-grandmother, who arrived here at the end of the 18th century on a slave ship, but I'll never know her tribe or her nationality.) Haley begins his story fittingly in a small African village, where a 17 year old boy named Kunta Kinte is abducted by slave traders after venturing out of his village alone. His harrowing voyage to America is told in some 50 of the most gut-wrenching pages ever written. It's been reliably estimated that the death rate on the slave ships was between 35 and 40%; translated into numbers, that means that besides the 14 million Africans who were dragged, more dead than alive, onto the shores of the Americas, another 11 million died en route. Sold into slavery to a Virginia planter, Kunta lives out his life in bondage, struggling to hold onto the few remnant of his African identity. Haley is a great storyteller and the narrative sweeps through succeeding five generations, bringing his subjects vividly to life, and it all reads like a great novel until we are brought up short by his own arrival on the scene a century and a half after his ancestor's birth, and then it hits us like a knockout punch: forget the novel, this is real. This is Haley's family and every black family in America that has struggled to survive and has not only survived, but has succeeded despite enormous odds. The most mind-blowing part of the book, for this reader, was when Haley returned to his ancestor's native Gambian village of Juffure and heard his own family history narrated by the Griot. Haley has written, in his history of one family, the story of every family in America that traces its roots back to Africa from the 16th through the early 19th centuries. In the words of old African-American saying, which has relevance for everyone, you can't know where you're going, if you don't know where you've been. Haley shows us, in vivid and at times excruciating detail, where we've been, and what we've come through to be who we are."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"I am surprised that I have not read this book sooner ~~ considering how much I love biography/family histories. This is one book that will definitely go on my top 50 books.Alex Haley writes of his seven generations of family life ~~ beginning with &quot;The African&quot; ~ Kunta Kinte ~ who was abducted from his village in The Gambia and ending with a brief biography of himself. From a proud African captured and forced to become a slave to freedmen and farmers, business owners and the women who prayed for the families while keeping the stories alive ... this is one book to cherish.You struggle with Kinte's disappointments, fears, sorrow, bitterness and joy as he watches his freedom disappears into slavery. You begin to understand his anguish at losing his family, self-respect, pride and honor. You begin to understand the stoicness behind each slave's demeanor as he or she serve their masters/mistresses and their secret longings for a home they can call theirs or even live their lives without fear of being sold off to another family plantation. And you begin to understand their relief when the Civil War ended.I have to confess, Haley's family are among the fortunate ~~ they managed to stay together through two slave-holding families ~~ though I don't understand how the Murray family can say slavery is ok. They may be more lenient than other slaveholding families ~~ but it is still wrong to hold another human being against their will simply because of their skin color.Haley demonstrates how the intelligence of his family helped them survive the years during slavery, after Civil War and during the Reconstruction period. And I have to confess, my favorite scene in this whole book is when Tom, shortly after being freed, comes upon a white man who had whipped him after accusing him of stealing food while working for him during the war, gives him a drink. The captain then demanded that Tom gives him a drink and Tom just looks at him steadily before walking away. He knew then that he was free and unbeholden to any white man. And Tom is my favorite character ~~ he finds a way to work around working for white men and still retaining his independence. He has the strength of The African running in his veins.This is one book that will be sticking with me for a long time. It is rich in heritage. It is rich in dialect. It is rich in every human emotion possible, and dreams. It is rich in hope as well. This is one book that should be deemed as a classic ~~ it portrays American history in a way that we don't get to hear in classes in school. It is one dimension of a time that seeps in history ~~ and it is an African-American history. It is one that I highly recommend for everyone to read. The voices of Haley's ancestors aren't so easily forgotten. They will haunt you the next time you hear of a Civil Rights movement happening ~~ or a story about a slave ancestor. These are a people who have not forgotten their roots and where they came from. They hung onto their dreams and dignity as best as they could throughout some of the harshest times in the matters of history. And Haley captures their voices beautifully.This is one book you won't regret picking up."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"When I began reading this book I had to force myself to get through the first few pages because of the details of the background and culture of Africa. Alex Haley opened the book by telling about Africa as it existed back then and gave the view of America by the Africans as they saw it. I soon began to realize, however, that the cultural background is an essential part of the novel. Every detail Haley gave in the beginning of the book became important through the rest of the book as it followed the life of one man, Kunta Kinte. Kunta Kinte is an African boy whi is taken from his homeland by white men to become a slave. As I continued the book I became attached to the Kinte family and began to feel the pain and suffering of Kunta Kinte. The story of Kunta is passed on for many generations as they learn the story of their ancestor. This book made me open my eyes to the pain and suffering that African slaves kidnapped had to go through. I loved this book and strongly recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"Roots is one of the best books I've ever read, but after reading this newly released edition, I'd recommend readers find an older copy. The first section is riddled with typos and grammatical errors and so is the last section, obviously the book was edited by more than one editor because the rest of the book is perfect.It's a disgrace that such a great book was allowed to be reprinted in such a sloppy fashion.

The reader is permitted to partake in the first 17 years of Kunta's life, learning along with Kunta the customs of his people... We cheer with him when he graduates from one kafo to the next; we sit in awesome wonder as we read about all of the things he sees on his travels; and we cry out in agony as he is captured and kidnapped by slave traders. We follow Kunta to America, where he makes four failed attempts to escape before slave catchers cut off half of his foot. If more than half of the book is dedicated to Kunta, the remainder of the book is dedicated to his legacy. We follow the life stories of Kunta's daughter Kizzy and Kizzy's son Chicken George, all the way down to Alex himself -- who sits on his grandmother Cynthia's knee, over and over again hearing the story of &quot;The African&quot;. I was so captivated by Roots that I took the book with me even to the bathroom. You will not be able to put this book down."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"I'm 21 and missed the phenom that was the mini-series. I picked up &quot;Roots&quot; after having read &quot;Queen&quot; and enjoying it immensely. I was a little frustrated with the first 150-200 pages that chronicle Kunta Kinte's life in Africa. It was interesting, but I was expecting to read about antebellum American history, and this didn't appear to be it. I was quickly over it as Mr. Haley guided me on a sojourn through seven generations of Kunta Kinte's progeny. I found the story to be an educational and entertaining tale.Then I hit page 702.Alex Haley was born. All along I knew this story was a dramatic interpretation of his family history, but suddenly, my God, these people were real. Their sufferng was real. The inhumanities they faced were real. That young man who lived a rightous and rightful life in Africa (HOW IMPORTANT THAT I LEARNED ABOUT HIM) and had it stolen from him was, too, real.Just another reminder of how cavilier our lives have become; how much we take as granted. Truly, I am better having read this book. Even with my blue eyes and ruddy cheeks, I found there a great and valuable piece of my own heritage as an American and the nature of us all as human beings. How ashamed I am to be a member of a species that could commit such atrocities. And how proud to be of those that bravely overcome them."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"With a book as socially important as \\"Roots\\" you must focus on two things as you read. First, consider the book on its own literary merits and quality, as you would with any other book. But in this case you must also take account of the book's importance to American culture and society. The importance of \\"Roots\\" is beyond reproach and it clearly deserves its reputation as a classic. The way this book has illuminated the African-American historical experience is obvious and can't be denied, and the sweep of this novel is up to the challenge.Outside of the imposing social importance of this book though, there are a few things to quibble about if you just look at this book on its own strengths. In its attempt to cover seven generations of an extended family, the book is certainly lopsided, with a huge amount of space given to Kunta Kinte, and less and less to each successive generation. Of course, this was a choice of Haley's in order to keep the book to a manageable length, and Kunta's story is certainly the most dramatic, but you are left with many unanswered questions about the lives of his descendants. Kunta's early life back in Africa takes up the first fifth of the book, and this section is overlong and difficult to get through due to its lack of suspense. Kunta's happy, proud life, along with that of his village, are described in such an overly sentimental way (I hesitate to use the word \\"sappy,\\" though it comes dangerously close) that you are left with the suspicion that Haley is trying to play cheerleader for the softer side of African history. Of course this was necessary back when Haley wrote the book, as ancient African cultures were barely appreciated at the time, and historians still mostly thought that Africans had spent thousands of years doing nothing until the Europeans arrived. So Haley has done a service in his coverage of Kunta's childhood by using solid African history as the backdrop, but the picture is just a little too rosy for belief. One other flaw with Haley's coverage of this period concerns the African role in the slave trade. It is now common knowledge that the slave trade got off the ground because a small number of white traders recruited vast numbers of Africans to round up their countrymen and bring them to the slave ships. This was the tragic outcome of inter-tribal rivalries, with the recruited slave raiders unaware of the horrific implications of their actions. This phenomenon is mentioned in passing, though Haley suspiciously fails to dwell on its significance, as if it were too embarrassing.Those minor flaws aside, the book becomes impossible to put down when Kunta's life takes a tragic turn as he is kidnapped into slavery. Here is where we begin to appreciate the full power of Haley's achievement. His vast research into the experiences of the slave makes the story truly heartbreaking, with the horrific conditions of the slave ship described in great detail. We also learn of the lives of quiet desperation led by Kunta's descendants both on the plantation and on through post-slavery discrimination. Despite the severe hardships of living under a system designed to crush them, African-Americans held out with a strong hope that things would eventually get better, and a strong modern culture developed under amazing circumstances. Alex Haley's insights into the crushing despair, strong moral fortitude, and hopeful faith behind the development of African-American culture are the ultimate achievement of this book, and this should be appreciated by all Americans."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"This year for Black History Month, I decided to read a black history book, and I could not think of any title more celebrated than Alex Haley's \\"Roots\\". The experience was rewarding far beyond what I would have imagined in two respects. First, learning more about a cultural heritage that was different from my own was an awakening to say the least. Furthermore, Haley proved to be a master storyteller, making the read an enriching personal event.One of the most compelling aspects of Roots is its conceptual basis. \\"Roots\\" is unique in its approach to research. The germination of \\"Roots\\" occurred when, as a youth, Haley marveled at the ancient family stories related to him by his maternal grandmother and a coterie of other female cousins and aunts. Those tales relate how a great ancestor known as \\"the African\\" was kidnapped into slavery one morning while chopping wood for a drum along a river called \\"Kamby Bologo\\". The family's oral tradition was remarkable in its time scale, covering at least five generations after the African was sold into slavery at Annapolis in 1767.Haley expands his research beyond the family stories to include corroboration from conventional genealogical and historical sources such as official records from Spotsylvania county Virginia. In addition, Haley takes the further (and unprecedented) step of including corroboration from African oral tradition sources know as \\"Griots\\". Griots are a cultural phenomenon in West Africa. They are individuals who are combination storytellers and historical archive for a culture that has limited written records. It is the blending of information from such diverse sources that gives \\"Roots\\" its unique appeal.As the father of two young (and darling) children, the most touching part of \\"Roots\\" for me was the beginning that related the birth, childhood and early adulthood of \\"the African\\" who was named Kunte Kinte. Having an awareness of the general storyline, and knowing what was going to happen eventually to Kunte Kinte, it was heart wrenching to read about the loving family and village relationships that would be forever severed by a terrible crime. The process of committing a person to slavery is dehumanizing in the extreme. \\"Roots\\" reversed that process by returning to the chattel that was Kunte Kinte his basic humanity. From the standpoint of prose style, the success of \\"Roots\\" herein lies. It is not merely a story from black history, but it is an important cautionary tale for any human being that is tempted to show brutality to fellow travelers.I did not give \\"Roots\\" five stars because of another stylistic issue that I believe diminished its potential impact. It appeared to me that Haley changed his pace about mid way through the text, and I found this somewhat disappointing. Up through Kunte Kinte's sale to \\"Massa Waller\\", the character development reminded me of the level of detail you might find in a Victor Hugo novel. However, about the time Kunte Kinte is maimed by slave hunters (they chop off half his foot), it seemed to me that Haley picked up speed in his storytelling, and the years (and generations) began to pass by with ever increasing velocity. I would have preferred a more deliberate approach and greater character development to the later generations (particularly with Kizzy and Chicken George). I think that \\"Roots\\" could easily have been twice as long and yet remain a compelling epic."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"This outstanding work of Alex Haley is one of the finest books of all time.

Unfortunately, there were a ridiculous number of grammar and spelling errors as well as a couple incorrect facts that really devalued the book for me. I couldn't read 10 pages without seeing a mistake like \\"the the\\". I was especially disappointed by these errors since it was the special 30th Anniversary reprint of the book. I would have thought they would fix most of these mistakes. As a history teacher, the factual errors were even worse for me. He wrote that the American Revolution was also known as the Seven Years' War. That is incorrect. The Seven Years' War is another name for the French and Indian War which preceded the Amer. Rev.

Although I've recently graduated, to this day its still a book I think about from time to time. The story is infatuating and gripping to no end. Alex Haley poured his heart into this book and as the reader, you can feel it from page to page. This is a very lengthy, yet powerful story. Alex Haley was able to eloquently transcend generations and political movements with a book that I will have to simply say, enlightened me greatly. I would definitely read it again and encourage anyone who is interested in an accurate account of the dynamics of slavery and its lasting effect on American culture today-good, bad, and ugly."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"I really liked this story because it just kept me reading and it really opened my eyes to slavery and how wrong it is. The best part of the story was with Chicken George. This book should be required reading in high schools everywhere."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"I first read this book ten years ago, and since then have read it three times. I am about to read it for a fourth time. In my opinion the book gives an in depth look at slavery without sugar coating it. I was drawn in by the characters, and there were times I became so emotional, I had to put the book down. Even while I was away from the book, I found myself thinking about it. Very intense. The genius of this book is the author's ability to get the reader to walk in the shoes of those in the book. Too many times the period of slavery and the impact of slavery has been minimized or glossed over. On the other hand, it has also been sensationalized countless times just to make a point. This book neither hides the truth, or comes off has a blazing neon in your face sign. It simply is, and without a doubt that is the harshest reality of this all. These things really did happen."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"Roots is an important novel. It was a part of the process of African-Americans coming to understand themselves. This process started with the \\"black is beauty\\" movement and its most recent development is the growing popularity of the holiday Kwanzaa. This book dispelled the notion, taught by western society, that blacks should be ashamed of the African origins and enslavement of their ancestors.Root is an important American novel but that is not the reason why you should read it. It should be read because it is an excellent example of the historical novel. Fact and fiction are mixed together to bring alive the rich history of America.As you read this novel you will marvel at the bravery and dignity of the African named Kunta Kinte and his decedents. You will witness the brutality of the past and see historical events through a new perspective. You will feel pride as you see the human spirit triumph.Mr. Haley's writing style is not very artistic but it is clear and precise. He truly recreates the past in a manner that will keep you turning the pages.If you saw the television adaptation, you will also see the changes that were made to the tale to avoid alienating the majority of the audience.I highly recommend this book to all that are eager to gain knowledge and enrich their souls."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"When I started reading this book I wasn't sure if I would like it or not. The first part of the book concentrated on Kunta Kinte's childhood in Africa and while it was interesting I didn't find it particularly exciting. Then Kunta was kidnapped and taken to America where he was sold as a slave, and this where I found I couldn't put the book down! Reading about the conditions on the slave ships and the way they were treated on the plantations was both incredibly sad and horrifying. Everybody should read &quot;Roots&quot; so they can be made aware of this. It must have been a fantastic experience for Alex Haley when he discovered his family history and it makes you wonder who your own ancestors were!"},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"Fascinating. The fact that the author was able to trace back seven generations of the Kinte family is highly impressive and has demostrated the amount of time and effort he put in, as well as the extent of his sincerity. The book has been written with such pride and love and is so brutally frank that I find it hard to put down and even harder to erase the images and emotions that the book has invoked in me. It has been a long time since I've been so deeply affected by a book."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"Need I go on? I think this is arguably the best book around. It's incredibly inspiring and though-provoking. I tell you, after finishing this book I looked at everyone differently - especially black people. Does that sound racist or ignorant? I don't think so because I really appreciated what the black population's ancestors had been through. Their struggle for freedom (namely Kunta Kinte's) inspired a respect and a kind of sorrow for what they had gone through. Mr Haley brought the characters to life for me and when they cried, I actually cried, but when they laughed I rejoiced. It is very rare to find such a touching book which has such a profound effect on you it leaves you feeling inspired and great about man-kind and the struggles we can overcome.In a world where it is difficult to command respect without meeting face to face, I respected all the descendents of the central character and Alex Haley. I think this book should be made compulsory reading for everyone regardless of race, religion or ethnicity. We'll understand and respect each other more."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"Roots.This is a saga of an American family that starts with Kunta Kinte and ends with the author himself. It starts in Gambia in the year of 1750 when Kunta Kinte is born in the village of Juffure where he grows up. When Kunta is about seventeen years old, he is captured by toubobs (white slave hunters) and brought to America on a big slave ship together with a lot of others slaves. Decades pass and generations of slaves from his descendants goes through tough times but keeps the story about Kunta alive. They finally get their freedom back but now they are far away from their homeland.The language in the beginning of the book isn't very difficult. It is a little more difficult when he comes to America and you start to read the English that the black people speak. For me it was a little difficult in the beginning before I got used to it. He really writes the way that people talk. In this book it's quite a lot of dialogues but it is also a lot of describing text. The pace is good and it is very concentrated to important things. Those are very dramatic.My favourite character in this book is, without a doubt, Kunta Kinte. It was really interesting to read about his life in Africa, his trip to and his life in America. At first he despises everything that America stands for. He hates the whites because they are white and so evil. He hates the black because they are so stupid that they have given into whites and are letting themselves be controlled by these evil people. They had given up their faith and their traditions and taken part of the whites. He tries to escape four times and then get his foot chopped of. He loses his hope of ever seeing his village or country again and he is determined to keep his religion alive and not to eat meat. (I think that his religion helps him to remember who he really is.) He talks with his daughter about his homeland so that it won't be forgotten. That continues through generations and includes every new person.He is also the most important character if for no other reason than that about half of the book is about him. It starts with him being taken to America. You read about his feelings, his fears and his hatred for other blacks (and toubobs) when he first comes to America. ....This book is very well written and full of emotions. Love, joy, sadness, happiness and a lot of pure hatred.The plot is very believable. This author is very good at describing things. You get an idea about what they were going trough. The places are real and we know that this has happen in our history. The descriptions of the environments are excellent. ...The must have had an unbearable desire to die. The book is written in the third person until he, himself is born. Then he writes in the first person.I think Alex Haley doesn't want us to forget this part of our history but also encourage us to find out more about our ancestors. Your family is the most important thing in the world. They went trough tough times but they got through them because they stayed together.It is not possible to read this book and not be affected in some way."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"&#34;Behold the only thing greater than yourself.&#34;So started Kunta Kinte's life when his father Omoro held him aloft before the African night sky.Tragically within 17 rains (years), Kinte would become grist for the slavery mill as was abducted and forcibly removed to servitude in the United States.As Haley tracks Kinte's life as a slave, and that of those who would follow him, what emerges is not so much the story of the withering adversities of slavery as of the unique and redemptive powers exhibited by those -- his ancestors -- who would overcome those adversities.Part of their ability to overcome those adversities of course existed in the memory of Kinte's original narrative but part also existed in their own individual abilities to rise up and face the challenges that would them until ultimately they would be granted legal freedom from servitude.That legal freedom from servitude of course itself only turned out to be part of a continuing story but it makes this part of the story no less important.This book should be required reading for every American student lest its many lessons be forgotten."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"I am half way through this book and even though it is over 600 pages it is an excellent read!

Had he just presented it as a work of fiction, it would have been just a powerful.As I began reading the book I started to doubt the reality of so much of it, which is a shame because on the whole I'm sure the novel is a very real account of slave life.If I think of it objectively however, the book stands tall as a work of fiction that should be required reading for all children. I just hope they are made to understand that it is not a true account.I wonder what went through Haley's mind as he wrote the last chapter which details his journey researching the novel knowing it wasn't true."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"Roots is the riveting story that traces a black family from the ancestor who was captured by slave traders in Africa and follows the family down through seven generations. An important and worthwhile project that benefits all groups. As Alexander Haley later acknowledged, Kunta Kinte was as much a symbol for all blacks as he was a real person.The later generations received less detailed treatment, and several historical sources of information may have been overlooked. For example, there may be census or other records that verify parts of the story (e.g. Massa Waller's sale of Kizzy), but these are not mentioned."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"this was a long but entertaining book. mr haley took a handful of known facts and wove an interesting tale.my only problem is his not realizing the slavery in kunta,s village was just as wrong as that in america."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"It's a compelling read, but:According to www.martinlutherking.orgWhat's truly amazing, however, is that \\"Roots\\" is receiving a reverential tribute at all. For while the miniseries was a remarkable - and important - piece of television,the book on which it was based has now been widely exposed as a historicalhoax.Unfortunately, the general public is largely unaware of how Haley's monumental family autobiography, stretching back to 18th-century Africa, has been discredited.Indeed, a 1997 BBC documentary expose of Haley's work has been banned by U.S. television networks - especially PBS, which would normally welcome such a program.Coincidentally, the \\"Roots\\" anniversary comes amid the growing scandal over disclosures of historian Stephen Ambrose's multiple incidents of plagiarism. Because as Haley himself was forced to acknowledge, a large section of his book -including the plot, main character and scores of whole passages - waslifted from \\"The African,\\" a 1967 novel by white author Hal Courlander.According to Wikipedia:Alex Haley researched Roots for 12 years; the Roots TV series adaptation aired in 1977. The same year, Haley won a Pulitzer Prize for the book and the Spingarn Medal as well. Haley's fame was marred by plagiarism charges, and after a trial, he was permitted to settle out-of-court for $650,000, having admitted that he copied large passages of Roots from The African by Harold Courlander. In 1988 Margaret Walker also sued him, claiming Roots violated the copyright for her novel Jubilee. The case was dismissed by the court. Reportedly he paid her a civil judgement of $650,000 for plagiarism.Haley's work is controversial for other reasons. He has been accused of fictionalising true stories in both his book Roots and The Autobiography Of Malcolm X. X's family and members of The Nation of Islam accused Haley of changing selected parts of his story.What a shame"},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"...of someone like Kunta who was born and grew up in some black African village, someone who was captured and chained down in one of those slave ships that sailed them across the same ocean, into some succession of plantations, and since then a struggle for freedom.\\"Ten years went into the (p 890) \\"research, intercontinental travel and writing\\" of this utterly entertaining epic, a historical fiction account of Alex Haley's ancestry that spans nearly 200 years. The author rose to the challenge of filling in the gaps that spanned his family's confirmed historical (census, ship, etc.) records. He includes lots of information about African language and culture, slavery, and significant dates in America's history that are relevant to the tale. The story starts in a village in Africa in 1750 with the birth of the one later known to his descendants as \\"The African,\\" namely, Kunta Kinte. Slave traders capture, enslave, and transport him to America as a teen and sell him to a plantation owner. Unless you're very young, or resided on a different planet during the late 70s when the miniseries aired, you know the fate that awaits Kinte for his repeated plantation escape attempts. It'd be wrong to say much more about this superb story, except that it is about the horrors of white humans treating black ones inhumanely, and, ultimately, one slave family achieving the only goal that really matters in such situations: freedom.The 30th anniversary version comes with an excellent four-page biography of the author, and a seven-page Readers Digest excerpt about Haley's writing of the book, especially his real world research to for the ocean-crossing segment. In summary, this genealogical historical fiction novel, a real page-turner, is the best I've read of the genre for its detailed descriptions, wonderful dialogue, and engaging plot.

As Alex Haley takes you through his family tree, the reader is astounded by the intensity of the writing. I was amazed that a human being would do the things described in the book. Beginning with the birth of Kunta Kinte in an African village, Haley takes you through the long journey to slavery - and the long journey out again. This book is both heart-warming and tragic, as this black family struggles with slavery in remembrance of their indomitable African heritage. I would highly recommend this book to those who can handle the truth of our country's biggest flaw - slavery"},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"Alex Haley's superb narrative of his family genealogy ranks with the great works of American writing. Combining fact with historical fiction, Haley (1921-92) begins by describing his ancestor Kunta Kinte from African village life, to the horrors of the slave ship in 1767 and servitude on a Virginia plantation. Few expressions are more powerful than when Kunta Kinte and his wife Bell vanish from the pages after their daughter Kizzie is sold away. \\"Roots\\" then focuses on Kizzie, Chicken George, and other descendants on up thru freedom and the eventual birth of the author. The story fades a bit near the end - Haley was behind schedule and dodging bill collectors as he wrote the final chapters. Still, this is an outstanding and very readable narrative about ordinary (yet remarkable) human beings. Haley even details tracing his ancestry to Kunta Kinte's native village in present-day Gambia. \\"Roots\\" became an immensely popular ABC miniseries in 1977, setting thousands of other Americans to tracing their family histories."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"This is a wonderful and complete story line that has made many people sit up and take a long hard look at family. We have come so far from the importance of true family and what it really means in our society at this point. People have become selfish and thinking only of themselves. But, here Mr. Haley taught us to prize the rich family values one should have about each other, no matter how hard the times are or what situations we find ourselves in. From this story let's just keep family first at home as well as in the church.God Bless."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"Haley wrote a great book. Ought to be considered an American classic if its not already.The timeline moves forward more rapidly after the Kunta Kinte part, which takes up at leas the first one-third of the book. In other words theres a lot of detail about him and his life, then it speeds up during grandson George's lifetime until it is glossing over the day-to-day details of George's descendants' lives. I suppose thats inevitable - Haley could not have written the same level of detail about all the grandchildren, great-grandchildren and the numerous offspring. Haley handled this very well.There are also several \\"cutoff points\\" where the chapter changes and the focus moves completely to the next generation. In other words, when Kizzy is taken away, we no longer hear of Kunta & Bell - the story becomes completely about Kizzy. Then when she gets old, the story refocuses to George's family. We never learn the fate of Kunta & Bell or exactly how Kizzy dies. This literary technique has a melancholy effect, but also leaves some things to the readers imagination. I like it for that.There are some details, for example in dates of things happening versus the age of characters. But if you avoid looking for age/date contradictions, they won't detract from enjoying the book. Other little details include mentioning use of barbed wire on a plantation (invented by a Frenchman in 1865 and didn't enter widespread production until 1874-ish), George bathing in a galvanized tub before his marriage circa 1840(galvanization entered widespread use in the late 1800s), and the \\"old Gardener\\" Josephus describing Indian's teepees to young Kunta (the Eastern Woodlands tribes built wigwam huts - they did not use the conical teepees he describes of the Plains Indians, who were barely known to the colonists at that time, circa 1790)...All these are minor details, of course :)......Please bear in mind this is a work of FICTION. Haley himself intended it that way; however the book has been spotted on library shelves in Biography or Geneaology sections. That is incorrect - the details of what happened 200 yrs prior could in no way be researched reliably enough for this work to be non-fiction or a true biography.There have also been scholarly challenges to Haley's claims that he found his ancestral village in The Gambia, and to his genealogical research (its now known that Kunta/Toby arrived earlier than 1767 or was in fact born in America, and died years before Kizzy's birth. Also that the slave with the injured or deformed foot was a man called \\"Hopping George\\", possibly unrelated to the Haley line. And no evidence his foot was cut off as a runaway).So Haley's claim to descendancy form Kunta/Toby is speculative. But this book will capture your imagination.(For some details about criticism of the book, see Wikipedia. Just don't let that stop you from understanding the purpose of this fine work)."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"Disclaimer that I have not read the original and the review is meant for those looking to buy the abridged audio book. The narration starts with the life of Kunta Kinte which is probably the best part of the book whose sudden loss of freedom, gradual acceptance of slavery and a forced identity is gut wrenching, and continues well to the life of Kizzy his daughter. The narration loses intensity once Chicken George grows up, with too much details on cockfighting, and less focus on the human angle which made the Kinte episodes gripping. To my disappointement, the Civil War times were glossed over too quickly and thereafter almost became a rapid reciting of names of successive generations and their occupation, till we reach Haley's generation.My suggestion, if you have not read the original, go for the unabridged version."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"Ever since I was little I saw the book laying on my parents small make-shaft book shelf and time to time I would look at the exterior and the size of the book with awe. One day a friend of mine brought this book back to my attention and I'd purchase it at my local book store. Alex Haley's 'Roots' is fantastic. It captures generations of love, tears, pain, strife, sacrifice, as well as happiness engulf close to 700-something pages.I found myself getting so involved and moved by the characters' stories that I often had to put the book down and there were parts in there that just broke my heart and I swore I didn't want to read it anymore but instead it took me in further. Throughout the entire book I observed a repeating pattern of events that allow me to think about how for generations a family could hold on to their faith, beliefs, and traditions no matter what. Also, throughout this long life-span journey of Kunta Kinte and his proceeding family tree, and their experiences with the opposing lives of free-men and slaves, the author presents a precise central idea or opinion that is past down from generation to generation.This central idea is so clearly emphasized by the title of the book. Alex Haley's opinion on the importance of a family or individuals roots or origins is much similar to the necessity of roots for the survival of plants; that provide anchoring and support. Not only did Haley believe that roots played a key roll in his life and the life of his entire family tree, but that in some cases it is the only noble aspect of life that one could be proud of, as it determines his identity.I am totally supportive of the author's opinion, as us human beings sometimes are stripped away from our natural and civil rights and are left with nothing to hold on to but the spiritual and historical pragmatic aspects of life: roots, origins, faith, and religion. I love the style it was written with and the determination it instills not only to me but to anyone who reads it. Since this book is a classic, it has withstood the test of time. If you have a lot of time on your hands, I would recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"I thought it could have used more tight editing in that it was a bit long in places. The portion in Africa and the boat ride over for instance took almost 200 pages and dragged in places. Regardless of that, I couldn't put it down. I found myself staying up late night after night to read it. The amount of work and dedication Mr. Haley put into this is phenomenal. Although my family didn't come to America until the late 1800's on my dad's side and the early 1900's on my mother's, I'm still ashamed by what the early settlers here did to the African Americans and Native Americans. I can't wait to watch the Mini-Series now though. I can only hope it was true to the book."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"Alex Haley is to be congratulated at this well researched and stirring family saga. Just the fact that he was able to use his family's oral history to trace this wonderful story is an achievement most modern authors are unable to lay claim to. And it is a fabulous story, rich in detail and for the first few generations after Kunta Kinte we really get to know the characters.But it is the very fact that we know intimately only the first few generations that makes this fine work lack something. There is a disproportionate amount of time focused on Kunta Kinte, and whereas this is important, as his is the most harrowing and heart rending story, I feel it takes a little too much of the book. And towards then end, the characters get barely a mention. I should imagine that Alex's father has a story which is equally worth telling, but the latter generations are glossed over. I would really like to know more about these people too.So it is a magnificent achievement, easy to read and riveting. But it loses steam about half way through, and there is little flesh in the story towards the end. I do recommend it - it is a justly famous and wonderful book - I just feel it misses the opportunity to have been a truly spectacular book"},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"Last year, when I was only a few weeks into being 12 years old, I had to read this book out of needing to for school, and curiosity of what could be in a book so long. and I was simply amazed.

There are too many chapters about Kunta Kinte in Africa and in Virginia, and there are too few chapters about the last two generations preceding Haley himself.Each successive generation is memorable: there is, of course, Kunta, the native of Africa. His only daughter, Kizzy, is sold away and raped by her new master. The son begotten from that rape is \\"Chicken George,\\" an accomplished cockfighter. His part is my favorite.Chicken George has many children, chief among them Tom, the blacksmith. Once the family is freed by their masters and moves to Tennessee, the book picks up pace, going over two generations in the same amount of print used to describe Kunta's miserable, horrific passage across the Atlantic. These generations are less memorable because the book moves too quickly at this point to give juicy details. And the final few chapters, chronicling Haley's research, is gratuitous and self-aggrandizing.Aside from a slow first two acts and abrupt ending, Roots is excellent, character-driven story-telling. I don't mind that there factual errors (that scholars have pointed out) and much of the meat of the story is a novelization of Haley's \\"roots.\\" Go in regarding this is a novel, which it is."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"This product is a very excellent book on CD for those who are interested in black genealogy.

It also shows that the cruelty of slavery in America could not suppress the spirit of black people to be free or the hunger of black people to know their African roots. Even though most black Americans might not know exactly who their African ancestors were, they could look to Alex Haley's ancestors Kunta Kinte and his parents, grandparents, and so forth as a symbol of their own African ancestors."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"Love reading this book after so many years!

The fear of kidnapping from Africa, The terrible realities of the middle passage, and the life on the plantation. IT made me realise what they endured so that I would be here today. It's made me reflect on the ancestors from wence I came, and made me say &quot;Thank you for surviving.&quot; Haley must have been moved by his work as much as I was, to have written it with such passion."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"After the african part which unfortunately didn't catch my attention, the story of slavery in America over several generations was really worth the read. The two main reasons are that the talented and awarded author manages to show us touching characters and gives simultaneously many glimpses into the american history. A history that we Europeans (I'm French) often ignore but which Haley gives me the desire to learn more about.By the way, the biography of Malcolm X by the same writer is also worth a read"},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"The story that traces the lives of the generations of black slaves in America reveals the cruelty of humanity that has been forgotten and ignored. Through the gripping tale of the slaves, readers can identify with the emotional trauma that they are going through with that of yesteryears. They are so real and human and inevitably leads us to wonder what has or has not changed over the years. Surprisingly, what that has apparently changed and forgotten has merely taken on another form, maybe worst then what one can expect"},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"I won't get all into detail in this review.

Naturally, it is a story based as close as possible to the facts as possible. Who cares if there are some small mistakes is his writing. He succeeded in doing what no man Black or White or any other color or natural origin had done before. How many of his critics could boast such a legacy. He had gone where no man had gone before him in 500 years here in these United States. So, bow before him to show him your respect. Trust me, if he could have gotten all of his facts straight, he would have. It was not he who had erased his history, but rather, the enemy did it. We all know who the enemy is in the slave trade scenerio."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"Hey everybody! Check out the review by MICHAELHA13. The whole review concerns his defense of American slavery. So, I click to get more information on him. The only review he's ever done is this racially motivated review of this classic book. Then I go into his Wish List: he wants to purchase over 20(!) books on Confederate generals and leaders! And he hasn't bought any, so he must not have any money. And he spells poorly, also. Hope he stays in Texas. Check him out! (By the way, Roots by Alex Haley gets 5 stars from this humble reviewer.)"},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"I have read Roots (cover to cover), four times.

I will continue to recommend it, and am sure to read it again too."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"I first read Roots in 1977 and, after watching the tv series, I knew that I needed to re-read it. Without the horror of slavery (free, lifetime labor with no chance of escape), I don't believe American would have evolved into the superpower that it is. It's a well written account of Alex Haley's family tree starting in Africa with the capture of his 6th generation grandfather @ the age of 17-&#34;rains&#34; (years). The African tribes lived in strong, deeply religious communities, whose survival depended on their interdependence on each other. The unspeakable horrors began when thousands upon thousands of Africans (men, women, and children) were kidnapped and shipped all over the globe to work as slaves for their masters. This is a book not only about slavery's inhumanity but, perhaps more importantly, about the need for us to respect and connect with each other and with all life on Earth."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"I enjoy lisening to the story because i can take it with me and read it without my glasses anywhere"},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"Roots is a well-written novel that underscores the tragedy of the lives of an American family all the way from their African roots, an area many authors neglect. Roots not only spotlight and personalizes the cruelty and indifference which their family endured and overcame, it also manages to do so in a way that is not accusatory but engages the reader. Ithought it especially poignant that the family tried so hard to cling to their African identity and yet lost so much of the rich culture, ironically focusing on elements that Kunta Kinte would have found trivial. It is an excellent example of how people, of African descent or not, lose so much of their culture's uniqueness in their scramble to be modern, or worse because modern culture forces it upon them."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"This has always been my favorite book!!!!

The story itself is great, as the author pulls you into the lives and feelings of his characters. The fact that it is based on true events is just amazing.

Reading this book again as a middle aged person, who spends a lot of time working on family history, brings new perspective and depth to the story. What a great read."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"the history classes we take in school gloss over this horriable time in our country. reading this book makes you understand their pain ,losses ,and how hard their fight was to win freedom. it is a very heart wrenching story of truth."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"This is a great book that anyone can connect to and also a great look back into the history around the family."},{"Title":"Roots -","review":"A great story of an American family finding their roots.

The characters, setting, dialogue/dialect, and virtues are classic Porter; the issues and values are timeless; and the thought provoking manner in which she concludes her story leave one considering their own lives on a deeper level. Well worth a few hours of reading(one of her shorter novels) and several more of soul serching to follow. A highly recommended book for young and old!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"At the Foot of the Rainbow","review":"This book does not have the quality that I am use to reading in her books.

They formed a major part of my platform for ethics and values, without me even realizing it. You might not love the dated language and settings as much as I did, but it's worth the time to reacquaint yourself with a world that was quaint and tender and untouched by technology. The stories are timeless and the conflicts continue in the human condition today, so the stories never disappoint in their plot and character--even today."},{"Title":"At the Foot of the Rainbow","review":"If you enjoy literature of the early 20th century which holds truths as well as entertainment, try a novel by Jean Stratton Porter. At the Foot of the Rainbow, offers a wholesome story of love, love lost, and the plight of life in the early 1900's. It's certainly worth the time to appreciate excellent penmanship and creativity from a woman far ahead of her time."},{"Title":"At the Foot of the Rainbow","review":"I enjoyed this book overall but found the plot line to be much darker than the other books by this author that I have read.

Mr Sawicki provides more detailed information than a person can get from the Army Lineage Series (these focus on &quot;active&quot; regiments and do not provide a complete history).The book lists all Cavalry Regiments in numerical order and gives historical dates, and examples of the distinct insignia.

I give a copy of this book to every new staffer who comes to work in our office, and tell them it's mandatory reading. Simply put: Mr. Oleszek's book is the single best reference out there for students and citizens wanting to learn about the ins and outs of how a bill becomes a law. What makes the book a must-read is not just the author's experise in understanding how Congress works, but also his ability to write extremely readable prose."},{"Title":"Congressional procedures and the policy process","review":"If you are new to the Hill, this book is a must desk-side companion. It is a practical guide that steers a Hill staffer through the rules, norms and processes of the Capitol complex. The House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate are institutions where knowledge of process is more highly regarded than understanding the issues under debate. Olezek underscores that fact. His book has been must reading for congressional staff for a generation, and it continues to be the first among equals today.Anyone thinking of working on the Hill or studying U.S. legislative processes would do well to begin here."},{"Title":"Congressional procedures and the policy process","review":"Congressional Procedures and the Legislative Process is one of those books for which the concept of applying a star ranking makes little sense. On one hand, the author obviously knows his stuff and is able to provide a clear, coherent overview of a difficult topic. On the other hand, the topic itself is punishment and anyone reading it other than a would-be DC staffer, journalist or lobbyist is probably wasting their time. (I shudder to think of someone assigning this as a textbook, but professors must, as I don't see how there would otherwise be a large enough audience to justify a new edition every three to five years.)This book provides an overview of how legislation is forced through both houses of Congress, how the two houses reconcile conflicting versions of the same legislation and how they, in theory, provide oversight over the executive branch. The bulk of the book is on the first part, the traumatic birthing experience of legislation in both houses. The book is almost entirely devoid of any attention to what would be an ideal, or even sane, process creating good laws. Instead, the book, written by a long-time staffer at the Congressional Research Service, looks at legislation from the perspective of legislators, which seems to be that law-making is war by other means. As a result, the book focuses heavily on tactical maneuvers that can accelerate and stall legislation -- and that mainly means stalling legislation. The rules that facilitate these tactics can be quite arcane, arbitrary and exceedingly baroque.These rules seem to be the author's lifelong obsession, in the way that someone else might memorize batting averages of professional baseball players. For him, they are infinitely fascinating, though his presentation of them is decidedly practical and unemotional. Nonetheless, he seems discomforted by the increasing partisanship of Congress, and the growing individualism of the Senate in particular.In short, this book is likely a must-read for anyone who has a pressing professional need to know the innards of the Hill. To try to maneuver Congress without this book is probably akin to trying to participate in French Parliament without knowing French. But if you're not actually going to use knowledge of Congressional procedures in your work, then you'll likely forget the contents of this book within minutes of setting it down as it is so technical and obscure.A review of the seventh (2007) edition, though the newer eighth edition is probably equally dated as it was published before the passage of Obama's health care reform package which required some creativity with Senate rules."},{"Title":"Congressional procedures and the policy process","review":"This book is a great read for those seeking to learn more about how our congress does and does not work.

This book along with &quot;Under the Tuscan Sun&quot; from France Mayes will create a shortage of houses and lodging in the years to come in Tuscany. The good news is that it serves the Italian economy and in your town. After reading the Hills of Tuscany, you will want to travel in Tuscany and experience the way of living of the Italians. Also, you will want to make Italian friends, to buy more funghi, pasta, pici at your grocery store. I almost suspect that such books is sponsored by the Italian tourist bureau.

After occupying a series of dwellings a \\"houseboat, sailboat, mountain cabin, that garage in Laguna Beach, the attic in Paris, the cubbyhole in New York, and a whatsit in the Bahamas,\\" the Hungarian-born Mate and his artist wife, Candace, deemed it time for a permanent home.Central Italy's countryside, where \\"Everything was small to the measure of man,\\" beguiled them; there \\"reigned the gentle Tuscan light, and silence, and a calm.\\" They became contentedly sated by \\"pranzo,\\" the four-course daily meal that resembles in quantity \\"our average Thanksgiving dinner,\\" and decided to buy a farmhouse, to put down roots in the idyllic Tuscan hills.Their enchanting dream was a challenging task. Mate spoke no Italian and was woefully ignorant of the vagaries of an agrarian existence. Nonetheless, he set about his search for their perfect home with a Quixote-like zeal, undaunted by a real estate agent cum undertaker who stored his listings with names of the recently departed in a shoe box. A parade of touted homesteads in abject disrepair didn't discourage him. Collapsed fireplaces and gaping roof holes were the norm. Mate zigzagged his way across unfamiliar terrain, following unmapped rutted paths, bouncing over rocky roads until he found his utopia, \\"a structure with perfect rhythm.\\" La Marinaia The Sailor's Wife. Once that purchase was accomplished, attempts to have utilities turned on introduced him to an implacable, inscrutable Italian bureaucracy. It was explained that there are an almost infinite number of regulations in Italy, \\" . . . many dating from Roman times, some contradictory, some incomprehensible.\\"Settling in also meant becoming a part of the nearest town, Montepulciano, \\"built for humans not for cars, so the main street was just wide enough for conducting daily affairs, evening promenades, and small festive processions.\\" The couple delighted in exploring closet-size shops run by often absent, usually amiable owners. Their nearest neighbor welcomed them with fresh goat cheese covered by a large fig leaf, and they attempted to improve their Italian by watching Telegiornale, the local televised news an \\"Italian version of reality, a flexible amalgam of fresh headlines, old footage, and clips from Steve McQueen movies.\\"More than an enthusiastic tribute to the ever astounding beauties of the Italian countryside, \\"The Hills Of Tuscany\\" is a paean to the pleasures of the palate as Mate describes in rapturous detail ravioli stuffed with ricotta and wild mushrooms, crostini spread with tuna and capers, rabbit ragu \\"spicy with tomatoes\\" plus a legion of dishes bathed, basted, stir-fried, swathed in or caressed by olive oil. He is also unreservedly passionate about the local wine, \\"wine as robust as the clay,\\" \\"wine with a deep complexity that tingled all the taste buds.\\"Today, Mate lives with his wife and young son at La Marinaia, tending his olives and vineyard. It is there, he writes, that \\"we learned to live and enjoy life as the Tuscans do piano, piano, con calma.\\" Slowly, slowly, with calm. The author's enthusiastic prose is infectious.

While a good book, it bugged me to a certain extent - perhaps because of the slight odor of elitism that was contained within the pages. Mate, on the other hand, invites his readers with him on a more intimate, personal journey. His wife is not reduced to some distant other person who happens to be with him, but is a partner. We get as much of an impression of their life together as we do their life in Italy. I enjoy this book immensely, and it gets reread quite often, especially when I'm feeling all too American."},{"Title":"The Hills of Tuscany: A New Life in an Old Land (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"If you liked &quot;Under the Tuscan Sun&quot;, you will love this book. Both books describe how an American couple settles in an old house in Tuscany, and the obstacles they had/have to overcome.Where they differ: Mate and his wife live in Tuscany for good, and I would think that therefore they have a perspective which is a little bit different, more wholesome. I also slightly preferred Mate's book because he writes with a down-to-earth sense of humor, making it easy for the reader to relate (when he describes his first attempts at understanding the speech of a native Tuscan, for example - quite a humbling experience for him!). But like the &quot;Tuscan Sun&quot;, this book is a declaration of love for Tuscany, its landscape, its people, and its delicious food.All in all a very enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"The Hills of Tuscany: A New Life in an Old Land (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"I've read most of these 'move to Italy(or France)' books and can say without reservation that this is my favorite. The writing style is delightful and really funny, and the author and his wife are truly likable people (he adores her and doesn't speak about her like the odd chair observed from afar like Mayes refers to her mate.) You feel very much in the middle of all the activity, because he feels that way... a nice change from the other books. The warm and giving 'Italian personality' comes through in all these books, even seen from so many different views, but in this book it blends so closely with the author's own that it is less 'reported on' and more part of the fabric of his story. He is truly at home in this place.... which means he doesn't have to tell you that. The Hills of Tuscany has a refreshing warmth and reality that make it stand out in this category. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Hills of Tuscany: A New Life in an Old Land (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"Okay, I'm on a roll here. Under the Tuscan Sun by Frances Mayes, On Rue Tatin by Susan Loomis, At Home in France by Ann Berry, and now The Hills of Tuscany by Ferenc Mate, and I recommend all. This one's a bit weird though in that it goes on for just over 100 pages leaving me cold and feeling like it's missing something (lacks heart somehow), and like possibly the author just wrote it for the cash. The recounted dialogue also seems stilted. It's meant to be witty but somehow doesn't ring true. Then Ferenc and Candace find their dream house (yes, it takes over 100 pages to get there!) and somehow the tone begins to change. As the chapters pass from this point and the Mates interact with their Italian neighbors it becomes much warmer, more full of heart, and actually a good read I wouldn't hesitate to recommend. It's now left me with the impression that the author wrote it over the years and his skills as a writre improved with time, yet he didn't go back and clean up the earlier chapters which are strangely dry and lackluster. The chapter about the neighbors killing a pig was also interesting to read just how prosciutto was made, etc. Great meals, wine-making, domestic settling in, the clever and timeless ways peasants do things (all lost to us Americans and we're so much the poorer for it), etc., it's all here, just like all the books in this genre, but thankfully it lacks the tone of feeling superior to the locals that some have. Get through those first 100 or so pages and stick with it. It's a pleasant read after that. Now I'm off to read Mate's new book (2000) called A Reasonable Life: Toward a Simpler, Secure, More Humane Existence, as that's EXACTLY the place I'm at in my life at 42 after leaving the New York City rat race for a simpler existence (the rats were winning) after seemingly going into an office 10 years ago, sitting down at a computer, and realizing ten years had gone by, lost forever, and I'm no better for it really, and it's not the life I want or the way I want to live, so now I'm back home in California, putting in my own kitchen garden (potager), etc., and MUCH more fulfilled at the end of each day. The American &quot;efficient&quot; way of doing everything (houses and shopping centers like ugly barracks, food in plastic from a grocery that lacks flavor and aroma, etc.) is robbing us all blind of a rich life, and I for one want off the treadmill to success and to go back to the older and richer ways, hence my interest in these types of books now, and my appreciation for what Mr. Mate has written here."},{"Title":"The Hills of Tuscany: A New Life in an Old Land (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"I've read many many new and old books about Tuscany and other parts of Italy and this is my very favorite. A sweet romance is told along with giving the reader a somewhat secretive map of the region. If you take the time to figure out the north south east and west directions imbedded in the story, you may be able to find several little known and delightful places in and around Montepulciano and even all the way over to the Tuscan coast.

I was wrong. Mate's light style and discriptive passages of the search for the perfect Tuscan house rekindled my own personal desires. Mate doesn't dwell as much on the restoration of the dwelling itself where Mayes goes into great detail, but rather concentrates on developing more human contacts and connections. That may be more due to the fact that he and his wife are permanent residents and not just summer and holiday transplants. That gives this book a more personal touch and I think gives the reader a clearer sense of the wonderful Tuscan people than in Mayes' efforts. Mate also lets us know how strong his love is for his wife, and that so much of the joy of living in this part of the world is that he gets to share it with her. One has to admire their resolve in moving to a counrty where neither speaks a single word of the language, but for someone else who has strugggled to communicate in a foreign land, I could relate to their difficulties and take joy in their triumphs.

To me, this book seems more realistic than \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\" in facing the challenges of finding a new home in a foreign land and culture.

Last May I was in Montepulciano and we walked to the small village of Monticchiello, where as Mate say &quot;in the finest Italian tradition, instead of giving directions...&quot; we were lead to the house of a shop owner who's shop was closed. That brought tears to my eyes. It was wonderful to re-walk the street and plaza of Montepulciano and better yet to experience life there through the eyes and hearts of people who are open to wonderful new experiences and people."},{"Title":"The Hills of Tuscany: A New Life in an Old Land (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"This is really a tiresome, banal litany of predictable cliches about living a life of luxury in Tuscany. The first half of the book is about how he and his wife look for a house, while the second half is mostly about food. Everything, of course, is absolutely perfect--the tuscan light, the tuscan hills, the tuscan food. This book is kind of an unintentional parody of the genre.It's also poorly written. Mate has almost no descriptive powers per se. He just tells us how sumptuous everything is. He also uses hyperbole so consistently that his observations become pointless. I thought a book like this would be interesting, but it's just self-indulgent and dull."},{"Title":"The Hills of Tuscany: A New Life in an Old Land (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"I, too feel that the book is poorly written. I had to go back several times to clarify what was being discussed and who the author was speaking about. If you know a little about Tuscany, it is a very enjoyable book to relive moments when time was spent there. The vivid transformation in the mind of memories past is always enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Hills of Tuscany: A New Life in an Old Land (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"Growing up \\"Italian\\" and surroundings that consisted of family, culture, gardens, cooking, food and wine, I was looking for something to satisfy my curiosity for a complete story of Italian Life around Tuscany and the wine vinyards. Browsing the Amazon web site, I came across three books, written by Ferenc Mate, titled: \\"The Hills of Tuscany\\", \\"A Vinyard in Tuscany\\" and \\"The Wisdom of Tuscany\\". I purchased all three from Amazon at a very reasonable price which included free shipping. I read the books starting with \\"The Hills of Tuscany\\" followed by \\"A Vinyard in Tuscany\\" and \\"The Wisdom of Tuscany\\".Ferenc Mate first two books delived for me a very strong look into Italian life within Tuscany. It gave me a strong feeling of being in Tuscany with Ferenc Mate as he described a desire to begin a new life as a land owner and resident within the vinyards. I especially enjoyed reading about events leading up to and the purchase of a house. I loved the talks and preparation of the various Italian foods that I am so familiar with.The most interesting of the three books was \\"A Vinyard in Tuscany\\". That was the book that really resonated with me. The Author describing the trials and tribulations of his search for land to grow a vinyard, the house, foods and last but certainly not to be minimized, the Author's wife Candace.I must say that as much as I enjoyed the first two books, I felt that I was let down because the Author, Ferenc Mate did not mention the price of the house and vinyard land. I felt cheated.The last book \\"The Wisdom of Tuscany\\" was a disappointment. I had the feeling that the Author rushed the book. It was below the level of the first two."},{"Title":"The Hills of Tuscany: A New Life in an Old Land (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"I've read a stack of books on living, working or travelling in Italy. Most of them have been pretty good, and some have been superb. Ferenc Mate's attempt at describing the trials and tribulation of living in one of the most stunning regions of Italy is a rather dull read, churning out the same tired cliches in a not very well written series of experiences we are supposed to fawn over. Not me. Having been fortunate enough to have stayed in Tuscany many times I can vouch for the stunning beauty of the landscape and architecture, the simple joys of food, friends and wine surrounded by such ravishing scenery. Mate does not convey this very well and the reader is left turing the pages wanting something to fire his imagination but instead is left bored and un-inspired. When reading a book I usually mark a passage or a phrase I like with a light pencil line. This is about the only book on Italy I have that has not got one such indication. All in all, it's an insipid, banal read compared to the envy inducing descriptions of Italian life in other books."},{"Title":"The Hills of Tuscany: A New Life in an Old Land (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"I've read both Frances Mays two books and I found my soul taking flight to Tuscany to find that bit of peace and happiness that only my mind has put into form.Someday I'm going to take this mind trip and make it into my own special reality."},{"Title":"The Hills of Tuscany: A New Life in an Old Land (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"A disappointment. Almost everything in here has already been said in so many other books written about Tuscany. The only difference is that Mate and his wife have even fewer adventures than the other people who have written about the region. Hard to believe how many rave reviews are posted here. Did everyone read the same book? There must be a dozen better books with the same premise."},{"Title":"The Hills of Tuscany: A New Life in an Old Land (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"By the time I got to the end of this I could have cheerfully murdered these two smug ratbags. Everything was so perfect, everybody was so kind, everybody loved each other, nothing bad or nasty ever happened (Oh, I'm sorry, there was the time they were woken by a barking dog) and all that bloody food! I was quite queasy after the tenth description of these gluttons just stuffing themselves day after day with pat&eacute;, salami, pasta, rabbit, chicken, sausages, wild boar, pork, lamb, cherries, strawberries, potatoes, pheasant, prosciutto, figs, chestnuts, guinea fowl, ten different cheeses, wine, grappa, coffee, tarts, cakes, mushrooms, bread, chicken livers, tuna, tiramisu.Alright we get the picture! The food here is good for Christ's sake!Everything was over-described to the point of parody. At one point he couldn't even hose down the brick patio without going into a paroxysm over the earthy smell of the wet bricks permeating the entire house.There was one hilarious moment when I thought the village was burning down. He launched into a typically purple bout of rhetoric using phrases like,'I expected to see the dark town with faint lights against the sky, but instead saw the lower part of town ablaze with orange fire. The houses and the towers were black against the light, and some houses glowed, others were swept with flames, and the flames shot through the belfry of the steeple and the bell hung a stark black ....'A bit later it is revealed that it was only the moon rising and it was a kind of orange colour."},{"Title":"The Hills of Tuscany: A New Life in an Old Land (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"Mate's book about his adventures in buying a home in Tuscany is wonderful reading. He makes the experience very personal to the reader...made me want to go find him to help me buy a home in Italy. The food and the neighbors were all things I would like to experience myself. I could taste the fresh olive oil, I could envision the sight of the truffle-sniffing dog finding the pig. Hilarious, yet some moments were very poignant. I did not want the book to end."},{"Title":"The Hills of Tuscany: A New Life in an Old Land (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"I would have bought this book just for the beautiful photo on the dust jacket (which makes you want to leap, Alice-in-Wonderland-like, into the picture). If you have read Under the Tuscan Sun, it will be impossible not to compare the two, but these are definitely different perspectives of Tuscany, written in distinct but equally enjoyable voices. If you have already read Mayes's book, Ferenc M&aacute;t&eacute;'s will draw you once again into that languid, colorful world, filled with wonderful tastes, smells and sights. (I worry that Tuscany will be overrun with American tourists. I know that if I don't get some pici with funghi soon, I may faint from hunger!) The M&aacute;t&eacute;s have actually lived year-round in Tuscany since the late '80s, and this book explores their early years of finding a house (already restored), furnishing it, making friends and learning the local ways; his self-deprecating descriptions of bumbling through learning Italian and doing things like cutting hay are very funny. I find it astonishing that his prose is so fluid and easy-to-read given that his first language is apparently Hungarian. Candace M&aacute;t&eacute;'s small illustrations throughout are just wonderful. (On another note, just from reading his short bio on the dust flap, I'd really like to see Mr. M&aacute;t&eacute; write his life story, from his escape from Hungary through his many careers and moves. I think it would be fascinating.)"},{"Title":"The Hills of Tuscany: A New Life in an Old Land (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"This book is the most fun I've ever had in Italy without actually ever having gone there (even though I'm a long-time Tuscanophile!). Ferenc Mate presents a vivid and vibrant celebration of Tuscany's gorgeous land, its fabulous cuisine, and uniquely friendly people, with a gentle humor and a personal touch that show his immense affection for the place and its inhabitants. This book is a wonderful preamble to a trip to Tuscany, or (in my case!) a fantastic armchair read!...And if you need a traveling companion next time, Ferenc, let me know! ; )"},{"Title":"The Hills of Tuscany: A New Life in an Old Land (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"As a second-generation Italian-American, I'm getting tired of the subtle patronizing attitudes that some prosperous expatriates to Italy emit via their memoirs. Reading this book, I felt that Ferenc Mate truly felt a genuine empathy with Italians. His ability to laugh at himself, and with his Italian neighbors -- not at them -- was a superb aspect of this work. He seemed to understand that being at home in Italy requires more than merely hobnobbing with other expatriates, and absorbing their prejudices. As a writer, I appreciated the book's style as well as substance. My hope is Mr. Mate will soon write a sequel."},{"Title":"The Hills of Tuscany: A New Life in an Old Land (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"Books on foreigners living in Italy seem to have become a genre unto themselves. In the past year I've read Francis Mayes' \`Under the Tuscan Sun' , Tim Parks' \`Italian Neighbours' and \`An Italian Education', and now Ferenc Mate's \`The Hills of Tuscany'. All are of interest to those of us who regard Italy as the finest country in the world to pursue the simple pleasures of life. The list of things that are better in Italy - food, wine, towns, landscape, people - is just too long and convincing to allow for any other point of view. Its virtues have been so often stated - as they certainly are in all of these books - that they seem like stale cliches, ripe for the assault of skeptics.The skeptics may have a field day with the early chapters of \`The Hills of Tuscany'. Mate lays it on a bit thick as in this passage about a meal on the Mediterranean coast: \\"The thing I lust for more than Tuscan food is Tuscan seafood. It is cooked simply with olive oil,salt and black pepper, sometimes parsley and garlic, perhaps a splash of wine, and rarely - on the heavier flavoured sardines or tuna -with capers or tomatoes or olives. My god, I'm like Pavlov's dog just thinking about them all.\\" There's no getting around it - he gushes. Not cool. Paradoxically, this passage also illustrates his strength - the quick, deft descriptions of food, places and people that immediately ring true, i. e. that reflect some of my own experiences in Tuscany.The book is really in two parts - finding the perfect house in Tuscany and then living in it. The first part is a day by day narrative of the ultimately successful search. His writing about it is not so successful. The trouble is he either gushes or he plods. There are flashes of the glory to come in his sketches of the people and places but he never really makes it seem very interesting.I'm a little embarrassed by this criticism because Mate sent me a pre-publication copy. Basically, anybody who loves the historic hills of central Italy is Ok in my book. But not sui generis a good writer and I was beginning to despair of Mate. Then he finds the house just outside of Montepulciano, next to Cortona my favourite town in ye olde Tuscany, and he starts to cook, literately and literally.In the second part of the book he gets down to what he does best - well crafted descriptions of the place and the people. Mate's writing and his wife's diminutive sketches beautifully illustrate the myriad details that fascinate visitors to Tuscany. His sometimes treacly enthusiasm is soon overcome by his ability to sketch a scene with accuracy, brevity and effortless emotion. Here, for instance, he writes of a neighbour's kitchen: \\"In it, under the vast, clay-tile hood, are two small benches facing each other across the flames.\\" His few words immediately evoke exactly the fireplace I saw in the rustic Banfi winery near Montalcino. Anyone who doesn't stop and marvel at the culture that created this primordial symbol of home should be banned from Italy for life. Tourists come to see the staggering amount of significant western art in the churches and museums. The inveterate Tuscan traveler comes to see what Mate illustrates - the world outside the churches and museums.His descriptions of his neighbours and their largely edible traditions are the high point of the book. He gets to know his neighbours, to share their labours and the fruits thereof. And what fruits - proscuito &amp; pasta and fresh yellow chickens, wine from the vines growing in the garden, truffles in the forests surrounding his house. The earthly delights are endless and visceral. And he doesn't go to some snooty restaurant with waiters in too shiny shoes. No, he goes next door or just cooks it up a home.Not that I'm a food snob or know bugger all about wine. But I know good food when I eat it and I've eaten it in Tuscany, at almost any kind of place you can imagine from a 3 star restaurant to a supermarket takeout. But heaven in Tuscany is having your own kitchen and shopping in the countless vegetable shops, butchers, enotecas (wine stores), farmers cooperatives - even going to an organic farm, as we did, and following the proud farmer around while he plucked and pulled out of the ground inarguably fresh eggplant, carrots, potatoes, herbs and wine, Well, he didn't pull the wine out of the ground but he made it himself from the vines right in front of us and it was great. Nothing quite matches cooking in your own, if only for a couple of weeks, rustic kitchen and over indulging under the warm, starry sky. There are few more satisfying experiences in life outside of driving a Ferrari from Monte San Savino to Sienna on the twisty back road. Which I have never done so the food will have to do.Francis Mayes' instant classic \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\" made me wonder why someone who had not been to this part of the world would buy it. It's a lovely book but I read it because I wanted to know more about a place that fascinates me. Does Tuscany have the power to fascinate even those who have never been there? The sales figures would suggest that it does. It must work like a chain letter - someone who has been there tells someone who hasn't about the book and the power of literate description does the rest. Now we have Mate's book. When I started it, I thought it was an attempt to capitalize on the popularity of Mayes. When I finished it, I realized that it was an entirely different perspective on a many faceted subject. Where Mayes is ethereal and reflective, Mate at his best is earthy and true. His neighbours sound like some of the people I've met in Tuscany. His descriptions of the towns and countryside take me back there. And the food. Good god almighty, his description of the food could put pounds on a supermodel.Mate's is not the kind of book to carry around with you in Tuscany. It's sparse on traveler's details, perhaps because he doesn't want even more tourists clogging up the landscape. It is meant to be read before or after your trip to savour the pleasures to come or to bask in the warm - I guarantee it - memories of your journey."},{"Title":"The Hills of Tuscany: A New Life in an Old Land (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"This is a lovely book for anyone fascinated with the Tuscany region or anyone who has the travel bug and can't get away at the moment.

This book was much more down to earth than Mayes' book, being heartwarming, funny at times (the endless search for the &quot;perfect&quot; farmhouse), and poignant. The Mates' worked hard to become one with the local people (which is the difference between the Mates' and Mayes). This book makes me long to move to Tuscany!"},{"Title":"The Hills of Tuscany: A New Life in an Old Land (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"Ferenc Mate follows in the tradition of people writing passionately about Italy. Almost on a whim, he and his wife decide to move to Tuscany, uprooting their former life and relocating before they have found a house or learned much of the language. Luckily, as a writer and artist, respectively, Ferenc and Candace both have work that travels easily.The two wade through the notorious Italian bureaucracy involved in searching for and purchasing a house, eventually finding and settling into an idyllic farmhouse. Ferenc and Candace gradually adapt to their new home, adjusting to life in Italy with the help of friendly neighbors and townspeople.The joy the Mates feel is contagious, though tinged with jealousy in my case. Perhaps the most enjoyable aspect of this book is the couple's love for one another, blossoming in this beautiful setting and radiating from every page. A gorgeous tribute to a lovely place."},{"Title":"The Hills of Tuscany: A New Life in an Old Land (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"Imagine my surprise upon arriving in Montepulciano and pulling this book out of my luggage, one I had quickly grabbed at the bookstore before leaving the U.S. It served to be an excellent guide to the area and I was intrigued enough with the descriptions and drawings in the book to hunt down the house near San Biaggio. I did find the house one hot August afternoon after asking locals and was told that I was only one in a stream of tourists that afternoon looking for the house.

Instead of the dreamy &quot;only the wealthy who can afford 10 contractors and gardners can enjoy this land&quot; books about Tuscany here is a book with grit and truth. This is an every man book - with wonderful humor and feeling. You can really put your self in Mr. Mate's shoes and enjoy the story of his leap into Italy. Its realism and wonderful descriptions make me want to read it again and again. Where is the sequel - the next 10 years? I for one am waiting with baited breath."},{"Title":"The Hills of Tuscany: A New Life in an Old Land (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"Here is a charming book that will take you on a year long journey of life in the Tuscan Hills. Mate has done an excellent job of capturing the ambiance of the area. One can almost feel the warmth of the Tuscan sun, smell the olives as they mature and hear the buzz of cicadas floating through the night air.For mushroom afficanados Mate describes the find and the preparation of these woodland morsels in words that only a mushroom hunter can heartfully appreciate. For the rest of the world, there is the opportunity to simply savor the well described flavor and the joy of the mushroom hunter -- which all Italians seem to be.And, speaking of food, the author has captured the menus of Tuscany and the preparation of many home gourmet dishes; the gathering of the grapes and the making of wine; the butchering of a pig and the making of prociutto, sausages, head cheese and a host of other products coming from swine.Meet Pasquale, Anna, and a other locals in Mate's well developed characaters. It's easy to imagine them living next door, chatting in the trattoria, or cursing the bull that got away. These folks have wisdom gleaned from the time continuum and indelible personalities. Highlighting their development are typical Italian phrases the reader is likely to hear upon visiting the region.This book is a must read for anyone wishing to take a vacation in words or prime themself for a trip to wonderous Tuscany."},{"Title":"The Hills of Tuscany: A New Life in an Old Land (Thorndike Nonfiction)","review":"God I loved this book...It made me laugh(out loud at times) cry a lot as well.Happy tears..

The author invites the reader into the home he and his painter-wife created from an ancient farmhouse, into their warm friendships with neighbors, and into the festive celebrations of the seasons, all highlighted with the luscious cuisine of Tuscany. Included with chuckling humor are Mr. Mate's struggles with the move to a foreign country, with the hazards of mastering a foreign language and with learning to live in a farming community.

You do not have to concentrate as there is a very thin plot and characters are the same as all the other Tuscan books you ever read ,you can pick it up and put it down and never loose the meandering tread. The syrupy description are a little too sickly and the author's effort at being self effacing doesnt really come across as being funny,its all too cutesy and chummy. The down fall of this book is the smugness of the couple and their attitude to their surrounding,its is trying to paint a Picasso by numbers and it shows.

Although I thought it was great, many people would not get a lot out of it and certainly would not get the same things out of it that I did.The book is about balancing family and professional life. I did not fully \\"get\\" the book as one underlying assumptions of people who talk about balance is that they do not like their work. This is an assumption I cannot accept. I am also of the belief that most truly successful people are not very balanced.What I did get from the book was the continued importance of being real regardless of ones position. There is a tendency in life as one becomes more successful for everyone to shield them from the bad news. There is a temptation to talk and lose the ability to listen. Part of the key to continued success is to not lose the ability to listen.The book is targeted towards members of congress. All of the examples and advice is centered around public life. It talks about how the job changes the person (something I believe). The key is to have control over what changes you allow.One quote used is \\"too soon old, too late wise\\". My quest for wisdom continues."},{"Title":"To Live Among Wolves","review":"This book is in the style similar to Daniel Silva books.

Ten months later, an early morning call has him back in the office of his old division chief, Lou Stark.Hank Ingalls, a top field agent who knew more about nuclear proliferation than any man alive, and the man who once saved Sean's life is missing. The Agency, that had fired him right before he disappeared, will not authorize anyone to look for him. Determined to try and find Hank despite orders not to, Lou turns to Sean, knowing he could be trusted to do the job without worrying about be bureaucracy might say or do. After all, when he lost Jennifer, he lost everything in his life that mattered.Now, with few leads other than reports that Hank was killed by a lion near Zaire, Sean sets out to find him. Searching through Hank's files, Sean discovers that highly classified reports are missing, removed by high-level government bureaucrats. In order to recreate the files, Sean decides to start his search in Germany, Hank's last assignment.There, Sean picks up a trail that leads him to Zaire, to an Odessa-controlled research laboratory that is preparing nuclear weapons. Sean, with the help of Mossad agent Rachel Allon, local businessman Jean-Pierre Bolenge and his niece, attempt to stop the Nazis and their Arab co-conspirators before the nuclear warheads are unleashed on Israel, a fact known to the U.S. Government who is prepared to destroy Israel in order to hold on to the Arabian oil resources.A good fast read, \\"To Live Among Wolves\\" contains a lot of background information on the behind the scenes workings of the CIA and how the Agency finds itself losing the power to go about its business by the watchdogs on Capitol Hill who worry more about what's in something for them than what best serves the country's security.Book received free of charge."},{"Title":"To Live Among Wolves","review":"Alan Simon's novel keeps one on the edge of one's seat.

Also, very brief entries; for example, when you look up a noun in the English-Slovak section, the dictionary provides a Slovak word but not the gender - one must then go to the Slovak-English section to see the noun's gender in Slovak. (perhaps this is obvious for a more advanced student). It is also a bit strange that in some cases the English-Slovak translation does not appear in reverse in the Slovak-English section.Unfortunately I haven't found a good dictionary at a good price for Slovak, as there are for other languages. If you are a serious student, I think you will want to spend more for a better version. As a very basic reference, this book is a good value."},{"Title":"Slovak-english, English-slovak Dictionary","review":"If you are looking for a book to help translate actual slovak, look some where else.

This one is terrible. The typeface looks like it was photocopied from a typewriter and the binding is bad.More importantly, it is exceedingly limited, having none of the necessary information about gender or any detailed information about the words (as in, if there is a word in English with two meanings in Slovak, it will just list the two options and not say which goes with which meaning). There are not many English-Slovak dictionaries, but this might be the worst. You can get much better ones in Slovakia or maybe on the internet.

To one familiar with the C/C++/Java/C# line, VB and VB .NET are really irrelevant."},{"Title":"C# and the .NET Platform, Second Edition","review":"I'm mystified how this book managed to get a 4 star rating. I got this book not too long ago, and maybe made it through half before shelving it with a smirk on my face. This book was *way* too simple to even deserve the name on the cover let alone being printed. That's the main thing: too simple, laughably simple. And even for beginners - get that stuff for free anywhere. And I completely missed the .NET part of this book. Then we can get into the disjointed authoring that continually repeats things and shoddy editing. That's much more realistically where this book stands in my opinion.But I can't get over how many positive reviews this thing gets calling it a &quot;great book, saved me time&quot; and blah blah blah. In fact, I got to all these APress books and they have almost the same reviews over and over again which makes me think some kind of faceless marketing is going on here.

But god that book's boring, the author always repeats himself and often uses \\"let's assume you want...\\" expressions. Bloody annoying. Moreover I don't like the fact the code's incomplete. If you want to properly learn C# you need complete code, if not for Internet and dowloading the code you would be f***ed. So, yes that book is pretty okay but far from being The Classic!IRNBRU"},{"Title":"C# and the .NET Platform, Second Edition","review":"This book helped me to understand the concepts of C#.It is presented in a VERY CLEAR Enlish language. To better undestand the concepts and language references the author is using excellent TEACHER's technique:the same coding examples are modified based on what needs to be explained in the chapter. Excellent and clear language definitions for C# (also very helpfull comparison with C++,COM,DCOM). It does not have many practical programming experience and nice tips/tricks to work with C#. But I was not targeting the book as 'show how to program in OOP'. I do have many years of that type of habit. What I needed is to undestand the concept, learn the language syntax and then,of course , I am able to write with my style(as C++ coder) the needed business tasks/applications, and then go into depth of knowledge of .Net as C# programmer.Excellent book for programmers who would like to see the whole picture of C# possibilities and language references in ONE BOOK.Easy to read, easy to understand and great to start with. For details on programming tips and code - use internet and your experience and...vu a la...enjoy writing your solution for the business needs.

My only experience before learning C#, was an introduction to programming college class, all in Java, in which I earned an A.Since C# is almost identical to Java, in terms of programming syntax and object oriented priciples, I was worried that the book would be bogged down with a ton of repetition. Surprisingly, it was not; the author does a great job of quickly and efficiently explaining the simple syntax and OOP of C#, so that an experience programmer can get a quick refresh of the things he/she already knows, while also introducing the nuances of C#.Of course, this book is not meant for programming newbies; however, you definatly don't have to be an advanced programmer to understand it, at least not the first few chapters, which deal with the basics of the language.After the first 4-6 chapters, the book gets into the more advanced C# language details, explaining advanced C# programming details and .NET stuff.Honestly, I haven't read the whole book. I read the first 5 chapters, and was able to start developing programs. As I ran accross situations calling for C# parts I hadn't yet learned (in particular windows forms and threads) I just jumped in and read the corresponding chapters. This is why I think the book is great. I was able to jump into chapters anywhere in the book, after reading the basics of C#, and easily and effciently learn what I needed for the programming project.In addition, the book explains how to use Visual Studio for C# throughout the book, which is great if you are using Visual Studio.I tried to use &quot;Microsoft Visual C#.NET 2003 Kick Start,&quot; another C# overview book, to learn threads. I soon realized the BOTH consise AND thorough nature of 'C# and the .NET platform' when confronted with Kick starts explaintions. Kick start seemed to rush through explaining threads, providing pretty much an explainion of the syntax. Instead of explaining the foundations and details of C#'s methodology with threads, Kick start substitutes in annoying example code, breaking API calls up into wierd unique classes and methods, as if giveing a method I have never seen before a different name is going to help!Again I say, the C# and the .NET platform book has copius supplies CONSISE code. The author doesn't waste time provideing elaborate examples, which intermingle all kinds of details into one. Instead the author uses the bulk of his 1000+ pages to thoroughly and thoughtfuly explain/examine the world of C#.To conclude, I really enjoy this book's consise and thorough presentation. I believe it is great for both learning and as a resource. It is not a learn-how-to-program book, but at the same time it isn't some macho-Im-already-a-freaking-C#-master...ummm...book."},{"Title":"C# and the .NET Platform, Second Edition","review":"Troelsen covers the material well, but is irritating to read. The book must have been, like so many technical books, on an impossible schedule. I hope that's the reason they ran out of time to edit the text.Cliches and redundant phrases litter the text like weeds in a thicket. A thousand pages should have been five hundred. It's probably the best C#/.NET book out there, but it doesn't deserve five stars."},{"Title":"C# and the .NET Platform, Second Edition","review":"Andrew Troelsen is a great writer. His writing style is very easy to read and enjoyable (and how often is a technical book enjoyable?) The example are well thought out and interesting.

I hope Andrew comes out with a new version when the next version of C# arrives."},{"Title":"C# and the .NET Platform, Second Edition","review":"Occasionally you read a book and the writing style and content just grab you - it's as if the author is writing at exactly the level you're at. For me, this is one of those books.I've done a lot of Java and Windows C++ programming and wanted to jump into .Net, C# and ASP.NET and this is was the perfect source for me. The language, the environment (.Net CLR, etc.), the classes and ADO and ASP.NET are all explained well and thoroughally. Comparisions are made to pre-.Net techniques (COM, ASP, etc.) for doing things and the .Net/C# way and the benefits are shown. Most obvious details are skipped (they're easy to look up if required)and more interesting ones drilled down into.For instance, I've been failing away with my first ASP.NET application, playing with ASP.NET Web Matrix and consulting random web sources for examples/class info, etc. and having some success by not getting the big picture - there is &quot;magic&quot; going on under the covers and to really understand ASP.NET you have to understand what the system is doing for you. I then read ASP.NET chapters (not thinking at first this book would even cover it), and the whole ASP.NET scheme became crystal clear - after an hour of (great) reading I have what I need to know in depth. It couldn't have been more clear. When I was done the chapters I was so elated that I wanted to find Andrew's email address (I haven't been able to yet) and personally thank him - it was that good.Note: I had also read 'Programming ASP.NET' and the two chapters in this book on ASP, in my opinion, are much better than that whole book.The ADO.NET chapter was also amazingly clear, describing in detail the rational behind the classes and interfaces in that area."},{"Title":"C# and the .NET Platform, Second Edition","review":"As someone who is making the switch to C# from MFC/C++, I find that this book is an excellent primer and reference.

For the longest time I never understood why I kept getting frustrated whenever I read this thing. It finally hit me - the book is somewhat of an anomoly. On one hand, it misses some major areas of .net functionality (doesn't even cover xml document creation nor COM interoperability) and on the other hand it goes into excrutiating detail on other points. A lot of times he will start a topic off by going into a lot of detail - but then will admit that he is explaining something very obscure that 99% of people may never need to know. My question is - then why cover it? Cut out some of this obscure stuff and put in some more of the topics that most people would encounter. Although I have painted a negative picture so far, there are some areas where this book really shines. I am finding that as I progress from being an intermediate to advanced c#/.net developer I am starting to appreciate this book more.In summary, I would recommend this only as a 2nd or 3rd book to your c#/.net collection - there are too many holes in the text for it to be considered a primary text (I personally fell in love with Wrox's Professional C# - 2nd ed)."},{"Title":"C# and the .NET Platform, Second Edition","review":"This book is not for beginner programers. It is excelent for people coming from VB, C++ or Java. It gives you a solid base on the .Net framework as well as the C# language touching both at the same time but in a coherent manner. Of the more specific subjects touch in the book the one on Data Access is ourstanding. It is also a great book to do from start to finish as the layout of the chapters favor this. You may want to supplent this book with a book for specifics about web technologies (I can recommend Programming Microsoft.Net by Jeff Prosise) and one dealing with data access (Microsoft ADO.NET Core Reference by David Sceppa is a good choice)."},{"Title":"C# and the .NET Platform, Second Edition","review":"First, I would like to thank the Author, Andrew Troelsen for writing such an excellent book on C#.I have read several books on C#, but this book I am reading word by word, sentence by sentence.

The Author has taken a full advantage of his experience in teaching. He has structured this book accordingly.The author has mentioned, this book is for the developer who already has some expousre to modern object language, but I feel this book can help beginners who wants to learn C# and .NET technology.If you want to learn more about C# or enhance your existing knowledge, this is the book. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"C# and the .NET Platform, Second Edition","review":"Andrew Troelsen's C# book is a readable, well-organized introduction to programming in C#. The content is interesting, and covers a useful range of topics, but several of the chapters leave you wanting more detail, such as the chapters on ADO.NET and XML Web services. Despite its thickness, this really is an introductory book because it gets into just enough detail to get you acquainted with a topic, but not enough detail to give you a deep understanding of the topic.This book is best suited for people who want conceptual discussions and full sentence explanations, and for people who want a more gentle introduction to C#. If you are a more experienced developer and are looking for more of a reference text then this is not the book for you. In this case, I would recommend G. Palmer's \\"C# Programmer's Reference\\" (Wrox Press) (or reference the C# language specification itself).I am giving this book 3 stars for three reasons. One, the level of detail was good, but not spectacular, and many of the chapters left me wanting to know more. Two, I didn't get a strong feeling for the \\".NET Platform\\" aspect of the book. Certainly, the book covers a range of .NET framework classes, but you don't really get a good feel for how everything fits together, because the book covers so many topics. Finally, many of the code samples are presented in the text as incomplete snippets, taken out of context. For example, many of the code snippets are missing the \\"using\\" (imports) statement that tells you which .NET Framework class it uses. Since the book is about the \\".NET platform\\" I would have expected more attention to this detail in the code examples. The other drawback is you can't copy them into a project as you read along because they are out of context.In summary, this book is a very good introduction to C#, but is not a great reference book, and will leave most intermediate (and above) developers wanting more."},{"Title":"C# and the .NET Platform, Second Edition","review":"Weeding through the massive number of C#/.NET books on the market, I found that many are too bulked out with long code listings and screen shots, don't have enough focus on higher level architectural issues, or are written in a dry, unreadable manner._C# and the .NET Platform_ turned out to be exactly the book I was looking for. Excellent balance of architectural background with tight, exact code examples that go straight to the point. Troelsen's conversational writing style makes this book an easy read. I found it to be very well-organized, with topics that built upon each other nicely.I also appreciated the presence of comparisons throughout the book of C#/.NET features to C(++) and Visual Basic 6 features.

This book is particularly well suited as a training book for the novice programmer (If read front to end) and as a reference for experience programmers. The only topics I missed are no-touch deployment applications and smart phone applications which are relatively new and may be slightly off-topic for this book. However, if Andrew is writing a revision to this book and includes these and newer topic such as generics I'd LOVE to proof it :) hint hint...

A good example would be chapter 12 on .NET remoting, which I just finshed reading, though the coverage is not as deep as those found in the books by Don Box and Jeffrey Richter.In the early part of the book on the C# language, the author often refers to and compares C# with VB .NET, which is unnecessary and distracting.

The exercises are of progressive order, each one building on the materials from the proceeding one. Each exercise includes simultaneous instructions for the left and right hand so that technical progress of both hands is assured. The musical exercises and written text are of equal importance.This book introduces new concepts, such as the position of the right hand and string registers, and analyzes important aspects of violin technique.The totality of the ecercises amalgamates all of the basic technical elements of violin playing. However, Violin Technique does not preclude other musical material. In fact, the concise exposition of these exercises assumes the concurrent study of a repertoire of pieces that involve the technical problems discussed in this book. Theses exercises yield the best results when technical and musical problems are treated together.--- frim book's back cover"},{"Title":"The prosecutor","review":"James Mills, in his work of non-fiction, THE PROSECUTOR, covers three cases worked on in the 1960s by NYC prosecutor James Mosley. The first case is an example of Mosley's plea bargaining and obtaining an admission of guilt from a burglar/murderer.The second is an examination of the difficulties Mosley had in the prosecution of Alice Crimmins in the deaths of her children, a well-known case at the time.While these first two cases are well presented by Mills, I didn't find either of them especially compelling. There is a book solely about the Crimmins case, and while I have not read it and can't vouch for it, the case itself would likely be more interesting written as a complete book with Mosley's work part of the content. But these two segments cover only a total of 38 pages.The remainder of the book, 148 pages, is about the murder of a small-time loan shark, hit man, and gangster named Ernie \\"The Hawk\\" Rupolo whose body was found floating at a Queens County beach in 1964. This section is just fascinating. The Hawk's life is covered extensively using interviews with his brother, his common-law wife, his mob cohorts, and including extensive previous interviews of Rupolo himself, and Mills paints a vivid picture of not only Rupolo, but of \\"the life\\" in general. The story moves on to the machinations Mosley and the police used to investigate Rupolo's murder and to bring the accused, predictably another group of mobsters, to trial. The trial itself is particularly entertaining, featuring, as it does, competing groups of wise-guys, the prosecution's being a highly bizarre group of men who have been offered various deals for their testimony, and the gaggle of defense attorneys, whose styles and abilities varied widely, in interesting and amusing fashion.Mills is an outstanding writer, reportorial without being dry, creative without being fictional. I have removed a rating star for the first 38 pages, which, while certainly not bad, are also forgettable. But I highly recommend THE PROSECUTOR for the section on The Hawk, a truly wonderful piece of work."},{"Title":"John Paul II: Lessons for Living","review":"Pope John Paul II shares honors with Billy Graham in terms of evangelism and religious life.

His son Magnus D'Armand follows in his father's footsteps by traveling from one lost colonial planet to another fermenting revolutions so that eventually democracy will come to the local residents. Magnus has visited six worlds in his artificially intelligent spaceship Herkimer. He has guided people on all six planets on a path leading to democracy. On the planet Midgard, Magnus selected a companion with psychic powers to join him on his quest.Magnus under the guise of Gar Pike and Alea land on a newly discovered lost colony that seems to have no centrally managed government. However, Gar is uneasy because in his experience, a country with no governing body should lead to chaos and anarchy. Traveling as peddlers, the duo finds happy contented people abiding by the Ten Commandments in each village. Only the outlaw General Malachi and his army of thugs stand in the way of peace. However, Gar thinks there must be more to the power structure than he or Alea see.Magnus is the most fascinating and enigmatic of the brood sired by Rod Galloway (see THE WIZARD IN SPITE OF HIMSELF). His tale is narrated in a fast-paced, breezy, and humorous story line that shows him in a new light due to his interactions with Alea. The audience will care for both characters as they join them on their travels.

I applaud Stasheff's restraint in not forcing the relationship between Magnus and his companion, Alea, into an overly predictable direction. Each character remains true to his and her strengths and weaknesses. The story, which involves Magnus' continuing mission to help oppressed peoples find the government best suited to them, gives Magnus a world where there appears to be no visible government, or rather, not one he can classify. Like the other books in this series, the story is self contained, and makes you want to learn more about Magnus. To catch the WHOLE story, one should read the Warlock Series which begins in Warlock In Spite Of Himself."},{"Title":"A Wizard and a Warlord: The Adventures of the Rogue Wizard","review":"Christopher Stasheff is an author who's works I usually enjoy reading.

This book brings to light those attributes that the world views as virtues, but in reality keeps us running so hard and so fast that we forget how to slow down, and rest ourselves in the Lord.

She shares from her own experience, as a recovered perfectionist, and also from the experience of other female perfectionists and her humor is enough to make ANY perfectionist lighten up! A very well written analysis of the Martha/Mary styles.

I was shocked, is this how she viewed me...too busy, stressed out, maxed out?! Yes, this book is me to the tee and Debi has a humorous way of dealing with us Marthas. The book showed me how out of balance my life was. It made me stop and think about priorities. I now have permission to relax, let go and live a much more balanced life.

What a relief and joy to discover that God made me this way - that he has a use for me - and that I can choose to loose the &quot;over the edge&quot; perfectionism and achieve a balance, love myself, my family and those that God has placed in my life! I am so relieved to know that I don't have to do it all and that I can enjoy life.

So, as a bona fide, card-carrying, clutter-oriented messie, I was surprised at how much I identified with the author's struggle. Perfectionist parenting and post project depression are common for many of us! Thanks for the reminder that an out of balance life doesn't honor the Lord, regardless of which side we fall on."},{"Title":"Martha to the Max: Balanced Living for Perfectionists","review":"I gave this book FIVE STARS hands down! I love how this author hones in on the ever-challenging struggle us Christian women have between naturally being more like Martha in our own flesh vs. wanting to be more like Mary who willingly takes time to put God first and sit at His feet first every morning. After reading this book I see now that if I am surrendered to Christ and to walking in the Spirit over my own flesh....I can be the BEST of both Mary who sits at Christ's feet and listens and is taught and the BEST of her sister Martha who is more project and task oriented in the details of her day.My favorite line in the book is on pg. 20 because it describes me and how I lived before reading this book: Debi writes, \\"Like Martha, I am tempted to perfect my own personal kingdom not seek the kingdom of God. Like Martha, I tend to view life as a series of projects, not a path toward knowing and serving Christ.\\"I am so pleased to boast that by applying many of Debi's ideas and with the Holy Spirit's help I regularly participate these days in THE GREAT SUPERNATURAL exchange of trading in my days dominated by walking in my flesh as a type A, O-C (obsessive-compulsive) Martha for a transformed life of walking in the Spirit (the best of Mary and Martha) as my new *normal*!Like Debi before I was intentional and prayerful about living for God, I too was misguided for decades by admiring the unrealistic ways of such type A, O-C Martha perfectionists. But living this way wore me down and zapped me of contentment, zeal and joy! I thank God for Debi and her eye-openig and life-giving book and for her candid and transparent willingness to share her hard-earned lessons and battles so the rest of us may learn easier and quicker than she did! I enjoy Debi's humorous and honest approach willing to laugh at herself! I too use to judge harshly the type B's and viewed them as the lesser and very lackadaisical compared to us superior more competent classic Type A perfectionusts! Like Debi I skimmed over the scripture \\"Pride goes before destruction\\" and self-destruct I did which tends to happen when you live your way and not God's way!But I am happy to report I am much closer to sharing Debi's motto these days of \\"PAMITP\\". . . what on earth is that you ask? Well it stands for Peope Are More Important Than Projects! This book is a MUST READ OWNER'S MANUAL for any Type A, O-C perfectionistic Martha's out there!

It is an honest book with true stories that do not try to cover up Debi's search for that &quot;one good thing&quot; Jesus asked Martha to discover.

To the woman barely dangling at the end of her rope, Debi throws out a lifeline of solid Biblical insights and practical solutions for simplifying life's maze, while amplifying its meaning. This book is filled with help, hope, and humor, all borne from Debi's personal challenges and successes. Because of her willingness to change with God's help, Debi progressed from living maxed-out, to living to the max-from experiencing the fracture of many things to enjoying the fulfillment of \\"one thing\\" and the One Who really matters.

My only critique is that it spends MOST of the book outlining the problem and very little time talking about the solution. And when she did get to the solution it was only in vague terms.

And she answers the question...\\"Why is Martha so bent out of shape?\\" The stories from the author's life, and those of friends, made people stop and ask me why I was laughing so hard. My two favs, the young couple preparing for the family BBQ and Milly's cats \\"swaggering through the food encrusted dishes, like tiny Cleopatras walking through piles of gold.\\" I must have read that part to 10 people and I cried with laugher ever time!

The partisan rhetoric was ill-informed and certainly overused in the book. Not only were many of the statements grossly exaggerated and incorrect, they disrupted the flow of the story.Perhaps these rantings were added to disguise some of the predictable turns in the plot. Patrick you are a Bad Dog."},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"I read this book on the advice of friend. I was very disappointed. There is a reasonably good story, but the writing is second rate. The are many technical errors. There are a multitude of needless and mind-numbing destriptions of minutia that do nothing to advance the story. This train wreak of a book is further worsened by the author's parroting of the far right's view of the world and his mindless jingoism. If that wasn't enough, 90% of the book reels along like a drunken sailor, only to have what should have been 50% of the book jammed into the last 10% of the book.Save yourself some time and don't read this piece of tripe."},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"This book has a very good idea from the conceptual standpoint. The trouble is the good part of the book is only 50 pages long. I kept trying to figure out how the author was going to cram all that was needed into the few pages remaining and of course he couldn't. Why he spent the first 300 plus pages developing a character is beyond me. He could have done it in the first fifty pages and left the rest for good stuff. If you enjoy Kilo Class and USS Seawolf you will not enjoy this one. If you must read it wait for the paperback or go to the library. Now if you want great submarine books try Michael DiMercurio as no one does a better job under water."},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"I have read previous Robinson books and they were ok but this story is absurd. To believe that a major in the SAS would become a arab terrorist and to hide a boat in the Panama Canal when there are millions of square miles of ocean to hide it is stretching the imagination.I have read many cheaper books that were miles better than this.I don't think I will read any more Robinson books. Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"Having read a couple of previous efforts by Patrick Robinson (Kilo Class and HMS Unseen), I thought perhaps I'd stumbled across a half-decent new author. Those books weren't wonderful, but they were decent bathroom reads. Unfortunately this book is nearly unreadable. Robinson's political diatribes become extremely tiresome, and he spends long stretches on pointless dialogue and descriptions. At one point he takes a full page describing a Navy staffer's commute to the Pentagon for a crisis management meeting. The story frequently bogs down with these needless interludes.There are massive plot holes, and plot points that are so unbelievable as to be laughable. The prison escape, the Chinese plot to hide the submarine in the Panama canal rather than scuttling it in deep water, and the US Navy's impotence in the face of attack are a few examples.I gave it two stars rather than one because the plot was interesting. But it could have been so much more."},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"Robinson has been a very good writer. I have listened to a lot of his other work. (Btw, Guidall does a killer Morgan, everyone should hear it once)However, I agree w/ other reviewers' comments fully about this book's shortcomings: Clinton, politics, hard-to-believe political plotlines, etc. I was especially disappointed by the rehashing of the oil-futures-doom plotline that was very similar to the oil-futures-doom plotline in the &quot;Shark Mutiny&quot;.I hope Robinson is also disappointed by this work and brings us,in his usual style, a winner next time."},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"An SAS commando, skilled at unarmed combat, leads mideastern terrorists to strike America with cruise-missiles. Ray Kerman joins British special forces, barely aware of his Islamic past - his Iranian parents blended into British society. On assignment monitoring Israeli Forces in the West Bank, during a pitched battle between guerrillas and IDF, Kerman meets the beautiful Palestinian Shakira. Faster than you can say \\"I feel the ancient Muslim within me\\", Kerman joins Hamas. Now called Ravi Rashood, he he convinces some Iranian mullahs to buy 2 Barracudas - Russian Sierra class nuclear subs that haven't been used in years. Armed with cruise missiles, one of the subs will sneak up to our Pacific coast and blast American petro facilities with missiles. On the home front, Admiral Morgan, the National Security Advisor, and Lt. Ramshawe, a young intelligence officer, link Kerman, Hamas and the mysterious sale of the twin Barracudas.\\"Barracuda\\", the worst book I've read since \\"Shark Mutiny\\", is even worse than Publishers Weekly warned - full of meaningless digressions so mind-bogglingly irrelevant, they don't even rise to pedantry and must be read to be believed. The submarine idea doesn't even materialize until nearly half-way through \\"Barracuda\\". Until then, Robinson tells the story of Kerman/Rashood - his upbringing, his training and his improbable conversion to terrorist. Spectacular attacks Rashood commits earlier in the book are supposed to lead to his missile-sub plan, but that idea sounds like something Rashood's Iranian backers could've thought up. (Nothing in Kerman's SAS background explains how he alone dreamt up the plan or even knows a thing about subs). Earlier exploits are meant to be spectacular (including a daring breakout from an Israeli max-sec prison housing hardcore terrorists) but suffer from Robinson's inept story-telling and in any event never connect with the plot to attack the US with cruise missiles.Robinson seems unable to remember what \\"Barracuda\\" is about - while Rashood travels to Iran, he writes about an Iranian missile boat, a Chinese cruise missile, and that the missile's engine was built in Toulouse. Neither the missile nor the boat will figure in any action. The science of driving and hunting submarines is barely touched on, but you can count on Robinson's chillingly plausible depiction of an Iranian breakfast menu. Robinson will often introduce a large cast of characters - reciting their names and positions - but has them do nothing. Robinson must think that I'm the only techno-thriller fan who believes that accurate technical details should be used to further the plot, rather than demonstrate the author's wealth of trivia. His fans supposedly overlook stylistic flaws in favor of purportedly explosive plots and plausibly accurate details. But there's nothing realistic, explosive or even very new here. Robinson (and others) have done the \\"rogue sub\\" plot to death (\\"Kilo Option\\"), and you can get more convincing and visceral stuff in Clancy, Craig Thomas, Mercurio and DC Poyer. The laughably implausible dialog in which a Russian submarine ace conveniently explains the workings of a modern nuke-sub read like a chapter from \\"nucular-sumbarine wahfair fer dummies\\", and only highlight that Robinson has less of a feel for warships than their performance specs. Nothing explains Shahood's immediate preference for the Barracuda over other contemporary Russian subs like the Akula or Oscar, and Robinson doesn't give enough nuance to the science of warships to explain Barracuda's special lethality (The real Barracuda has reportedly been laid up since being seriously damaged by colliding with the attack sub USS Baton Rouge in 1992, about 16 years before \\"Barracuda\\" occurs). Credible? British forces accompanying Israeli commandos into Hebron? A beautiful mideastern woman named \\"Shakira\\"? Chinese who speak pidgin? Islamic types who don't sound very Islamic as they do singularly anti-American? Islamic terrorists who can get support anywhere they look in the Islamic world? Plausibility?Robinson's writing is mostly mediocre, which only softens the impact of his true howlers: \\"It was a face of high intelligence\\"; \\"That Siberia's a bloody big place. Gotta be the biggest place in the world\\"; Morgan's car speeds \\"like a meteor across the moon\\"; and my favorite, this paradoxical description of a missile attack \\"Never mind comparisons with an atomic bomb, they could very nearly have seen this in Hiroshima\\".To top it off, Robinson replaces his immature political incorrectness with a more mature brand. Instead of sobriquets \\"towelhead\\" or \\"chink\\" heard throughout \\"Shark Mutiny\\", Robinson unleashes a more understated and quaint brand of ethnic cleansing in which Muslims are utterly alien to the ethnically homogenous west. Kerman's Islamic past is kept secret until he joins Hamas. Once revealed, Kerman's origins shock British and American leaders who, despite sizable Muslim populations throughout their countries, are mystified that a Muslim might actually have made his way into their top echelons. Robinson's political bent is also laughable, targeting liberals who gave the Panama canal away to a red-Chinese controlled conglomerate, made GPS more useful to terrorists, and kept us hooked on foreign oil by blocking oil-drilling in Alaska for environmental reasons. I could accept Robinson's conspiracy theory linking the PRC to the Panama Canal if the Chinese actually did anything more than act as middlemen for Kerman. In contrast, his Americans seem much more ambitious when Morgan and crew gleefully strong-arm the President into sabotaging the Panama Canal as part of a plan to re-claim it for America. I'm Yankee, but couldn't help feeling disturbed by the image of US gunships orbiting the Panamanian capital to ensure Panama's president signs a treaty ratifying the turnover. Though Robinson obviously hates Clinton, his Republican president looks like a clueless puppet, easily swayed to sign anything Morgan and crew leave on his desk (It's like \\"Leave it to Beaver\\" in the Oval Office - \\"Hey Beave - let me borrow the 82nd Airborne this week\\"). Robinson refers to Clinton as the current President's predecessor, even though \\"Barracuda\\" takes place 8 years after Clinton left office. With its horrible writing, unbelievable characters and nonexistent \\"realism\\", this \\"Barracuda\\" should sleep with the fishies."},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"There are two big premises you have to swallow to get the plot started off. First, that British SAS Major Ray Kerman (raised in England for more than 25 years) would suddenly switch sides and join Hamas and return to a culture he barely conciously remembers. Second, that destroying a major part of the U.S. oil production industry would make us -withdraw- from the Middle East. If you can suspend your disbelief to get over those two mountains, the rest of the hills aren't as hard to climb.One premise that I completely agree with is that terrorists can win the \\"War on Terror\\" by focusing on destroying -things-, not people. That is a basis for the operation pursued by Ray Kerman, aka Ravi Rashood. Killing people brings down the wrath of the hurt nation very quickly. To avoid this, force them to spend tons of money on security and on replacing damaged -things-. Keep attacking infrastructure until they have no more money to pursue you because it's costing so much to guard and secure resources at home.The action is slow getting started, but finally moves along into a fact pace just before you hit the end of the book. I was quite uneasy when starting the book because it focuses so much on the villan. We hardly even meet the \\"good guys\\" for over 100 pages. I kept thinking to myself, \\"If this is the main character whom I'm supposed to empathize with, then this is totally the wrong book for me!\\" There are quite a few characters who make comments that are not politically correct for a Democrat reader, but then not every reader is a Democrat! I happened to agree with many of the comments and thought several were quite witty."},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"As a reader of Mr. Robinson's previous books - which were not bad - I picked up Barracuda 945 from the public library with expectations of a solid exciting read. Sadly, this book falls far short of Mr. Robinson's previous work.The short answer for this is that Mr. Robinson doesn't stick with what he knows - submarines and submarine warfare - but instead ventures into realms where he reveals himself as ill-prepared and/or biased.Namely;1. politics. Mr. Robinson often deviates from the plot to interject mini sermons on the evils of 'weak liberal presidents' who, when they gain power, neglect US military and foreign affairs to the detriment of our own power (which he sees as a very bad thing. Further, he degenerates into sermon-y rants when the subject of the 'little ******* Chinese communists' comes up. Politics is never a black and white affair and his portrayal as such is disconcerting.2. religion. He makes an effort to show some dimensions of the complex Islam culture and religion, but again, his efforts fall flat and thus his attempts to prevent his book from degenerating into an US vs Them affair in actuality highlight that conception due to his poor understanding of Islam culture and beliefs.3. the overall scenario. Mr. Robinson's book is based on the hypothesis that one nuclear submarine can single-handly destroy the US energy economy. He fails to take into account the fact that the US does currently, in fact, have vast reserves of oil stored away in the event of such a crises. So while in his book investors panic and gas prices over quadruple, in reality our government would take steps to mitigate the crisis.4. characters. Every one of Mr. Robinson's characters is a stereotype. His characters are not interesting, extremely predictable, and often behave in manners not befitting the offices he distinguishes them with. I was very disappointed about this.The only saving grace to Mr. Robinson's book is when he gets into the details of the ships and his combat descriptions. Because he does have a large amount of knowledge about military equipment and can write up a tasty fight scene fairly well I am giving Barracuda 945 three stars - though I may be giving him the benefit of the doubt in a few areas. I think Mr. Robinson just deviated from what he did best: submarines and combat, and tried to bite off more than he could chew.All in all, it was a hard book to finish and for Mr. Robinson's next book I will read the reviews first before picking it up."},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"Plot a little far-fetched, but I can suspend reality for the sake of entertainment if necessary. Problem was, there's little entertainment. Enough right-wing cliches about Clinton to make a Bush supporter vote for Howard Dean. And the ending, well, there is no ending. They might was well as had on order form at the end of the book to pre-order the sequel."},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"What do you say when an author takes a good plot and mangles the execution?First, the research is falty. The author has no idea how the US would react to this type of threat. Has he nbever heard of AWACS?Second, the author seems to think more words are better. A little background is nice during a story, but why pad everything?Third, a black and white view of politicians is both childish and self-defeating. The author made the characters seem clueless in his voice over political tirades.Fourth, misplaced jargon makes the story ludicrous in places. How many English/Iranians use California pop expressions?Fifth, the dialog in general is pittiful. Words and phrases chosen for educated characters are weak, trite, and Bush league. (Sorry, could not resist.)"},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"While it is difficult to believe the premise of the book, it is carried out so well that I suspended my disbelief and got caught up in the story. The premise is that the Chinese purchase a nuclear powered submarine from the Russians and turn it over to a crew of terrorists, who launch the non-nuclear cruise missiles against economic targets on the west coast of the United States. The targets are all in the energy industry, with the goal to force the U. S. to buy more Middle Eastern oil at inflated prices, some of which will be funneled to the terrorists. Neither Russia or China would ever do such a thing, as their very association with the submarine would be an act of war and invite massive American retaliation and worldwide condemnation.However, the secondary premise is credible and is one of the most frightening scenarios that could happen. An extremely intelligent and well trained commando murders two of his comrades and joins the Islamic terrorist organizations. He immediately rises to the level of commander and alters their strategy from that of suicide bombings to one of meticulous planning, training and execution. Their operations are extremely successful, leading to a meeting with the leaders of Iran. At that meeting, the scheme to purchase and use a nuclear submarine is hatched.The tension in the story is palpable and ratchets up your emotions to points where you find yourself swearing at the terrorists along with the American officials. Unfortunately, the author lets his political views into the story. His bashing of Bill Clinton sometimes weakens the story. If there is ever a situation where missiles are being fired on America, I fervently hope that the people tasked with defending the country spend their time identifying the perpetrators rather than bashing the former President who ordered the Global Positioning System (GPS) signals altered so that everyone can achieve military positional accuracy.Sometimes, the quality of the writing of a story is best demonstrated by how well it overcomes what you know are major weak points in the plot. In this story, I didn't believe the premise, but was swept up in the tidal wave of a well-told tale."},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"I really enjoyed this book and found myself becoming completely absorbed in the story. This was the first book by Patrick Robinson that I had read, and given the length I was somewhat concerned that it might be overburdened by detail, as many books of this genre have tended to be as author's have followed Tom Clancy down the path to boredom. However, the methodology utilized by the author kept that from occurring although there were certainly a few instances of unnecessary digressions or more detail than necessary to advance the action and create an aura of believability.After the action involved in a brief but essential prologue which occurs in 1995, the remainder of the story occurs during the years 2004 thru 2008, and while I concur that the essential details of the plot are quite improbable, I do not consider the general outline of the story to be as far outside the realm of possibilty as some other reviewers. In fact, one reviewer has criticized as totally impossible one essential element of the plot that actually is historically accurate - that is the fact that the Clinton administration under terms of the Panama Canal treaty negotiated by the Carter administration essentially allowed control of the Canal to be turned over to a company that many people believe is an agent of the Chinese government. The fact that the author is a very knowledgeable military journalist who obviously possesses excellent political contacts is one of the factors that made the book so enjoyable for me. The way such details are inserted into the story in most instances make them much less disruptive to the flow of the story than other books of this type. However, as my title indicated, there are several sections late in the book with scathing criticisms of the Clinton administration by some of the characters, and while I actually agreed with the commentary and enjoyed it I agree with other reviewers that it was probably overdone in the context of this story.The outline of the story is very simple, and I actually wish that I hadn't read the book jacket but will not reveal anything here that the publisher has not revealed in the promotional material. (However, if you have already decided to purchase the book and don't know the plotline, you might want to skip this paragraph and let the story develop as you read it.) A brilliant former high-ranking SAS officer with a detailed knowledge of military tactics defects to a Middle Eastern terrorist group and quickly rises to a position of importance as one of its key strategists. He devises a plan to obtain a nuclear submarine (which are almost impossible to locate and track while submerged if manned by a patient well trained crew); his goal is to create enough havoc (while minimizing the loss of life) so that the United States will withdraw from its activities in the Middle East. Arrayed against him are the Admiral Morgan, the President's National Security Advisor, and the military and intelligence resources of the US government. The action is fast paced, there are several interesting subplots, the character development is good, and I gained a fair amount of knowledge from the descriptions concerning some of the political and military aspects of the story.Two final important points. First, this book had two very thoughtful reader aids that added greatly to my enjoyment and which are much too seldom employed by the publishing industry. There is a cast of all the principal characters involved in the several different theaters of action which is arranged to promote maximum ease of use by the reader, you don't have to keep flipping back to refresh your memory if your reading is interrupted. It also has maps of most of the areas involved, although these should also have been placed together at the front instead of somewhat randomly interspersed with the text. Second, this book demands a sequel. The ending is very clever and completely satisfying, and yet - the major adversaries (who respect each other enormously despite their desire to confound each other's goals) are implicitly destined to meet again since their titanic struggle is unresolved.Disclaimer: In the interest of full disclosure, I was furnished a review copy of this book by the publisher based upon my interest in this genre as evidenced by my previous reviews of similar books. I have no relationship and have never met either the author or anyone employed by the publisher, and furnished no guarantee that I would even submit a review. If anything, in order to prove my objectivity I perhaps presented my criticisms in more detail than they deserve. Nevertheless, people in my business have belatedly learned too much disclosure is preferable to not enough, so this addendum is offered in that spirit.Tucker Andersen"},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"I have noted that a number of reviewers here seem to spend a lot of time reading books they don't like and then write reviews trashing them. It makes me wonder if they don't have an agenda other than literary.It is obvious that the book is not friendly to liberals or the democrats that gave the canal back to Panama. Perhaps some of the reviewers downgrading the book have their own political agenda that has nothing to do with the merits of the book itself.I have enjoyed all of Patrick Robinson's books, and I consider this one of his best. If you like this one, consider Lion's Game by Nelson DeMille.Ben Adnam was a character in two previous books who was killed at the end of the second. He was one of those terrorists you love to hate, but Robinson has a new villain, Ray Kerman. If you enjoyed the antics of Ben Adnam, then you will like Kerman.It is too bad some reviewers are pushing an agenda, it reduces the value of reviews in Amazon"},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"I've been enjoying Patrick Robinson's books since I first read Nimitz Class several years ago. Since then I've tried to enjoy the plots of his novels and leave the Right Wing political rhetoric aside. As an avid fan of the Tom Clancy novels I was glad to find another Naval action thriller writer out there to fill the gaps of time between other authors books and build some good current detail. I may be a Democrat, but I'm far from Left Wing and when a story has to get bogged down by either building background with all too healthy doses of Right Wing military attitude or putting it into your main character's mouths it really sucks the life out of the story. And, when it does - as much as I hate to, I skip through the pages to get back into what it was I bought the book for in the first place. I've bought and read every first edition hard cover so far, but as I read each successive piece more and more it gets bogged down in the Right Wing accusatory attitude. It's not what I bought the book for and I want to enjoy it for what its supposed to be."},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"Only because I can't give a book 0 stars did this one get 1 star.Patrick Robinson, do us all and yourself a favor and retire.

My guess is that one's political outlook and view of the world we live in may well color one's impressions of this work. I happen to believe that this is a very dangerous world we are living in and that it has been made more so by some of the political decisions of those who were in charge during some criticsl times. The author identifies Carter and Clinton as being two &quot;leaders&quot; who have contributed to our problems of national safety and makes a compelling case in that regard. If that doesn't float your boat, then you will probably not enjoy this book.A young Iranian flees Iran with his parents and is raised in luxury and privilege in England. He enters the military in England and rises to be one of the most respected SAS officers in the British army. His SAS group is advisng the Israeli Army during a sweep of Palestinian strongholds and things get badly out of hand. The resulting chaos causes Maj. Ray Kernan to swittch sides in the conflict and return to his Iranian homeland as a General for Hamas. He is now General Ravi Rashood and his conversion is good news for the terrorists and bad news for everyone else.We are priviy to some of his exploits which clearly identify him as an exceptional leader and a ruthless killer. Over time, a plan is developed for the acquisition of a nuclear submarine. This is not as far fetched as it sounds and a plausable scenario is spun by the author as the deal is made and executed and the submarine departs Russia for a trip of terror down the West Coast of the United States. The story plays out from there with fascinating explanations of why this is everyone's worst nightmare in combatting terrorisim.I found the book very hard to put down and I also found the ending, which is essentially a &quot;To Be Continued&quot; to be perfectly satisfying, given the status of things.

This book not only has no style and a contrived plot at best, the endless preponderance of simple-minded, sheerly idiotic right-wing rants and slights to democrats, greens, and anybody else who'se not a jackbooted thug wearing american-flag underwear will truly, as one reviewer says, turn a Bush supporter iinto a Dean fan.

Instead of having Barracuda I disappear into the great depths of our oceans, after gonzoing the west coast of the US, he doesn't attempt to get the US Navy to scratch their balls trying to figure out where Barracuda I went. Instead he scuttles it in the Chinese(WTF?) run Panama Canal. OK its a done deal...right? No-o-o-o, he has the Navy Seals blowing up the Atlantic Panama Canal gates just to show the Panama Government who's boss. Stupid unrealistic fairy tale ending. That alone will leave you with a big HUH-DUH!?! But, hey, at least the ending put to me to sleep quickly."},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"Ah, Pres. Clinton bashers! They just can't stop.In Barracuda 945, Patrick Robinson mixes true facts with fiction facts to create the essence of his story. In this book, because of Clinton's weaknesses and disinterest in American accomplishments and ingenuity, he has allowed Communist China to control the Panama Canal. These Chinese aid terrorists and thwart the American Navy.But be assured, readers. After the main hero as American special forces illegally kill Chinese Canal operators and destroy part of the Panama Canal, putting it out of commission for months. America gets applause from the rest of the world and gets the Panamanian government to shake in its boots and give the US total control of the Canal.The book does provide some entertainment and was easy to read. The author's followers, especially the neo-conservatives, will enjoy this book. They may be happy or they may be disappointed that the ending allows for a sequel.I wonder what President Clinton will have done wrong in that one."},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"I would agree with most of the reviews on here and would say that I was a Patrick Robinson fan until now. He should have re-named the book Clinton- the disaster. His plot also has one major flaw, as well as all the others that have been mentioned.

It makes no sense!"},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"Patrick Robinson started his series in the submarine genre with a splash with thrillers such as Nimitz Class and HMS Unseen, truly enjoyable reads. This era of the series died painfully in Barracuda 945.Mr. Robinson has foregone adventure for preachiness. His focus is now on the badness of Democratic presidents. This could be overlooked if he made the point and moved on. Instead, he comes back time and again to reiterate his same words (I hesitate to call them ideas) to exhaustion. He uses the narrator and multiple characters to say the same thing repeatedly, removing any interest the reader has in the story.The door is left open for a sequel, but unless I read a review to indicate Mr. Robinson has returned to his roots and left the preaching to televangelists, I will miss my first Patrick Robinson book if and when it is released."},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"A quality suspense/thriller novel about undersea warfare, and its never-ending possibilities.

Since 9/11, I have wanted to learn as much about terrorism as possible and, consequently, have read many factual books on the subject. This is my first readership of a novel about terrorists. In all my 70 years, I can never remember reading a book as scary as this one. There were at least 4 instances when I had to close the book because it scared the hell out of me. Yet I had to pick it back up time again to go on and finally finish it. I don't know how realistic the terrorists' acts are, but they seem very plausible. It seems very possible to me that these terrible acts can really happen to our country. I hope they do not."},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"Perhaps Robinson's best work yet, don't wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"Let me preface this by saying that I really enjoyed Nimitz Class, Kilo Class and HMS Unseen, which is why I picked this book up in the first place. Although I checked the book out of the library and haven't had to pay any money for it, I still spent hours of my life reading this book that I will never get back.To be blunt, I found this book to be highly insulting, and what is more I can't believe that Robinson's editor even has a job. Thrillers of this type have to move at a good clip. Barracuda 945 is ponderous at best. Robinson insists on referring to his characters by their full titles, or even worse, by abbreviated titles, e.g.,\\" Lt. Cmdr. Shakira Rashood then went to the bathroom.\\" His dialogue leads me to believe that he has never had an interesting conversation with another human being, not to mention a relationship with a woman. His characters are incapable of genuine self-reflection, and feel that they need to repeat themselves time and again. In the chapter concerning the deal the Iranians make with the Chinese to purchase the submarines from the Russians, Robinson spends 20 pages in dialogue that essetially runs like this:\\"We want you to buy these two subs for us. They are nuclear and very quiet.Undetectable. The Russians will agree, they're broke.\\"\\"Yes, you want us to buy an undetectable nuclear sub for you, from the Russians. And they will agree because they're broke.\\"\\"Yes, the Russians are broke, and they will do anything for money. And we will give you the money to buy the subs from them. Did we mention that the subs are nuclear and undetectable?\\"And so on....On top of all this, Robinson's poitical agenda isn't just conservative, it's insane. Obviously, the US and the West are the \\"good guys,\\" and have to protect their interests. But when the National Security Advisor decides the BLOW UP THE PANAMA CANAL acting unilaterally, surrounded by subordinates who essentially say \\"good idea boss\\" in the last 50 pages of the book, I think the author's elevator no longer goes to the top. Between this type of demented foreign policy fantasy, and his ramblings about liberals, it turns my stomach to think that he is hoping that people will finish this book and say \\"Boy, America sure is great!\\"Don't do us no favors Patrick."},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"Others have summed up this book rather well: it's beyond pathetic. Take an interesting idea, and add in implausible plotlines, undeveloped characters, a completely unconvincing ending, and gratuitous right wing polemic, and you've got a book like this. It is really sad because the author showed a lot of promise with his early novels, which are worth reading. Unless Robinson wises up, he's lost a lot of his readership, myself included."},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"If you have sampled the work of good military techno-thriller authours (Ed Beach, early Tom Clancy), this book will seem truly pathetic.The problems are numerous: the primary antagonist is a skilled unarmed combat soldier, but apparently he only knows one way to kill a man (yes we \\"get it\\", hand rams nose up into the brain, very creative). How many times can you trott out the same scene?Can you imagine a President of the U.S. to whom it needs to be explained that, yes, the course of a cruise missile can vary in flight according to a pre-set flight path. Can you imagine anyone in the audience for this type of book needing that to be spoon fed to them?Or maybe the notion that Israel would keep a single prison, isolated by a bit of desert, with ALL of Hamas' worst offenders in one location, yet only have 30 or so guards for whole facility. El Al puts more security details on commuter flights.Maybe you would like to hear about a Hamas general at the center of an Islamic terrorist force would allow a female to take a high ranking combat position on board a submarine of all places. It is completely absurd.The book makes a valiant attempt at depicting the cat-and-mouse game of a nuclear sub sneaking it's way to the US West coast, but it falls apart quickly. It's somewhat plausible that the rookie crew makes it to their launch point, but subs make an awful lot of noise when they launch cruise missiles, and that goes completeley unnoticed... 3 separate times. Not only that, but the US Navy, after realizing that they've got a boomer firing bottle rockets can't figure out how to find the thing. They listen and listen, but apparently forget something called ACTIVE SONAR. Not one US ship starts flooding the waters pings to flush out the rogue sub. No choppers dropping sono bouys, nothing.To top-off the preposterous story line, the terrorists choose to scuttle the 350ft sub to hide all evidence. The best place to do that is over a six mile trench in the Pacific, right? Wrong, they'll do it in 70 feet of mud in a lake inside the panama canal; because otherwise the story cannot wrap up in a nice tidy bow describing how bad the Carter & Clinton administrations messed up the handling of the Panama canal.Don't even get me started about the stupid political rants. The funny thing about the ham-fisted Democrat-bashing in the book is how ironic it turns out to be, since the novel goes into the future until ~2008: the author goes on about how America had the world on it's side (which it did) and withdrew from the Middle East after dealing with post-9/11 Afghanastan, with the Iran and other shaking in their boots about how the Great Satan would respond to more attacks on their people. Too bad the book was written before we made up the whole WMD thing, plowed into Iraq and lost any post 9-11 good will or sympathy we might have had across the world. OOPS. The author can't be blamed for the lack of 20-20 forsight given the date the book was written, but it is certainly humorouse given the clumsy right-wing preaching that even Rush L would probably find to be goofy at best.A true waste of time."},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"First, I bought the abridged CD version of this book. The reader David McCallum was fine. However, I can only guess that in order to save costs, they divided the CD segments into 15-20 minute intervals. This is fine if you are listening to the CD uninterupted. However, when you have to sort through 8-10 minutes to get back to where you left off, it can be annoying.The book itself began with a good premise. However, the author had several meaningless segments which had nothing to do with the main story.Robinson's political overtones were also overbearing. I am not a Clinton fan. However, Robinson's portrayal is nothing less than a hatchet job.The climax of the book centers around the Panama Canal. The premise that the US would allow a private Chinese company to own the canal is totally absurd.The ending appeared to be more of a chapter closure rather than completion of the book. It left the impression that this book will become a series.Robinson's last few books left much to be desired. I would pass on this one."},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"This book should be called Barracuda 945 Part 1. Robinson uses this book as a platform for expressing his opinions on the Clinton Administration, Hollywood and the Oil Industry while straying from his roots as a sub warfare fiction writer. There is NO sub tactical warefare in this book and the author shows the U.S. ineptness at dealing with an enemy nuclear sub. Don't expect an ending because the author chose not to bring to a conclusion any of the story's major threads, which leaves this reader unsatisfied. I thought Robinson would learn his lesson from Hollywood that sequals are not better than the original."},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"I am (was) quite a fan of Robinson, although I have been progressively dissapointed lately with each new novel. I tried to read this with an open and enthusiastic mind. Well, the beginning was okay. But one quarter of the way through I was battling terribly, I finished it out of duty. The days of Nimitz Class and Kilo Class are clearly gone, and are not coming back. The story is absurd. It moves at a painfully slow pace. The characters are undeveloped and dull. This book paints an idiotic view of the US administration. Okay, perhaps it is on the mark there presently, but Arnold Morgan is even more ridulous than anything I can imagine even in the current US administration, and there is a lot of latitude there already! The general flow of the story is all too predictable, and I cannot recommend it. If you've never read Robinson before, rather read Nimitz Class or Kilo Class. If you have, then don't touch it!"},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"Patrick Robinson suffers from Tom Clancy Disease with Barracuda 945-not much of an idea,page after page of nothing happening,desperately in need of an editor to lop off the extra pages added to justify the outrageous price of the book and he even goes Clancy one better,the entire book was nothing more than a set up for a sequel.Patrick,what's with the excruciating geographical references,the making of the Admiral Morgan character into a cartoon,your repeated refences to the Clinton administration(hey,we didn't like him either but we don't want to read about him in your books)? I've absolutely enjoyed every one of your books but you should be ashamed if you cash any royalty checks for this rip off."},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"When Nimitz Class came out, I thought Patrick Robinson had taken the world by storm by bringing the wonderous world of submarine warfare into mainstream reading. The following books have succeeded in going down in style, and up in the barf-o-meter. Kilo Class was good, HMS Unseen OK, USS Seawolf marginal, Shark Mutiny terrible, and now this book that pretends to be good reading. Yuck.I bought this book because I was on a one week business trip to Germany and wanted to take something I could enjoy. I had plenty of free time, but I chose to watch German TV that I could not understand than this book that made me think of how I could have better spent my money. The ending of this book is nothing but a launching pad for the dazzling career of General Ravi Rashood. Gimme a break. Weak plot, weaker motivations.The character of Admiral Morgan is now so over-dramatized. I was actually hoping that the attempted assasination of his character in this book had succeeded. I was disappointed.The good thing about Nimitz Class was it's attention to engineering detail. This book does away with all pretenses to be well researched. Mr. Robinson chooses to employ words such as &quot;zillions of gallons of water&quot; rather than do a quick calculation of his own. And this example is only representative of such shortcuts (just an excuse not to do research).What can I say. I'm a Patrick Robinson groupie. Even if his next book is like this tripe, I'll buy it. But Mr. Robinson, if you can't write anything good, can you please not write anything at all? Please?"},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"The only reason I gave this book one star was because it is the lowest rating available. Amazon should permit negative ratings, especially for a Patrick Robinson book.This absurd story begins with the sudden \\"flipping\\" of an experienced British commando during a firefight who suddenly \\"sees the light\\" and is now an anglo-hating terrorist. More ridiculous is that England, the commando's own country can not seem to locate him but the U.S. quickly starts following his trail; one of many overt political statements from Mr. Robinson.The author adds an even \\"more realistic\\" scenario. A maximum-security Israeli prison housing some of the world's most dangerous terrorists manned by a few poorly trained guards is easily overrun.Next a Russian submarine sitting in drydock for several years is suddenly thrust into service and manned by foreign nationals not exactly known for their naval ability. The sub, manned by a skeleton crew, evades all detection by the most technologically advanced country in the world. Quite realistic. Even better, after sitting in drydock for lack of money for so long, this submarine never ever has one mechanical breakdown?This is just the beginning of the book's many insults to the readers' intelligence.Throughout this ridiculous story are constant overt political opinions by Mr. Robinson who uses his books as his own political soapbox from which to preach his ultra-conservative \\"Might makes Right\\" declaration. The story's liberal characters are inserted merely as punching bags for the author's infallible conservativism.Mr. Robinson's political tirades are at best... juvenile.I had found Mr. Robinson's earlier works- Kilo Class, Nimitz Class, HMS Unseen and The Shark Mutiny more researched and less implausible but his works deteriorated with each subsequent novel.Root canal is less painful than reading this book.If you want to read good submarine techno-thrillers try Joe Buff or Michael Dimercurio"},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"An ex-SAS commando, skilled at unarmed combat, leads mideastern terrorists to strike America with cruise-missiles. Ray Kerman joins British special forces, barely aware of his Islamic past - his parents emigrated from Iran and blended into British society. On assignment to monitor Israeli Forces inside embattled Hebron, Kerman meets a beautiful Palestinian during an IDF-Hamas battle - and faster than you can say \\"you-wouldn't-like-me-when-I'm-angry\\" - Kerman joins Hamas. Now called Ravi Rashood, he eventually arrives in Iran, where he convinces some mullah's to buy 2 \\"Barracudas\\" - Russian Sierra class nuclear subs that haven't been used in about two decades. Armed with cruise missiles, one of the subs will sneak up our Pacific coast and blast American petro facilities and other targets of opportunity. On the home front, Admiral Arnold Morgan, the National Security Advisor, and Lt. Cdr. Jimmy Ramshawe, an intelligence officer, piece together the clues linking Kerman, Hamas and the mysterious sale of the twin Barracudas.\\"Barracuda\\", the worst book I've read since \\"Shark Mutiny\\", is even worse than Publisher's Weekly warned - full of meaningless digressions so mind-bogglingly irrelevant, they don't even rise to pedantry and must be read to be believed. The Barracuda plan doesn't even materialize until nearly half-way through \\"Barracuda\\". Until then, Robinson tells the story of Kerman/Rashood - his upbringing, his training and his improbable conversion to rogue warrior. The \\"ops\\" he commits earlier in the book are supposed to lead to Rashood's missile-sub plan, but that idea sounds like something Rashood's Iranian backers could've thought up. (Nothing in Kerman's SAS background suggests how he alone dreamt up the plan). The earlier ops themselves are meant to be spectacular (including a daring breakout from an Israeli max-sec prison housing hardcore terrorists) but suffer from Robinson's inability to form a reasonable POV and otherwise inept story-telling, and in any event, never connect with the plot to lob cruise missiles at the US.Instead, Robinson seems to forget what \\"Barracuda\\" is about - while Rashood travels to Iran, we learn of an Iranian missile boat, a Chinese cruise missile, and that the missile's engine was built in Toulouse, even though neither the missile nor the boat will figure in the action; the science of driving and hunting submarines is barely touched on, but you can count on Robinson's chillingly plausible depiction of a breakfast menu; Robinson will often introduce a large cast of characters - reciting their names and positions - but otherwise has them doing nothing. Robinson must think that I'm one of the only techno-thriller fans who believes that accurate technical details should be used to further the plot, and not the author's rep for knowing anything. His fans supposedly overlook stylistic flaws in favor of purportedly explosive plots and plausibly accurate details. But there's nothing realistic, explosive or even very new here - you can get more convincing and visceral stuff in Clancy, Craig Thomas, Mercurio and DC Poyer. The laughably implausible dialog in which a Russian submarine ace conveniently explains the workings of a modern nuke-sub read like a chapter from \\"nucular-sumbarine wahfair fer dummies\\". Nothing explains Shahood's immediate preference for the Barracuda as opposed to other contemporary Russian subs like the Akula, Oscar or Victor III, and Robinson doesn't give enough nuance to the science of military subs to explain Barracuda's singular lethalality (The real Barracuda has reportedly been out of action since it was seriously damaged after colliding with the attack sub USS Baton Rouge in 1992, about 16 years before \\"Barracuda\\" occurs). British forces accompanying Israeli commandos into Hebron? A beautiful Palestinian named \\"Shakira\\"? Chinese who sound like crude stereotypes of take-out deliverymen? Islamic types who don't sound very Islamic as they do singularly anti-American? A world-wide net-work of Islamic fundamentalists who work seamlessly together? Where's the realism?Robinson's writing is mostly just mediocre, which only softens the impact of some true howlers: \\"It was a face of high intelligence\\"; \\"That Siberia's a bloody big place. Gotta be the biggest place in the world\\"; and my favorite, this seemingly paradoxical description of a missile attack \\"Never mind comparisons with an atomic bomb, they could very nearly have seen this in Hiroshima\\".To top it off, Robinson replaces his immature political incorrectness with a more mature brand. Instead of bigoted sobriquets \\"towelhead\\" or \\"chink\\" that punctuated every other page in \\"Shark Mutiny\\", Robinson unleashes a more understated and quaint brand of ethnic cleansing - in which Islam and Muslims seem utterly enigmatic in an ethnically homogenous west. Kerman's Islamic past is kept secret as he rises in the SAS. Once revealed, Kerman's origins shock British and American leaders who, despite sizable Muslim populations throughout their countries, are utterly mystified that a Muslim might actually have made his way into their top echelons. Robinson's political bent is also laughable, targeting liberals who gave the Panama canal away to a red-Chinese controlled conglomerate, made GPS more useful to terrorists, and kept us hooked on foreign oil by blocking oil-drilling in Alaska for environmental reasons. (Robinson refers to Clinton as the current President's predecessor, even though \\"Barracuda takes place 8 years after Clinton left office.) I could accept Robinson's theory linking the PRC to the Panama Canal except for one thing: nothing in \\"Barracuda\\" makes his Chinese seem as ominous as his Americans - when Adm. Morgan and crew gleefully strongarm the President into sabotaging the Panama Canal as part of a plan to re-claim it for America (complete with gunships orbiting the capital to ensure Panama's president signs a treaty ratifying the move) you've got to wonder what the Chinese had in store (other than simply becoming another super-power that won't live within its means) that makes their comeuppance seem deserved. (Though Robinson obviously hates Clinton, Republican president looks like a clueless puppet, easily swayed to sign anything Morgan and crew leave on his desk. It's like \\"Leave it to Beaver\\" in the Oval Office.) With its horrible writing, unbelievable characters and nonexistent \\"realism\\", this \\"Barracuda\\" should sleep with the fishies."},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"I like P Robinson's other books but this one is both a stretch as well as a platform for childish name calling.

I am currently reading Scimitar SL-2, which generally takes up where Barracuda 945 left off and does so very well so far.

The book was still a good read I just thought it lacked the &quot;on the edge of your seat excitement&quot; factor that I dearly loved in his previous books. The action with the Navy SEALs was decent but again lacked wow and zest.I would recommened that anyone that was going to read this book should read the first five. If not the first five at least Nimitz Class and H.M.S. unseen."},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"Patrick Robinson's epic techno-thriller, BARRACUDA 945, should come with a written warning from the Surgeon General. I have never before tackled any of Robinson's works, but after reading this rollercoaster ride of a novel, I must say that this is one genre that is extremely addicting.If you're going to read BARRACUDA 945, be forewarned that sleep deprivation can occur. Other symptoms include nervousness, inability to concentrate on anything except BARRACUDA 945, and loss of interest in normal everyday activities, except getting to the gripping last page of BARRACUDA 945 ASAP.OK, you've been warned.One of the remarkable things about BARRACUDA 945 is Robinson's incredible ability to take the reader's breath away throughout the entire 440-page tome. The novel begins with Robinson's introduction of British turncoat Ray Kerman, who incidentally takes sides with bloodthirsty terrorists who devise a plan to rob a pair of international banks in order to buy two nuclear powered submarines from the Russians with aid from Chinese officials.BARRACUDA 945 also reintroduces Robinson's star character, National Security Adviser Arnold Morgan, who is making his sixth appearance in a Robinson novel. Morgan is the epitome of the right wing, ultra-conservative, take-no-prisoners kind of guy. He not only devises the plan to retake the Panama Canal from China after the bad guys ditch the nuclear submarine in the canal after several attacks on key U.S. oil refineries, he also manages to keep the Commander-in-Chief from going hysterical numerous times after the country is besieged by terrorist attacks.While the main part of the novel takes place in 2008, Robinson does a superb job in illustrating the importance of remembering that terrorism against America is still a huge threat and is an issue that shouldn't be taken lightly. With several key references relating to the impact of 9-11, Robinson, a former British newspaper columnist who covered thoroughbred racing for a number of years, has written a novel that should be required reading for our country's current National Security Council adviser, Condoleeza Rice.In BARRACUDA 945, Robinson's Hamas terrorists make Osama Bin Laden and the rest of the infamous Al-Qaeda network seem like a bunch of disorganized boy scouts. Although the September 11th attacks were horrific and the images of those planes slamming into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center remain burned into my conscience, Robinson's Hamas terrorists are also what President George Bush would call \\"evil doers\\".Despite Robinson's attempt at trying to make Kerman, also known as Hamas Gen. Ravi Rashood, seem somewhat compassionate and humane, this man is nothing more than a ruthless psychotic killer who stops at nothing to complete his macabre mission. Even though Rashood launches deadly ICBM missiles into numerous oil refineries in Alaska where the death toll is next to nil, Rashood and his band of modern day pirates turn the entire town of Lompoc, California into an apocalyptic inferno after destroying the main electricity facility that powers much of Los Angeles and San Francisco.Another problem with Robinson's novel is his constant editorializing against former President Bill Clinton. It's apparent that Robinson despises the embattled Clinton, but to compare his intellect with his genitals is just downright sophomoric. Plus, I had a hard time grappling with the notion that Clinton would have been stupid enough to give control of the Panama Canal to China.An additional point worth mentioning is the copy editing of BARRACUDA 945. Sorry folks, but when a giant publisher like HarperCollins releases a book, a reader shouldn't have to experience any misspellings.Despite Robinson's glaring dislike for Bill Clinton and some typographical errors, BARRACUDA 945 is just what the doctor ordered if you're looking for a blistering page-turner packed with suspense, intrigue and action.Down, periscope!--- Reviewed by David Exum"},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"There are some good elements to the story Robinson tells here, some parts of the book I really enjoyed. Yet the main attack/plot element wasn't as interesting when the book really got into it in the final third, and the ending of the story doesn't resolve what happened in the book it just sets up the sequel.The protagonists are a little one dimensional (the crusty Admiral, his beautiful, understanding fiancee, and the bright Australian protege), the rants about the Panama Canal get a little old, and you'd think that the US could do a little contingency planning. Instead, the US just looks lame as throughout the book, they can only react to what is happening.I'm not sure that the end of the Cold War hurt this genre by eliminating the primary villain. I will say that I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who hasn't read Robinson's previous books."},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"Most people who have written other 1 star reviews have pretty much summarized this books short-comings pretty well. The only thing I would add is that the author obviously hates former President Clinton and sticks us with the tab for his OPINIONS. You can't go twenty pages without some jab at the former President. Also, Mr. Robinson seems to spend most of his time trying to make sure the reader enjoys and understands the scenery rather the technology a good submarine thriller is based upon. If I wanted a travel guide, I would have bought that instead. I agree with another reviewer that Dimercurio is the way to go in this genre...This is a poor effort from a talented author that has written many wonderful books...I'll buy the next one but wait for it to go to paperback!!PS= Get ride on the 1.2.3.4.5. lists that we see about four times in this book......it's annoying and childish!"},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"I've read a number of Robinson's books and was pleased to begin this one. Terrorists buys two Russian submarines and sends one as a visible decoy to China while the other one creates mayhem in the U.S.My main problem with the book, other than the silly ending obviously written in after the editors wanted an upbeat finale, is that most of the book is based on hiding the existence of the marauding submarine and then having it surface on purpose so it can be caught in shallow waters. Total lunacy.On the other hand the first two thirds is a good read. Perhaps some shadow author can rewrite the last third and fix it."},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"Robinson starts out with an intriguing scenario but drops the ball when he climbs up on his political soapbox.The premise of a terrorist bent on destruction of American assets is not new, but Robinson treats us to a possible plot that involves several less-than-friendly countries, superhuman exploits of an ex-patriot SAS agent, and stealth destruction on a massive scale - a scenario ripe with possibilities.Unfortunately, Robinson never gets too deep into his characters or their motivation, except for the pensive &quot;conversion&quot; of the former SAS agent. The author seems to think that ranting by frustrated generals and admirals counts for real character development and motivation. And when Robinson unloads on everything from Hollywood to the Academy Awards to Democratic presidents (all whom are lumped together with wimpy idealogues who sold America down the river - or should I say Canal?), he really loses the focus of both his characters and his plot.Perhaps that is why the ending of this book is as wimpy as Robinson's Democrats. He had nothing lift to blast so he just let the conclusion sink slowly in the mud. A fitting finale to the Barracuda 945 - both the sub and the book."},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"Earlier books like Nimitz class were more entertaining but this one betrays the superficiality of the author's acquaintance with naval officers, their customs and their behavior. Not wardroom material. Political asides are pathetic."},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"Another solid story from Robinson. Well written, fast paced, with my only complaint being that by page 385 I had heard enough democrat bashing to last me a while. It became unclear if the political views were that of the characters or of the author. All that aside, Robinson has set up some future mano y mano confrontations with our Admiral Morgan and this new super villan. A must read for any Robinson, or even Clancy fan."},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"Patrick Robinson comes roaring back in his latest naval adventure, &quot;Barracuda 945&quot;. After vacationing with last summer's &quot;Slider&quot;( a romp with the Cape Cod summer baseball league), Robinson returns to his roots with an action packed, page turning thriller about terrorism on the high seas after 9/11/01. Once again America's defenses are wide open to attact from a Middle Eastern terrorist with a proper British upbringing and training in the UK's special forces. The plot involves an attack on America's energy supplies with a plan to use a silent nuclear submarine's launch of off-shore missles.Robinson creates believable scenarios and solid characters with his descriptive prose. The reader is propelled along the story line with swift moving scenes and a sense of urgency all Americans recognize after 9/11.Robinson's latest isn't without fault. For some unknown reason other than to highlight his visit to Hollywood's Kodak theater, Robinson detours the thriller into an Oscar ceremony interrupted by the terrorist's attack on America's energy supply. Robinson must like to travel, but his editor should have suggested he write a scene about the havoc the attack could cause on an American military base instead of letting a good novel be lessened by a cheap thrill.Robinson doesn't disappoint with this one. He reclaims his place among the best writers of military adventures."},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"If your idea of a good military read is to try to follow a writer who can't tell east from west, is unable to develop intelligent characterization or even a believable plot, and who constantly bashes anything or anybody even slightly to the left the most conservative brain-dead republican you have ever met - then this book is for you. Two thirds of the way through it I literally tore the book apart before trashing it. I simply couldn't bear the thought of someone finding it and reading the ramblings of this intellectually deficient, self-righteous fool."},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"Patrick Robinson's last book, THE SHARK MUTINY, showed a mildly original and promising idea but was spoiled a little by a preposterous ending. This next instalment in his series featuring Vice Admiral Arnold Morgan is back on top form with very good research and some blazing action scenes which whisk the reader along at a lightning pace! BARRACUDA 945 starts off in 1995, when one Major Ray Kerman is accepted into the elite British SAS Regiment. Move forward to 2004 where we find Kerman on a top secret antiterrorist operation in Israel taking down HAMAS fighters as part of the war on terror. Kerman, we learn, is of Iranian descent and was brought to England in 1979 after the fall of the Shah and the subsequent troubles, and was kept in check by a fundamentalist Muslim cleric in London. When an SAS mission searching out a HAMAS terror cell in Herbron goes wrong and explodes into a full scale bloodbath between Palestinian fighters and Israeli Defence Force troops, Kerman's loyalties are put to the test when those close to him are under attack by Israeli forces. He then goes AWOL, murdering his fellow officers, and joins up with HAMAS.Vice Admiral Morgan and his trusty NSA liason Lieutenant James Ramshawe, an Australian officer who is really the main good guy character in the story as it is his hunches on Kerman's whereabouts that get results, soon links his fugitive to a robbery in Tel Aviv, but what is the purpose of this? How does it all tie up with a massive prison breakout in Nimrod, Israel, of known HAMAS terrorists?Years later, Kerman, now operating under his Iranian birth name Ravi Rashood, recruits many of those he freed, and also his new wife, Shakira(who is nothing to do with a certain pop singer!), and purchases two thought-to-be-unseaworthy Barracuda Class subs from cash-strapped Russians through Chinese military officers who support his plans. Rashood/Kerman plans to attack America's West Coast and its oil and power infrastructure to create economic turmoil. In 2008, the terror attacks begin, foxing the US military and pushing the US President into a corner. It seems like another 9/11 has taken place. Yet James Ramshawe still has a hunch, will anyone believe him? When Admiral Morgan learns the true nature of the attacks, will the President be forced to act? Read on!Once again, Patrick Robinson has created another fast-paced submarine story which often reads like tomorrow's news headlines! The submarine scenes and Navy SEAL operations in the later half of the book are as realistic as you can get, it feels as though you are there - inside the Barracuda with the bad guys, stopping the bad guys in the jungles of Panama and even at the Royal Ascot horse race meeting when Kerman tries to meet his parents and assassinate Admiral Morgan in the process in a minor subplot. Robinson does not go into too much technical detail about the submarines, just enough so that anyone unfamiliar with naval matters can understand, so as to keep the story flowing along nicely.However, my one criticism stands - Robinson still insists on going into excessive detail about what every character has to eat - by each course - what wine they drink and which vineyard it came from and what year, and so on. As much as I love fine food and wine, I did feel that this was especially over the top during the first 150 pages or so, and did detract a bit from the main focus of the book - the hunt for the Barracuda and Kerman. But this overall fantastic read still gets five stars for keeping the reader engrossed throughout. This would make an awesome movie as well, but might not win an award considering what happens in Los Angeles when a power station serving California is attacked with missiles from the Barracuda! As for the ending, it is not what you expect, it leaves all sorts of possibilities wide open for many of the characters.I eagerly await the next instalment and look forward to further adventures involving Morgan, Ramshawe, the SEALs and co!"},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"British SAS commando Major Ray Kerman stationed in Israel joins Hamas and quickly becomes a leader due to his bold successes in country. Abetted by the Iranians, Ray buys a Russian nuclear submarine, the Barracuda 945. He plans to attack the West Coast of the United States with missile strikes against the Alaskan oil supplies and the California electrical grid.National Security Advisor Vice Admiral Arnold Morgan leads the US Navy's efforts to stop the Barracuda 945 at sea. However, even with the help of the National Security Agency the US Navy struggles to locate the deadly nuclear sub for several weeks until they locate the Barracuda 945 in the Panama Canal. Confrontation between two brilliant leaders and their crew occur with much at stake.Though the historical soliloquies can be overwhelming, they bring a sense of reality to a powerful action-packed sea adventure that will remind readers of Sink the Bismarck. The story line is going at the fastest knots, but also insures the key two antagonists plus Morgan's friend, Assistant to the Director of the National Security Agency Lieutenant Commander James Ramshawe, are more than just 200 proof testosterone. Instead readers feel their frustrations and excitement. Patrick Robinson's latest Morgan thriller is a solid tale that fans will enjoy the high-speed sea chase.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"It is time to stop for Mr.Robinson to go on with submarine series, as this latest item Barracuda 945 was a big failure. It was disappointing especially those fans who read through all previous books - like myself.As a &quot;consumer&quot; of his submarine books I have to say - the way the author built its story was not exciting rather exasperating. What was brilliant in book Nimitz, that after the catastrophy how the bad guys were chased by the good boys. How did the analysts put together the puzzle. Instead of this in Barracuda terrorists make successes again and again through hundreds of pages without any serious mistake. There is no any chance to catch them till the very last few pages of the book. The one and only good-smart guy get only few short pages from the author to figure out the mistery. The same is true for the SEALs.I liked Robinson's books because of good,enjoyable, complex and long-lasting solutions - I did not get it from Barracuda. If I didnt know Robinson, I would say the author made it for purpose to raise the morality of terrorist opposite to American government. The latter seemed totally incapable and militant, where people rather use the military power then their mind.On the other hand, for me as an intellectual the obvious unfairness in politics ruined the credibility of the all book. The bias for hardline conservative ideology could have seen in prevoius books as well. But in Barracuda it developed to definite lies and slanders about liberal side.The author wanted to push his personal political view in the story at any price. During this big effort he does not realise that his main character, National Security Adviser, Arnold Morgan /who represents Robinson himself/, lost all of his positive characteristics. In Barracuda he became an irrational, fanatic and nasty figure, a nationalist who disgains those who think different ways, a decision-maker who knows only military solutions...And this man should be represents the good guys? God save US from this kind of decision-makers...!Eventually Robinson reached exactly the opposite goals that he had wanted to. The story raises engagement towards passionate terrorists, making from them romantic and brilliant heroes. On the other hand the most powerful man on US side - according the book - is an unintelligent, furious militant.I would suggest to sell the book with subtitle &quot;Take care, it is a PARODY&quot;!"},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"Having read all Patrick Robinson's previous &quot;submarine-work&quot; I must say that Barracuda 945 was a bit of a dissapointment to me. The errors in the book concerning the typing were a bit disturbing. The most disturbing however was Patrick Robinson's urge to give his opnion on Hollywood and former politicians and their politics in this book. Some of the comment on these former politicians was functional, yet I found there was too much of comment.The only thing I can hope for is that Barracuda 945 is a kind of an upstep to a follow up that will be just as good as Nimitz Class, HMS Unseen, etc."},{"Title":"Barracuda 945","review":"I really enjoyed Robinson's previous novels. However, this one leaves much to be desired. The protagonist, an SAS officer, undergoes an epiphany that is quite a stretch to accept. After this he becomes a dedicated and dangerous terrorist. The action then plods along in a rather formulaic manner - interspersed by polemics against Democrats and former President Clinton. Please, Mr. Robinson, you have more talent than you've brought to this effort!Potential readers: skip this one &amp; read his previous novels."},{"Title":"Saving the Pitcher: Preventing Pitcher Injuries in Modern Baseball","review":"Anyone who has read Will Carroll's work for Baseball Prospectus or even his weblog has learned more about injuries from him than from every baseball broadcast combined. Unfortunately, he is baseball's only &quot;medhead&quot; so it will take some time to spread the knowledge. Writing a book is the first step.&quot;Saving The Pitcher&quot; finally gives us a starting point for discussing injuries. It breaks down every component of the pitching motion--that is, what each body part contributes to the motion and proper technique for doing so. Carroll also informs us of what contributes to injuries, warning signs (velocity loss=shoulder; control loss=elbow) and the right training and exercise programs.While STP is well written, it sometimes reads as a textbook. Although, when you think about it, it really is a textbook of sorts. That isn't to say it's like taking a biology class; Carroll's enthusiasm for baseball shines through to make the book quite enjoyable.I also would have liked it if he went more in-depth on V-Loss. I suppose he wants to gather more data on it first before formally presenting it, perhaps in a book of its own.That quibble aside, STP is a great book. Baseball fans should check it out, and every professional, college, high school, and (most importantly) Little League coach should be mandated to read it before being allowed near a young pitcher. Hopefully this is the first of many more volumes from Will Carroll."},{"Title":"Saving the Pitcher: Preventing Pitcher Injuries in Modern Baseball","review":"In clear language, Saving The Pitcher explains the biggest issues relating to a pitcher's health, and the combined efforts required of a team's training staff, physician, pitching coach, manager, and the pitcher himself to save the pitcher from injury. Will Carroll systematically goes through the pitching process -- describing the anatomy used in pitching, the mechanics of the pitching motion, the preparation and conditioning a pitcher should use, and the workload to which a pitching arm should be subjected -- to show how injuries can be prevented.One of the great things about this book is that Carroll is fearless while discussing his subject. The first time Will mentions Leo Mazzone -- the celebrated Atlanta Braves coach who some think could be the first pitching coach in the Hall of Fame -- it's to criticize Mazzone's teachings about a pitcher's ideal follow-through. It's not as if Carroll is a Leo-hater (Will says plenty of complementary things about Mazzone elsewhere in the book) it's simply that Carroll isn't intimidated by any pitching expert, no matter how famous or successful they are, when it comes to talking about pitching injuries.If you're in any way curious about the types of arm surgery you read about in the sports section of the newspaper, if you have a kid that's getting serious about pitching in Little League or high school, or if you just wonder why that slider you tried out as a teenager was so damn painful to throw, you'll want to get your hands on this book. There's plenty of information for you between these covers."},{"Title":"Saving the Pitcher: Preventing Pitcher Injuries in Modern Baseball","review":"Mr. Carroll does a marvelous job assembling and disseminating the evolving body of knowledge on this topic in a manner which is accessible and engaging. Contrary to the statements made by another recent reviewer, Mr. Carroll _does_ have a background in sports medicine. He relies up on this, but never loses sight of his audience.This book is invaluable reading for both experts and neophytes alike. Few areas are more misunderstood than the health and training of pitchers, and knowledge of and adherence to the principles espoused by Carroll and his subjects would go a long way toward improving pitchers' health and the overall quality of baseball.If you love baseball, read it."},{"Title":"Saving the Pitcher: Preventing Pitcher Injuries in Modern Baseball","review":"I have to say I found this book griping. It was well written and as odd as this might sound, I found it hard to put down.Will Carroll while not a medical professional is the top writer in the field of baseball injuries, writing both for \\"Under the Knife\\" for Baseball Prospectus website and his own blog The Juice. He makes it his business to know and understand baseball injuries and has a style that explains very complicated medical issues to lay people like myself.This book makes a fascinating read, and I would highly recommend it for baseball fans (anyone interested in learning more about the game within the game), parents of young pitchers or anyone involved in the teaching of baseball skills."},{"Title":"Saving the Pitcher: Preventing Pitcher Injuries in Modern Baseball","review":"Will Carroll is not qualified as a doctor, a player, a coach, or anything else that might seem relevant to make him an \\"expert\\" on baseball injuries. I don't hold that against him, though.As mentioned by other reviewers (and claimed by the author), this book offers information about pitcher injuries that is not written about in any other popular book. The chapter on the \\"Anatomy of Pitching\\" makes the book worth reading for any baseball junkie. Will Carroll explains, in 24 pages (including drawings), the major bodily stresses that pitching causes to the body, and the common injuries that result.However it is hard to overlook both the poor organization of the book, and how often Carroll claims things that are not (and could probably not ever be) substantiated by science. He claims, unequivocally, that there is a \\"one best\\" pitching motion, which is exactly defined, better than all others, and the proper use of which will result in no pitching injuries. He implies that he has implicit support for this idea from famously scientific-minded pitching coaches like Dr. Mike Marshall and Tom House. I believe this is a bit misleading. Mike Marshall has never written a book, but Tom House has. If you want to read a much more thorough, non-dogmatic bit of research on effective pitching, I would highly recommend it.Apart from his dogmatic approach, it's also frustrating to see Carroll jumping around between topics, never giving much depth, or sometimes not completing a logical thought process for what he does choose to focus on. For example, he writes a long (and rather interesting) chapter on how modern statistics show the extent of Eric Gagne's dominance during the 2003 season. However he then does not even *mention* Gagne's subsequent arm injuries, before moving on to an unrelated topic!All of this being said, the book is a must-read if you care about pitcher injuries, and their effect on performance (for the pitcher, for your favorite team, your fantasy team, etc). Until someone else starts writing about this topic, I will be reading everything that Will Carroll puts out, in print or online. I just don't take everything that he writes very seriously."},{"Title":"Saving the Pitcher: Preventing Pitcher Injuries in Modern Baseball","review":"While Mr. Carroll is not a doctor nor an athletic trainer - hs has a skill set that is unmatched in modern baseball. He has a network of connections in MLB that makes his online column a must-read, he is a good writer and has a tremendous knowledge of the history of sports medicine.These skills come forth in this book. It's a quick read that is accessible to fans and useful to coaches and players. The chapter on Velocity Loss shows how mindless fans like myself can see when a player is truly fatiguing on the hill.I found this book to be interesting, informative and one of the top baseball books released this year. I would love to see my favorite team apply a lot of things that Will recommends here and even try the 4-man rotation out.A great first book, Mr. Carroll, I look forward to number two."},{"Title":"Saving the Pitcher: Preventing Pitcher Injuries in Modern Baseball","review":"This book has the potential to change the face of baseball, if only everyone would take the time to read it.

It's perfect for busy Mom's in that it's filled with short essays each written by a different author. Some are laugh-out loud funny, some truly heart-warming and other's make you think \\"thank goodness I'm not the only one who's made that parenting mistake!\\".I wasn't sure I would like the essay format of the book but I ended up really enjoying it. After a long day of racing after the kids the book's format made it easy to relax by reading one chapter before collapsing in bed from exhaustion. :-)OK so the one reason I didn't give this book 5-stars is that there are two chapters that bring the book down. The chapter \\"Why Does Your Son Have a Phallus on His Head\\" written by the books editor came across as Jennifer Margulis's public way of getting some type of revenge at her mother for issues they have. The comments about her mother were embarrassing to hear from a grown woman and had NO relevance. It was just a weird thing to read and again I felt embarrassed for the editor that she added that to her book.But that was minor compared to the chapter \\"Slow to Warm\\". This is the chapter that the reviewer \\"Shame, Shame\\" was referring to. (Ok -- who actually says \\"shame\\"???...) Wait until you read this chapter! Your jaw is going drop to the floor and you'll be stunned you just read that in a PG rated Toddler book. Don't get me wrong -- I use more than my fair share of swear words! I'm actually surprised my kids first words weren't something that was made up of four letters! :-) But the chapter \\"Slow to Warm\\" is basically a porno put into words. Perhaps the author of that chapter is an 800-sex-line operator or works on the HBO set of Real Sex -- but that chapter should NEVER have been added to the book.

This collection is none of those things. It is SOOOO good. The stories span a wide gamut and have a range of tones--every one of which spoke to this dedicated and thinking and at-times beleaguered parent! There is some racy stuff, some endearing stuff--everything from the highly inspirational to the down-right edgy. This is one \\"toddler\\" you'll actually want by your bedside at night! Get a copy now and, like me, you'll be back for a dozen more for all the parents out there who really need to read this book.

I read it almost cover to cover, which says so much for the selection and editing of the essays; nothing tripped me up or lost me along the way. I appreciated the inclusion of fathers and the variety of styles in general. The book managed to make me nostalgic for the toddler phase, which is hard to believe since my daughter is only four and I should still be panting with relief, but even more than that, it made me feel such tenderness for the parents, their earnestness, their candor, their ambivalence, their fierceness... what a compelling display of the capabilities of the personal essay."},{"Title":"Toddler: Real-Life Stories of Those Fickle, Irrational, Urgent, Tiny People We Love","review":"Having read pretty much all of the available how-to's concerning toddlers, I was pleasantly surprised that this book is actually a nonfiction collection of essays by both moms and dads about the hilarious and heartbreaking ups and downs of raising a toddler. As the mom of a 2-year-old, I sometimes have days where I want to throw my hands up in frustration and scream. This book showed me that it really does happen to everyone, and that there is always some humor to be found in these situations. My favorite essays in the book were: &quot;Lessons From Snake Boy&quot; by Karen C. Driscoll (the first three pages, about a trip to the zoo and foray into a public bathroom, had me rolling on the floor); &quot;Potty Prattle&quot; by Kerri Peterson (she is a family physician who has 4-year-old triplets that refuse to use the potty); and &quot;Bedtime for Milo&quot; by Ayun Halliday (about nursing her son numerous times per night - I totally related to this).

Like teenagers, they teeter at the edge of blissful ignorance and knowledge of the world. That makes them full of insight and wonder -- a bridge to consciousness from which we all can learn.

Reading a few of these short and wonderfully written essays every evening at bedtime, I got the warm fuzzies and was reminded of the growing pains of my own early motherhood. It's all here -- the joyful, in-your-scrapbook moments as well as the jaw-grinding frustrations of living with a tiny pre-school person.Familiar voices in the book include the likes of Louise Erdrich (\\"Blue Jay's Dance\\") and Joyce Maynard, plus countless new writers whose contributions to \\"Mommy Lit\\" are worthy of anthologizing.

Often, we mothers and fathers of toddlers keep our war stories to ourselves, trying in vain to sustain the illusion that we do, in fact, wear the pants in our house. But anyone who's actually been the caretaker of a stubborn developing human whose pointed goal of complete independence is continually thwarted by stature, social constraints, and parental interference knows who the boss really is. TODDLER is a kind of parenting tell-all, a first-person, behind-the-scenes glimpse of the toughest reality show there is: raising a child. Parents will be comforted to discover that their kid isn't the only one with inexplicable demands and intense preferences, and it will come as a relief to know that parents have plenty of company in the challenging experience of shepherding their charges through the hard-going terrain of two-year-old life. And yet the book is not all horror stories and I-can't-believe-she-said-that-in-front-of-the-neighbors incidents: while there is none of the treacly \\"but it's all worth it\\" sentiment that often pervades writing about life with young children, the book does feature sweet moments reminding us why it is we love our irascible, demanding, incredible toddlers as much as we do. TODDLER is a unique and wonderful book -- and a must-have addition to any mother or father's parenting library.by Andrea BuchananAuthor of _Mother Shock: Loving Every (Other) Minute of It_(Seal Press)"},{"Title":"Toddler: Real-Life Stories of Those Fickle, Irrational, Urgent, Tiny People We Love","review":"Those looking for a syrupy, sentimental, all-warm-and-fuzzy idealization of child-rearing probably won't like this one so much; but it will resonate with others who are more open to consider the complex range of experiences and emotions toddlers bring to their parents. I would not describe it so much as a how-to manual, but more as a testament to the fact that people who become parents are still people in other respects too. In this regard I'm partial to one piece in particular, \\"Is It Day Now?\\" by Shu-Huei Henrickson. If you have a kid already, buy it and read it, and you'll take heart from good company in many of your feelings. If you don't have a kid yet, buy it and read it too, and you'll get a better sense of what may be in store!"},{"Title":"Toddler: Real-Life Stories of Those Fickle, Irrational, Urgent, Tiny People We Love","review":"I really did forget how exhausted living with a toddler makes me. I should have taken better notes with my first when I raised him through toddlerhood a decade ago, kept a list of things to remember.~You will not be allowed to move an inch outside of the toddler's orbit without then having to listen to and deal with the terrified wails of a child who sounds like their toenails are being peeled back.~Forget about getting anything all the way done, and try not to get too frustrated by the piles of half-finished things everywhere. If it gets too bad you could always just push it into a heap in the middle of the living room and light a fire-use it to roast the toddler.~Nobody wants to listen to your kid scream on the other end of the phone. Nobody. So forget about maintaining any long-distance friendships.~If the toddler doesn't have a chance to run around like a possessed pony for at least three hours a day, you shouldn't be surprised by the way the living room looks when the kid finally lets go of the ceiling fan and goes to bed.One thing has recently given me a wonderful hit of sanity, and a much-needed reminder that I'm not the only person with a toddler in her life who sometimes has to fight the urge to throw herself in front of a speeding bus: Toddler: Real-life Stories of Those Fickle, Irrational, Urgent, Tiny People We Love, edited by Jennifer Margulis.This book is full of open and frank essays about life with the little heads. The writing is wonderful, and reading it gave me a feeling of renewal and connection to my parenting, and reminded me that this part will have passed into something else before I even know it. It allowed me to give myself permission to hate this stage as much as I love it, and to not beat myself up for wishing it would move just a little bit faster so I can get on with MY life already. It makes a great gift for anybody who has a toddler ruling their life, so get it, read it, and spread it around.Even though this book won an Independent Publisher's Award, there's talk of it going out of print, and that should not be allowed to happen.

However, I wasn't prepared for the language I found in several of the stories. If you routinely yell, \\"f---\\" or \\"s---\\" in response to your kids actions, then you might not think twice about it. I'll admit to letting \\"damn\\" slip out a couple of times, but I have never used some of these other words in front of anyone, especially my kids. And I agree with the previous reviewer who was a little shocked by the story where the mom is thinking of graphic sexual phrases in response to a teacher's comment about her preschooler. \\"Shame, shame,\\" indeed.

The guys feels guilty and all, but still, maybe it's too much \\"Reality Reading\\" here, and shouldn't we be trying to avoid saying stuff like that?. But then, I read a few more stories about all kinds of different stuff, and there's this one about a mom getting bored at the park talking to the other mommies, and she starts thinking about sex, like graphically, like we're talking about the stuff she says she's thinking about I never even heard of. I mean, I finished that story, and tried to look back at it to figure out what was going on, but what, is that funny?

This however, is a classic that should be in your library if you're interested in Coaching in the workplace. Most of the Coaching books I've purchase are soft and weak in their content. Many of these don't really offer a process on \\"how to coach\\" or even explain what coaching is. Other books seem to be a \\"make you feel good\\" style of book, but don't offer hard skills to coach others for performance. I guess this is why the term \\"coaching\\" seems to be misused and abused which I find frustrating. This book offers tangible content and more.

However, it has stuck in my mind with startling clarity because of the mastery of the author both as a writer and as a fly angler. It is a collection of lucid essays about Roderick Haig-Brown as a boy and a young man learning the art of fly fishing from wonderfully drawn tutors . This is a book that a father would give to his son or an uncle to his nephew. One of the really great angling books of all time."},{"Title":"River never sleeps","review":"Haig-Brown is the master of writing about the sport of fly fishing. Through this work you experience the man, the sport and the land. Though written years ago, it is timeless. His love of the rivers, lakes and their surroundings is shared and felt by anyone who goes afield today with the long rod."},{"Title":"River never sleeps","review":"For the longest time, I held off reading any Haig-Brown because I didn't identify with the main advocates, those (seemingly) elitist fly fishermen on Internet message boards. About a decade ago I picked up a used copy of \\"Fisherman's Fall\\" (his second best book)and marveled at the man's ability to tell a story -- mostly about fish and fishing -- so clearly and lyrically. In short order I learned that RH-B moved to Canada post WWI as teen and earned a living any which way he could, including falling timber and trolling spoons on heavy spinning gear for VI springs. Nothing effete about this fellow! I was well and truly hooked and have read another half dozen of his books (including the four seasons books).But the jewel in the crown is ARNS. Haig-Brown's personal story so worth reading that my non-fishing 70 year mother rated it one of the better non-fiction books she'd ever read. Rod Brown led such a fascinating life in a time and place that offered sport fishing opportunities few of us will ever see . . . and certainly none in native English speaking countries. His love of rivers, forests, and people shows itself not in some philosophical meanderings, but in a vital sense of shared excitement at discovery and participation. Here's a man who wanted to know where the fish lay in his home water, the Campbell River. Rod wriggled into a wetsuit, put on a mask, snorkel and flippers and swam the river, diving down to spy the chinooks holding in the deep all the other salmon and trout in between. To test whether or not waders would fill with water and pull the wrong-footed angler to the bottom of the river to tumble and inevitably drown in those lead (sic) boots, he put on his waders and walked out over his head to see what happened. (Not a whole lot other than getting wet and needing to point his feet downstream to prevent hitting his head on boulders.) Haig-Brown was also an innovative and expert fly fishermen, pioneering the dead drifted dry fly for summer run steelhead. His stories of long-gone fishing holes and extinct runs of salmonids heighten the pleasure fishing addicts like myself derive from reading and thinking, \\"What would it have been like to have stood on the banks on the Stamp watching the General fish his run?\\"A well-lived life in and around fishing, in a beautifully told book."},{"Title":"River never sleeps","review":"I had missed out on this man's work when I was younger.

It includes a general treatment of bad-faith attitudes and policies, and a series of more detailed case studies of exceptionally egregious violations of legal treaties & human rights. It is timeless because of ongoing popular and official ignorance or lack of concern for American Indian rights, economic problems and indigenous culture---witness, for just one chilling example, the continuing imprisonment of Oglala/Anishinaabe activist Leonard Peltier, for murders he did not commit.Jackson was a pioneer activist for Indian rights, and commitment shines through on nearly every page. While it is true that her writing style may seem dated to some contemporary undergraduates, her subject's intrinsic interest holds the attention of any reader with more than a marginal interest in the topic. It is still useful for research purposes, though it is perhaps most valuable for history and/or anthropology courses on changing attitudes & policy toward Indians.In teaching about American Indian history, a main reservation about assigning it is the need to present what Indians themselves have said and/or written about their encounters with Euro-Americans. For a fine variety of views on these issues, see P.

With statements like, \\"Hook, Line and Sinker\\", and words like, \\"Tomboy\\", Garrison gives readers the history and reasoning behind so many overused and frequently spoken phrases and words in the world of speech.I am one of the biggest word nerds ever, so this book was very enticing to me. A lot of the histories of the phrases and words were very interesting, but some of them just felt like they were filling space. I was impressed for the most part by this book, I just wish a little more time was taken on research and development. I also felt that some of the definitions/histories were very obvious and not much thought was put into them. As a whole though, I really loved this book. It was a very interesting read and it was fun to learn some things that I did not know already. If you are an avid grammarian, or just some with an interest in why we say what we say, you will love this book and have a fun time reading through it.

In 19 easy-to-read and short chapters themes like sports, outdoors, money, food, animals and borrowed from the British English are covered.

It is a collection of all phrases such as barnstormer that make you wonder how on earth this term means what it does. Each entry goes into the background of a word or phrase to explain where it came from and sometimes its evolution over the years. Each description is about 2-3 paragraphs long, making each explanation short and sweet.I was so excited to get this in the mail. And then I started reading it. Or trying to read it. This is not a book to be read in one sitting. Unless you're very much into language and its origins, you will find this book boring and dry. There's really nothing wrong with it, it's just not up my alley (and no, that saying was not in this book, or I just didn't look hard enough).One thing that I didn't agree with - the organization of the book. There were 19 different sections, all pertaining to different areas: one dealt with sports (yep, I had to skip over a lot), one with the outdoors and one with \\"hip\\" sayings that we've never stopped using. I think a dictionary/encyclopedia arrangement would have worked better with this sort of book because of the \\"areas\\" seemed to veer away from their main subject or be a bit loosely defined. I remember thinking more than once, he made a whole topic out of that idea?I think this book is a bathroom book. It's fantastic in short bursts.

Little did I realize this is not a brand new book, but rather a reprinted one. It was first published around 2000 (according to the copyright page) and it has recently been reprinted with a more stylish cover. So if you read the first edition, there is nothing that indicates anything new here.Garrison takes popular words/phrases and gives a brief description of them. This description can either be the way they are used now, or a story of where the word originated from. Each description is about one paragraph long. It's like a cross between an encyclopedia and a dictionary, which different chapters for different types of phrases (i.e. \\"The Great Outdoors,\\" or \\"The World of Entertainment.\\"Some of the words will make you groan with the obviousness of it such as Babel. Most people could probably think of a realist background for it and probably be right. Other words have more intriguing or little known backgrounds. One of these words is sandwich, named after John Montagu who was the fourth Earl of Sandwich who ate meat between two slices of bread.What I didn't like was how short the definitions were. I would've much rather seen few definitions with more space devoted to them. Some of the words sound like they have a great back story and five lines is all too little to tell it effectively.If you are a wordsmith and enjoy knowing random trivia questions this may be the book for you. It won't be riveting, but is fun to randomly search a couple words at a time.Better yet.

That's what this book really is best at - being a bathroom reader. It's not the type of book you read straight through; but it does have some gems if you're willing to sift through all of the entries! I learned the roots of \\"Let the Cat Out of the Bag\\" (cats were sometimes sold on the black market in bags, trying to be passed off as young pigs), \\"Booze\\" (actually a term started in Philadelphia!), and \\"O.K\\" (began as a political term!)My favorite entry was actually the last one, \\"Wrong Side of the Bed\\", where it explained that anything on the left side of the body, or the physical world was \\"sinister - mysterious and dangerous, and perhaps evil\\"!

I like to introduce each act with some interesting information that will enhance the students' reading. We began this play by discussing King Leontes' major problem - jealousy. I introduced the idiom \\"the green-eyed monster\\" and we talked about the devastating consequences of a life lived with jealousy, citing other literary and biblical characters that have displayed this attribute. Things got a little interesting when a thoughtful face asked, \\"But isn't our God a jealous God?\\"Turns out Shakespeare doesn't actually use the term \\"green-eyed monster\\" in The Winter's Tale, so imagine my surprise when I came across the etymology for this phrase and discovered that he was the first to use it in print in Othello! I found this information while reviewing the book Why You Say It by Webb Garrison. Here's Garrison's brief explanation for the \\"green eyed monster\\":Casting about for a vivid way to describe jealousy, the Bard of Avon remembered that many cats have green eyes. Not necessarily correctly, he seems to have considered cats to be cruel and vindictive.Therefore, in Othello (Act III), he called jealousy the green-eyed monster - comparing it with a cat that to a human appears to play with a the bird or mole it has captured and is about to eat. p. 8Since I enjoy and collect books on etymology, I was happy to review Why You Say It for Thomas Nelson Publishers.

They are also a bit shallow and more than once I was wishing there was much more information. Then again, Mr. Garrison himself states that this isn't intended to be a scholarly work and hopes that you have lots of fun and perhaps learn something along the way.

I picked this book because I thought finding out the \\"fascinating stories\\" behind phrases we use all the time, would be fun and educational and all that good stuff.This book explains the stories or reasons how everyday phrases and words came to be. Why we say \\"cameo role\\" or \\"let one's hair down\\". They break it down and tell you within a paragraph or two where the word or words originated from, and how they came to be used as slang or whatever you want to call them. Garrison explains their origins and backstories.When I first started reading, I was excited. It seemed like such a fun and cool way to learn about how these popular phrases we use without thinking, came about. Sadly though, I was not particularly drawn in by the information presented. I find it is presented in a very dry, and somewhat boring, manner. It did enlighten me to how these words developed into what we use them for today, but not in a very engaging manner. I just found it very hard to keep reading. The author just wasn't presented in a way where I felt like I wanted to continue reading. It became a chore, which is not the best thing for a book to be.I cannot claim I would recommend this book to others. It is not a book to keep by your night stand to read whenever you get a chance. The best I can say is it may indeed, be perfect as a bathroom reader. Which is not always a bad thing. There are some successful books out there MADE to be bathroom readers. In our family, we always keep material in the bathroom so one doesn't grow bored if you happen to need to be in there. So that is where I think this book will end up. My father loves facts and random knowledge, so it may prove to be quite popular as a book to skim through when you have a few moments.

It was very interesting reading this book and learning about all the different sayings. I received this book from Thomas Nelson."},{"Title":"Why You Say It","review":"Words are mysterious by themselves. We need context, past usage, and root meaning to define them. Why You Say It is a fascinating look at the story behind over 600 words and phrases in daily usage. Garrison looks at words and phrases from the world of entertainment, sports, animals, the business world, the outdoors, the British, food, and many other categories.One example: Have you ever wondered where the word sniper came from? Well the Snipe was one of the most common birds during the Middle Ages in England. Its flesh was prized as a delicacy but it was a bugger to shot with a bow and arrow. With the invention of firearms in the 16th century a hunter could wait in concealment and snipe the bird when they came into range thus making a quick, silent, and efficient kill. \\"As a result, the name of the bird hunter designates any solitary marksman or terrorist who fires from a place of concealment\\" (62).This is a fun resource for the inquisitive wordsmith who finds joy and excitement by digging into the meaning, history, and usage of words. It is like a historical dictionary of sorts. It serves as a good book to keep in the bathroom for extended use. It will also prove a helpful resource for the preacher or public speaker who is daily using words to convey messages of varying import.If there is a criticism it lies in the fact that this book was originally published in 2000 and is in need of an update. It is lacking many contemporary words which have since invaded our culture.Reviewed through Book Sneeze."},{"Title":"Why You Say It","review":"If you like trivia, I have the book for you. Webb Garrison wrote a book entitled Why You Say It subtitled \\"The Fascinating Stories Behind Over 600 Everyday Words and Phrases.\\" For trivia buffs like me, this book is wonderful. The information on the back of the book describes it best:\\"Are you more likely to take the bull by the horns or beat around the bush? Don't let anyone call you on the carpet for failing to put your best foot forward. That would be a bitter pill to swallow. In the long run, it's easier to just bite the bullet and get your ducks in a row. After all, nobody likes the taste of humble pie.\\"You've likely uttered at least one of the adages within the last week, but have you ever stopped to consider where such conversational staples originated? Why You Say It reveals the backstory of more than six hundred words and phrases that pepper our everyday dialogue. This catalog of our language's most colorful expressions delivers an illuminating read for anyone curious about the evolution of words.\\"It's easy to see where some of the words and phrases in the book originated and how they came into play, such as Handwriting on the Wall. As you may remember from Scripture, the book of Daniel tells how the hand of God wrote four strange words on the wall while King Belshazzar of Ancient Babylon misused holy vessels taken from the Jewish Temple. Daniel was able to interpret the mysterious message and told the king disaster would come upon him and the nation. Events soon unfolded just as Daniel had said.The backstory on others are not as well-known. Melba Toast was named after Dame Nellie Melba, a famous opera singer in the late 1800s. She demanded thin slices of bread oven-baked until very crispy, which came to be known as Melba Toast.There are also phrases where you think you know how it came about but, after reading Mr. Garrison's description, find out you were wrong. For instance, \\"Grin Like a Chesire Cat\\" did not originate with Lewis Carroll's \\"Alice in Wonderland.\\" Instead, it came from Cheshire County, England. Cheshire County \\"was an independent political unit for centuries. Justices of the peace named by the king had no jurisdiction,\\" so Delamere Forest became famous as a haven for highwaymen. During King Richard III's reign, Mr. Caterling was named as the new forest warden. He put an end to poaching and captured the criminals, many of which were hanged. Caterling had a wide grin on his face while watching the executions. This unpleasant expression was described as \\"grinning like the Cheshire Caterling.\\" Over the centuries, it becamed shortened to the phrase we are all familiar with now.This is a very interesting book, a fun and easy read. I think anyone who reads it will find it very enjoyable and enlightening as well.Webb Garrison, formerly Associate Dean of Emory University and President of McKendree College, wrote more than 55 books, including Civil War Curiosities and Civil War Trivia and Fact Book. Before his death in 2000, Garrison lived in Lake Junaluska, North Carolina.This book was provided free of charge by Thomas Nelson Publishers."},{"Title":"Why You Say It","review":"Why You Say It by Webb Garrison is a good resource for the curious minds that enjoy the various strange expressions and words used in the English language. It contains about 600 words and phrases that we use in our vernacular language and summarizes the origin of them. It has almost all of the major phrases that I hear and some that I rarely hear. For example, it has the phrase \\"Handwriting on the wall\\" which stems from the writing of condemnation on the Babylonian wall in the book of Daniel. This book as I said satisfies one's curiosity on word origin. However, it is no Oxford English Dictionary or anything of the like. Webb Garrison does use numerous good resources to enlighten the individual on word origins, and I believe that the material is pretty accurate. It is good book for a quick look up on a word or phrase, but not a research tool. One thing I noticed is that he rarely uses dates for the origins except to say like the word \\"Pandemonium\\" was invented by John Milton in his Paradise Lost, but unless one is knowledgeable in high literature and poetry, more research might be required to know when this epic poem was written. Overall, I found the book enlightening, and it contains a good overview on the strange and sometimes nonsensical things we say."},{"Title":"Why You Say It","review":"Why You Say It is an interesting work detailing the origins and original meanings of many figures of speech and phrases. Coming in at 348 pages, this book remains a light read for the reason that the entire book works like this:HEDGEThroughout much of northern Europe, early farmers planted bushes and shrubs to serve as fences and boundary lines. Anglo-Saxons were partial to hawthorn, a row of which they called a hege. It was a mark of caution to plant hawthorn around a field, or hedge it. Eventually the name of the barrier came to be used in connection with many kinds of safeguards. As a result, we say that a person who wagers on several horses rather than only one hedges his bet. Many a person manages to hedge by avoiding direct promises and unqualified commitments.(definition of \\"Hedge\\" from p. 182)The above format is followed for around 600 different words and phrases. It makes for a slightly educational and interesting read, but I found myself growing uninterested very quickly. Why You Say It is not as interesting as it is made out to be. The book retails for $14.99, so unless you want to read about how all 600 phrases originated, purchase another book with your money, such as David Murrow's The Map (also by Thomas Nelson Publishers).This book was provided freely for my review.

Anyone who enjoys trivia will love this and even for those who don't, it's an enjoyable read nonetheless."},{"Title":"Why You Say It","review":"Language is a tricky thing. Its development is fluid and often lost in the mists of time. Why do we say what we say? Words have origins that are sometimes traced readily, but at other times defy explanation. This is often even more true of sayings and expressions. It can seem a veritable pandemonium.By the way, where do we get the term pandemonium? If it sounds Latinate to you, you're on the right track, but in fact pandemonium is a place name, used by English poet John Milton, as the place Satan and his peers have their headquarters. So, if you use the term pandemonium today to mean a place of discontent, disquiet, or chaos, your heart is in the right place.Where do we get the expression, the 'heart is in the right place?' I'm assuming that most people's hearts will be where they have come to be placed - in the middle of the torso, between the lungs and above the liver. The ancient Egyptian mummifiers might have known where the heart was (although they didn't quite know what the organs did), but through the ages the results of the heart beat might bring one to question its location - when it is in the right place, all is presumably well.Author Webb Garrison has pulled together literally hundreds of words and expressions that might have colourful and interesting backgrounds. This book is a trivia treat - it is not a systematic treatise or etymological survey by any means, but rather a short, handy reference for those who like to ponder imponderables. For those who do any public speaking, this can be a valuable resource.For anyone else, this is an interesting collection of possible word and phrase origins. I say 'possible', because while Garrison provides a nice bibliography, there are no source citations, and, language being what it is, these phrases may or may not all have the origins presented here. However, a random sampling check against the OED shows that most conform to the most commonly held ideas, at least according to that standard text.So, follow the hype and get your ducks in a row, for you've heard it here first, though perhaps not from the horse's mouth. It is no hogwash, and I'm not pulling your leg or trying to pull a fast one. I've no axe to grind nor a chip on my shoulder compelling me to recommend this book."},{"Title":"Why You Say It","review":"The meaning and origin of common words and phrases explained in approximately three paragraphs. Set up to be the perfect book for quick reference or bathroom breaks. The premise and setup of this book are good, but the actual contents are mediocre to bad. Some phrases, especially the more obscure or regional ones, could have benefited from a more in depth explanation, or even a sentence using the term, to better illustrate how the term is used. The author also could have \\"connected the dots\\" a bit more on how the term came about to how it came about as we now know it.Some entries (see Molotov Cocktail) were incomplete and consequently the \\"punchline\\" is never fully realized (\\"Molotov bread baskets\\" of which the Molotov Cocktail was a response both in action and name, were never even mentioned by Mr. Garrison).The worst offenders, like Three Sheets to the Wind, are just simply wrong. Mr. Garrison claims this phrase came about because the \\"rolling and pitching of a poorly rigged ship\\" was the result of a four-masted ship with only three sails unfurled in a gale. What Mr. Garrison doesn't seem to realize is that in a large gale, likely none of a ship's sails would be out, unless you wanted the masts torn out! His claim about symmetry is also untrue. Further, the phrase existed long before four-masted ships, so the author's explanation is wrong on multiple levels.While incomplete explanations are frustrating, they can be overlooked in light of the better written entries. A number of incorrect explanations, however, call into question all of the entries and consequently I cannot enjoy or recommend this book."},{"Title":"Why You Say It","review":"When this book came up on the BookSneeze program, I was intrigued (to say the least) and snagged a copy. What I got was more or less what I expected.The book is pretty straightforward. Each chapter title \\"categorizes\\" the words or phrases it will discuss (with titles like \\"Names and Games\\" and \\"Many Were Famous, Others Were Merely Rich\\") followed by a list of that chapter's entries. A \\"See Also\\" list is included in each chapter for phrases that may be simlar to the chapter's offerings, as well as an index of all phrases and words at the end of the book.As I probably should've expected, this book is pretty academic in its presentation and descriptions. While it usually does give interesting descriptions about how the words and phrases often came about, the book can become pretty dry if read straight through instead of using it as a reference. Additionally, some of the descriptions leave you wanting slightly more details, while others can be a little too detailed. Also, for a book that is describing how these sayings came to be, it occasionally sprinkles other adages into its descriptions, becoming distracting in its usage toward the end of the book.How you enjoy this book depends on how you read it. If you're looking for a quick reference on words and phrases or a gift idea for a word geek (like myself), this book is perfect. If you're looking for trivial knowledge or a short read or two, it's also a great book.

It was more entertaining to flip through it with my husband and read occasional sayings and their meanings aloud.

I love those kinds of books when life gets super busy. I kept this in the car for ages. Then, on those days, when I got to the boys' school early, I could keep myself entertained while learning about where things came from!If you're a \\"too busy to read\\" type of person or if you're just a word geek, this book is certainly one that you'll want to pick up."},{"Title":"Why You Say It","review":"My thoughts: Although this is usually not the case, I would venture to say that the description for this book given by the \\"salesmen\\" is actually pretty accurate. It is exactly as it is described- a book similar to a dictionary in format which gives a short paragraph or less about each word and phrase. It is not a very captivating read for hours on end, but it is ok for a quick read, a phrase a day, or what have you. Some of the words seemed very random while others just seemed extraneous, like they just needed to get past 600 words- but I will say that there are some interesting descriptions. (Sometimes the descriptions weren't satisfying enough though- like it lacked a couple more sentences of explanation.) Believing that I live in a perfect world, I did approach the book a couple at different times with some phrases and words that I really wanted an explanation for- they were really really common phrases- and none of them were featured, a little disappointed i'm not going to lie. But that is not the book's fault so I'm going to stop rambling. My final thoughts are- it was ok, I'm not going to jump into the street to push it out of oncoming traffic that it didn't see when it was carelessly crossing the street and risk my life, but I might shout WATCH OUT or something- that's about the level of caring. xD anyhow.

Lol."},{"Title":"Why You Say It","review":"There is no doubt that you noticed a young whippersnapper got this website up to snuff with a new look, but did you know how \\"whippersnapper\\" and \\"up to snuff\\" got its phrasing? Webb Garrison, author of Why You Say It, gives the background on over 600 everyday words or phrases handed down through the decades.For instance, whippersnapper came from the greenhorn cowboy who first learned the easiest skill of snapping a black snake whip. These brash and unskilled beginners would strut through town calling attention to themselves by snapping their whips, but everyone knew they didn't have the real skills of bulldogging a steer or roping a maverick.Being up to snuff came from Europeans during the 17th century when snuff was becoming common. The discerning connoisseur was a person who could distinguish the difference between good and bad powder tobacco. The sharp fellow, who was not easily deceived by a sniff, was said to be up to snuff. With the changing social habits of the day, not up to snuff referred to an amateur's ability, later changing the label of ridicule to anyone's below standard performance or ability to discern.The book is loaded with fun and humorous phrases like: nip it in the bud, horseplay, go off half-cocked, blow off steam, poppycock, ducks in a row, shoot the works, and left-handed compliment. The history of popular words includes: blockbuster, blue jeans, Listerine, on hold, golf, bikini, America, hit, cheesecake, and circus.These fun little pieces of trivia will bring a smile to your face and open your eyes to a history almost forgotten. I was personally fascinated by several of the stories behind phrases that were past down from my parents and grand parents, which didn't make sense until I read the book. The book is currently available through Thomas Nelson.I received this book free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their BookSneeze.com book review bloggers program.

I love to learn the origin story of products we use, or words we say. I was excited to receive this book and literally started to read while I stood in my kitchen with the open box at my feet.I am impressed at the number of background stories Webb Garrison managed to cram into a book with only 356 pages. The book is simply written and very easy to understand, however I will admit that I was left wanting more. The origin stories are very brief, usually no longer than three or four paragraphs, and in my opinion that is just not enough space allotted to adequately provide enough background on a phrase. Although, I liked reading the origin stories of so many phrases, I think I would of enjoyed the book even more had there been less phrases and more meat.Disclosure: I received this book free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their [...] book review bloggers program.

Although, I found some parts interesting in the book overall it was underwhelming to the 100th Degree.

Which, we can already conclude because we all have & use Dictionary's, right? This set up alone was enough to put even the most seasoned reader to sleep. I have never wanted to know why we say \\"Melba Toast\\", the story behind \\"Full of Beans\\", or the story of a \\"Sandwich\\".All of the stories were not as boring as others but you have to read every little mundane story just to get to one or two clever ones.

The book, written by Webb Garrison, examines the history behind common words and phrases that the average English speaking person encounters nearly every day.I'm not sure really how to rate this book. At times it was interesting; however, more often than not, I was eager to skip ahead. Each word or phrase reads like a Wikipedia article: brief, hitting the important things, and slightly wordy.Some words and phrases were very interesting, having truly fascinating history. Others were logical. Many were surprising.Garrison aims well, but never really hits the mark. Some words I wanted to know more about, and others seemed to be too full of boring history. I realize that Garrison has no impact on the etymology of words, but I feel like this book could have easily been shorter.Overall, Why You Say It was an interesting enough read, but it leaves no lasting impression on me.

We are language geeks here. (linguiphiles??)

Over 600 words and phrases. Most importantly, it contains within it's covers the explanation for the phrase \\"I'm pooped\\". I've got boys, enough said.Now, this is a reference-type book. The people who are going to love it are a particular type of people. Lovers of language and history. Trivia buffs. I found a few sideways references to things you might not want young kids reading about, but it's clean (unlike a slang dictionary I ran across once, good heavens, that was eye-opening!)The book is organized by subject, though it has a complete alphabetical index as well. So you can see what words or phrases we have relating to the entertainment world, or money/commerce, food, \\"Making Fun of Others\\" (actual chapter title) and more. Each chapter beings with a quote, an introductory paragraph, and a list of it's contents as well as a list of other words that might fit into the chapter but apparently fit better in a different chapter. Cross-referencing is fun!I think I probably liked this book because I'm familiar with many of the contents, but not necessarily with all the history. It's great to have it all in one place so I can keep the tradition going with my kids--discussing obscure words and where they came from around the dinner table.I'll leave you with one word I grew up with, and it's origins:In the community, I was forever hearing complaints from teachers and people in charge of my \\"shoddy work\\". \\"You've done a shoddy job on this essay, rewrite it\\". \\"Your efforts at cleaning are completely shoddy. Put some elbow grease into it.\\" There was a definite British influence going on there.But now I know, after all these years, that the word comes from a slang word used by textile workers around the time of the American Civil War. It involved shredding old wool garments to use as materials for new wool military uniforms--they looked OK but didn't hold up well. Thus, shoddy equals something that might look decent at first glance but soon shows it's poor quality.

First published in 1940, their advice for understanding the written word has aged well. Their goal is to help us use the best books in our lifelong education. This version, rewritten in 1972, improves on the first release by incorporating recent research on the psychology of reading and reference to current additions to the growing population of worthy books.This book discusses both how to read and how to decide what is worth reading. There are four different levels of reading. The first is Level 1 Elementary Reading, in which we move straightforwardly through text, absorbing the obvious. It is a perfectly acceptable way to read road signs and the backs of cereal boxes. It is not sufficient for most books. Level 2 Inspectional Reading consists of scanning the structure and skimming the content of a book to get a general sense of its message. It requires fluency in Level 1 skills and is necessary to make an informed decision about whether to invest more effort in a book.Level 3 Analytical Reading is an advanced skill to which the authors devote seven chapters of carefully-considered description. Analytical readers need to classify a book and relate it to others that quote or supersede it. They need to outline or profile a book and understand its central messages. Analytical reading requires understanding the book's author, including the vocabulary of words, phrases and personal experiences the author uses to communicate and his or her purposes in writing the book. Analytical reading moves beyond understanding and accepting what authors tell us. It requires fairly evaluating their arguments and then taking a stand with respect to them. We haven't really read a book if we cannot clearly identify our points of agreement and disagreement with its author.The Level 4 Interpretive or \\"Syntopical\\" Reader has master the skills of reading related books and synthesizing from them a grasp of the larger body of knowledge. To echo one critic of this book's first edition, they know \\"How to Read Two Books.\\" The skills of Level 4 Reading are locating key passages in books, identifying the vocabulary, key questions and major issues of the subject area, and analyzing the ongoing discussion between authors of books on the same topic. Far from believing that this four-level approach is all the guidance we need, Adler and Van Doren present strategies for reading various types of books, ranging from poetry and imaginative literature to history, science and philosophy. They leave us well prepared to enrich ourselves from the pages of books.This is a valuable book for anyone who reads seriously. I'll advise slipping it into the suitcase of a college-bound niece or nephew. It will also reward a snow-bound adult on a chilly afternoon. For those who write as well as read,The Craft of Researchis a congenial companion volume. May your reading be rewarding."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"I thought I knew how to read well until I read this book. This has changed the way I will read books, magazines, and newspapers from now on. Well worth the price to learn to read well."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"This book is about how to read any given book in order to get out of it all that that book contains. The authors say that the art of reading can be conducted at four heirarchical levels: elementary reading (the simplest, which consists merely of recognizing phonetic symbols as \\"words\\"), inspectional reading (which consists of \\"sizing up\\" a book and reading it superficially), analytical reading (reading a book to truly understand it), and syntopical reading (the highest level of reading, understanding the discussion of an issue across multiple books). It is assumed that the reader knows already how to read at the elementary level (otherwise the reader would not be a reader at all), so not much time is spent on this level. Inspectional reading also receives a cursory treatment- just enough to show what it is, how to do it methodically, and its role in the higher levels of reading. The bulk of the book covers how to read a book analytically, i.e. for understanding: the questions to ask of a book in order to understand its structure and content, and how to reply adequately to the questions which the book, in turn, asks of its reader. The general principles of analytical reading are then shown in concrete examples of various types of literature (e.g. philosophy, science, imaginative literature, etc.).This book is extremely practical. Applying its concepts makes one not only a better reader, but better at communication and clear-thinking in general. As Wittgenstein said that what can be thought clearly can be expressed clearly, similarly what can be read clearly can be understood clearly. Reading this book in conjunction with a good logic text (such as Peter Kreeft's \\"Socratic Logic\\") will certainly help one to understand books, ideas, and life itself more clearly."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"Although it seems this book is written for those reading at the college or even graduate level, I wish someone had given it to me in high school. It shows how reading a book well is not just starting at page 1 and ending up on the last page. It guides you through various levels of reading, from the elementary all the way up to the \\"synoptic\\", showing step-by-step how to pay attention to both the details being presented, and to view the book from a broad perspective. It also has a section for how to differently approach works of literature, poetry, science, history, philosophy, and other genres. Once I read this book, I felt more confident in approaching the more difficult books like those of Aristotle, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, etc... This was the key to help open up these worlds to me."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"I found this book stimulating and it created within me a renewed desire for serious reading and a greater respect for my own fundamental desire to engage in reading over the years. I was struck by Adler's almost simple faith in the power of human reason. There is one section where he flatly states a rather radical concept, to my way of thinking, and that is that if two men are in discussion and begin with differing positions they MUST ALWAYS COME TO AGREEMENT if they clarify all errors of fact and reasoning that have caused them to disagree.It was also almost moving to me to read some of his statements in light of the year he wrote the book - 1940 or 1941- a time when the future of the Anglo-American/Western tradition of free inquiry based on reason was being seriously challenged by the repressive forces of Fascism, Communism, Hitlerism, and the Japanese Bushido warrior cult. And it wasn't entirely clear at that point which side was going to win out.I liked his notion of gradually expanding the community of men and women who have read the Great Books with understanding, and are conversant with their content and concepts.Although Adler did not make the following point, it did occur to me that although people of culture and learning will go to art exhibits to view the works of the old masters, or will attend the symphony or opera, you will rarely encounter someone saying \\"and this past weekend I also read volume two of Spinoza's great treatise.\\" Why don't we hear that? Because as Adler points out most of us view reading the Great Books as too difficult. Whereas I suspect he'd agree with me that great art and great music you can more passively appreciate without the intensity of intellectual engagement that serious reading entails.I am torn as to whether or not I should devote a portion of my future reading time to the Great Books that he lists. I was exposed to some of them during my college years, and others of them I may read just because I want to (such as Homer). But there are so many books and periodicals that I want to read that I have to be very selective due to my time constraints."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"I first read this book when I was in Junior High School. During the intervening 40 years I have carried it from place to place in my library without giving it a second thought. On a whim I picked it up last week and decided to see what was there.Wow! I'm sorry I didn't get more out of it when I was young. Fortunately much of what Mr. Adler writes is what I have discovered about reading, but I never articulated it. And now that he has, I can approach reading in a much more methodical way.I was startled to discover that there is now a new edition with Charles Van Doren listed as the first author. I am hard-pressed to imagine what he might have done to improve upon the perfection of the original. It is very entertainingly written with a very personal flavor that I really appreciate.I found it either discouraging or encouraging to read his diatribe against the American education system, realizing that he wrote it in 1939.(My copy was printed in 1960.)"},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"This is one of my favorite books. Adler and Van Doren give practical, sensible advice about how to get the most from what you read. This book is indispensible to students (high school and college).

You should own this book."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"The book contains a lot of very good advice on how to extract the most value out of reading a book, how to suck it dry as it were -- very good stuff. It is defintely worth reading, but there's one flaw (that's part of everything I read of Adler): his writing is extremely verbose. You will be constantly tempted to skip forward. An abridgement would be quite useful, I think -- something the size of Strunk & White, in paperback.Bottom line: should you read this book? I'm going to say yes, but be prepared to fast-forward a lot (and not feel guilty: it _is_ wordy and pompous)."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"I have the good fortune to be the 100th person to review this book, yet I think it deserves as much attention as possible, especially now that our educational system has dwindled down to new historic lows. As a society in the United States, we have clearly selected a path to quantity in terms of literacy, rather than quality and although this has given us great employability, much of the great talent in this country is latent. The approach undertaken by Adler is to awaken a reader from a passive observer to an active and demanding participant in the educational process while also appealing to the intellect. There is sometheing here for everyone seeking better ways to capture information or gain understanding from the most important invention of all time, the written word.I honestly thought I knew how to read a book until I was humbled into the realization that there are several levels to this activity, ultimately leading to the question of how to truly internalize a book and make use of it. It has in that respect increased my personal expectations of myself and thereby the selection of readings that I have undertaken.

I feel that due to this, this book serves as an excellent aid towards personal development if this is the nature of the material one reads.Adler was unquestionably a gifted teacher (through his writings at least) and has done great justice to the Aristotelian tradition of teaching through detached brilliance, codifying his observations.The other great byproduct of how to read a book is the preponderance of the writer on how to actually structure the writing of a book. The writing process is thus greatly enhanced, as one should anticipate the needs of a highly discriminating reader and produce meaningful and accessible work.I wish that this book was part of the curriculum for me in high school, it would have made a significant impact in my college years."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"Recently started grad school and this book has given me good tips on getting through the 400+ pages of reading that has to be done each week.

The next challenge is to find the time to form the habits taught here that will improve my reading skill. Perhaps one of the most lasting impressions I will have of this book and Mortimer Adler in general is his differentiation between reading for knowledge/information, reading for enjoyment/entertainment or the kind of reading and learning he hopes to encourage which is reading for understanding/wisdom. I was frusterated by my experience of modern education's focus on speciallizations and I feel that school did not form in me the skills needed for a continuous life of learning. Highschool and college turned something that should be about pursuing your wonder at the world around you into something that feels like work and is fixated on preparation for working the rest of your life away. I regret that I didn't recieve encouragment to study on my own 15 years ago - I would have been happier and better off if I had dropped out of highschool and taught myself through the great books. I didn't do it in highshool, but I plan on doing it now! Thank you Mr. Adler - Rest In Peace."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"This is a great book for young readers.

They start with explaining the four levels of reading: elementary, inspectional, analytical and synoptical, and the level of understanding one should expect from each level. They also explain the basic principles of gaining an anticipatory understanding of the book you're attempting to read. For instance, it's critical that you first read, understand and think about (and I stress, think about) the jacket, title, contents, index, preface and the introduction before reading the body of the work. In essence, How to Read... introduces the reader to a level of involvement that hopefully makes for a more satisfying and enlightening experience. The authors also make a strong case for reading and understanding the classics (something I tend to agree with) because they (the authors) think the classics add an element of philosphical depth to ones life.

But for my money and time, had Mortimer Adler been able to read that book before writing his book telling us how to read, he might have produced a book that I could have found interesting.I would recommend the prospective buyer of this book read Amazon's preview excerpt of this book. After reading the excerpt, ask yourself what you could share with a friend about what you have read--or even what might be useful for others to know.

We inhale and exhale and scarcely pay attention to the process until we start gasping for breath. The analogy to reading occurs when the reader begins to gasp for literary breath, usually when faced with a daunting read of a complex text. In HOW TO READ A BOOK, Mortimer Adler addresses a complaint that was current when the first edition of his book was published in 1940. College professors moaned that their students could not read in a manner that allowed these readers to come to terms with the authors of assigned texts. Oh, readers could read in a literal sense, that is from word to word from the first page to the last. They even might know some of the big words used, but when professors asked their undergraduate readers to discuss in their own words the content of those pages, the results were too often literary asthma. Now flash forward to today. Same problem, same result. What Adler tried successfully to teach in the classroom and in this text is just as relevant today as then.Reading, as Adler sees it, is divided into two types: there is the passive sort that requires that the reader to pay scant attention to the words on the page. Reading is a monologue in which the words of the author are filtered directly and uncritically to the cerebral cortex of the reader. The contents linger momentarily and exit the consciousness very nearly as quickly as they entered. The sports page and trashy novels are the feeding grounds for passive reading. Then there is the second sort--active reading. It is here that Adler insists that reading be an ongoing dialogue between reader and author. When the author begins the verbal conversation with the reader, that reader has the moral responsibility to treat those words just as if he(or she) were engaged in a literary debate with all the rules of the Princeton Debate Club applying. Adler demands that the reader do far more than merely read in a straight line progression from the first word to the last. The reader must engage in frequent stops to have a conversation with the author to make sure that the inner meaning of the words is transmitted as intended. Here, the standard tools of literary analysis apply: main idea, inference, conclusion, style, and tone. Most college professors would be ecstatic if their neophyte charges could read on that level. But to Adler, that is only the mid point on the road to reading the classics. What distinguishes the mid reader from the accomplished reader is the ability of the reader to render a judgment on the text based on ideas external to the text. Once the reader understands the intent of the author, a process Adler calls \\"coming to terms\\" with that author, then that reader is fit to pass judgment on the author's intent and ideas. Adler mentions plenty of tricks by which the neophyte reader can come to terms, most of which involve actively marking the text with pencil marks. It is only after these literary sleight of hand maneuvers have been accomplished can the reader aspire to the third and highest level, the black belt of reading: the critical reader. And it is precisely here that Adler suggests that reading is a self-perpetuating process: the more that a reader plows through the mind and deeds of the literary giants, the more that this reader will be able to do what the authors of these ancient texts have long desired--that their ideas will have been found, in the words of Francis Bacon, to be \\"digested\\" and \\"feasted.\\" Bacon learned his craft from the greats of Roman and Greek classical antiquity. Adler urges us today to do no less."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"Wow. This book is 346 pages of instructions on how to properly read a book. Add the two appendixes, the first giving a list of books to read to further stretch your mind, the second testing your understanding of the material, and you get a great book.Unless you have read the book, you probably wonder how it could take 346 pages to instruct you on how to properly read a book. However, the book shows that each page is necessary, and the fact you wonder that shows what little you know about how to read a book properly. Most people are only familiar with the first stage (which must be known to read this book) of reading, Elementary Reading. Few people understand the true activity involved in properly reading a book.The book is broken into four parts.The first part starts off with defining some terms, and analyzing different objectives for reading. It also shows that reading is an active effort that cannot be undergone passively. He also explains the beginning two levels of reading. Which are Elementary, and Inspectional Reading.The Second part deals with Analytical reading. This is by far the meat of the book. It is also the most rewarding. Since it is here that people need the most guidance. Adler explains each of the rules necessary for analytical reading very well. So not one point is missed, or misunderstood. He starts the section off with how it relates to the first stages of reading. He than continues to the instructions.The third part gives clearer instructions for particular types of reading material(ie. Social Science, History, Philosophy etc). It analyses each type of reading matter individually, first defining it (as best it can be) than giving either variations to the rules, or rules that are primary or more relevant.The last and final part, talks about the ultimate stage of reading. This part describes Syntopical reading, and gives the rules for it. Syntopical reading involves reading several books for the purpose of understanding a certain topic, than giving an objective analysis of the topic based on those books. This part ends with a short explanation of what reading does in your life. How it is needed to grow, and how the mind, like all other muscles can quickly waste away unless properly used.Such things that add to the books easy readability is the author's ability to structure the book so that each section coherently fits in your mind. At the same time, repeating certain principles that cause you to remember each instruction correctly. And the summary at the end of the chapters makes it easy to go back and review what you have learned.One thing to remember about this book is that Adler is obviously gearing this book for the novice as well as experienced readers who share one thing in common. The fact that neither knows how to read a book properly. Because of this, you sometimes get the feeling that Adler is over explaining certain topics. Or that he thinks you have absolutely no common sense when it comes to reading. However, I think this is an inherent risk when writing a book like this. As you will soon find out when reading this book, as the author himself says ,&quot;there is nothing arcane or even really new about what we have to purpose. It is largely common sense&quot; (pg.29). Because of this, there are two factors that may cause one to over explain certain topics. One is that you can't assume the reader knows too much. You have to supply what is necessary for the reader to understand what it is you are trying to teach. The second is that the Author has to know what is common &quot;common sense&quot; for the reader. Because Adler is so knowledgeable about this topic, he may lose that ability to know what needs to be explained and what doesn't.With this in mind, I highly recommend this book to anyone who would like to get more from the books they read. This book will forever change your reading ability."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"I read the original version of this book which was first published in 1940. I was so enamored with the book that upon finishing the 1940 version (which I had obtained from the library), I went out and bought the updated edition and read that! The updated edition (published in 1970) is even better than the original. The material is more logically organized and topics such as speed reading which were absent from the original edition are now discussed. I cannot recommend this book strongly enough. If you are an avid reader you will learn how to get so much more out of your reading than what you get already. And, perhaps most importantly, you'll get the courage and confidence to tackle a more difficult yet more rewarding class of books.

So, I decided to give it a second chance. It's now thoroughly underlined, highlighted, and thumbed through. I continue to use the reading list in the appendix as a lifetime must-read list.This is one of those books that really should be required reading in college, and perhaps high-school (but I doubt most high school students would bother with it). The fraction that I did originally read in college stayed with me all these years, and brought me back to the complete book. I won't go into detail of how the book works (other reviewers have done that), but will say that if you follow Adler &amp; Van Doren's suggestions for active, passionate reading you'll find yourself enjoying books more than ever. And, in my case, enjoying the act of reading for the first time in my life. Since first reading &quot;How to Read a Book&quot; some years ago, I've rarely been without reading material that I was enthusiastic about, and continue to use the suggestions in this &quot;guide to intelligent reading&quot; at various times to remind myself of such things as the difference between reading for information vs. understanding; or when and how to read long novels quickly and with immersion and not get lost or bogged down without taking forever to finish, if at all.This guide is filled with information and recommendations which most of us probably think we already know, but since the subject of reading itself isn't usually well taught, becomes a classic, and vital handbook for any serious reader."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"Well, I certainly got a lot of \\"witty\\" comments from people as I carried around a copy of Mortimer Adler's \\"How to Read a Book.\\" Being on the receiving end of redundant jokes was worth it though as Adler was a joy to read, even though I've read a number of books thus far.American philosopher and academic Mortimer Adler's book is a slight misnomer in that he does not necessarily tell the reader how to read a book, but rather how to read a book well...or \\"analytically\\" to use his terminology. It's not simply enough to let your eyes look at each and every word in sequence, then put the book down with a sense of satisfaction. The time invested in a book is precious. Therefore, argues Adler, only the best book should be invested in and the reader should make sure he extracts as much in formation as possible out of the book.For much of the book, Adler presents a list of \\"dos\\" to gain a full understanding of the author's message. He advises the reader to do some \\"pre-reading\\" first--reading the book's title, table of contents, index, even its index and the quotes on the back. This will prepare the reader's mind for the information he will receive and how it might be structured. He also highly recommends that the preface and introduction be read as this is where the author normally presents his thesis, purpose, and/or methodology. In reading body of the book, the thesis should always be kept in mind and the reader should be constantly examining how the author builds his argument. Finally, after the book is complete, the reader should be able to restate the book's premise and structure in just a couple sentences, reconstruct the argument, and be able to evaluate the book relying on logic rather than just emotional opinion.After giving general rules for reading analytically, Adler briefly evaluates various genres of books, giving the reader their general characteristics and how these reading rules might be slightly adapted to the genre. In this section, Adler tends to be \\"hit and miss\\" as he is quite helpful in presenting works of philosophy, science, and social science; but less helpful in imaginative fiction and history.Finally, Adler demonstrates how to read multiple books on the same subject in such a way as the books compliment one another, and provides a series of reading tests to reinforce the book's major premises.While I found this book well written and was able to glean some gems from it, I generally found that I was doing most of what Adler suggested already. We could all be better readers and Adler certainly gives encouragement in this regard, but as a whole my time might have been better invested elsewhere. However, I recognize that not all people read carefully and consider that books are actually long detailed arguments. For these people, I would highly recommend this book to aid and assist your future reading. For others, it would serve as an enjoyable read as the prose is majestic, but not all that necessary.Recommended."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"This is a review of \\"How to read a book\\" by Adler (May 2008).This book was recommended to me by several authors I liked so aftr reading the positive reviews I decided to buy it. I can see that some see this book as 'timeless' and I think that is true, but I have also some criticism.Pros:- I see the main value of the book in teaching you the ability to structure your reading process/effort so that you get maximum value out of reading any book. For experienced readers (age 35+) this may be already a kind of automatism, but for less experienced (either in terms of #years or in terms of type of topic) this is probably not the case.- I liked in particular the fact that the author not only discusses how to read book with emphasis on analytic content (rational / scientific / factual type of books), but also other kinds of literature.Cons:- The book is way too long. The author takes many pages to make a point that can also be done in 30% of the space. Fortunately, the author provides summaries of his 'rules' and tips. Nevertheless, an author who writes about how to efficiently read a book, should be brief himself! Just as you may expect from a dedicated reader that he reads efficiently, you may expect from a good writer he thinks through how to make a point, and be brief in the end, not forcing a reader to read many superfluous pages. Adler failed here. This makes me downgrade my rating.Bottom line: If possible get it from a library; I would not recommend buying this book if you are in the second half of your 'reading life'."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"The author makes many good points about reading skillfully, including how to determine if you should bother reading a particular book.The main point is that different books should be read differently. If you agree with that premise, this book will train you how to do it. If, on the other hand, you read the USA Today the same way you would read the Communist Manifesto or a technical journal, then you may have no use for the book.Unfortunately, Adler is a little wordy at times, but the book contains instructions on how to deal with verbose authors too!"},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"How to Read a Book clearly explains the four levels of reading a book. These are elementary, inspectional, analytical and syntopical. The authors teach that each reading level builds on the previous one. It was shown that the ability to read at the inspectional, analytical and syntopical levels were required to review a book or research paper effectively. It is clear that learning to read actively and effectively is a complex skill that requires careful and detailed study.The authors of How to Read a Book, Mortimer J Adler and Charles Van Doren, clearly and methodically delineate the four levels of reading, namely elementary, inspectional, analytical and syntopical. The authors explain how each level builds on the previous one. The authors have a deep understanding of a wide range of subjects. They presented propositions and arguments in a logical, thorough and convincing manner. This is reflected in their ability to simplify the subject whilst capturing its essence in a simple, easy to follow and understandable style.How to Read a Book is divided into four parts. The first part teaches the distinction between the four levels of reading. In this section there is a detailed discussion of the first two levels of reading, namely elementary and inspectional. The second part focuses on the third level of reading, namely analytical. The rules of analytical reading are carefully explained. The three stages of analytical reading comprise the rules for finding what a book is about, interpreting a book's contents and criticising a book as a communication of knowledge.Part three is an exposition of the different ways to approach different kinds of reading materials which include practical and theoretical books, imaginative literature, history, science, mathematics, social science and philosophy. Part four of the book focuses on the ultimate goal of reading, that is, syntopical reading. It teaches how to achieve a goal of lifetime reading.I have never been formally taught to read properly. The book provided me with the opportunity to learn to carry my reading to higher levels of skill. The book enabled me to understand the complex art of reading and the flexible application of some basic rules to different types of reading.My job involves carrying out a lot of research on various airline subjects that requires reading a number of related books. The book teaches me how to read the different books in relation to one another in such a way that I can clearly understand the complementary and conflicting aspects.I need to continue learning throughout my life. The book teaches me how to choose the best books to read so that I can develop the habit of self-directed lifetime learning."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"Adler and Doren believe that reading well is an art. This book gives a step by step method to reading difficult books well. I like this book because it has helped me to read 3 books that I found difficult to read (Homer's Illiad and Odyssey and Plato's Dialogues including The Republic).The authors provide a Great Book list in the Appendix."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"In this very useful book, Adler and Van Doren admirably succeed in showing the reader how to become a more able reader. For anyone, student, businessman, or otherwise whose success is dependent upon being able to quickly and thoroughly understand written material, this book will rapidly repay the purchase price and the time invested in reading it.The authors identify four levels of reading: 1)elementary reading - the ability to pick up a page of printed material and understand the words on it and their grammatical relation to each other; 2)Inspectional reading - the sort of reading one does in the library or bookstore to determine whether a book is worthy of the time to read it thoroughly; 3 - Analytical reading - the most thorough level of reading one can engage in with a single work. It is the level at which one converses with the book in a sense; 4)Syntopical reading - Reading many books about a single subject with the goal of gaining a comprehensive knowledge of it. The authors make the point that all books aren't worthy of the same level of reading. The authors don't have a problem with casually reading a novel for enjoyment, but that isn't the sort of reading this book describes. This book is a guide to the process of reading to learn and grow.The elementary level is only briefly described. After all, in order to make any use of this book, it is necessary that one first have the skills to read it. The chapter on inspectional reading may prove to be the most useful to many readers. Many students do not seem to have much skill in finding appropriate books for research, or they waste a lot of time on a book only to find out that it really is not helpful for their purposes. Many practical suggestions are offered to remedy this problem. The value of inspectional reading goes beyond this, however. Adler correctly notes that the teaching of literature in high school is particularly prone to destroying any comprehension or delight in the works studied by attempting to move to an analytic approach to the work without first getting the big picture to provide context.The bulk of the work is devoted to analytic reading. They divide this type of reading into three stages and offer four or so rules for each stage. In going through this process, the student should become thoroughly acquainted with what the book is about (what type of book it is, what problems it is trying to solve, etc.), understand what the propositions are that the author offers to solve his problem and how those are supported, and finally, be able to offer an informed critique of whether the author failed or succeeded in his attempt.Having described how analytical reading works in relation to expository works, the authors then devote 100 pages to explaining how the rules must be expanded or modified when dealing with specific types of literature such as history, fiction, or philosophy.Syntopical reading is covered in only one chapter. It is essentially an analytical reading of works or portions of works that pertain to a matter of interest. The rules and guidelines offered in that section are those that relate specifically to finding the right works, and then understanding when they are addressing the same matter (a subject sometimes made difficult by differences in terminology).The book is well organised and very easy to read. Anyone already capable of reading at the elementary level should be able to begin making use of the material in each chapter as soon as they have read it. This book would be an excellent gift for anyone graduating high school and preparing to go on to college."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"It is a conundrum that you have to read a book on how to read a book but the author has done a brilliant job of summarizing techniques for better comprehension .

I wish our school boards would have this book as a must read for sophomores and juniors in high school"},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"This is, without a doubt, the most useful book I have ever read. You may experience the same, even if you don't read all of it (which I did, but don't always recommend). The later chapters on syntopical reading (multiple simultaneous books on the same subject) and some of the specific types of reading (CH14-19) may be best read as needed, or some cases, re-read to sharpen your reading skills for a particularly important or challenging read.Another reviewer has written a good high level summary, so I won't repeat her outline of the book's argument, but I will say that I recommend this book to everyone who has even a passing interest in gaining more from what they read.To the few who claim this is a boring book, I say: it is a serious book about how to read better. If you're not even a little excited about the benefits of that, you probably won't like it. If you only read books for entertainment the way one might watch a movie, this book is likely of little use to you and best avoided.

The book teaches the very basic and fundamental steps that need to be taken to get the most out of reading a book. It's not just a matter of mechanically going through the book and getting the most you can via your recollection and knowledge; it requires more rigorous application of steps such as understanding the author's terms, propositions and conclusions and then deciding for yourself whether and why and to what extent you agree with the author or not. The discussion on syntopical reading is invaluable: the authors encourage and motivate readers to add their own insights and possibly expand the discussion and even add new knowledge to a field of experise via the reading and analysis of many books on the same topic. I think many casual readers feel that they are only receptors of the information and, because they are not certified on or in some way credentialed in a particular field, they have nothing to offer to the evolution of the discussion. The book also offers a humbling reminder to avid readers: you can read a lot and still not be well read; that is, if you are not in some way satisfying your reading appetite with some of the world's great works, you may be filling yourself but not getting all the intellectual nutrition you need."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"The suggestions about reading in this book are invaluable for anyone who wants to get (or give)a great education. It will tell you some rules that you think you have to follow but you don't, and other rules that you would never have thought of. Not only that, you get a little philosophy in the bag. Check it out before you start into that serious book you've been planning to make yourself read."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"This book is one of the best books I have read, and it has exerted immense influence on me. I now read actively -- I mean, as much as possible -- and can feel how much more I am gaining from reading. The book has shown me the way to life-long learning."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"In reading a book, it is important to differentiate between the three levels: entertainment, information and understanding. Gathering facts is not the same as gaining insight. Learning is not the same as discovery. There are four types of reading, each building on the previous: elementary, inspectional, analytical and syntopical. Elementary reading is reading as a child. Inspectional reading includes: title page, preface, table of contents, index, publisher's notes and pivotal chapters. Dip in here and there and read the last few pages. This process should take no more than one hour. This is most important for expository works. Even a difficult book should be read through without stopping. Remember speed-reading is actually variable speeds of reading as appropriate to the book in hand. The four basic questions are, 1: what is the book about as a whole? 2: what is being said in detail and how? 3:Is the book true in whole or part? 4: what of it-significance? The first four rules of analytical reading are: 1:classify the book, 2: find the unity, a single short statement that captures it's essence. 3: analyze the parts of the book. 4:determine the problems the author is trying to solve. The next four rules are: 5: come to terms with the author through key words and phrases. Important words help to increase understanding enormously. The approach is both top down and bottom up. 6: find the most important sentences and discover their propositions. 7: locate the basic argument of the book from the key sentences. Restate this in your own words to confirm your understanding. 8; find the authors solutions. If a book is over your head it is an opportunity to increase your knowledge. The last 4 rules concern criticism. 9: you must be able to understand before you can criticize. 10: when you disagree do so reasonably. 11: respect the difference between knowledge and opinion. Read other criticisms only after you have read the book, this can be very pleasurable. 12; show where the author is uninformed, misinformed, illogical or incomplete. The three sets of rules of analytical reading are therefore: structural, interpretive and critical. Degree of difficulty x size of audience=constant appears to be a rule. Great comment on Plato: wherever I go in my mind I meet Plato coming back. Syntopical reading involves creating a tentative bibliography, reading all the books inspectionally. Short-list the relevant books. Bring the authors to common terms. Establish a set of neutral propositions. Define the issues and analysis to throw maximum light on the subject. Ask questions as a child would and try to answer them. There is no limit to the amount of growth and development that the mind can sustain. Bibliography could do with bringing up to date from 1970 when to revision was written."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"nothing in this book is revolutionary. these are things any reader already knows and does, things that one had to learn to get through college. If you have a thirteen or fourteen year old definitely make him or her read it.

The list of books at the end is mostly crap. There is a difference between being educated and well rounded and a crusty old lit snob. one could waste an awful chunk of ones life reading dusty old greeks or Proust instead of Beard of Lewis or Vonnegut.

What more can you say for a book than: 'it changed the course of my life'? It did.How many intellectually oriented books remain in print for sixty years? Not many. \\"How to Read a Book\\" insured I would not be restricted to the shallow fare our University's spoon out and I learned not give up on reading the Western Canon, which most university students today do. They flee from the classics, after one course. I did not. I knew something my teachers did not tell me. I knew from \\"How to Read a Book\\": 1) do not get side tracked looking up strange words or reading the commentary on the bottom of the pages. Do that and know nothing from the first reading, except frustration. Just read the story, treatise of book through. You will be surprised how much you comprehend; 2) No one masters a classic from one reading. For a decent grasp, figure on three readings; 3) The only books truly worth reading are books that are over your head.\\"How to Read...\\" is not what many people conclude from the title. It is not a 'how to read manual.' It is a how to approach and comprehend different kinds of books. Adler's primary aim is to introduce people to learning by reading the Western Canon (The Great Books), which academics have all but expelled from school. \\"How to Read\\" could have been titled 'What Your Teachers Forgot to Teach You' or 'What Your Teachers Could Not Teach You. Adler points out (he wrote his book in the 1940s, concerned at how gullible people were to war propaganda) that few professors know how to read a book. Several years later, an Adler collegue published a journal article titled: \\"How to Read an Essay\\"\\"How To Read...\\" gave me confidence to believe what I thought I discovered when I read academic reviews. It seemed that half the reviewers did not bother to read the book they \\"reviewed\\" and others seemed to criticize the book that was not written (Adler warns readers about this). I also found true Adler's advice that many students are turned off forever to writers such as Shakespeare because their teacher did not tell them to not worry about mastering a play or Great Book on first reading. Many students walk away mistakenenly conviced some have what it takes to read great books, others do not. (Today, many higher mathematics teachers convey to students that one either does or does not have what it takes to master mathematics. Like any other subject, the average person can master it. Mathematics is a language, a language smaller & more consistent than English. Genius just learns fast and can go further.) Just read. Do not get side tracked reading annotations, lengthy introductions, expert notes, or looking up words. Just read the story or essay. You will be surprised by what you do understand by the time you finish the work.Adler teaches you that the book that is most worth reading is the book that is over your head. You must understand that a great book must be read at least three times. Just read the story the first time. If you wish, look up words and read commentary and notes the second or third time. Each time you read a Great Book you get more out of it. Annotations, commentaries, teachers rob you of the greatist gift of a great book, self-discovery.Before you decide not to buy \\"How to Read a Book\\" pick up a copy and look it over. All libraries have a copy. It is a classic. If you are interesting in learning, you will want your own copy!"},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"[Helpful? Not? Please vote.] :: Truly, I admire anyone who reads every word of this book (as I did). To say the author is verbose is quite an understatement. A family member of mine met the good Dr. Adler, and was not quite star struck either. I found this out after reading \\"How to Read a Book\\", and was relieved we had reached the same conclusion. MJ Adler wants to make absolutely, positively, incontrovertibly, wholly, unambiguously, categorically *CERTAIN* you know exactly, precisely, ..(blah-blah).. , and clearly what he means. Easily two-thirds of the book is reiteration of an already clearly-made point. This isn't to say that it's a valueless book. Its intellectual treatment of the subject of reading a book is nothing less than complete. It's also quite a bit longer than it need be. I would ideally be allowed to rate it at 4.5 stars. I had to take 1/2 star, rather than give 1/2 for being more than a bit too thorough. It was, in short, a drudgerous read.If I were you, I would definitely grab a used copy of this book, or check it out from the library. I would then employ its wisdom (most of which is in the first third of the book), and make a good outline of the book's major points. This book is a recipe for extracting the marrow from books, considering their finer points, and finally weighing the impact on your life and/or larger issues. If you really like the author's style, read on, and be impressed with how well-read he is. If it's dull to you (as it became for me), rest well knowing that if you have the general ideas from the book in mind, like a recipe for reading, you will still have benefited from it, and almost certainly will have improved your reading in some appreciable way. I detract only for missed opportunities in brevity."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"There's no doubt that effective reading is a skill which has to be developed through deliberate practice, and this book provides mostly good advice which should help develop that skill more quickly (but I don't agree with all of Adler's advice).Adler's advice pertains to aspects such as doing preliminary reconaissance of a book by systematically skimming it, classifying the book by genre, identifying the author's aims, grasping the way the author uses terminology, distilling the central message of the book along with its implications and the structure of its supporting arguments, judging the book fairly, and drawing on multiple books on the same subject in order to reach a synoptic understanding of the subject. The main point is that reading books effectively comes down to reading them actively, motivated by a sincere desire to understand, learn, and grow; without that motivation, the reader is really just going through the motions and perhaps shouldn't even bother trying.Readers who are already skilled will have picked up most or all of the strategies and techniques recommended by Adler on their own, through trial and error. Therefore, the value of the book is that it should expedite the development of this skill for less skilled readers, and it should reinforce (and validate) this skill for those who are already skilled readers.All of this sounds pretty good, so why 3 stars? Because Adler has made the book much too long, with the result that his key points can easily get lost in his endless babbling, not to mention making the book very tedious to read. If Adler had cut out the fat and trimmed the book from 400 pages down to 100 pages, the book probably would have easily deserved 5 stars. It's as though Adler is so impressed with his own erudition that he loves to hear himself talk and can't help showing off. Or perhaps he's so pompous that he feels the need to overexplain things to the reader, as though he's lecturing a child. Whatever the reason, the end result is still that Adler's verbosity obscures his key points and makes the book a chore to read, thus greatly diminishing its value. Readers can partially compensate for this problem by reading the book quickly but, ironically, that option is less feasible for the beginning readers who could have potentially most benefitted from the book.I can recommend the book only with major reservations, and hopefully my review will help you decide whether this book is a good choice for you."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"After I read How to Read a Book, I wanted to re-read every important book I've ever read.

It is a thorough introduction to the world of serious reading, and it is the best one I am aware of.The reading is introduced to the various levels of reading as defined by Adler and van Doren. It is made clear that the higher levels of reading (\\"analytical\\" and \\"syntopical\\") are rarely studied properly by high school or even college students.The steps involved in proper reading are clearly outlined, along with suggestions for avoiding typical errors made by readers. A decent guide to criticism is included. Perhaps the authors under-emphasize the importance of the study of logic to proper critical reading, assuming that the common man will be able to think logically enough to ably criticize the \\"Great Books\\". I recommend a study of logic in conjunction with this book; this should prepare the reader for really acceptable criticism of all sorts of serious books.The book is most readily applicable to works of philosophy; the authors try to use analogy to apply their techniques to the study of imaginitave literature with only moderate success, in my opinion. In fact, the entire book might be more properly offered as a tool for readers of philosophy, leaving the critical reading of literature, history, and science to be dealt with by other authors.Such problems definitely do not detract from the usefulness of the book, and are helpful in many ways.Several appendices are included, including a list of suggested books. The list alone is worth the price of the book; nowhere else have I been able to find as comprehensive source of the very best books written in all fields, through all times in human history.Finally, I partly disagree with the authors regarding Western vs. Eastern book study. They seem to believe that it is enough to study the Western canon for your entire life without having much understanding of the East. They wrote this book, however, before the advent of modern super-communication. Adler's \\"Great Conversation\\" can now begin to take place across all cultures, and for this to happen, a good understanding of the East is essential and very readily available to someone who is willing to devote the required time. This book, however, remains the best guide to the study of the West, and should be read by everyone.

Let me start with what I find valuable before being critical of this book. First, let me say that Adler and Doren give some good advice about how to read in a way that expands your mind. Seeking the propositions and arguments of a work and puzzling over passages you don't understand are good ways to increase your level of reading comphrehension. To me much of what they suggest is just plain common sense but it is good to be reminded of common sense at times. I generally liked their discussion of how to read particular works and their helpful list of classic literature in the appendix at the end of the book.While many of van Doren's and Adler's tips are helpful, I didn't find their suggestions about the various \\"levels of reading\\" to be that helpful. This could just mean that I am too stubborn and impatient but I read for both enjoyment and to better myself. Trying to follow all of the authors rules for reading each time I read something would take too much time and effort. And it would suck the joy out of it. So, I didn't much like the propensity of the authors to create a multitude of rules for reading. Maybe others have followed it and received huge intellectual rewards from it. If they have, more power to them. It's just not for me.Also, this book was more verbose than it needed to be. This does not mean the authors didn't give any good advice, on the whole they did. Rather I think they could have communicated it with less words. I did get the most out of their discussion of analytical reading which is the type of reading I find myself doing much of the time.

In reading only in part, only part of the idea may be caught.The goals of reading: reading for information, reading for understanding. To gain understanding you have to work on the book. Reading for understanding is aided discovery.The authors point how that there are different levels of reading:1) Basic reading (See Spot run)2) Reading with a limit on time, systematic skimming.3) Reading for maximum understanding, or unlimited time4) Reading several books, synoptically, this is the ability to do research from several books.So in reading a book you need to decide what it is you want out of the book.
