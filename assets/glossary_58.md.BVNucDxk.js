It's unimaginable because in 1814 enemies didn't fly overhead, they marched through the streets; and for 26 hours in August, the British enemy marched through Washington, D.C. and set fire to government buildings, including the U.S. Capitol and the White House. Relying on first-hand accounts, historian Jane Hampton Cook weaves together several different narratives to create a vivid, multidimensional account of the burning of Washington, including the escalation that led to it and the immediate aftermath. From James and Dolley Madison to the British admiral who ordered the White House set aflame, historical figures are brought to life through their experience of this unprecedented attack. The Burning of the White House is the story of a city invaded, a presidential family displaced, a nation humbled, and an American spirit that somehow remained unbroken.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OdfnyQEACAAJ&dq=When+They+Burned+the+White+House&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Troubled Tiger: Businessmen, Bureaucrats and Generals in South Korea (East Gate Book)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Ultimate Japanese: Advanced (Living Language Ultimate Courses)","description":"Available October 2003","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YTgCAAAACAAJ&dq=Ultimate+Japanese:+Advanced+(Living+Language+Ultimate+Courses)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Conquering Depression and Anxiety Through Exercise","description":"One out of every two Americans will suffer from some mental problems during their lifetimes, the most typical afflictions being depression and anxiety. How do most of us cope? Usually, we turn to overeating, drinking, and smoking. As a result, two out of every three Americans are overweight or obese, and fifty percent of annual deaths in this country can be defined as optional-the result of diseases that could have been avoided had we lived differently. In short, we treat our unhealthy mental reactions to the American lifestyle with even unhealthier physical habits.Psychologist Keith Johnsgard-an inveterate jogger who is in his 70's!-proposes a better solution in this uplifting book, a concept he dubs the sneaker solution. Why not turn to exercise-one of the healthiest aspects of American lifestyle-as a means of improving not just our physical well-being but our state of mind as well? Though usually associated with losing weight and physical fitness, exercise does in fact offer many mental health benefits. Johnsgard inspires us to put on a pair of sneakers and start moving. He draws from a lifetime of research in sports psychology and scientific studies to make a convincing case that exercise can greatly enhance our mental outlook. Further, the positive mental effects of physical activity can be as effective as psychotherapy or drug treatment, and make you look better, to boot! Exercise not only elevates mood, but improves self-esteem and energy levels and tends to lessen substance abuse and anxiety.Johnsgard-who's served as an expert commentator for the CBS Winter Olympics-also offers keen insights into how to get yourself motivated to do exercise, how to work exercise into your regular routine, and how to best use weight-loss and fat-reducing techniques. He explains in clear language the basics of exercise physiology and its effect on both your mind and your body, ushering in the results of studies that he and others have conducted.If depression and anxiety have overshadowed your life, or you just want to improve your mental outlook while enhancing your physical fitness, this book is a superb motivator to help you help yourself through the healthiest, least expensive, and simplest method available.Keith Johnsgard, Ph.D. (Los Gatos, CA), is emeritus professor of psychology at San Jose State University, the author of the The Exercise Prescription for Depression and Anxiety, a frequent contributor to Runner's World and Running Times, and an expert commentator, who has appeared on the CBS Winter Olympics (1994), Dateline NBC, the Lifetime Channel, the Learning Channel, A & E, and the BBC.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vzZRM_O_A_IC&dq=Conquering+Depression+and+Anxiety+Through+Exercise&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Introduction to TRIZ","description":"This exciting new book presents the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ), a process that will provoke a breakthrough in your thinking patterns and the way you approach problem solving.

Miss Kane's claims seemed highly unlikely, even to Inspector Alan Grant of Scotland Yard, until she described her prison -- the attic room with its cracked window, the kitchen, and the old trunks -- which sounded remarkably like The Franchise.

In other words, the shift in the rights of individuals is best understood as a \\"bottom up,\\" rather than a \\"top down,\\" phenomenon. The Rights Revolution is the first comprehensive and comparative analysis of the growth of civil rights, examining the high courts of the United States, Britain, Canada, and India within their specific constitutional and cultural contexts.

White offers a concise, understandable explanation of what the Trinity is and why it matters. While refuting the distortions of God presented by various cults, Dr. White shows how understanding this teaching leads to renewed worship and a deeper understanding of what it means to be a Christian.

I take on issues near and dear to conservatives. In fact, included in my book is a Topical Table of Contents, which itself will summarize what this book is all about. Just think of each topic being discussed in a conservative context, and you pretty much have the gist of my writings. The topics of this special Table of Contents are: Abortion, American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Anti-Americanism, Assault on Christianity, Clash of Cultures, Culture of Corruption, Culture of Death, Efficiency in Government, Eminent Domain, Great Speeches, Holding Them Accountable, Homosexual Agenda, Honoring America, Illegal Immigration, Iraq War-Criticism, Iraq War-Rationale, the Late, Great Ronald Reagan, Legislating from the Bench, Light-Hearted humor and events, Media Bias, Middle East-War on Terror, 09/11/2001 (the day that changed the world forever), P.E.T.A., Presidential Election, Radical Islam, Social Security and Mexico, State Legislatures, Statesmanship, and United Nations Corruption. There are 125 articles, all filled with Right Opinions, in \\"Unplugged & Unashamed.\\" They are conservative articles, but they do not always tow the party line. For instance, there is one called, \\"Could Abramoff Actually Be Good For American Politics?,\\" in which I call to task Republican fund-raiser Jack Abramoff.

Guidelines are rooted in the theory of retrogenesis in dementia--that those with the condition regress in stages toward infancy--as well as knowledge of associated brain damage. The objective is to meet patients where they are developmentally to best be able to address the tasks of their daily lives, from eating and toileting to preventing falls and wandering. This accessible information gives readers a platform for creating strategies that are respectful, sensitive, and tailored to individual needs, thus avoiding problems that result when care is ineffective or counterproductive. Featured in the coverage: Abilities and disabilities during the different stages of Alzheimer's disease. Strategies for keeping the patient's finances safe. Pain in those with dementia, and why it is frequently ignored. \\"Help! I've lost my mother and can't find her!\\" Sexuality and intimacy in persons with dementia.

The collection of approximately 400 articles, alphabetically arranged and written by some seventy faculty members and alumni in addition to the author, covers all aspects of Princeton life in the past as well as in the present. Of special interest are the biographies of eminent Princetonians, including the University's presidents, well-known trustees, distinguished deans, famous alumni, and some of Princeton's most prominent and popular professors. Other articles in the book embrace a wide range of topics: histories of academic departments, programs, and research units; descriptions of the honor system, the preceptorial method, the four-course plan, and coeducation; a historical survey of the University's acquisition of land and the development of its campus, together with articles on its principal buildings; pieces on student activities; accounts of alumni activities; articles on athletics; portraits of notable personalities; and commentaries on a host of lighter topics such as the cane spree, beer jackets, the Faculty Song, the proctors, and Veterans of Future Wars.

Convicted in a trial by his elders in Britain and hounded by rumors that he settled in Ireland for financial gain, the man who was to become Ireland s patron saint battled against great odds before succeeding as a missionary. Saint Patrick Retold draws on recent research to offer a fresh assessment of Patrick s travails and achievements. This is the first biography in nearly fifty years to explore Patrick s career against the background of historical events, and Roy Flechner leaves no stone unturned as he takes readers on a riveting journey through Romanized Britain and late Iron Age Ireland. Rather than a dismantling of Patrick s reputation, or an argument against his sainthood, Flechner s biography raises crucial questions about self-image and the making of a reputation. From boyhood deeds to the challenges of a missionary enterprise, Saint Patrick Retold steps beyond established narratives to reassess a notable figure s life and legacy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y_j6DwAAQBAJ&dq=Who+Was+Saint+Patrick&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Asterix and the Cauldron","description":"In  Asterix and the Cauldron,  when a local Gaulish chief wants a cauldron full of money kept out of Roman hands, he entrusts Asterix to guard the loot.

Beginning with the 1853 consolidation of a group of fledgling railways that formed a route from Buffalo to Albany, the New York Central grew into a powerhouse transportation company with more than 10,000 route miles. This illustrated history of the railroad that grew to power under the Vanderbilt dynasty covers every aspect of the New York Central through its 1968 merger with longtime rival Pennsylvania Railroad and the eventual merger of Penn Centrals successor, Conrail, into Norfolk Southern and CSX. Along the way, readers are treated to a selection of archival photographs, commissioned route maps, period ads, and timetables detailing all of New York Centrals operations--steam and diesel, freight and passenger--not to mention associated icons like Grand Central Terminal, the legendary Henry Dreyfuss shrouded Hudson steam locomotives, the Water Level Route, and the 20th Century Limited passenger trains. Prolific railway author Brian Solomon sources 150 evocative photographs, promotional materials, and postcards not included in the previous edition to deliver a nostalgic and colorful look at the New York Central.

Terrorism studies is a highly heterogeneous field with a broad range of theories and disciplines, marked by ample debates.

Now fully revised and expanded, this richly illustrated book describes two hundred years of scientific discoveries that inspired French Impressionist painters and Art Nouveau architects, as well as Surrealists in Europe, Latin America, and Japan. Lynn Gamwell describes how the microscope and telescope expanded the artist's vision into realms unseen by the naked eye. In the nineteenth century, a strange and exciting world came into focus, one of microorganisms in a drop of water and spiral nebulas in the night sky. The world is also filled with forces that are truly unobservable, known only indirectly by their effects radio waves, X-rays, and sound-waves. Gamwell shows how artists developed the pivotal style of modernism abstract, non-objective art to symbolize these unseen worlds. Starting in Germany with Romanticism and ending with international contemporary art, she traces the development of the visual arts as an expression of the scientific worldview in which humankind is part of a natural web of dynamic forces without predetermined purpose or meaning. Gamwell reveals how artists give nature meaning by portraying it as mysterious, dangerous, or beautiful. With a foreword by Neil deGrasse Tyson and a wealth of stunning images, this expanded edition of Exploring the Invisible draws on the latest scholarship to provide a global perspective on the scientists and artists who explore life on Earth, human consciousness, and the space-time universe.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KJawDwAAQBAJ&dq=Invisible+Art&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lovers of the African Night","description":"Ata Four, the fourth female descendant of the original Ata and the BaNare's new leader, ventures from the edge of the Kalahari into South Africa looking for the father of her child","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=L05fAAAAMAAJ&dq=Lovers+of+the+African+Night&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Weather Patterns and Phenomena","description":"Provides details on weather theory, including what causes weather and how it works, reading weather conditions, forecasting, weather flying, and applying weather information to flight","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_QVVHAAACAAJ&dq=Weather+Patterns+and+Phenomena&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself SVG in 24 Hours (Sams Teach Yourself...in 24 Hours)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Parrot: An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet","description":"This is our seventh set of Happy, Healthy Pet titles.

At its center is Naty: born in 1925, educated in the United States, a socialite during the Batista era, who after marriage to a prominent doctor and the birth of a daughter became intoxicated with Castro and his revolution (here, published for the first time, are the letters they exchanged while he was in jail). Though her husband and daughter immigrated to the United States after Castro's victory, Naty remained in Cuba to raise her second child, Castro's unacknowledged daughter, only to be ultimately confronted by his dismissive, withering judgment: \\"Naty missed the train.\\" Her two daughters, one of whom settles well into life in America, while the other never recovers from her father's intransigent repudiation of her; her granddaughter, who Naty desperately believes will return to Cuba when--not if--Castro is removed from the island; and her mother, an unregenerate reactionary: these are the lives that complete this extraordinary story. Each of the women is irrevocably marked with a part of the island's terrible and poignant tale, and Wendy Gimbel has created a rich and intense narrative of their lives and times. Havana Dreams leaves us with an indelible impression of familial obligation and illicit love; of the heady but doomed romanticism of revolution; and of the profound consequences of Cuba's contemporary history for the ordinary and most intimate lives of its people.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kqzx3ZDQ8ywC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sincerely, Scott Neumann","description":"Imagine e-mailing a priest asking for spiritual guidance and support because you had killed thousands of bugs on your windshield one muggy summer night.

The sonnets and plays in Loves' Fire are the seeds and fruit of an extraordinary project: seven sonnets by Shakespeare, newly envisioned for the stage, in one-act plays by seven brilliantly gifted contemporary playwrights. Shakespeare's sonnets of romantic and sexual love are timeless, for they are not bound to any particular setting or to either sex. These seven plays, each paired with the sonnet that inspired it, are startling not only in the variety of their mood, content, and setting, but also in their unusual interpretation. For example, Wendy Wasserstein's version of Sonnet 94 is a one-act play set in the Hamptons, where a well-to-do couple is getting ready for a society benefit; Eric Bogosian creates a story of sexual jealousy and obsessiveness from Sonnet 118; and composer William Finn has transformed Sonnet 102 into a song about an artist attempting to paint his lover -- and failing.These seven new works, commissioned and produced by the Acting Company, will be performed in June. Brought together in this slender volume with the sonnets, they form a unique tribute to Shakespeare -- a rich and marvelously entertaining celebration of the modern playwrights' adoration of the Bard.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UYSBQgAACAAJ&dq=Love%27s+Fire:+Seven+New+Plays+Inspired+By+Seven+Shakespearean+Sonnets&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Health and Suffering in America: The Context and Content of Mental Health Care","description":"Service of the Engine is a common local Chichewa-English expression in the Malawian fishing village where the author did her fieldwork.

This study explores the sensitive interface between the use of pharmaceuticals, available through an extensive informal distribution system, and self-treatment of sex-related diseases. The author examines morally sensitive situations in which men and women opt for Ciba, and evaluates its efficacy, or effectiveness. The discussion not only covers physical and metaphorical aspects of efficacy, but also the possible social and moral effects of medication. It offers a fresh and empirically grounded perspective on the links between efficacy, sex-related diseases and moralities.

Most of these pieces--from 24 representative poets and 12 prose writers--are collected and translated into English here for the first time. Reflecting the editor's Pan-Amazonian vision, the book's organizational principle embraces the entire 7 million square kilometers of the Amazon basin as one imaginary space linked by myth, history, geography, and economy--not divided into arbitrary political regions. Most inhabitants live along the banks of the legendary Amazon River or its more than 1,000 tributaries, the widespread water system that unifies the work of these writers. Contributors to this volume also come from Amazonian cities such as Iquitos in Peru and Leticia in Colombia as well as from the Andean cities of Quito and La Paz and the English-speaking country of Guyana. These poems, stories, and passages from novels include traditional themes of the indigenous groups, many dealing with their threatened survival and the relationship of humans to nature. They describe colonial and neocolonial exploitation of the land and its inhabitants, recent urbanization and its effects, and the individual concerns of each author, who frequently assumes the role of spokesperson for social justice. Often, the writing speaks through myths, such as the tale of the boto, the pink river dolphin capable of metamorphosis into human form, or the story of the beautiful woman who gave birth to the Amazon River with her inconsolable and torrential weeping. It includes the Amazonian tradition of haiku verse, which attests to the cultural presence for more than a century of a sizable Japanese colony in the region. Amazonia typically has been regarded as a jungle environment--a source of folk tales and the concern of anthropologists. This pioneering collection illustrates the extraordinary multiculturalism of the region and its evolving contemporary culture. While turning notions of national literatures upside down, the book will contribute to the construction of a new Amazonian identity and will position the region's creative writing firmly inside mainstream Latin American literary history. What's more, it evokes the astonishing and marvelous beauty of one of the world's most important river cultures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kRmaQgAACAAJ&dq=Literary+Amazonia:+Modern+Writing+by+Amazonian+Authors&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Italians","description":"In a book perfect for anyone looking to understand modern Italy and the unique character of Italians, the author explores the history, culture and religion of the Italian people, shedding new light on many aspects of Italian life.

Think of the last time you watched a movie: the chair you sat in, the snacks you ate, the people around you, maybe the beer or joint you consumed to help you unwind--all this stuff shaped your experience of media and its influence on you. The material culture around film and television changes how we make sense of their content, not to mention the very concepts of the mediums. Focusing on material cultures of film and television reception, The Stuff of Spectatorship argues that the things we share space with and consume as we consume television and film influence the meaning we gather from them. This book examines the roles that six different material cultures have played in film and television culture since the 1970s--including video marketing, branded merchandise, drugs and alcohol, and even gun violence--and shows how objects considered peripheral to film and television culture are in fact central to its past and future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CzEaEAAAQBAJ&dq=Cruising+Is+Contagious&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rabbit: An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet","description":"For people who want a furry companion that doens't need twice-daily walks or extensive grooming.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qaUZVI6mUDsC&dq=The+Rabbit:+An+Owner%27s+Guide+to+a+Happy+Healthy+Pet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Butterfield 8","description":"The bestselling novel that became an Oscar-winning film starring Elizabeth Taylor about New York's speakeasy generation A masterpiece of American fiction and a bestseller upon its publication in 1935, BUtterfield 8 lays bare with brash honesty the unspoken and often shocking truths that lurked beneath the surface of a society still reeling from the effects of the Great Depression.

Like all sexual behaviour, SM is more than it seems, encompassing a spectrum of physiological and psychological mechanisms. By its reliance only on observed behaviour, the outsider's view has consistently led to misconceptions and false interpretations of SM behaviour. This book moves beyond the superficial and the misleading, focusing on the actual SM experience by fully integrating the external view of the academic with the internal view of the practitioner.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lbgKAAAACAAJ&dq=Bound+to+be+Free:+The+SM+Experience&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lives of the English Poets A Selection","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VxqGzQEACAAJ&dq=Lives+of+the+English+Poets+A+Selection&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Costume Language: A Dictionary of Dress Terms","description":"Stephanie Davis has combined her painting and art teaching with research into costumes as depicted through the centuries.

The poem is typical of his age, being a free re-handling of the story already told by Apollonius Rhodius, to whom he is superior in arrangement, vividness, and description of character. Valerius's poem shows much imitation of the language and thought of Virgil, and much learning. The chief interest of the epic lies in the relationship between Medea and Jason, especially the growth of Medea's love, where Valerius is at his best. The long series of adventures and various Roman allusions suggest that the poet meant to do honour to Vespasian (to whom the epic is dedicated) with special reference to that emperor's ships in waters around Britain.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=liTWAAAAMAAJ&dq=Valerius+Flaccus+(The+Loeb+classical+library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Giap: Volcano Under Snow","description":"A portrait of Vietnam's most important military leader, General Giap, discusses his military tactics and campaigns, his role in the Vietnam War, and his impact on the pivotal battles of that war, from the 1940s to the fall of Saigon in 1975.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wUqskgEACAAJ&dq=Giap:+Volcano+Under+Snow&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Victorian: Stained Glass for Today","description":"Stained glass patterns for panels done in the victorian style.

The Immortals is set in an infamous neighborhood of Port-au-Prince, on Grand-Rue, where many women, young and old, trade in flesh, sex, and desire. We learn, in glimpses and fragments, about the lives of women who fall in love with the moving images of television, the romance of a novel, and the dreams of escape. This moving novel asks, What becomes of these women, their lives, their stories, their desires, and their whims when a violent earthquake brings the capital city and its brothels to their knees? To preserve the memory of women she lived and worked with, the anonymous narrator makes a deal with her client once she discovers that he is a writer: sex in exchange for recording the stories of the friends who were buried beneath the rubble. She tells the stories of women who were friends, lovers, daughters, and mothers all while their profession sought to hide any trace of intimacy or interiority through pseudonyms and artifice. Ultimately the book reveals how a group of women sought to make a name for themselves in life, demanding that they not be forgotten in death. Winner of France s 2012 Prix Thyde Monnier de la Soci t  des Gens de Lettres, The Immortals is the first work of fiction by the celebrated Haitian writer Makenzy Orcel. Mingling poetry and prose, Orcel centers stories that too often go untold, while reflecting on the power and limits of storytelling in the face of catastrophe. Nathan H.

The book represents the foundation of Nishida's philosophy, which reflects both his deep study of Zen Buddhism and his thorough analysis of Western philosophy. In this important new translation, two scholars -- one Japanes and one American -- have worked together to present a lucid and accurate rendition of this basic work. They have also included an enlightening introduction and ample notes to aid the Western reader. Nishida sets forth the notion of \\"pure experience\\"--The concept that pure, or direct, experience precedes the separation of subject and object and is true reality. He next considers reality, investigating its relation to thinking, volition, and intuition. The Good, which Nishida considered to be the realization of our internal demands or ideals, is analyzed in the light of the nature of reality and pure experience. In conclusion, Nishida suggests a theory of God as the unifier of the universe and the universe as an expression of God. Throughout he touches upon the work of Western philosophers such as Kant, Hegel, Fichte, William James, and John Dewey in order to explicate his ideas\\"-- Front flap.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mCv2vRfczwkC&dq=An+Inquiry+into+the+Good&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ARCHAEOLOGY AND THE BOOK OF MORMON VOLUME I","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7M44AAAAIAAJ&dq=ARCHAEOLOGY+AND+THE+BOOK+OF+MORMON+VOLUME+I&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dream Chasers","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Daydreams and Nightmares: The Fantastic Visions of WInsor McCay, 1898-1934","description":"Daydreams & Nightmares collects the rarest work from Little Nemo In Slumberland creator Winsor McCay's historic career.

By using this system energy consumption is also reduced because nowadays the manually operated street lights are not switched off even the sunlight comes and also switched on earlier before sunset.

It is widely regarded as a classic text in the field. Drawing on the biblical figure of Hagar mother of Ishmael, cast into the desert by Abraham and Sarah, but protected by God Williams finds a proptype for the struggle of African-American women. African slave, homeless exile, surrogate mother, Hagar's story provides an image of survival and defiance appropriate to black women today. Exploring the themes implicit in Hagar's story poverty and slavery, ethnicity and sexual exploitation, exile and encounter with God Williams traces parallels in the history of African-American women from slavery to the present day. A new womanist theology emerges from this shared experience, from the interplay of oppressions on account of race, sex and class. Sisters in the Wilderness offers a telling critique of theologies that promote \\"liberation\\" but ignore women of color.

By allowing women to control their fertility, the birth control pill has revolutionized women's lives. Women are going to college, graduating, and entering the workforce in greater numbers than ever before, and there's good reason to believe that the birth control pill has a lot to do with this. But there's a lot more to the pill than meets the eye. Although women go on the pill for a small handful of targeted effects (pregnancy prevention and clearer skin, yay!), sex hormones can't work that way. Sex hormones impact the activities of billions of cells in the body at once, many of which are in the brain. There, they play a role in influencing attraction, sexual motivation, stress, hunger, eating patterns, emotion regulation, friendships, aggression, mood, learning, and more. This means that being on the birth control pill makes women a different version of themselves than when they are off of it. And this is a big deal. For instance, women on the pill have a dampened cortisol spike in response to stress. While this might sound great (no stress!), it can have negative implications for learning, memory, and mood. Additionally, because the pill influences who women are attracted to, being on the pill may inadvertently influence who women choose as partners, which can have important implications for their relationships once they go off it. Sometimes these changes are for the better . . . but other times, they're for the worse. By changing what women's brains do, the pill also has the ability to have cascading effects on everything and everyone that a woman encounters. This means that the reach of the pill extends far beyond women's own bodies, having a major impact on society and the world. This paradigm-shattering book provides an even-handed, science-based understanding of who women are, both on and off the pill. It will change the way that women think about their hormones and how they view themselves. It also serves as a rallying cry for women to demand more information from science about how their bodies and brains work and to advocate for better research. This book will help women make more informed decisions about their health, whether they're on the pill or off of it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7BmtDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Psychology+of+Birth+Planning&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Myself and Marco Polo (Picador Books)","description":"This text has two main objectives: to explore how travel narrative works as a form of cross-cultural representation and to propose a critical method for its study; and to set out the ethical imperatives of travel as a mode of encounter with difference that leads to the performative enactment of becoming other.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OkW8AAAAIAAJ&dq=Myself+and+Marco+Polo+(Picador+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spirit of America;: Winning the world's land speed record","description":"Presents a collection of bibliographic essays that describe the history, culture, and impact of the automobile and automobile industry in the United States.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oRwMv8iNP-MC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A little maid of Massachusetts Colony","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"In Peace Let Us Pray to the Lord","description":"For many, the modern Pentecostal Movement can be a perplexing and mystifying world.

It happened just outside of Jasper, a sleepy East Texas logging town that, within twenty-four hours of the discovery of the murder, would be inextricably linked in the nation s imagination to an exceptionally brutal, modern-day lynching. In this superbly written examination of the murder and its aftermath, award-winning journalist Joyce King brings us on a journey that begins at the crime scene and extends into the minds of the young men who so casually ended a man s life. She takes us inside the prison in which two of them met for the first time, and she shows how it played a major role in shaping their attitudes racial and otherwise. The result is a deeply engrossing psychological portrait of the accused and a powerful indictment of the American prison system s ability to reform criminals. Finally, King writes with candor and clarity about how the events of that fateful night have affected her as a black woman, a native Texan, and a journalist given the agonizing assignment of covering the trials of all three defendants. More than a spectacular true-crime debut, Hate Crime is a breathtaking work of reportage and a searing look at how the question of race continues to shape life in America.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5dAcejIl6oMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essence Brings You Great Cooking","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The life of Buddha as legend and history","description":"Authoriative account of the life of Buddha utilizing information never presented in a western form.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5N8nUQK5i84C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"St. Therese, The Little Flower: The Making of a Saint","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Third reality: Crafting a 21st century Latino agenda","description":"Although Ernesto Nieto founded the National Hispanic Institute (NHI) in 1979, its story begins during the first part of the twentieth century through the lives of his grandmother and his parents.

Nonlocal field theory extends classical field theory by describing the responses of points within the medium by functionals rather than functions (the \\"constitutive relations\\" of classical field theory). Such considerations are already well known in solid-state physics, where the nonlocal interactions between the atoms are prevalent in determining the properties of the material. The tools developed for crystalline materials, however, do not lend themselves to analyzing amorphous materials, or materials in which imperfections are a major part of the structure. Nonlocal continuum theories, by contrast, can describe these materials faithfully at scales down to the lattice parameter. This book presents a unified approach to field theories for elastic solids, viscous fluids, and heat-conducting electromagnetic solids and fluids that include nonlocal effects in both space and time (memory effects). The solutions to the field equations agree remarkably well with atomic theories and experimental observations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RbwPEe88CNIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Egg-Drop Blues","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Aviators","description":"Interweaving their high-flying, heart-stopping adventures during wartime and beyond, the author of Forrest Gump tells the epic stories of three remarkable aviators - Charles Lingbergh, Eddie Rickenbacker and Jimmy Doolittle - who defined aviation during the great age of flight.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YAfaCwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Aviators&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The history of Henry Esmond, esq (Universal library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5B1ktQEACAAJ&dq=The+history+of+Henry+Esmond,+esq+(Universal+library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cellular Automata: Theory and Experiment","description":"The thirty four contributions in this book cover many aspects of contemporary studies on cellular automata and include reviews, research reports, and guides to recent literature and available software. Cellular automata, dynamic systems in which space and time are discrete, are yielding interesting applications in both the physical and natural sciences. The thirty four contributions in this book cover many aspects of contemporary studies on cellular automata and include reviews, research reports, and guides to recent literature and available software. Chapters cover mathematical analysis, the structure of the space of cellular automata, learning rules with specified properties: cellular automata in biology, physics, chemistry, and computation theory; and generalizations of cellular automata in neural nets, Boolean nets, and coupled map lattices.Current work on cellular automata may be viewed as revolving around two central and closely related problems: the forward problem and the inverse problem. The forward problem concerns the description of properties of given cellular automata. Properties considered include reversibility, invariants, criticality, fractal dimension, and computational power. The role of cellular automata in computation theory is seen as a particularly exciting venue for exploring parallel computers as theoretical and practical tools in mathematical physics. The inverse problem, an area of study gaining prominence particularly in the natural sciences, involves designing rules that possess specified properties or perform specified task. A long-term goal is to develop a set of techniques that can find a rule or set of rules that can reproduce quantitative observations of a physical system. Studies of the inverse problem take up the organization and structure of the set of automata, in particular the parameterization of the space of cellular automata. Optimization and learning techniques, like the genetic algorithm and adaptive stochastic cellular automata are applied to find cellular automaton rules that model such physical phenomena as crystal growth or perform such adaptive-learning tasks as balancing an inverted pole.Howard Gutowitz is Collaborateur in the Service de Physique du Solide et R sonance Magnetique, Commissariat a I'Energie Atomique, Saclay, France.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6o6zx5MRRcQC&dq=Cellular+Automata:+Theory+and+Experiment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Soul Rider I: Spirits of Flux and Anchor (Dutch Edition)","description":"A sweeping story of survival during World War II Amsterdam, May 1943. As the tulips bloom and the Nazis tighten their grip across the city, the last signs of Dutch resistance are being swept away. Marijke de Graaf and her husband are arrested and deported to different concentration camps in Germany. Marijke is given a terrible choice: to suffer a slow death in the labor camp or for a chance at survival to join the camp brothel. On the other side of the barbed wire, SS officer Karl M?ller arrives at the camp hoping to live up to his father s expectations of wartime glory. When he encounters the newly arrived Marijke, this meeting changes their lives forever. Woven into the narrative across space and time is Luciano Wagner s ordeal in 1977 Buenos Aires, during the heat of the Argentine Dirty War. In his struggle to endure military captivity, he searches for ways to resist from a prison cell he may never leave. From the Netherlands to Germany to Argentina, The Dutch Wife braids together the stories of three individuals who share a dark secret and are entangled in two of the most oppressive reigns of terror in modern history. This is a novel about the blurred lines between love and lust, abuse and resistance, and right and wrong, as well as the capacity for ordinary people to persevere and do the unthinkable in extraordinary circumstances.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kvw_DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Udaya Journal of Khmer Studies: Issue No. 2","description":"This second issue of Udaya brings together a wide variety of current research in and around Cambodia.

In this lively narrative, Zeiler explores the ways in which the Spalding World Baseball Tour drew on elements of cultural diplomacy to inject American values and power into the international arena. Through his chronicle of baseball history, games, and experiences, Zeiler explores expressions of imperial dreams through globalization's instruments of free enterprise, webs of modern communication and transport, cultural ordering of races and societies, and a strident nationalism that galvanized notions of American uniqueness. Spalding linked baseball to a U.S. presence overseas, viewing the world as a market ripe for the infusion of American ideas, products and energy.

The axe was replaced as a key symbol, first by the dagger and finally by the sword. The houses of the living came to supplant the tombs of the dead as the most permanent features in the landscape.

But inside the pale, what troubles Brother Cadfael is a proud, secretive nineteen-year-old novice. Brother Cadfael has never seen two men more estranged than the Lord of Aspley and Meriet, the son he coldly delivers to the abbey to begin a religious vocation. Meriet, meek by day, is so racked by dreams at night that his howls earn him the nickname  the Devil s Novice.

With them came their precious jewels: diamonds, rubies, emeralds, pearls... But then the Fair People vanished, taking with them their twelve fabulous treasures. And they remained hidden until now... Across North America, these twelve treasures, over ten-thousand dollars in precious jewels in 1982 dollars, are buried. The key to finding each can be found within the twelve full-color paintings and verses of THE SECRET. Are you smart enough? THE SECRET: A TREASURE HUNT was published in 1982. The year before publication, the author and publisher Byron Preiss had traveled to 12 locations in the continental U.S. (and possibly Canada) to secretly bury a dozen ceramic casques. Each casque contained a small key that could be redeemed for one of 12 jewels Preiss kept in a safe deposit box in New York. The key to finding the casques was to match one of 12 paintings to one of 12 poetic verses, solve the resulting riddle, and start digging. Since 1982, only two of the 12 casques have been recovered. The first was located in Grant Park, Chicago, in 1984 by a group of students. The second was unearthed in 2004 in Cleveland by two members of the Quest4Treasure forum.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t9OCDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Voice Treatment for Children & Adolescents","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0rtsAAAAMAAJ&dq=Voice+Treatment+for+Children&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Outlaw Kingdom","description":"Outlaw Kingdom Matt Braun In 1889, Bill Tilghman joined the historic land rush that transformed a raw frontier into Oklahoma Territory.

Toughness is defined by four interdependent elements: Character-who are you and are you secure in your identity? Capability-what are you able to do? Capacity-what are you able to withstand? And Commitment-what are you willing to do? Being truly tough is a genuine command over ourselves and an ever-increasing mastery of the mental, emotional and physical elements that define us and determine the course of our lives. It gives us the fortitude, mindset and tools to not simply survive adversity, but to thrive through it and in its wake. It gives us a broad and always expanding array of capabilities that create self-reliance and confidence, give us access to new opportunities and experiences, and allows us to contribute more than we consume. It ensures we understand who we truly are, and that we ultimately determine that identity and reinforce it daily with our choices and habits. And true toughness allows us to remain committed to our chosen path to achieve what we intend no matter what it is or how difficult the process. This is not a chest-pounding call for \\"manly\\" activity, emotional sterility, and self-flagellation, but a guide to discover and develop our ultimate capacity to withstand adversity, to collect and build the mental and physical tools to accomplish the challenging and incredible, to find security in our identities and the confidence and resilience it engenders, and to become an active and positive contributor to the world at large. Tough is an inspiring look deep into what makes us tough and why it matters, and a clear roadmap replete with the necessary tools for becoming truly tough.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4B4czgEACAAJ&dq=Becoming+Tough&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Trojan Hearse","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Christian suffering","description":"This comprehensive introduction helps students, pastors, and mission committees understand contemporary Christian mission historically, biblically, and theologically. Scott Sunquist, a respected scholar and teacher of world Christianity, recovers missiological thinking from the early church for the twenty-first century. He traces the mission of the church throughout history in order to address the global church and offers a constructive theology and practice for missionary work today. Sunquist views spirituality as the foundation for all mission involvement, for mission practice springs from spiritual formation. He highlights the Holy Spirit in the work of mission and emphasizes its trinitarian nature. Sunquist explores mission from a primarily theological--rather than sociological--perspective, showing that the whole of Christian theology depends on and feeds into mission. Throughout the book, he presents Christian mission as our participation in the suffering and glory of Jesus Christ for the redemption of the nations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TeyZAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A History of Old English Literature (Blackwell History of Literature)","description":"This timely introduction to Old English literature focuses on the production and reception of Old English texts, and on their relation to Anglo-Saxon history and culture.

I ve suffered for my art, now it s your turn.  So begins the story of Ted Wallace, unaffectionately known as the Hippopotamus. Failed poet, failed theater critic, failed father and husband, Ted is a shameless womanizer, drinks too much, and is at odds in his cranky but maddeningly logical way with most of modern life. Fired from his job at the newspaper, Ted seeks a few months  repose and free liquor at Swafford Hall, the country mansion of his old friend Michael Logan. This world of boozy dinners, hunting parties, and furtive liaisons has recently been turned on its head by miracles, healings, and phenomena beyond Ted s comprehension. As the mysteries deepen, The Hippopotamus builds into a rollicking sendup of the classic British mystery that is  tremendously funny  (Christopher Buckley) and a  near-perfect book  (Entertainment Weekly). The basis for the recent movie starring Roger Allam, Matthew Modine, and Fiona Shaw,  The Hippopotamus is animated by an antic sense of comedy and features a willfully feckless hero . . . Described in uproarious terms that suggest Wodehouse crossed with Waugh, Swafford emerges as a parody of every upper-class country house ever depicted in an English novel  (The New York Times).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UZNiDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spanish II, 3rd Ed.

You track your progress by ascending from one color to the next.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bFoaBAAAQBAJ&dq=Wink+and+Grow+Rich+(Wealth+Dynamics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Please, Somebody Love Me!: Surviving Abuse and Becoming Whole","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Tabernacle: Its Structure and Utensils","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U-KzPAAACAAJ&dq=The+Tabernacle:+Its+Structure+and+Utensils&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Chicago Bears: An Illustrated History","description":"The ultimate history of the legendary Chicago Bears, from Halas to Hester, with hundreds of photos, stats, and player profiles.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3BRE-VcghQgC&dq=The+Chicago+Bears:+An+Illustrated+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kyoto Map 1:11000 ITM -2002 (Travel Reference Map)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Miss Seton's Sonata (Zebra Regency Romance)","description":"Talented musician Miss Teresa Seton finds herself in a compromising situation that leads to a marriage of convenience with the Marquis of Merrick, a man haunted by his past who vows never to love again, but Teresa, harnessing the power of music, is determined to change his mind.

He can identify every car in town from the sound of its engine, but his world is changing faster then he can fathom. His wife has become an artist, selling sea-glass sculptures to tourists. His daughter is bound for college, while his son has turned angry and lawless. Lucky's own heart is failing him, too. An operation has kept it ticking, but he can't run the boat alone any more. As the spring lobster season opens, the only deckhand Lucky can find to help load his traps is Ronette, the not-quite-divorced wife of the local lobster wholesaler. When the two make it out to the fishing grounds, someone else's buoys are bobbing in his ancestral waters. Before he knows it, Lucky is in a lobster war and has abandoned all the rules: family, health, finance, even the rules of the sea that have guided him throughout his life. As waves of trouble turn into a flood tide, Lucky's pride propels him into an epic confrontation with his enemies and a rogue whale -- a battle his unreliable heart may not survive. The Wooden Nickel is a classic story of a man raging against a changing world, full of pathos and comedy.

In the first story, an elderly couple is told that delivery of their Thanksgiving dinner has been canceled due to an impending blizzard. Unwilling to have guests but nothing to serve them, they make a run to the grocery, hoping to get there and back before the snow, but crash their car into the last of their neighbors. In  The Receiving Line,  a male prostitute tricks a closeted suburban schoolteacher only to learn that the trick is on him. In  The Woman On The Road,  a twelve-year-old girl negotiates the competing demands of her faith and her family as she is bat mitzvahed in the feminist ferment of the 1980s. The lessons she learns are the lessons learned by a ten-year-old boy in  Fergus B. Fergus,  after which, in  Summer Friend,  two women and one man renegotiate their sixty-year intimacy when sadly, but inevitably, one of them gets ill.  The Home Of The Holy Assumption  offers a benediction. A quadriplegic goes missing at a nursing home. Was she assumed? In the process of finding out, all are reminded that caring for others, however imperfectly even laughably is the only shot at assumption we have. In upstate New York, a November storm is one that comes early in the season. If it catches people off-guard, it can change them in the ways Oldshue s characters are changed by different but equally surprising storms.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eDvTDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Introduction to the History of Psychology","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Dirty Work/1451434","description":"This book analyses how socially responsible investments as well as the rising importance of Islamic finance are linked to the shift towards renewable energy.

Her crew were lazily enjoying this respite from the arduous labor of rowing up stream. Three miles below them lay the Marjorie W. herself, quite ready to sail so soon as they should have clambered aboard and swung the long boat to its davits. Presently the attention of every man was drawn from his dreaming or his gossiping to the northern bank of the river. There, screaming at them in a cracked falsetto and with skinny arms outstretched, stood a strange apparition of a man. \\"Wot the 'ell?\\" ejaculated one of the crew. \\"A white man!\\" muttered the mate, and then: \\"Man the oars, boys, and we'll just pull over an' see what he wants.\\" When they came close to the shore they saw an emaciated creature with scant white locks tangled and matted. The thin, bent body was naked but for a loin cloth. Tears were rolling down the sunken pock-marked cheeks. The man jabbered at them in a strange tongue. \\"Rooshun,\\" hazarded the mate. \\"Savvy English?\\" he called to the man. He did, and in that tongue, brokenly and haltingly, as though it had been many years since he had used it, he begged them to take him with them away from this awful country. Once on board the Marjorie W. the stranger told his rescuers a pitiful tale of privation, hardships, and torture, extending over a period of ten years. How he happened to have come to Africa he did not tell them, leaving them to assume he had forgotten the incidents of his life prior to the frightful ordeals that had wrecked him mentally and physically. He did not even tell them his true name, and so they knew him only as Michael Sabrov, nor was there any resemblance between this sorry wreck and the virile, though unprincipled, Alexis Paulvitch of old...","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EozCCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hypnosis Fact and Fiction","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l-YlAQAAMAAJ&dq=Hypnosis+Fact+and+Fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Southern Collection Then and Now","description":"A complete collection of menu ideas, wine suggestions and recipes for the gourment and novice cook alike.

Arnall assumed the governorship of Georgia in 1943, becoming the youngest person in the United States ever elected to that position. In his single term (1943-1947) he initiated a series of remarkable reforms that elevated Georgia above its Tobacco Road image and stood it alongside North Carolina, then the South's most progressive state. Unlike most of his colleagues, Arnall refused to \\"play it safe\\" in the state's political arena. Though still a segregationist and a traditionalist in many ways, Arnall had no patience for provincialism and cared deeply about Georgia and how it was viewed by the rest of the nation. Boldly confronting the demagoguery of his predecessor Eugene Talmadge, Arnall, who called himself \\"a democrat with a small 'd',\\" united the state's liberal and conservative factions to deliver the promise of the New South to all of Georgia's citizens: biracial voting, government reform, economic development, and an improved standard of living. So sweeping and farsighted were Arnall's accomplishments that, to a great extent, the structure of Georgia's present-day government evolved under his guidance and has changed little since. In 1985, a Georgia Association of Historians survey ranked Arnall's leadership, responsiveness to issues, and national reputation the highest among governors who served from 1943-1983. Successful as it was, his career, begun a decade earlier in the state house of representatives, was cut short. Many Georgians felt that Arnall was too liberal and, worse, that he had catered to the national media, enhancing his own image by discussing the state's problems with outsiders. By Arnall's own estimation, his political career ended when he decided to abide by a 1945 federal court decision that invalidated Georgia's white-voters-only primary elections. Arnall left politics in 1947, returning briefly in 1966 for a spirited, but unsuccessful, primary bid for governor. Written with Ellis Arnall's full cooperation and filled with fascinating details of the final days of Old South politics, this book recounts the political career of one of the region's most accomplished and energetic leaders. The Politics of Change in Georgia is based on the former governor's speeches and public writings, critical and supportive newspapers accounts, and interviews both with Arnall and with other prominent Georgians such as Herman E. Talmadge, S. Ernest Vandiver, Jr., Lester G. Maddox, Carl E. Sanders, Jr., James H. Gray, Sr., Howard H. Callaway, and Ivan Allen, Jr.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4lnsxHhybo8C&dq=The+Politics+of+Change+in+Georgia:+A+Political+Biography+of+Ellis+Arnall&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"WebDAV: Next-Generation Collaborative Web Authoring: Next-Generation Collaborative Web Authoring","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Barlowe's Inferno","description":"Through 40 chilling and beautiful color paintings, bestselling science fiction and fantasy artist Wayne Barlowe details an amazing visual journey into the strange, frightening, and bizarre world of hell.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vchBAAAACAAJ&dq=Barlowe%27s+Inferno&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Last Call: 10 Commonsense Solutions to America's Biggest Problems","description":"Professional career guide from the Vault Career Library featuring strategies for networking for career purposes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n3k7D5ChB8YC&dq=Last+Call:+10+Commonsense+Solutions+to+America%27s+Biggest+Problems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cream of Wheat Advertising Art","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Eight Who Made a Difference: Pioneer Women in the Arts (Avisson Young Adult Series)","description":"Profiles eight notable women in the arts, including sculptor Louise Nevelson, photojournalist Margaret Bourke-White, and painter Mary Cassatt.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=e0pTswEACAAJ&dq=Eight+Who+Made+a+Difference:+Pioneer+Women+in+the+Arts+(Avisson+Young+Adult+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Origins of the Modern Japanese State: Selected Writings of E.

In addition, policymakers want assurance that education dollars are being raised and used in the most efficient and effective possible ways.

The shift from \\"equity\\" to \\"adequacy\\" as a new standard for determining fairness in education spending. The debate and the evidence over the productivity of American schools.

'Managing Operational Risk in Financial Markets' outlines the major issues for risk management and focuses on operational risk as a key activity in managing risk on an enterprise-wide basis. While risk management had always been an integral part of financial activity, the 1990s has seen the requirement for risk management establish itself as a key function within banks and other financial institutions. With greater emphasis on ensuring that money is not lost through adverse market conditions, counterparty failure or inappropriate controls, systems or people, risk management has become a discipline in its own right. Managing risk is now THE paramount topic within the financial sector. Recurring major losses through the 1990s has shocked financial institutions into placing much greater emphasis on risk management and controls. The collapse of Barings and losses made by Metallgescellschaft, Orange County, Diawa and Sumitomo as a result of a lack of procedures, systems or managerial control has demonstrated to organisations the need to broaden the scope of their risk management activity from merely looking at market and credit risk. This has brought into focus the need for managing operational risk. Operational risk can only be managed on an enterprise wide basis as it includes the entire process of policies, culture, procedures, expertise and systems that an institution needs in order to manage all the risks resulting from its financial transactions. In fact, in order to effectively manage market and credit risks it is necessary to have the relevant skills and expertise in the staff, technical and organisational infrastructure, as well as monitoring and control systems. As all of these are components of operational risk, it then becomes apparent that an integrated risk management approach needs to focus on operational risk. Provides a comprehensive framework for the management of operational risk Defines the spectrum of risks faced by organisations and how they can effectively manage these Develops an enterprise-wide risk information system and defines the major challenges that need to be addressed in developing such a system","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8K980GNs6k0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fighting Forces: An Illustrated Anatomy of the World's Great Armies","description":"Eighth Army, Britain's most famous field army of the twentieth century, landed in Italy in September 1943 and fought continously until the defeat of the Germans in early-May 1945. This book studies the experience of Eighth Army in the Italian campaign, examining how a force accustomed to the open spaces of North Africa adjusted to the difficult terrain of Italy where fighting became much more a matter for the infantry than for the armour. It also compares the qualities of the commanders of Eighth Army in Italy: Montgomery; Leese and, finally, McCreery. The book uses official records at various levels, personal accounts - some never before published - and published material to present a picture of an army that, although defined as British, was one of the war's most cosmopolitan formations. Its soldiers came from the UK, Canada, India, Ireland, Nepal, New Zealand, Poland and South Africa as well as from Palestine - the Jewish Brigade - and from Italy itself.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xBjHDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Immortal Part","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LzZLAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Collected Poems,: 1953-1993","description":" The idea of verse, of poetry, has always, during forty years spent working primarily in prose, stood at my elbow, as a standing invitation to the highest kind of verbal exercise the most satisfying, the most archaic, the most elusive of critical control. In hotel rooms and airplanes, on beaches and Sundays, at junctures of personal happiness or its opposite, poetry has comforted me with its hope of permanence, its packaging of flux.  Thus John Updike writes in introducing his Collected Poems. The earliest poems here date from 1953, when Updike was twenty-one, and the last were written after he turned sixty. Almost all of those published in his five previous collections are included, with some revisions. Arranged in chronological order, the poems constitute, as he says,  the thread backside of my life s fading tapestry.  An ample set of notes at the back of the book discusses some of the hidden threads, and expatiates upon a number of fine points. Nature tenderly intricate, ruthlessly impervious is a constant and ambiguous presence in these poems, along with the social observation one would expect in a novelist. No occasion is too modest or too daily to excite metaphysical wonder, or to provoke a lyrical ingenuity of language. Yet even the wittiest of the poems are rooted to the ground of experience and fact.  Seven Odes to Seven Natural Processes  attempt to explicate the physical world with a directness seldom attempted in poetry. Several longer poems  Leaving Church Early,   Midpoint  use autobiography to proclaim the basic strangeness of existence.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eP0VMSOXLf8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Last of the Aerial Gunfighters","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NLkFAAAACAAJ&dq=Last+of+the+Aerial+Gunfighters&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Schizophrenia, Adolescent Behavior, Juvenile Delinquency and Violence : Is There a Correlation?","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=T9v6PQAACAAJ&dq=Schizophrenia,+Adolescent+Behavior,+Juvenile+Delinquency+and+Violence+:+Is+There+a+Correlation%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Management of Heterogeneous & Autonomous Database Systems (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Swim to the Top: Arthur Lydiard Takes to the Water","description":"New Zealand swimming coach David Wright sought the help of running guru Arthur Lydiard to gain better results.

For nearly a decade, Wright and Lydiard, collaborating every week, experimented with the conversion of long-distance aerobic endurance training, hill running, bounding and springing, steps running and sprint sharpening from the varied terrains that a runner encounters to the confines of a swimming pool's still, flat water.

Making sense is the activity of fitting something puzzling into a coherent pattern of mental representations that include concepts, beliefs, goals, and actions. Paul Thagard proposes a general theory of coherence as the satisfaction of multiple interacting constraints, and discusses the theory's numerous psychological and philosophical applications. Much of human cognition can be understood in terms of coherence as constraint satisfaction, and many of the central problems of philosophy can be given coherence-based solutions. Thagard shows how coherence can help to unify psychology and philosophy, particularly when addressing questions of epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, politics, and aesthetics. He also shows how coherence can integrate cognition and emotion.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Px0vctI8eGQC&dq=Coherence+in+Thought+and+Action+(Life+and+Mind:+Philosophical+Issues+in+Biology+and+Psychology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Politicos","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7kcZAAAAIAAJ&dq=The+Politicos&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"As Long as I Live","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=59RgMwEACAAJ&dq=As+Long+as+I+Live&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Drinking, Smoking, and Screwing: Great Writers on Good Times","description":"Gathers selections from fiction by Charles Bukowski, J.P.

A few decades later, as the auto industry boomed in Detroit, white-collar workers sought places to raise their families outside of the city, and neighborhoods in Livonia went up seemingly overnight. The result was the creation of a quintessential American suburban city, one in which urban and rural lifestyles converged and formed a new kind of community. This book celebrates Livonia's development from the 19th to the 21st century, as it evolved from wilderness into a city that is routinely rated as one of the best places to raise a family in the United States.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mxJBJYzdBHAC&dq=Novi+(Images+of+America:+Michigan)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Skillful Rowing","description":"A comprehensive look at rowing training and tecnique.

In Growth and Convergence in Metropolitan America, Pack identifies growth trends that have contributed to the convergence of welfare among regions. Pack analyzes demographic, social, and economic data from 277 metropolitan areas in the northeastern, midwestern, southern, and western United States between 1960 and 1990. Her analysis reveals a strong connection between regional growth and improved socioeconomic vitality. She finds little connection between population growth the focus of many previous studies and well-being, but a strong connection between per capita income growth and well-being. Moreover, there has been a major change in the factors associated with economic growth between the 1970s and 1980s. In the latter decade, the importance of an educated labor force and major universities have assumed major importance. This appears likely to have continued to be true in the 1990s. While current urban policy has focused on intra-metropolitan cooperation as the key to improving conditions in declining or slow-growing urban areas, Pack's analysis emphasizes the major differences among the larger regions of the country both their cities and suburbs. From this perspective, national policies, both macro-economic policy and the progressive income tax, appear to be the most effective influences promoting regional convergence and improving the socio-economic well-being of both city and suburban residents.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=X6mUHP7nOvwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Baby Days: A Baby Record Book","description":"Filled with gorgeous original illustrations by E.H.Shepard and charming snippets of wisdom from everyone's favourite bear - the wonderful Winnie-the-Pooh.

Jeffrey Meyers begins laying out a case for a covenant renewal service by means of Old Testament sacrificial liturgics, biblical typology, and covenant theology. He then guides us through the stages of a covenant renewal liturgy, explaining from Scripture the meanings of each step of the service. The final section addresses miscellaneous issues in worship, such as the use of creeds, the \\"regulative principle,\\" and ministerial clothing. Jeffrey Meyers provides not only a compelling biblical, theological, and historical case for covenant renewal worship, but also shows that it is beautiful, profound, edifying, and liberating.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6CSuYz4zj8wC&dq=The+Lord%27s+Service:+The+Grace+of+Covenant+Renewal+Worship&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Libyan sands: Travel in a dead world (Black jacket books)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=E-e8zQEACAAJ&dq=Libyan+sands:+Travel+in+a+dead+world+(Black+jacket+books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Charlie's Touchdown","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=d5uWAQAACAAJ&dq=Charlie%27s+Touchdown&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Tennis Handbook For Parents: Starting Your Kids in Tennis and Helping Them Stick With It","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"If You Lived in the Alaska Territory","description":"A writer for the local newspaper for tiny Haines, Alaska, provides a series of colorful portraits of the inhabitants, festivals, and activities of this close-knit but remote village, offering reflections on the life and death of local eccentric Speedy Joe who never took off his hat, the Chilkat Bald Eagle Festival, and neighbors, both human and animal.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tE9KNYw_QhAC&dq=If+You+Lived+in+the+Alaska+Territory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Of Two Minds: Hypertext Pedagogy and Poetics (Studies in Literature and Science)","description":"In Of Two Minds, noted hypertext novelist and writing teacher Michael Joyce explores the new technologies, mediums, and modalities for teaching and writing, ranging from interactive multimedia to virtual reality. As author of Afternoon: A Story, which the New York Times Book Review termed \\"the most widely read, quoted, and critiqued of all hypertext narratives,\\" and co-developer of Storyspace, an innovative hypertext software acclaimed for offering new kinds of artistic expression, he is uniquely well qualified to explore this stimulating topic. The essays comprise what Joyce calls \\"theoretical narratives,\\" woven from e-mail messages, hypertext \\"nodes,\\" and other kinds of electronic text that move nomadically from one occasion or perspective to another, between the poles of art and instruction , teaching and writing. The nomadic movement of ideas is made effortless by the electronic medium, which makes it easy to cross borders (or erase them) with the swipe of a mouse, and which therefore challenges our notions of intellectual and artistic borders. Joyce makes it clear that we are not just the natural heirs but, through our visions, the architects of new technologies that promise to enact our visions as much as change them. The collection summons writing from artists, poets, teachers, scientists, and feminist thinkers, and in so doing builds on notions of human possibility as a basis for the broadest kind of conversation in what Joyce deems our increasingly multiple, polymorphous, and polylogous culture. \\"Weaving between theoretical speculations, reports of actual classroom usage, polemical addresses, and a rich web of allusions, Of Two Minds strongly makes the case that hypertext creates a topography of textuality that requires new mod es of thinking about texts.\\" --N. Katherine Hayles, University of California, Los Angeles A volume in our Studies in Literature and Science series.

Founded on rock music, celebrity, boom-time economics, and fleeting political optimism, this was \\"Cool Britannia.\\" Records sold in the millions, a new celebrity elite emerged, and Tony Blair's Labour Party found itself returned to government. Drawing on interviews from all the major bands including Oasis, Blur, Elastica, and Suede, and from music journalists, record executives, and those close to government, Britpop! charts the rise and fall of the Britpop moment. In this wonderfully engaging, page-turning narrative, John Harris, currently the hottest young music journalist in the UK, argues that the high point of British music's cultural impact also signaled its effective demise. After all, if rock stars were now friends of government, how could they continue to matter?\\"Cool Britannia was an empty promise that was bound to end in tears. John Harris captures the moment when New Labour, desperately wanting to seem hip, invited Britpop into Downing Street.

Along with a clear understanding of where American poetry stands and how it got there, After the Death of Poetry offers a compelling set of prescriptions for its future, prescriptions that might enable the art to regain its lost stature in our intellectual life. In exemplary case studies, Shetley identifies the very different ways in which three postwar poets Elizabeth Bishop, James Merrill, and John Ashbery try to restore some of the challenge and risk that characterized modernist poetry's relation to its first readers. Sure to be controversial, this cogent analysis offers poets and readers a clear sense of direction and purpose, and so, the hope of reaching each other again.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_sFZAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wooing Miss Whately (Zebra Regency Romance)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Beowulf to Beatles: Approaches to Poetry","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=J_RzAAAACAAJ&dq=Beowulf+to+Beatles:+Approaches+to+Poetry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Potty Train Your Baby","description":"Finally...a fun, easy-to-use guide to potty training any child in just ONE DAY Just think, from the time babies are born until they are toilet trained, they use an average of 4,000 diapers! Potty Train Your Child in Just One Day is the helpful guide you've been waiting for to get your child out of diapers and turn the potentially terrifying process of toilet training into an effective and enjoyable bonding experience with your child. Teri guides parents to the successful one-day potty training of their child by teaching them how to: ? Look for the signs that your child is ready to be potty trained ? Make the potty connection by using a potty-training doll ? Create incentive through consistent positive reinforcement ? Use charts, quizzes, and checklists to help with every step of potty training ? Know when it's time to bring in a potty pinch hitter ? Complete your potty training -- no more accidents Once Teri teaches you her techniques, she shares her secret -- potty parties! She has carefully designed twelve imaginative themes for parties, such as a seriously silly circus, a cartoon character carnival, or a magic carpet express, and supplies parents with everything they will need. Teri has proven that a potty party day engages a child in potty training in a way that no other method has before -- by speaking a toddler's language. A party may translate to fun, games, cake, candy, presents, and prizes to a child, but with Teri's expertise, parents can use it as a tool to motivate their child to want to go to the bathroom -- and to keep on going.

Could our generation be the one that is witnessing the beginning phases of the second coming of the Lord? If so, will you be one of the faithful Jesus finds when He calls His church to heaven? In The Sifted Generation, Pastor Michael Henderson takes a unique look at the final generation from which the true church will be sifted just prior to the days of tribulation that are coming on the entire earth. The Bible tells us the times of that generation will be perilous! Blasphemies, selfishness, rebelliousness, gracelessness, slanderous hearts, hedonistic behavior, and a lack of respect for God, His church, and His commandments will rule the day. As evidenced in the social and cultural wars around the globe, it is evident that the world is already choosing its sides. Ironically, the Bible declares that a man will arise in the last days. He will be a religious leader who will have great charisma and the uncanny ability to garner support from large sections of unbelieving humanity. Through deceptive words, promises, and the quasi miraculous, this religious leader will then persuade his followers to support one even more sinister than he. This partner in deception will pounce on the opportunity to take the reins of the world under his control. The Sifted Generation explores what life will be like on Earth just before the Lord begins the consummation of all things. The question is: When the Son of Man comes, will He really find faith on the Earth? (Luke 18:8).

Structuralist Versus Analogical Descriptions ONE important purpose of this book is to compare two completely dif ferent approaches to describing language. The first of these approaches, commonly called stnlctllralist, is the traditional method for describing behavior. Its methods are found in many diverse fields - from biological taxonomy to literary criticism. A structuralist description can be broadly characterized as a system of classification. The fundamental question that a structuralist description attempts to answer is how a general contextual space should be partitioned. For each context in the partition, a rule is defined. The rule either specifies the behavior of that context or (as in a taxonomy) assigns a name to that context. Structuralists have implicitly assumed that descriptions of behavior should not only be correct, but should also minimize the number of rules and permit only the simplest possible contextual specifications. It turns out that these intuitive notions can actually be derived from more fundamental statements about the uncertainty of rule systems. Traditionally, linguistic analyses have been based on the idea that a language is a system of rules. Saussure, of course, is well known as an early proponent of linguistic structuralism, as exemplified by his characterization of language as \\"a self-contained whole and principle of classification\\" (Saussure 1966:9). Yet linguistic structuralism did not originate with Saussure - nor did it end with \\"American structuralism\\".","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5fPwCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"El Mundo de Sofia","description":"Esta extraordinaria obra de divulgaci n que se ha convertido ya en una obra de culto aporta una coherente visi n de conjunto sobre aquellos aspectos imprescindibles para comprender la historia de la filosof a occidental.

This series contributes to the growing discipline of practical theology by providing frontline scholarship on major topics in the field, with an emphasis on the emerging international discussion. Written by expert scholars known worldwide, these volumes will be of interest to pastors, students of theology, and those working in the allied fields of sociology, psychology, cultural studies, social work, and medicine. According to the authors of this powerfully reasoned book, only a serious commitment to the Christian ideas of forgiveness and reconciliation can meet the needs of today's troubled world -- and the church must take the lead in this process. Partly a survey of existing attitudes and partly a how-to manual for developing an active \\"public\\" church, this book highlights the importance of forgiveness and reconciliation in both congregational life and society, and it traces out the intricacies of making them happen. After discussing common views of human nature and exploring the concepts of forgiveness and reconciliation as found in Scripture and church tradition, Robert Browning and Roy Reed put forth an innovative four-pronged approach integrating recent scientific studies of forgiveness with bold, theologically grounded ministry proposals.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=b9Q2jRThFzkC&dq=Forgiveness,+Reconciliation,+and+Moral+Courage:+Motives+and+Designs+for+Ministry+in+a+Troubled+World+(Studies+in+Practical+Theology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Magnificent Masquerade","description":"Kitty's father arranges a marriage for her with the Earl of Edgerton's younger brother, but on the way to their first meeting, Kitty and Emily, her maid decide to change places","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BhjOAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Magnificent+Masquerade&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Korea: The Untold Story of the War","description":"\\"An absolutely brilliant book . . .

Wickham, commander of the famous 101st Airborne Division in the 1970s and subsequently Army Chief of Staff, once visited Antietam battlefield. Gazing at Bloody Lane where, in 1862, several Union assaults were brutally repulsed before they finally broke through, he marveled, \\"You couldn't get American soldiers today to make an attack like that.\\" Why did those men risk certain death, over and over again, through countless bloody battles and four long, awful years ? Why did the conventional wisdom -- that soldiers become increasingly cynical and disillusioned as war progresses -- not hold true in the Civil War? It is to this question--why did they fight--that James McPherson, America's preeminent Civil War historian, now turns his attention. He shows that, contrary to what many scholars believe, the soldiers of the Civil War remained powerfully convinced of the ideals for which they fought throughout the conflict. Motivated by duty and honor, and often by religious faith, these men wrote frequently of their firm belief in the cause for which they fought: the principles of liberty, freedom, justice, and patriotism. Soldiers on both sides harkened back to the Founding Fathers, and the ideals of the American Revolution. They fought to defend their country, either the Union--\\"the best Government ever made\\"--or the Confederate states, where their very homes and families were under siege. And they fought to defend their honor and manhood. \\"I should not lik to go home with the name of a couhard,\\" one Massachusetts private wrote, and another private from Ohio said, \\"My wife would sooner hear of my death than my disgrace.\\" Even after three years of bloody battles, more than half of the Union soldiers reenlisted voluntarily. \\"While duty calls me here and my country demands my services I should be willing to make the sacrifice,\\" one man wrote to his protesting parents. And another soldier said simply, \\"I still love my country.\\" McPherson draws on more than 25,000 letters and nearly 250 private diaries from men on both sides. Civil War soldiers were among the most literate soldiers in history, and most of them wrote home frequently, as it was the only way for them to keep in touch with homes that many of them had left for the first time in their lives. Significantly, their letters were also uncensored by military authorities, and are uniquely frank in their criticism and detailed in their reports of marches and battles, relations between officers and men, political debates, and morale. For Cause and Comrades lets these soldiers tell their own stories in their own words to create an account that is both deeply moving and far truer than most books on war. Battle Cry of Freedom, McPherson's Pulitzer Prize-winning account of the Civil War, was a national bestseller that Hugh Brogan, in The New York Times, called \\"history writing of the highest order.\\" For Cause and Comrades deserves similar accolades, as McPherson's masterful prose and the soldiers' own words combine to create both an important book on an often-overlooked aspect of our bloody Civil War, and a powerfully moving account of the men who fought it.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1qhEHVki8tEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Constitutional Law for a Changing America: Institutional Powers and Constraints","description":"A host of political factors both internal and external influence the Court s decisions and shape the development of constitutional law. Among the more significant forces at work are the ways lawyers and interest groups frame legal disputes, the ideological and behavioral propensities of the justices, the politics of judicial selection, public opinion, and the positions that elected officials take, to name just a few. Combining lessons of the legal model with the influences of the political process, Constitutional Law for a Changing America shows how these dynamics shape the development of constitutional doctrine. The Tenth Edition offers rigorous, comprehensive content in a student-friendly manner. With meticulous revising and updating throughout, best-selling authors Lee Epstein and Thomas G. Walker streamline material while accounting for new scholarship and recent landmark cases including key opinions handed down through the 2018 judicial session.

Now, after fighting so hard to be independent and happy, she finds her life threatened as a result of her father's ruthless business dealings. Caught between resentment and fear, Camille prepares herself for the measures her father will take to protect her. But nothing could prepare her for the ex-SAS sniper who crashes into her life.

The culmination of three decades of intensive research, this provocative book is designed to take readers out of their comfort zone and examine the historical and archaeological data, which reveal that:   Israel was created not by illiterate pastoralists, as is claimed by biblical scholars, but by skilled Kenite copper smelters.   The Dead Sea Scrolls were not written at Khirbat Qumran.   The Temple Mount is not the site of the Temples of Solomon and Herod. Applying a synthesis of history, politics, science and covert intelligence sources, the author explores such diverse subjects as mind control, advanced energy systems, terrestrially constructed flying saucers, extraterrestrials, and the planned double-cross of the western Illuminati factions by China and Russia.

Very little is known about Chuang Tsu, and that little is inextricably woven into legend. It is said that he was a contemporary of Mencius, an official in the Lacquer Garden of Meng in Honan Province around the 4th century b.c. Chuang Tsu was to Lao Tsu as Saint Paul was to Jesus and Plato to Socrates. While the other philosophers were busying themselves with the practical matters of government and rules of conduct, Chuang Tsu transcended the whang cheng, the illusory dust of the world thus anticipating Zen Buddhism s emphasis on a state of emptiness or ego transcendence. With humor, imagery, and fantasy, he captures the depth of Chinese thinking. The seven \\"Inner Chapters\\" presented in this translation are accepted by scholars as being definitely the work of Chuang Tsu. Another twenty-six chapters are of questionable origin; they are interpretations of his teaching and may have been added by later commentators. This is an updated version of the translation of Chuang Tsu: Inner Chapters that was originally published in 1974. Like the original Chinese, this version uses gender-neutral language wherever possible. This edition includes many new photographs by Jane English and an introduction by Tai Ji master Chungliang Al Huang, who has been highly successful in bringing to the West the wisdom of the East.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U-HEBQAAQBAJ&dq=Chuangtsu:+Inner+Chapters,+a+Companion+to+Tao+Te+Ching&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reading Reminders: Tools, Tips and Techniques","description":"Reading Reminders features Jim Burke's 100 best techniques for teaching reading, complete with tools and techniques on how to implement them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kHjuAAAAMAAJ&dq=Reading+Reminders:+Tools,+Tips+and+Techniques&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Music Library","description":"\\"Library Music, also known as source or mood music, was made for use in animations, commercials, film and TV programmes.

Maybe the most stunning presentation of this book in 3300 years: Upon death, it was the practice for some Egyptians to produce a papyrus manuscript called the Book of Going Forth by Day or the Book of the Dead. A Book of the Dead included declarations and spells to help the deceased in the afterlife. The Papyrus of Ani is the manuscript compiled for Ani, the royal scribe of Thebes. Written and illustrated almost 3,300 years ago, The Papyrus of Ani is a papyrus manuscript with cursive hieroglyphs and color illustrations. It is the most beautiful, best-preserved, and complete example of ancient Egyptian philosophical and religious thought known to exist. The Egyptian Book of the Dead is an integral part of the world's spiritual heritage. It is an artistic rendering of the mysteries of life and death. For the first time since its creation, this ancient papyrus is now available in full color with an integrated English translation directly below each image. This twentieth-anniversary edition of The Egyptian Book of the Dead has been revised and expanded to include: Significant improvements to the display of the images of the Papyrus. A survey of the continuing importance of ancient Egypt in modern culture. A detailed history of Egyptian translation and philology since the discovery of the Rosetta Stone in 1799.

A non-categorical, characteristics approach to addressing high-prevalence mild disabilities. Learners with Mild Disabilities: A Characteristics Approach focuses on high-prevalence disorders affecting school learners today, including mild intellectual disabilities, learning disabilities, emotional/behavioral disorders, ADHD, autism spectrum disorders, and communication disorders, as well as on low incidence conditions that may manifest in the milder range, for example sensory, physical, health, or TBI. The author lays the foundation for addressing the needs of special learners and then focuses on learners from the perspective of alternative non-categorical frameworks. She describes students with disabilities and related conditions with respect to a variety of individual strengths and needs, considering their cognitive, language, academic learning, and social/emotional characteristics. Readers see how to apply these conceptual frameworks by analyzing a number of vignettes and extended case studies based on the experiences of real children and teachers. Designed as a primary text for use in undergraduate and graduate courses addressing the characteristics of learners with high prevalence or milder levels of disability, the text is also useful for the first specialized course in a special education program. It supports programs in inclusive education or the growing area of generic special education. The Enhanced Pearson eText features embedded video.

The first in-depth mathematical study of the subject as a coherent subfield of finite combinatorics--one with its own organized body of techniques and results--this book blends new theorems with some of the striking results from threshold logic, making all of it accessible to game theorists. Introductory material receives a fresh treatment, with an emphasis on Boolean subgames and the Rudin-Keisler order as unifying concepts. Advanced material focuses on the surprisingly wide variety of properties related to the weightedness of a game. A desirability relation orders the individuals or coalitions of a game according to their influence in the corresponding voting system. As Taylor and Zwicker show, acyclicity of such a relation approximates weightedness--the more sensitive the relation, the closer the approximation. A trade is an exchange of players among coalitions, and robustness under such trades is equivalent to weightedness of the game. Robustness under trades that fit some restrictive exchange pattern typically characterizes a wider class of simple games--for example, games for which some particular desirability order is acyclic. Finally, one can often describe these wider classes of simple games by weakening the total additivity of a weighting to obtain what is called a pseudoweighting. In providing such uniform explanations for many of the structural properties of simple games, this book showcases numerous new techniques and results.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OLQEEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All-American Desserts: 400 Star-Spangled, Razzle-Dazzle Recipes for America's Best Loved Desserts (Non)","description":"All-American Desserts is a treasure-trove of 400 desserts that tantalize Americans across this great country, whether traditional sweets, back-of-the-box classics, or newly inspired creations.

In working to clarify and deepen understanding of the current status of environmental public participation rights in Nigeria, the book addresses key issues in environmental governance for developing and transitional countries and the potential for public participation to improve the state of the environment and public wellbeing.

Bayonne chocolate makers today advertise that Jews brought chocolate making to France. ? Chocolate Hanukkah gelt may have developed from St. Nicholas customs. ? Jews pioneered chocolate in North America as successful and well-known American colonial Jewish merchants such as Abraham Lopez and Nathan Simson traded cacao and manufactured chocolate. ? A born-again Christian businessman in the Midwest marketed his caramel chocolate bar as a ?Noshy,? after the Yiddish word for ?snack.? ? Jewish values of caring for the needy, pursuing economic justice, protecting the environment and promoting sustainability feed into the organic and fair trade chocolate businesses of today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bbyvqhYYR7AC&dq=Chocolate+Covered+Adventures+Cookbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The history of Mr. Polly (Library of classics)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=18WZswEACAAJ&dq=The+history+of+Mr.+Polly+(Library+of+classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The middle beat;: A correspondent's view of Mexico, Guatemala, and El Salvador, (Publications of the Center for Education in Latin America, Institute ...

In our minds Caesar is a field marshall and a dictator. However, authentic images portray the idea of the clementia Caesaris, a clement Caesar. Jesus' life is congruent to the life of Caesar. Both Julius Caesar and Jesus began their careers in northern countries: Caesar in Gaul, Jesus in Galilee; both cross a fatal river: the Rubicon and the Jordan; both then enter cities; Corfinium and Cafarnaum; Caesar finds Corfinium occupied by a man of Pompey and besieges him, while Jesus finds a man possessed by an impure spirit. There is similarity in structure as well as in place names. People in the stories of Caesar and of Jesus are structurally the same people, even by name and location. Caesar's most famous quotations are found in the gospels in structurally significant places.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mLIrAAAACAAJ&dq=Jesus+Was+Caesar:+On+the+Julian+Origin+of+Christianity:+An+Investigative+Report&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Last Buffalo Hunter: A Novel","description":"The Last Buffalo Hunter is one of the few surviving oral accounts of the old North-West during the late nineteenth century, providing a valuable record of the spirit and romance of a way of life that ended with the demise of the once-vast buffalo herds.

According to Lester DeKoster, the doctrine of predestination as preached by Calvin makes building the kingdom of God, rather than evangelism, the sole and highest calling of Christians. Calvin's indifference to missions was rooted in his understanding that predestination leaves evangelism with nothing to give away; instead, daily labor on behalf of God's kingdom is the central act of divine worship. Calvin's preaching, his \\"Institutes of the Christian Religion,\\" and his leadership of the church and civic government in Geneva were each, DeKoster maintains, directed toward establishing God's kingdom on earth. Furthermore, Western democracy as envisioned by Thomas Jefferson and others is a direct result of such Word-inspired civil government. Properly understanding Scripture as a dynamic creative Agent of the City means that faithfully preaching today, just as in Calvin's day, will continue to dramatically evoke the City as God's kingdom on earth. Lester DeKoster's style reminds me of Thomas Carlyle. He takes the English language and -- as only a master of prose can do -- transforms that language into something powerful and imposing. . . . This book will prove to be an enduring monument, not only in the field of Calvin studies but far beyond that. -- John Richard de Witt First Presbyterian Church, Columbia, South Carolina","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MlJq69lGY7IC&dq=Light+for+the+City:+Calvin%27s+Preaching,+Source+of+Life+and+Liberty&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Value-Based Fees: How to Charge--and Get--What You're Worth (Ultimate Consultant Series)","description":"In this thoroughly revised edition of his classic book, Alan Weiss shows how consulting fees are dependent on only two things: value provided in the perception of the buyer and the intent of the buyer and the consultant to act ethically. Many consultants, however, fail to understand that perceived value is the basis of the fee, or that they must translate the importance of their advice into long-term gains for the client in the client's perception. Still others fail to have the courage and the belief system that support the high value delivered to clients, thereby reducing fees to a level commensurate with the consultant's own low self-esteem. Ultimately, says Weiss, consultants, not clients, are the main cause of low consulting fees.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oezwDwAAQBAJ&dq=Value-Based+Fees:+How+to+Charge--and+Get--What+You%27re+Worth+(Ultimate+Consultant+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The birth of a new physics (Science study series, S10)","description":"This book investigates, through the problem of the earth's shape, part of the development of post-Newtonian mechanics by the Parisian scientific community during the first half of the eighteenth century. In the Principia Newton first raised the question of the earth's shape. John Greenberg shows how continental scholars outside France influenced efforts in Paris to solve the problem, and he also demonstrates that Parisian scholars, including Bouguer and Fontaine, did work that Alexis-Claude Clairaut used in developing his mature theory of the earth's shape. The evolution of Parisian mechanics proved not to be the replacement of a Cartesian paradigm by a Newtonian one, a replacement that might be expected from Thomas Kuhn's formulations about scientific revolutions, but a complex process instead involving many areas of research and contributions of different kinds from the entire scientific world. Greenberg both explores the myriad of technical problems that underlie the historical development of part of post-Newtonian mechanics, which have only been rarely analyzed by Western scholars, and embeds his technical discussion in a framework that involves social and institutional history politics, and biography. Instead of focusing exclusively on the historiographical problem, Greenberg shows as well that international scientific communication was as much a vital part of the scientific progress of individual nations during the first half of the eighteenth century as it is today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PzqoBhdDsRUC&dq=The+birth+of+a+new+physics+(Science+study+series,+S10)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Human Rights and Gender Violence: Translating International Law into Local Justice (Chicago Series in Law and Society)","description":"Human rights law and the legal protection of women from violence are still fairly new concepts. As a result, substantial discrepancies exist between what is decided in the halls of the United Nations and what women experience on a daily basis in their communities. Human Rights and Gender Violence is an ambitious study that investigates the tensions between global law and local justice. As an observer of UN diplomatic negotiations as well as the workings of grassroots feminist organizations in several countries, Sally Engle Merry offers an insider's perspective on how human rights law holds authorities accountable for the protection of citizens even while reinforcing and expanding state power. Providing legal and anthropological perspectives, Merry contends that human rights law must be framed in local terms to be accepted and effective in altering existing social hierarchies. Gender violence in particular, she argues, is rooted in deep cultural and religious beliefs, so change is often vehemently resisted by the communities perpetrating the acts of aggression. A much-needed exploration of how local cultures appropriate and enact international human rights law, this book will be of enormous value to students of gender studies and anthropology alike.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eRYbjp-fOiYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Divine outline of history: Dispensations and the church","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Norton Book of Classical Literature","description":"An anthology of classical literature features more than three hundred pieces, representing the foundation of Western literature, as well as commentary that discusses the origins of Greek language, Homer, the fall of Rome, and more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=f45fAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Norton+Book+of+Classical+Literature&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christmas Poems (Everyman's Library Pocket Poets)","description":"An enchanting and witty compendium of Yuletide poetry includes the lyrics to familiar carols, Moore's \\"A Visit from St. Nicholas,\\" and other great works by Langston Hughes, Emily Dickinson, Rudyard Kipling, Dorothy Parker, Robert Graves, and Philip","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=b_-kcr-Lmi4C&dq=Christmas+Poems+(Everyman%27s+Library+Pocket+Poets)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Merchants of Grain: The Power and Profits of the Five Giant Companies at the Center of the World's Food Supply","description":"Discusses the five multinational grain companies, owned by seven American and European families, that control most of the international trade in basic food commodities.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=W8VjAAAAIAAJ&dq=Merchants+of+Grain:+The+Power+and+Profits+of+the+Five+Giant+Companies+at+the+Center+of+the+World%27s+Food+Supply&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"God Is the Gospel: Meditations on God's Love as the Gift of Himself","description":"God, who said, \\"Let light shine out of darkness,\\" has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. 2 Corinthians 4:6 This book is a cry from the heart of John Piper. He is pleading that God himself, as revealed in Christ's death and resurrection, is the ultimate and greatest gift of the gospel. None of Christ's gospel deeds and none of our gospel blessings are good news except as means of seeing and savoring the glory of Christ. Forgiveness is good news because it opens the way to the enjoyment of God himself. Justification is good news because it wins access to the presence and pleasures of God himself. Eternal life is good news because it becomes the everlasting enjoyment of Christ. All God's gifts are loving only to the degree that they lead us to God himself. That is what God's love is: his commitment to do everything necessary (most painfully the death of his only Son) to enthrall us with what is most deeply and durably satisfying-namely, himself. Saturated with Scripture, centered on the cross, and seriously joyful, this book leads us to satisfaction for the deep hungers of the soul. It touches us at the root of life where practical transformation gets its daily power. It awakens our longing for Christ and opens our eyes to his beauty. Piper writes for the soul-thirsty who have turned away empty and in desperation from the mirage of methodology. He invites us to slow down and drink from a deeper spring. \\"This is eternal life,\\" Jesus said, \\"that they know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.\\" This is what makes the gospel-and this book-good news.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iy-L4nYItzwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"You Shall Know Our Velocity","description":"In his first novel, Dave Eggers has written a moving and hilarious tale of two friends who fly around the world trying to give away a lot of money and free themselves from a profound loss.

Because of Nietzsche's evocative style and provocative ideas, his philosophy generates passionate reactions. His works remain controversial, due to varying interpretations and misinterpretations of his work. In the Western philosophy tradition, Nietzsche's writings have been described as the unique case of free revolutionary thought, that is, revolutionary in its structure and problems, although not tied to any revolutionary project. Some prominent elements of his philosophy include his genealogical critique of religion and Christian morality; the related theory of masterslave morality; the characterization of the human subject as the expression of competing wills, collectively understood as the will to power; and influential concepts such as the  bermensch and the doctrine of eternal return.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=288kDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Extreme Encounters: How It Feels to Be Drowned in Quicksand, Shredded by Piranhas, Swept Up in a Tornado, and Dozens of Other Unpleasant Experiences...","description":"Provides descriptions in the second person of what it is like to experience a variety of dangerous events, from wilderness disasters, medical emergencies, and everyday accidents to execution.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PEM8iQjb16MC&dq=Extreme+Encounters:+How+It+Feels+to+Be+Drowned+in+Quicksand,+Shredded+by+Piranhas,+Swept+Up+in+a+Tornado,+and+Dozens+of+Other+Unpleasant+Experiences...&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Of the Flesh: Dangerous New Fiction","description":"Fiction.

Robert Thurman is one such teacher. Now, in his first experiential course on the essentials of Tibetan Buddhism, adapted and expanded from a popular retreat he led, Thurman -- the first Westerner ordained by His Holiness the Dalai Lama himself -- shares the centuries-old wisdom of a highly valued method used by the great Tibetan masters. Using a revered, once-secret text of a seventeenth-century Tibetan master, along with a thorough explanation for contemporary Westerners, The Jewel Tree of Tibet immerses you fully in the mysteries of Tibetan spiritual wisdom. A retreat in book form as well as a spiritual and philosophical teaching, it offers a practical system of understanding yourself and the world, of developing your learning and thought processes, and of gaining deep, transforming insight. Tibetans think of their cherished tradition of Buddhism as a \\"wish-fulfilling jewel tree\\" for its power to generate bliss and enlightenment within all who absorb its teachings. Happiness, in fact, is the true goal of Tibetan spirituality, and the wish-fulfilling jewel tree will put you on the road to that reachable goal. This beautiful jewel-tree imagery, which acts like a mandala or a yoga pose to focus your attention on truths larger than yourself, will help you break through worn-out ideas and habits, strengthen positive abilities, develop more energy and creativity, and change your life -- and future -- for the better. As Thurman writes, \\"Readers learn to cultivate the sensitivity and appreciation to love more fully, feel compassion more intensely, and become a fountain of cheerfulness for all they meet and know.\\" Because the path to enlightenment requires more than sitting in meditation, The Jewel Tree of Tibet offers a rich, intellectually riveting course with many specific spiritual practices, including: eleven steps to create the spirit of enlightenment, here and now; the truths and stories of the ancient Indian and Tibetan sages; and guided meditations to experience the blessings of the wish-fulfilling jewel tree. You can do these practices with others or on your own, while living your daily life. And as you travel this road to deeper self-realization, self-understanding, and infectious happiness, you will also learn how the principles of Tibetan Tantra can open the doors to \\"infinite compassion and continuity,\\" and how to discover states of consciousness that transcend even death. One of the most explicit teachings of the steps to the path of enlightenment available, explained by a skilled Western teacher, The Jewel Tree of Tibet will enable you to honor the full subtlety and hidden depths of the Tibetan Buddhist path and realize at last its deeper mysteries and rewards -- for yourself and others.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lDTjiWBaeqMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Science is a Sacred Cow","description":"From jacket: \\"Scientists believe they possess in unique degree the qualities of accuracy, observation, reasoning power, intellectual curiosity, tolerance and even humility.

Written for those with minimal or no programming experience, Computer Programming in C for Beginners offers a heavily guided, hands-on approach that enables the reader to quickly start programming, and then progresses to cover the major concepts of C programming that are critical for an early stage programmer to know and understand. While the progression of topics is conventional, their treatment is innovative and designed for rapid understanding of the many concepts in C that have traditionally proven difficult for beginners, such as variable typing and scope, function definition, passing by value, pointers, passing by reference, arrays, structures, basic memory management, dynamic memory allocation, and linked lists, as well as an introductory treatment of searching and sorting algorithms. Written in an informal but clear narrative, the book uses extensive examples throughout and provides detailed guidance on how to write the C code to achieve the objectives of the example problems. Derived from the author s many years of teaching hands-on college courses, it encourages the reader to follow along by programming the progressively more complex exercise programs presented. In some sections, errors are purposely inserted into the code to teach the reader about the common pitfalls of programming in general, and the C language in particular.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5qIGEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fading Miracle: Four Decades of Market Economy in Germany (Cambridge Studies in Economic Policies and Institutions)","description":"This updated paperback edition describes West German economic policy from the late 1940s to the present.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kkXGk_HyIBAC&dq=The+Fading+Miracle:+Four+Decades+of+Market+Economy+in+Germany+(Cambridge+Studies+in+Economic+Policies+and+Institutions)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Watt: Rise of the Novel (Cloth)","description":"This groundbreaking study examines the vexed and unstable relations between the eighteenth-century novel and the material world. Rather than exploring dress's transformative potential, it charts the novel's vibrant engagement with ordinary clothes in its bid to establish new ways of articulating identity and market itself as a durable genre. In a world in which print culture and textile manufacturing traded technologies, and paper was made of rags, the novel, by contrast, resisted the rhetorical and aesthetic links between dress and expression, style and sentiment. Chloe Wigston Smith shows how fiction exploited women's work with clothing - through stealing, sex work, service, stitching, and the stage - in order to revise and reshape material culture within its pages. Her book explores a diverse group of authors, including Jane Barker, Jonathan Swift, Daniel Defoe, Eliza Haywood, Samuel Richardson, Henry Fielding, Charlotte Lennox, John Cleland, Frances Burney and Mary Robinson.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hYYYAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Art of Biblical Narrative, The","description":"From celebrated translator of the Hebrew Bible Robert Alter, the classic study of the Bible as literature, a winner of the National Jewish Book Award.

Vast in scope and intimate in its telling . . . Moving and riveting.   VIET THANH NGUYEN, author of The Sympathizer, winner of the Pulitzer Prize With the epic sweep of Min Jin Lee s Pachinko or Yaa Gyasi s Homegoing and the lyrical beauty of Vaddey Ratner s In the Shadow of the Banyan, The Mountains Sing tells an enveloping, multigenerational tale of the Tr?n family, set against the backdrop of the Vi?t Nam War. Tr?n Di?u Lan, who was born in 1920, was forced to flee her family farm with her six children during the Land Reform as the Communist government rose in the North. Years later in H  N?i, her young granddaughter, H??ng, comes of age as her parents and uncles head off down the H? Ch  Minh Trail to fight in a conflict that tore apart not just her beloved country, but also her family. Vivid, gripping, and steeped in the language and traditions of Vi?t Nam, The Mountains Sing brings to life the human costs of this conflict from the point of view of the Vietnamese people themselves, while showing us the true power of kindness and hope.

Yan Sun here examines the ways in which market reforms in the People's Republic of China have shaped corruption since 1978 and how corruption has in turn shaped those reforms. She suggests that recent corruption is largely a byproduct of post-Mao reforms, spurred by the economic incentives and structural opportunities in the emerging marketplace. Sun finds that the steady retreat of the state has both increased mechanisms for cadre misconduct and reduced disincentives against it. Chinese disciplinary offices, law enforcement agencies, and legal professionals compile and publish annual casebooks of economic crimes. The cases, processed in the Chinese penal system, represent offenders from party-state agencies at central and local levels as well as state firms of varying sizes and types of ownership. Sun uses these casebooks to illuminate the extent and forms of corruption in the People's Republic of China. Unintended and informal mechanisms arising from corruption may, she finds, take on a life of their own and undermine the central state's ability to implement its developmental policies, discipline its staff, enforce its regulatory infrastructure, and fundamentally transform the economy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Z4rvzgEACAAJ&dq=Corruption+and+Market+in+Contemporary+China&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Celebrate!

Seasoned with herbs and spices, moistened with olive oil and butter, rolled in cabbage and grape leaves, food no longer merely abates hunger but becomes a picture of fragrance and charm to satisfy sight, smell, and taste. There is no difference between Syrian and Lebanese foods. In America these foods are most popularly known as Syrian foods. However, since Syria was under the rule of Turkey for centuries, some of the drinks and foods are Turkish. This is why the coffee served in Syria and Lebanon is called Turkish coffee. A part of my heritage, these recipes have been handed down from mother to daughter for generations and followed by instinct a little of this, a pinch of that and flavored to please the palate, though the ingredients were never accurately measured. As my sister and I gathered these recipes from my mother, Maheeba (Mabel), she recalled many scenes of her native land; of certain haflis (parties), of friends, of the rich aroma of Turkish coffee poured into a demitasse, of the historical background of Arabic script and the makings of exquisite damask cloth. When we lived in Canton, Ohio, as children, my sister, brother, and I used to get a great deal of pleasure watching my father and his friends take turns smoking the narghileh (Turkish water pipe) as they relaxed during the evenings, exchanging stories of their journey to this country. The narghileh had the sound of bubbling water and an incense aroma filled the house from the Persian tobacco that was used. Our narghileh was made of beautiful cut glass with an oriental brass stem, and the smoking pipe that was attached had an almost cobra look with its many variegated colors. The smoke was being drawn through cold water to reduce the strength of the nicotine. The guests were served Turkish coffee and the hostess was ready to play the part of a fortuneteller. The cups were inverted and left to stand so that the coffee sediment formed a pattern on the inside of the cup. Then the cups were turned up again and the hostess interpreted the future of each guest from the pattern in his cup. I have included in the book features on the religious significance of foods, Syrian-Lebanese festivals, weddings, Easter, Epiphany, the preparation of wine and bread for Holy Communion, and a complete Lenten section. This is an adventure in foods you will want to repeat over and over again. While these customs and traditions still prevail in the land of my ancestors, I felt that you would enjoy opening a few doors to this ancient land, reflecting the mingling of traditions between those days and modern times.

Taking a computational approach, Temperley develops models for generating these aspects of musical structure. The models he proposes are based on preference rules, which are criteria for evaluating a possible structural analysis of a piece of music. A preference rule system evaluates many possible interpretations and chooses the one that best satisfies the rules. After an introductory chapter, Temperley presents preference rule systems for generating six basic kinds of musical structure: meter, phrase structure, contrapuntal structure, harmony, and key, as well as pitch spelling (the labeling of pitch events with spellings such as A flat or G sharp). He suggests that preference rule systems not only show how musical structures are inferred, but also shed light on other aspects of music. He substantiates this claim with discussions of musical ambiguity, retrospective revision, expectation, and music outside the Western canon (rock and traditional African music). He proposes a framework for the description of musical styles based on preference rule systems and explores the relevance of preference rule systems to higher-level aspects of music, such as musical schemata, narrative and drama, and musical tension.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IDoLEvTQuewC&dq=The+Cognition+of+Basic+Musical+Structures&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gospel According to Gamaliel","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=u_4engEACAAJ&dq=The+Gospel+According+to+Gamaliel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Now You See Her [Blackstone]","description":"When two unsteady souls, in totally different life stages, cross paths at just the moment that each needs the other most... Rachel Trammel is an associate attorney, fresh out of law school, and works for the Law Firm of Mason, Blackstone & Thorpe. Always hiding behind her glasses and blending into her surroundings, Rachel is oblivious to the beauty she holds which is only enhanced by her sweet and humble nature. She works hard as a first-year attorney and entertains herself through observation along with a very active imagination. The one person who inspires and makes regular appearances in Rachel's imagination is her immediate boss and senior partner, Cameron Blackstone. Mr. Blackstone is a distinguished, charismatic, steel-blue eyed dream, who causes Rachel's sexual fantasies to run wild at the most inappropriate times. With his dark past and mysterious habits of rarely being seen during the daytime, Rachel amuses herself with the many possibilities to the reasons why and even entertains the idea that Mr. Blackstone may be a vampire. As these two spend time together, working on their cases, Mr. Blackstone begins urging Rachel past her comfort zone and as a result she unknowingly chisels away at his deep-seated barriers. A mutual attraction seems to develop, but is hindered by the shadows that lurk in Mr. Blackstone's past. When the truth is finally exposed, will it bring them closer together or will it be too heavy of a burden for Rachel to carry? ...they will either balance each other out and become better versions of themselves, at the hands of the other's encouragement; or, resist each other's hands to only fall deeper into apprehension.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2pFVMQAACAAJ&dq=Now+You+See+Her+%5BBlackstone%5D&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Little Auto","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VV2vuQAACAAJ&dq=The+Little+Auto&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mande Music: Traditional and Modern Music of the Maninka and Mandinka of Western Africa (Chicago Studies in Ethnomusicology)","description":"With Mande Music, Eric Charry offers the most comprehensive source available on one of Africa's richest and most sophisticated music cultures.

He later learned that a carefully crafted Red-suburban version of reality isolated him from nearly everything real. \\"Red truth\\" was a strange morph of God, Patriotism, and Republicans. When this uniquely Red-suburban mentality played a role in winning President George W. Bush a second term in late 2004, Schilke began an investigation into the driving factors behind his Red upbringing, which still persist and thrive today in suburban and rural America. From carefully-guarded moral relativism, to the Army's questionable recruiting techniques; from Major League Baseball's tainted home run records, to the myth of the Ownership Society; Schilke maps these current events back into the perspective of his Red upbringing. Why does Red-suburban middle-America consistently vote against its own interests in election after election? Growing Up Red attempts to show that, in Red America, it is simply the patriotic thing to do. In Red America, raw Faith trumps Knowledge. Carefully-tweaked irrational fear drives never-ending consumption. A Republican President marches arm-in-arm with God down Main Street every Fourth of July. What happens when actual reality starts to bleed through the carefully-protected fences of suburbia?

Princess Pamela ruled a small realm, but her powers ranged far and wide. Her speakeasy-style restaurant in Manhattan was for three decades a hip salon, with regulars from Andy Warhol to Diana Ross. Her iconic Southern dishes influenced chefs nationwide, and her cookbook became a bible for a generation who yearned for the home cooking left behind in the Great Migration. One of the earliest books to coin soul food, this touchstone of African-American cuisine fell out of print more than forty years ago. Pamela s recipes have the clarity gained from a lifetime of practice cardinal versions of Fried Chicken and Collard Greens, but also unusual gems like Pork Spoon Bread and Peanut Butter Biscuits all peppered with sage advice on living and loving. Her book stands out for its joie de vivre and pathos as well as the skill of its techniques and is now available for cooks everywhere to re-create these soul-satisfying dishes at home.  If you lived in New York on big dreams and no money, Princess Pamela s was where you wanted to eat. Quirky and clubby (the Princess didn t let everybody in), her Little Kitchen served cheap cuts tripe, chitlins , pig tails and made them taste like food for angels. You felt lucky to be there.

A child of the first kibbutz movement in British Palestine, he went on to lead Israel to victory in the 1948 War of Independence and to liberate Jerusalem in the 1967 Six-Day War. Dayan was not only a soldier but a politician, an archaeologist, and a larger-than-life figure who helped shape the state of Israel. In My Father, His Daughter, Ya?l Dayan, who herself served in the Israeli Parliament, shares an uncensored look into her father s life and her own conflicted relationship with him. With poignancy and candor, Dayan creates a profound yet nuanced profile of her father. She relates his strong national pride, his boldness in dealing with other world leaders, and his troubles at home to his disintegrating marriage and multiple affairs. As revealing as My Father, His Daughter is of the man behind the myth, it is also a snapshot of a loving relationship between Ya?l and Moshe Dayan, and of a daughter s admiration and respect for a complicated but loving father.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZFG2BgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sherlock Holmes: The Adventure of the Dead Rabbits Society","description":"\\"With great disbelief Cornelius J.

His intention was to forge a unified state from his vast and disparate possessions, but his action had the opposite effect, catalyzing the emergence of competing nationalisms among his Hungarian, Czech, and other subjects, who feared that their languages and cultures would be lost. In this sweeping narrative history of Eastern Europe since the late eighteenth century, John Connelly connects the stories of the region's diverse peoples, telling how, at a profound level, they have a shared understanding of the past. An ancient history of invasion and migration made the region into a cultural landscape of extraordinary variety, a patchwork in which Slovaks, Bosnians, and countless others live shoulder to shoulder and where calls for national autonomy often have had bloody effects among the interwoven ethnicities. Connelly traces the rise of nationalism in Polish, Austro-Hungarian, and Ottoman lands; the creation of new states after the First World War and their later absorption by the Nazi Reich and the Soviet Bloc; the reemergence of democracy and separatist movements after the collapse of communism; and the recent surge of populist politics throughout the region. Because of this common experience of upheaval, East Europeans are people with an acute feeling for the precariousness of history: they know that nations are not eternal, but come and go; sometimes they disappear. From Peoples into Nations tells their story.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N544EAAAQBAJ&dq=History+of+Transylvania,+Vol.+3&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Seven Last Words From The Cross","description":"In Cross-Shattered Christ, theologian Stanley Hauerwas offers a moving reflection on Jesus's final words from the cross.

A huge U.S. flotilla of 800 ships carrying 162,000 men was about to attempt to smash into the outer defenses of the Japanese Empire. Their target was the Marianas Island group, which included Saipan, home to an important Japanese base and a large population of Japanese civilians, and Guam, the first American territory captured in the aftermath of Pearl Harbor. During the next eight weeks, tens of thousands of men, hundreds of airplanes, and dozens of major warships were locked in mortal combat. When it was over, 60,000 Japanese ground troops and most of the carrier air power of the Imperial Navy were annihilated; Japan's leader, Tojo, was thrown out of office in disgrace; and the newly captured enemy airfields were being transformed into launching bases for the B-29s that would carry the conventional and, later, atomic bombs to Japan, turning the land of the Rising Sun into a charred cinder.

Filled with never-before-published revelations, Queen Elizabeth II: A Woman Who Is Not Amused is a story of adultery, passion, jealousy, and mental cruelty, as lived by the Royal Family in Buckingham Palace. Readers will learn about Elizabeth's extraordinary reaction after being crowned Queen. A dramatic change came over her: convinced that she had to sacrifice herself for her people, she banned Philip from the marital bed for several years, committing herself then to a lifelong marriage to the throne. The book also unveils the extraordinary amoral life of the Queen's husband, Prince Philip, detailing his many adulterous affairs. The darkest secret of Britain's royal family is revealed: the long, passionate love affair between Philip and Princess Alexandria, Elizabeth's own younger cousin, an affair that broke Elizabeth's heart. It tells, too, of Elizabeth's one extramarital romance with a courtier she came to love, and the warning she was given to end the affair. In addition, Queen Elizabeth II describes the breakdown of the marriages of Charles and Diana, and Andrew and Fergie, as never before. It reveals that Elizabeth and Philip fought to hold together Charles and Di's marriage and details the extraordinary lengths to which senior palace courtiers went to get rid of the \\"wretched\\" Fergie because she wasn't \\"royal enough.\\".. and the punishment the palace has decreed on Diana for walking out on Charles. The lifestyle Elizabeth enjoys as the greatest living monarch in thewestern world is also examined.

What is unique about Christian colleges? What is required to sustain them? How do they maintain their bearing in the tumultuous intellectual seas of the twenty-first century?

You've seen him on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart offering up his trademark angry observational humor on everything from politics to pop culture. You've seen his energetic stand-up performances on HBO, Comedy Central, and in venues across the globe. Now, for the first time, Lewis Black translates his volcanic eruptions into book form in Nothing's Sacred, a collection of rants against stupidity and authority, which oftentimes go hand in hand. With subversive wit and intellectual honesty, Lewis examines the events of his life that shaped his antiauthoritarian point of view and developed his comedic perspective. Growing up in 1950s suburbia when father knew best and there was a sitcom to prove it, he began to regard authority with a jaundiced eye at an early age. And as that sentiment grew stronger with each passing year, so did his ability to hone in on the absurd. True to form, he puts common sense above ideology and distills hilarious, biting commentary on all things politically and culturally relevant. \\"No one is safe from Lewis Black's comic missiles.\\" (New York Times) You have been warned....","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=F_3x_azTqfAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rhetorical Choices: A Reader for Writers (Penguin Academics Series) (2nd Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Infinity Beach","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Dimensional Management: A Comprehensive Introduction","description":"A complete treatise on the subject of dimensional management, this book is designed to provide the reader with a comprehensive systems approach to all facets of dimension and tolerance development, analysis, inspection and documentation.

When General Stanley McChrystal took command of the Joint Special Operations Task Force in 2004, he quickly realized that conventional military tactics were failing. Al Qaeda in Iraq was a decentralized network that could move quickly, strike ruthlessly, then seemingly vanish into the local population. The allied forces had a huge advantage in numbers, equipment, and training but none of that seemed to matter. To defeat Al Qaeda, they would have to combine the power of the world s mightiest military with the agility of the world s most fearsome terrorist network. They would have to become a \\"team of teams\\" faster, flatter, and more flexible than ever. In Team of Teams, McChrystal and his colleagues show how the challenges they faced in Iraq can be rel-evant to countless businesses, nonprofits, and or-ganizations today. In periods of unprecedented crisis, leaders need practical management practices that can scale to thousands of people and fast. By giving small groups the freedom to experiment and share what they learn across the entire organiza-tion, teams can respond more quickly, communicate more freely, and make better and faster decisions. Drawing on compelling examples from NASA to hospital emergency rooms Team of Teams makes the case for merging the power of a large corporation with the agility of a small team to transform any organization.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wW4CDAAAQBAJ&dq=Teams&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Journey Back: A Survivors Guide to Leukemia","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6-hAxR3jjfEC&dq=The+Journey+Back:+A+Survivors+Guide+to+Leukemia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Woman From Sarajevo","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Kk5vPwAACAAJ&dq=The+Woman+From+Sarajevo&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"London: The Photographic Atlas (Millennium Mapping Company)","description":"If you live anywhere in England, you should already feel right at home within this book.

He then compares and contrasts Eastern values with those present in Western societies. Written in English and first published in 1905, this classic introduction to Japan's samurai culture has been a best-seller for decades. Focus on Asian Studies says it is \\"a must for an understanding of the soul of Japan.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nC0SBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Loveplay (Silhouette Desire #289)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K2LhAAAACAAJ&dq=Loveplay+(Silhouette+Desire&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hardy and Hardie, past and present","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_nNztAEACAAJ&dq=Hardy+and+Hardie,+past+and+present&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sex in the Christian Marriage","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Outfit: A Cowboy's Primer","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Wars of Frederick the Great (Modern Wars in Perspective)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Cranium: The Data Head Book of Outrageous Fun!: Search it, Find it, Solve it!

The wives and consorts of these powerful men have generally been viewed as decorative attendants, while common women were presumed to have had no power or consequence. Reassessing the conventional definition of power that has shaped such portrayals, Women and Power in the Middle Ages reveals the varied manifestations of female power in the medieval household and community--from the cultural power wielded by the wives of Venetian patriarchs to the economic power of English peasant women and the religious power of female saints. Among the specific topics addresses are Griselda's manipulation of silence as power in Chaucer's \\"The Clerk's Tale\\"; the extensive networks of influence devised by Lady Honor Lisle; and the role of medieval women book owners as arbiters of lay piety and ambassadors of culture. In every case, the essays seek to transcend simple polarities of public and private, male and female, in order to provide a more realistic analysis of the workings of power in feudal society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=A_J3qDFLwqgC&dq=WOMEN+IN+THE+MIDDLE+AGES&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Going Wrong (Paragon Large Print)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Software Tools in Pascal","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Wild Cats: Lynx Bobcats Mountain Lions","description":"A look at wild cats discusses their natural history, their relationship with humans, and their present and future survival status in the face of encroaching civilization","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kHaUMLXhDWkC&dq=Wild+Cats:+Lynx+Bobcats+Mountain+Lions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Power Graphics Using Turbo C","description":"This hands-on reference will help programmers take full advantage of the many advnaced graphics capabilities of C++.

In this account of his time there, he pays tribute to the hospitality, loyalty, courage and endurance of the people, describes their impressive reed houses, the waterways and lakes teeming with wildlife, the herding of buffalo and hunting of wild boar, moments of tragedy and moments of pure comedy, all in vivid, engaging detail. Untouched by the modern world until recently, these independent people, their way of life and their surroundings suffered widespread destruction under the regime of Saddam Hussein.

I make no apology for my irrepressible sense of humour which kept me going when the traveling got tough. I had no idea there was a writer in me only to realise that we are limited in a common strand of humanity so, I think a lot of people would appreciate exactly where I am coming from. It is surprising how vulnerable you become, taking part in other cultures, having to see everything from a different perspectives. You start with the idea that there is only one constant in all of this: yourself: 'Yes, but exactly who am I?' On this journey of discovery I have met many people, some amaziing: some out to take advantage of you, wherever you are in theworld, I guess you will confront such a wide range of human characteristics. Throughout I have been struck by the mobility of those who have so little by way of comfort in their lives yet are generous to a fault. It certainly makes you realise, just how fortunate we are in the west. Part of my travels are given to describe the sights and sounds that characterise different pictures, but the emphasis has always been on meeting and interacting with the wealth of people - not their monetary wealth, but the composite that makes up the human spirit. If some of the culinary delights made me ill and reduced me to a skeletal proportions the human experience has undoubtedly made me grow in stature.

They deliver exceptional torque and abundant horsepower, are in ample supply, and have a massive range of aftermarket parts available. Some of the LS engines produce about 1 horsepower per cubic inch in stock form--that's serious performance. One of the most common ways to produce even more horsepower is through forced air induction--supercharging or turbocharging. Right-sized superchargers and turbochargers and relatively easy tuning have grown to make supercharging or turbocharging an LS-powered vehicle a comparatively simple yet highly effective method of generating a dramatic increase in power. In the revised edition of How to Supercharge & Turbocharge GM LS-Series Engines, supercharger and turbocharger design and operation are covered in detail, so the reader has a solid understanding of each system and can select the best system for his or her budget, engine, and application. The attributes of Roots-type and centrifugal-type superchargers as well as turbochargers are extensively discussed to establish a solid base of knowledge. Benefits and drawbacks of each system as well as the impact of systems on the vehicle are explained. Also covered in detail are the installation challenges, necessary tools, and the time required to do the job. Once the system has been installed, the book covers tuning, maintenance, and how to avoid detonation so the engine stays healthy. Cathedral, square, and D-shaped port design heads are explained in terms of performance, as well as strength and reliability of the rotating assembly, block, and other components. Finally, Kluczyk explains how to adjust the electronic management system to accommodate a supercharger or turbocharger. How to Supercharge and Turbocharge GM LS-Series Engines is the only book on the market specifically dedicated to forced air induction for LS-series engines. It provides exceptional guidance on the wide range of systems and kits available for arguably the most popular modern V-8 on the market today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-KOhDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ring Master","description":"Contrary to popular belief, there is no work-life balance.

Heavy snowfall and high winds associated with storms often referred to as \\"nor'easters\\" can maroon millions of people at home or in transit, severely disrupt human services and commerce, and endanger the lives of those who venture out doors. Paul J. Kocin and Louis W. Uccellini provide answers to questions of how these important storms develop, what factors delineate snow/no snow situations, and what weather patterns provide clues that foretell such events. The book provides a comprehensive overview of this phenomenon from historical, climatological, and dynamical perspectives, using many illustrations, maps, tables, and color schematics. The introduction describes the major effects of such storms, the complex physical interactions that fuel their development, and the problems they present to forecasters trying to predict their fickle behavior and progress. A review of the great northeastern storms of the past three centuries follows, along with a climatology of the heavy snow events over a 30-year period. Descriptions of 20 major storms supply a framework for understanding the dynamical and thermodynamical processes that contribute to heavy snowfall. A summary of the physical processes that contribute to the storms concludes with issues that remain to be resolved. The case-study approach presents a great deal of material contained in hundreds of synoptic analyses in a well-organized and useful layout, allowing case-by-case comparisons of common features and differences. Extensive tables, diagrams, and photographs show weather patterns at the surface and aloft, emphasizing cyclone tracks and deepening rates, the contributions of cold surface anticyclones, cold-air damming and coastal frontogenesis, upper-level processes, jet streak circulations, satellite imagery, and three-dimensional air flow. It is hoped that this book will provide a foundation for researchers and students interested in investigating the processes that interact to produce major winter storms. The weather patterns described here provide a first step in the generation of conceptual models, and also serve as an easily referenced guide for forecasters concerned with predicting heavy snowfalls along the northeastern coast of the United States.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uKXCDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"AN Independent Woman (Signet Regency Romance)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Reduced Gradient Bubble Model in Depth","description":"The intent of this book is to present a working view of the reduced gradient bubble model (RGBM), decompression mechanics, and applications to technical diving.

Through such means and methods, the written words of Hebrew Scripture have been extended since antiquity, and given new voices for new times. In this lucid and often poetic book, Michael Fishbane delineates the connections between biblical interpretation and Jewish religious thought. How can a canon be open to new meanings, given that it is believed to be immutable? Fishbane discusses the nature and rationale of this interpretative process in a series of studies on ancient Jewish speculative theology. Focusing on questions often pondered in Midrash, he shows how religious ideas are generated or justified by exegesis. He also explores the role exegesis plays in liturgy and ritual. A striking example is the transfer of speculative interpretations into meditation in prayer. Cultivation of the ability to perceive many implicit meanings in a text or religious practice can become a way of living--as Fishbane shows in explaining how such notions as joy or spiritual meditations on death can be idealized and the ideal transmitted through theological interpretation. The Exegetical Imagination is a collection of interrelated essays that together offer new and profound understanding of scriptural interpretation and its central role in Judaism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dqlJEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Exegetical+Imagination:+On+Jewish+Thought+and+Theology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stage door,: A play in three acts,","description":"THE STORY: The play concerns a group of young girls who have come to New York to study acting and find jobs.

The authors of Frommer's France's Best-Loved Driving Tours have assembled the top twenty-five driving itineraries in France, each designed to exhibit a different aspect of the country. A tour around Normandy explores the legacy of D-Day with visits to D-Day landing sites, such as Pegasus Bridge and the Normandy Beaches, before moving onto resort of Cl?cy, an area full of mountains and lakes. Another Northern tour showcases British-influenced Brittany, with visits to the ruins of a Welsh abbey and the forest of Huelgoat, where ancient Celtic stones still stand. In the Dordogne area of Southwest France, prehistoric sites are revealed. A drive through the area takes you prehistoric limestone cave-dwellings, and Lascaux II, site of one the most famous Cro-Magnon cave paintings in the world. Farther on, you'll come upon a subterranean river that you can explore by boat and pathway. Further down South, the authors have put together a fascinating drive through the Cote d'Azur. Feeling rich? You can gamble to your heart's content in Monaco. Then for a change of pace, take a stroll through the Parc National de Mercantour, which is home to birds, butterflies and clusters of vivid alpine wildflowers. Majestic mountains, beautiful towns and Alpine ski resorts are just some of the features of a drive through the French Alps. Visit the mountain-rimmed Lake D'Annecy, ski the thrilling slopes of Val d'Isere and taste fresh Reblochon- a traditional goat cheese- on one of the farms outside La Clusaz.

In the course of more than two decades, Galen Arvad's tiny band of outlaw Mystics has grown into a nation of secret clans, despite fierce persecution by the Pir theocracy and the dragons that have enslaved humanity. On another world, the faery Dwynwyn saved her people by raising an army of the dead, but now none of the corpses can rest...and the sheer number of their tormented legions threatens the faery kingdoms. While on the third world, the tyrannical King Mimic's domination is threatened by a warrior maiden whose thirst for conquest exceeds his own. Yet through the magic of the dreams that link their worlds, a new wind blows, beckoning each of them into unknown lands with the promise of salvation, sanctuary, and power. For Galen's war-weary son, Caelith, the slender hope takes the form of a stranger's vow to lead him and his people to the sanctuary of a lost empire-the legendary ancestral home of the Mystics. Dwynwyn seeks salvation of her people through a small fellowship of Fae who must journey to a distant land of unquenchable horror-where their truth can bring peace to the living and the dead. As for the wizard-goblin Thux, newly and unwillingly appointed Technomancer to King Mimic, his journey to the Ogre citadel may bring him to the height of power and danger-if his own allies do not kill him first.

In one blood-soaked, furious week of fighting, from December 20 to December 27, 1943, the 1st Canadian Infantry Division took the town of Ortona, Italy, from elite German paratroopers ordered to hold the medieval port town at all costs. Infantrymen serving in the Loyal Edmonton Regiment and the Seaforth Highlanders, supported by tankers of the Three Rivers Regiment, moved from house to house in hand-to-hand combat amid heavy shelling and wrested the town from the grip of the fierce German defenders. Getting into Ortona had been a battle of its own. Ortona, the pearl of the Adriatic, stands on a promontory impregnable from three sides, with seacliffs on the north and east, and a deep ravine on the west. The Canadian infantrymen, drawn from virtually every corner of Canada, attacked from the south under the command of Major-General Chris Vokes, fighting across narrow gullies, mud-choked vineyards and olive groves, into the narrow streets of Ortona itself. When the vicious battle was over, 2605 Canadians were dead or wounded.

Whitaker is a comparative historical researcher on the politics of environmental degradation and sustainability. Toward A Bioregional State is his novel approach to development and to sustainability. He proposes that instead of sustainability being an issue of population scale, managerial economics, or technocratic planning, an overhaul of formal democratic institutions is required. This is because environmental degradation has more to do with the biased interactions of formal institutions and informal corruption. Because of corruption, we have environmental degradation. Current formal democratic institutions of states are forms of informal gatekeeping, and as such, intentionally maintain democracy as ecologically \\"out of sync\\". He argues that we are unable to reach sustainability without a host of additional ecological checks and balances. These ecological checks and balances would demote corrupt uses of formal institutions by removing capacities for gatekeeping against democratic feedback.

Khizr Khan s book can teach all of us what real American patriotism looks like.   The New York Times Book Review In fewer than three hundred words, Khizr Khan electrified viewers around the world when he took the stage at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. And when he offered to lend Donald Trump his own much-read and dog-eared pocket Constitution, his gesture perfectly encapsulated the feelings of millions. But who was that man, standing beside his wife, extolling the promises and virtues of the U.S. Constitution? In this urgent and timeless immigrant story, we learn that Khizr Khan has been many things. He was the oldest of ten children born to farmers in Pakistan, and a curious and thoughtful boy who listened rapt as his grandfather recited Rumi beneath the moonlight. He was a university student who read the Declaration of Independence and was awestruck by what might be possible in life. He was a hopeful suitor, awkwardly but earnestly trying to win the heart of a woman far out of his league. He was a brilliant and diligent young family man who worked two jobs to save enough money to put himself through Harvard Law School. He was a loving father who, having instilled in his children the ideals that brought him and his wife to America the sense of shared dignity and mutual responsibility tragically lost his son, an Army captain killed while protecting his base camp in Iraq. He was and is a patriot, and a fierce advocate for the rights, dignities, and values enshrined in the American system. An American Family shows us who Khizr Khan and millions of other American immigrants are, and why especially in these tumultuous times we must not be afraid to step forward for what we believe in when it matters most.

After exhausting his appeals, he evaded authorities by fleeing to Africa. He was finally captured in 1983 but his case was far from over. It would take another seven years for Dr. Branion to finally win his freedom and for those who prosecuted him to admit that he could not have committed the murder, and that they knew it all along. Acclaimed mystery writer Barbara D'Amato was drawn to this story two decades after the murder, as Dr. Branion languished in prison, ill and without hope. Her meticulous research repeatedly led her to one startling conclusion: that it was impossible for Donna Branion's murder to have unfolded the way the police alleged. In this award-winning account, D'Amato deftly explores the intriguing facts of this shocking case from the tragic blunders made by authorities to Branion's arrest, conviction, and years practicing medicine in Africa as a fugitive from justice. The result is a damning indictment of our criminal system and the vindication of an innocent man. The Doctor, The Murder, The Mystery by Barbara D'Amato won the Anthony and Agatha Awards for Best True Crime. She is also the author of the highly acclaimed Cat Marsala mysteries, including Hard Case and Hard Christmas.

Infamous stories are detailed of mailed fish and lost fingers, as well as countless examples of Emanuel s ruthless tactics and brazen vulgarities.

Good reading, good thinking, good living is what this book brings to the soul.b -- Joan D. Chittister from the introduction \\"Between Two Souls\\" presents a lovely, spiritually uplifting conversation in poetry between a gifted modern-day Roman Catholic nun and a nineteenth-century Zen monk. Offering an utterly unique entree into spiritual contemplation, this book pairs inspirational writing from two distinct but mutually enriching faith traditions, revealing the religious joy, wisdom, and all-embracing compassion that transcend temporal, cultural, and theological differences. Ry  kan (1758-1831) is one of Japanbs most-loved and most-renowned poets. After formal training at the Zen monastery of Ents  -ji, he refused offers to head his own temple and instead lived as a wandering monk in the snowy country around Mt. Kugami. Ry  kan wrote thousands of poems during his travels but never published a collection himself. For two years Mary Lou Kownacki, a Benedictine nun, used Ry  kanbs poetry for devotions. Each morning she would read one of his poems, meditate on it, and then respond with one of her own. \\"Between Two Souls\\" is the result of this poetic interplay. Over the course of these pages, Kownacki and Ry  kanbs separate voices blend and become one, ultimately drawing the reader into their soulful dialogue on the eternal. Like echoes across time, these beautiful poems bring new depth andinsight to truths that mark the meaning of the ages. Along the way they consider the smallest things in life, using them to gently warn us not to miss the bigger truths found in each moment, not to squander our souls. Complemented with an inspiring introduction by Joan D. Chittister and elegant calligraphy by Eri Takase, this volume provides a lifetime of devotional insights.

Chicago Tribune Born to a poor couple who were tenant farmers on a plantation in Mississippi, Anne Moody lived through some of the most dangerous days of the pre-civil rights era in the South. The week before she began high school came the news of Emmet Till s lynching. Before then, she had  known the fear of hunger, hell, and the Devil. But now there was . . . the fear of being killed just because I was black.  In that moment was born the passion for freedom and justice that would change her life. A straight-A student who realized her dream of going to college when she won a basketball scholarship, she finally dared to join the NAACP in her junior year. Through the NAACP and later through CORE and SNCC, she experienced firsthand the demonstrations and sit-ins that were the mainstay of the civil rights movement and the arrests and jailings, the shotguns, fire hoses, police dogs, billy clubs, and deadly force that were used to destroy it.

Space Stations: The Art, Science, and Reality of Working in Space takes the reader deep into the heart of past, present, and future space stations, both real ones and those dreamed up in popular culture. This lavishly illustrated book explains the development of space stations from the earliest fictional visions through historical and current programs--including Skylab, Mir, and the International Space Station--and on to the dawning possibilities of large-scale space colonization. Engrossing narrative and striking images explore not only the spacecraft themselves but also how humans experience life aboard them, addressing everything from the development of efficient meal preparation methods to experiments in space-based botany. The book examines cutting-edge developments in government and commercial space stations, including NASA's Deep Space Habitats, the Russian Orbital Technologies Commercial Space Station, and China's Tiangong program. Throughout, Space Stations also charts the fascinating depiction of space stations in popular culture, whether in the form of children's toys, comic-book spacecraft, settings in science-fiction novels, or the backdrop to TV series and Hollywood movies. Space Stations is a beautiful and captivating history of the idea and the reality of the space station from the nineteenth century to the present day.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Wx1xDwAAQBAJ&dq=SPACE+STATIONS&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Spelt Cookbook: Cooking with Nature's Grain for Life","description":"The story of spelt goes back over 9,000 years, but only recently has this marvelous little grain s unique nutlike taste been rediscovered.

David Kennedy  There is so much filth about the camp that it is terrible trying to live here.\\" - Michigan cavalryman John RansomNotorious, a hell on earth, a cesspool, a death camp, and infamous have all been used by prisoners and critics to describe Andersonville Prison, constructed to house Union prisoners of war in 1864, and all descriptions apply. Located in Andersonville, Georgia and known colloquially as Camp Sumter, Andersonville only served as a prison camp for 14 months, but during that time 45,000 Union soldiers suffered there, and nearly 13,000 died. Victims found at the end of the war who had been held at Camp Sumter resembled victims of Auschwitz, starving and left to die with no regard for human life.Rumors about the horrors of Andersonville were making the rounds by the summer of 1864, and they were bad enough that during the Atlanta campaign, Union General William Tecumseh Sherman gave orders for a cavalry raid attempting to liberate the prisoners there. The Union cavalry were repulsed by Southern militia and cavalry at that point, and even after Sherman took Atlanta, the retreating Confederates moved under the assumption that the Union would target Andersonville yet again. Before the end of the war, the Confederates were moving prisoners from Andersonville to Camp Lawton, but by then, Andersonville was already synonymous with horror. Unable to supply its own armies, the Confederates had inadequately supplied the prison and its thousands of Union prisoners, leaving over 25% of the prisoners to die of starvation and disease. All told, Andersonville accounted for 40% of the deaths of all Union prisoners in the South, and the causes of death included malnutrition, disease, poor sanitation, overcrowding, and exposure to inclement weather. In fact, Andersonville infuriated the North so much that Henry Wirz, the man in charge of Andersonville, was the only Confederate executed after the war. Before the war, Wirz was a Swiss doctor who had practiced medicine in Kentucky, but while some Southern scholars continue to believe he was simply a victim of circumstance, plenty of evidence suggests his actions were far more insidious and deadly. As the debate over Wirz's fate suggests, one lingering argument in the analysis of Andersonville is whether the abuse and starvation of prisoners was a tragic circumstance of wartime conditions and poverty in the South or if the mistreatment was purposeful and intended. Most scholarship supports the latter point of view, and for the most part, the major dissenting views come from Southern writers and historians who espouse the  Lost Cause.  There were articles of war and specific rules on how to treat prisoners on both sides, but by any measurement, humane treatment was all but nonexistent at Andersonville. Andersonville Prison: The History of the Civil War's Most Notorious Prison Camp chronicles the history of the Civil War's most infamous prison. Along with pictures of important people, places, and events, you will learn about Andersonville like never before, in no time at all.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FocbrgEACAAJ&dq=Prison+Camps+of+the+Civil+War+(Civil+War+(Management+Concepts))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Notable Caribbeans and Caribbean Americans: A Biographical Dictionary","description":"Caribbeans and Caribbean Americans are celebrated in the first major biographical dictionary devoted exclusively to their contributions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NLPrMMKmynwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pet Owner's Guide to the Greyhound","description":"The Pet Owner's Guide series, including new titles, now comprises 35 books on dog breeds or training and 16 titles on other animals.

Candace Spigelman examines how merging personal and scholarly worldviews produces useful contradictions and contributes to a more a complex understanding in academic writing. This rhetorical move allows for greater insights than the reading or writing of experiential or academic modes separately does. Personally Speaking foregrounds the semi-fictitious nature of personal stories and the rhetorical possibilities of evidence as Spigelman provides strategies for writing instructors who want to teach personal academic argument while supplying practical mechanisms for evaluating experiential claims. The volume seeks to complicate and intensify disciplinary debates about how compositionists should write for publication and what kinds of writing should be taught to composition students. Spigelman not only supplies evidence as to why the personal can count as evidence but also relates how to use it effectively by including student samples that reflect particular features of personal writing. Finally, she lays the groundwork to move narrative from its current site as confessional writing to the domain of academic discourse.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0hPbBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shotokan Karate Kata Vol. 1","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Spectrum Spelling, Grade 5 (McGraw-Hill Learning Materials Spectrum)","description":"This series links spelling to reading and writing.

Colwell, of the famous Stock-Exchange house of Wilson & Graves, that he had done his full duty by his friend Harry Hunt. He was a director in a half score of companies financial d butantes which his firm had  brought out  and over whose stock-market destinies he presided. His partners left a great deal to him, and even the clerks in the office ungrudgingly acknowledged that Mr. Colwell was  the hardest worked man in the place, barring none  an admission that means much to those who know it is always the downtrodden clerks who do all the work and their employers who take all the profit and credit. Possibly the important young men who did all the work in Wilson & Graves  office bore witness to Mr. Colwell s industry so cheerfully, because Mr. Colwell was ever inquiring, very courteously, and, above all, sympathetically, into the amount of work each man had to perform, and suggesting, the next moment, that the laborious amount in question was indisputably excessive. Also, it was he who raised salaries; wherefore he was the most charming as well as the busiest man there. Of his partners, John G. Wilson was a consumptive, forever going from one health resort to another, devoting his millions to the purchase of railroad tickets in the hope of out-racing Death. George B. Graves was a dyspeptic, nervous, irritable, and, to boot, penurious; a man whose chief recommendation at the time Wilson formed the firm had been his cheerful willingness to do all the dirty work. Frederick R. Denton was busy in the  Board Room  the Stock Exchange all day, executing orders, keeping watch over the market behavior of the stocks with which the firm was identified, and from time to time hearing things not meant for his ears, being the truth regarding Wilson & Graves. But Fullerton F. Colwell had to do everything in the stock market and in the office. He conducted the manipulation of the Wilson & Graves stocks, took charge of the un-nefarious part of the numerous pools formed by the firm s customers Mr. Graves attending to the other details and had a hand in the actual management of various corporations. Also, he conferred with a dozen people daily chiefly  big people,  in Wall Street parlance who were about to  put through  stock-market  deals.  He had devoted his time, which was worth thousands, and his brain, which was worth millions, to disentangling his careless friend s affairs, and when it was all over and every claim adjusted, and he had refused the executor s fees to which he was entitled, it was found that poor Harry Hunt s estate not only was free from debt, but consisted of $38,000 in cash, deposited in the Trolleyman s Trust Company, subject to Mrs. Hunt s order, and drawing interest at the rate of 2? per cent per annum. He had done his work wonderfully well, and, in addition to the cash, the widow owned an unencumbered house Harry had given her in his lifetime.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=i5JkDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Those Episkopols","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Ultimate Turkey Fryer Cookbook: Plus 25 Super Sauces","description":"The debut cookbook by the creator of the wildly popular blog Damn Delicious proves that quick and easy doesn't have to mean boring.Blogger Chungah Rhee has attracted millions of devoted fans with recipes that are undeniable 'keepers'-each one so simple, so easy, and so flavor-packed, that you reach for them busy night after busy night.

The voice in these poems is that of an intelligent, privileged woman pushing forty who pictures herself \\"unmarried, childless, dogless, politically unemployable/due to certain experimental periods, and not having/significantly saved the world from anything more than/my face without makeup.\\" This is the voice of a woman of conscience who also embraces the marvelous, wild, transforming power of red high heels. In the title poem, Harrell juxtaposes \\"the click-click of high heels walking away\\" with South African mothers mourning their slain children, and \\"that long slab of granite in Washington, D.C.\\" with AIDS babies and elephants killed by poachers. Her touch is so deft she can move smoothly from pressing global issues to the minutia of a day, then back to those heels \\"stepping quickly, walking down the noises.\\" Tone varies considerably from poem to poem. Harrell does a campy send-up of yuppie jargon, and a \\"death check\\" that's filled with anger. She takes us along on a surreal blind date. She imagines a pet snapping turtle whose one rejoinder is \\"Fucking A.\\" Her humor depends as often on chic shtick as on wit. These poems are not high art, but they are biting and funny. The weakest poems try too hard, though, and stall at the level of clever cuteness, as in \\"Life with Mom\\" or \\"Religious Denomination: Consumer.\\" What's interesting is that her best work in this collection comes when she doesn't keep up the comic fadade. Two of the most powerful poems, \\"The Good Eyes of May\\" and \\"Teaching a Son Kisses,\\" rely instead on compelling, emotionally complex stories, distilled to their essence. -- From 'Independent Publisher'","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=02g_KajZWegC&dq=From+the+Girls+in+the+Galaxy:+Journeys+to+the+Center+of+Ourselves&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In the Midst of Life","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Arms Against Fury: Magnum Photographers in Afghanistan","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Ape, Primitive Man, and Child Essays in the History of Behavior (Classic Soviet Psychology)","description":"Available in this first-ever English translation, this study by the well-known Russian psychologists demonstrates that the behavior of modern man is a product of three different lines of development: evolutionary, historical, and ontogenetic.

The liberal's answer is that America has failed to live up to its full promise of inclusiveness and equality--likely the result of corporate greed and white male ruling elites. The mainstream conservative or libertarian reply points to the Warren Court, the 1960s, or a loss of Constitutional rectitude. Christopher Ferrara, in Liberty, the God That Failed, offers an entirely different answer. In a counter-narrative of unique power and scope, he unmasks the order promised as a sham; the liberty guaranteed, a chimera. In his telling, the false god of a new political order--Liberty--was born in thought long before America's founding, and gained increasing devotion as it slowly amassed power during the first century of the nation's existence. Today it reveals its full might, as we bear the weight of its oppressive decrees, and experience the emptiness of the secular order it imposes upon us. The secular state has constructed a \\"myth of religious violence\\" to mask its own violent origins and ongoing displays of force. Ferrara destroys this myth with a relentless uncovering of truths hidden by both liberal and conservative/libertarian accounts of what has gone wrong. In this brilliant retelling of American history and political life, the author asks us to open our eyes to harsh realities, but also to the possibilities for a rightly ordered society and the true liberty that can still be ours.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=L6lzmgEACAAJ&dq=the+god+that+failed&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"3ds max: Organic Modeling Training CD","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ilGsAAAACAAJ&dq=3ds+max:+Organic+Modeling+Training+CD&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Necrophilia Variations","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"An Introduction to Video and Audio Measurement, Third Edition","description":"What do we measure and why?

Bonnard, Vuillard, Roussel and Denis, the most distinguished of the Nabis, revolutionized the spirit of decorative techniques during one of the richest periods in the history of French painting. Influenced by Odilon Redon and Puvis de Chavanne, by popular imagery and Japanese etchings, this post-impressionist group was above all a close circle of friends who shared the same cultural background and interests. An increasing individualism in their art often threatened the group?s unity and although tied together by a common philosophy their work clearly diverged. This publication lets us compare and put into perspective the artists within this fascinating group.The works presented in this collection offer a palette of extraordinary poetic expressions: candid in Bonnard, ornamental and mysterious in Vuillard, gently dream-like in Denis, grim and almost in Vallotton, the author shares with us the lives of these artists to the very source of their creative gifts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VIvqAAAAMAAJ&dq=Nabis+(Schools&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flying 400","description":"PREFACE The chronology is concerned primarily with operations of the US Army Air Forces and its combat units between December 7, 1941 and September 15, 1945. It is designed as a companion reference to the seven-volume history of The Army Air Forces in World War 11, edited by Wesley Frank Craven and James Lea Cate. The research was a cooperative endeavor carried out in the United States Air Force historical archives by the Research Branch of the Albert F. Simpson Historical Research Center. Such an effort has demanded certain changes in established historical methodology, as well as some arbitrary rules for presentation of the results. After International and US events, entries are arranged geographically. They begin with events at Army Air Forces Headquarters in Washington then proceed eastward around the world, using the location of the headquarters of the numbered air forces as the basis for placement. For this reason, entries concerning the Ninth Air Force while operating in the Middle East follow Twelfth Air Force. When that headquarters moves to England in October 1943, the entries are shifted to follow Eighth Air Force. The entries end with those numbered air forces which remained in the Zone of the Interior, as well as units originally activated in the ZI, then designated for later movement overseas, such as Ninth and Tenth Air Forces. The ZI entries do not include Eighth and Twentieth Air Forces, which were established in the ZI with the original intent of placing them in those geographical locations with which they became historically identified. For these two units, original actions are shown either under AAF or in their intended geographic area of location. All times and dates used are those of the area under discussion. The entry \\"1/2 Jun\\" indicates that an event occurred during the night between the two given dates, while \\"1-2 Jun\\" indicates an action over a period of time. In dealing with people, again arbitrary decisions were implemented. For military men below the general officer or equivalent level, full grade and name were used. For general officers and those of equal grade in other US and foreign services, the complete rank (both that at the time first mentioned and the highest rank held prior to the end of the war) and name will be found in the index. Only an abbreviated rank (e.g., Gen or Adm) and last name are used in the text. The exception is where two general officers had the same last name; in such cases, the first name is also included. Similarly for civilian leaders, only the last name is used; full name and title are given in the index. Location of all towns, islands, etc., is also made in the index. In all cases, attempts were made to cite place names in use by the native population at the time of or immediately before the war. No names imposed by a conqueror are used. For example Pylos Bay, not Navarino Bay, is used. Further, as appropriate, native geographic terms are used: Shima for island in. Japanese island groups, See for lake in Germany. However, two exceptions were made. In cases in which the place became infamous because of the actions of the conquering power, that name is preferred-for example Auschwitz would be used rather than the Polish name of Oswiecim. Also, in larger international cities, such as Roma, Koln and Wien, the anglicized name is used. Where a village or hamlet was difficult to locate or where there were several such places with the same name in a general area, the coordinates are given in the index. In some cases, with no extant navigational aids of the attacking force, the best possible guess was made based upon all available evidence. In other instances, such as the bridge at Hay-ti-attacked so often by Tenth Air Force-- a logical guess could not be made. In these cases, a question mark is placed in brackets after the index entry. Accent marks, such as umlauts, were omitted.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WN86DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Varieties of Unbelief","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Hr3XAAAAMAAJ&dq=Varieties+of+Unbelief&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ponce Pilate (French Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Meet Abraham Lincoln (Step-up books)","description":"This warmly told biography of our sixteenth president is enriched by many authentic but seldom told anecdotes and complemented by bold color illustrations that capture the spirit of Lincoln and his era.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vBjL2owjnrsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Soldier","description":"\\"An authentic masterpiece.\\"   The North American Review.

One of the most powerful critiques of the retreat into fantasy was that of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, whose early career in Vienna has helped frame debates about ethical and aesthetic values in culture. In Wittgenstein's Vienna Revisited Allan Janik expands upon his work Wittgenstein's Vienna (co-authored with Stephen Toulmin) to amplify a number of significant points concerning the genesis of Wittgenstein's thought, the nature of Viennese culture, and criticism of contemporary culture. Although Wittgenstein is the central figure in this volume, Janik places considerable emphasis on other influential figures, both Viennese and non-Viennese, in order to break down some of the persistent stereotypes about the philosopher and his surrounding culture, especially the myths of \\"carefree\\" Vienna and Wittgenstein the positivist. The persistence of these myths, in Janik's view, stems in part from the inability of many historians to differentiate past from present in the evaluation of intellectual currents. Janik reviews a number of figures overlooked in assessing Wittgenstein: Otto Weininger, Kraus, Schoenberg, Nietzsche, Wagner, Ibsen, Offenbach, and Georg Trakl. All of these, Janik demonstrates, are absolutely necessary to understand what was at stake in the debates on aestheticism and the critique of a modern culture. Wittgenstein's efforts to recognize the limits of thought and language and thus to be fair to science, religion, and art account for his place of honor among critical modernists. These essays elucidate Wittgenstein's perspective on our culture.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZyFWDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Distant Shore","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Making the Corps","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A dictionary of sea terms","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Western Maryland Trackside, with George M.

Many of the sources come from the period between 1400 and 1750, when more than 100,000 people - most of them women - were prosecuted for witchcraft in Europe and colonial America. During these years the prominent stereotype of the witch as an evil magician and servant of Satan emerged. Catholics and Protestants alike feared that the Devil and his human confederates were destroying Christian society. Including trial records, demonological treatises and sermons, literary texts, narratives of demonic possession, and artistic depiction of witches, the documents reveal how contemporaries from various periods have perceived alleged witches and their activities. Brian P. Levack shows how notions of witchcraft have changed over time and considers the connection between gender and witchcraft and the nature of the witch's perceived power. This second edition includes an extended section on the witch trials in England, Scotland and New England, fully revised and updated introductions to the sources to include the latest scholarship and a short bibliography at the end of each introduction to guide students in their further reading. The Sourcebook provides students of the history of witchcraft with a broad range of sources, many of which have been translated into English for the first time, with commentary and background by one of the leading scholars in the field.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Lj7LCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Angel Inside","description":"Presents the parable of a disillusioned young man who meets an old man in Italy, who introduces him to the life and art of Michelangelo, an encounter that teaches that following one's passion can lead to the work that one loves.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k0pDSMgewH8C&dq=The+Angel+Inside&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Romantic English Garden","description":"Victoria's Secret has collaborated with the well-known English garden-writer jane taylor to create this evocative celebration of romantic gardens.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BVMLkgEACAAJ&dq=The+Romantic+English+Garden&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Estimating for Interior Designers","description":"Offers guidelines and formulas for estimating materials and costs for paint, wallcoverings, carpeting, drapery, and other products and services","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zi5QAAAAMAAJ&dq=Estimating+for+Interior+Designers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Savannah (The Civil War Battle Series, Book 9)","description":"Cory Brannon, bitter at the failure of the Confederate Army at Chattanooga, takes part in a series of battles as the Army of Tennessee retreats slowly toward Atlanta ... by the end of August, Atlanta is lost ... and General Sherman's March to the Sea continues.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gWOc_Dw7PeIC&dq=Savannah+(The+Civil+War+Battle+Series,+Book+9)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Anthology for Creative Writers: A Garden of Forking Paths","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Sushi for Parties: Maki-Sushi and Nigiri-Sushi","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Flirt Coach","description":"How to Charm your Way to Friendship, Love and Professional Success.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i09MwtBex0IC&dq=Flirt+Coach&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Soul Mates and Other Eternal Enigmas","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Rules of Neighborhood Poker According to Hoyle","description":"Here's a chance to learn the 200 real rules of poker, including descriptions of the characters, the right food (pizza, cold cuts) and the wrong food to serve; betting strategies that keep the player from losing to much too early; dealing, talking; and the dos and don'ts of a minimal standard of behavior.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y8q3kSGtQs4C&dq=The+Rules+of+Neighborhood+Poker+According+to+Hoyle&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"World Class Brands","description":"A rulebook and practical catalogue for global branding featuring distinguished proven successes and failures.

Eros and Magic in the Renaissance challenges this view, providing an in-depth scholarly explanation of the workings of magic and showing that magic continues to exist in an altered form even today. Renaissance magic, according to Ioan Couliano, was a scientifically plausible attempt to manipulate individuals and groups based on a knowledge of motivations, particularly erotic motivations. Its key principle was that everyone (and in a sense everything) could be influenced by appeal to sexual desire. In addition, the magician relied on a profound knowledge of the art of memory to manipulate the imaginations of his subjects. In these respects, Couliano suggests, magic is the precursor of the modern psychological and sociological sciences, and the magician is the distant ancestor of the psychoanalyst and the advertising and publicity agent. In the course of his study, Couliano examines in detail the ideas of such writers as Giordano Bruno, Marsilio Ficino, and Pico della Mirandola and illuminates many aspects of Renaissance culture, including heresy, medicine, astrology, alchemy, courtly love, the influence of classical mythology, and even the role of fashion in clothing. Just as science gives the present age its ruling myth, so magic gave a ruling myth to the Renaissance. Because magic relied upon the use of images, and images were repressed and banned in the Reformation and subsequent history, magic was replaced by exact science and modern technology and eventually forgotten. Couliano's remarkable scholarship helps us to recover much of its original significance and will interest a wide audience in the humanities and social sciences.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DDVkNj97dMoC&dq=Eros+and+Magic+in+the+Renaissance+(Chicago+Original+Paperback)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"British Horror Cinema (British Popular Cinema)","description":"British Horror Cinema investigates a wealth of horror filmmaking in Britain, from early chillers like The Ghoul and Dark Eyes of London to acknowledged classics such as Peeping Tom and The Wicker Man.

Working within the social conventions of late Victorian London, the play's major themes are the triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage, and the resulting satire of Victorian ways. Contemporary reviews all praised the play's humor, though some were cautious about its explicit lack of social messages, while others foresaw the modern consensus that it was the culmination of Wilde's artistic career so far. Its high farce and witty dialogue have helped make The Importance of Being Earnest Wilde's most enduringly popular play. The successful opening night marked the climax of Wilde's career but also heralded his downfall. The Marquess of Queensberry, whose son Lord Alfred Douglas was Wilde's lover, planned to present the writer with a bouquet of rotten vegetables and disrupt the show. Wilde was tipped off and Queensberry was refused admission. Soon afterwards their feud came to a climax in court, where Wilde's homosexual double life was revealed to the Victorian public and he was eventually sentenced to imprisonment. His notoriety caused the play, despite its early success, to be closed after 86 performances. After his release, he published the play from exile in Paris, but he wrote no further comic or dramatic work.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GFNoAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Boshblobberbosh (Creative Editions)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Best of the Wine Country: A Witty, Opinionated and Remarkably Useful Guide to California's Vinelands","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Birth Partner: Everything You Need to Know to Help a Woman Through Childbirth, Second Edition","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Burning: The Unseen Trilogy, Book 1 (Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel crossover)","description":"As Buffy and Angel discover a link between their separate investigations into the disappearances of missing teenagers, rogue scientists discover how to open dimensional portals in Sunnydale, research that could have unexpected consequences.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=F2wnzAUXKWcC&dq=The+Burning:+The+Unseen+Trilogy,+Book+1+(Buffy+the+Vampire+Slayer+and+Angel+crossover)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Translating Truth: The Case for Essentially Literal Bible Translation","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Literacy's Beginnings: Supporting Young Readers and Writers (3rd Edition)","description":"The third edition of Literacy's Beginnings: Supporting Young Readers and Writers offers an integrated, literature-based approach to reading and writing instruction keyed to the typical developmental stages through which most children pass.

The story centers on Dan Roberts, a pilot who enters the Vietnam War with little idea of the actual realities of battle. As Roberts grows to understand the true nature of death and conflict, he finds himself questioning the war itself and the loyalties of his fellow sailors when he is assigned the investigation of the disappearance of a young man named Franklin. During the investigation he uncovers a series of duplicitous characters involved in drug dealings. He soon finds his life threatened by unknown forces, while he tries to overcome the dangers of war. The author contrasts Roberts' investigations with the battles he encounters as he simultaneously faces the overwhelming threat of air combat, the insidious plot of the drug ring and his own personal problems. While focusing on the interactions of the sailors with one another, the author introduces several diverse characterizations. Timothy Bryan and Bobby Thomas are two men close to Roberts but suspected of questionable motives and Peter O'Leary, a sympathetic friend, who is revealed to be responsible for Franklin's death. Ultimately, Roberts must overcome multiple betrayals. The core of The Spad Driver is the description of the complex world that the characters inhabit. The story focuses on the meaning of the Vietnam War through Roberts and the character of Major Nguyen Binh, a disillusioned North Vietnamese intelligence officer, and concludes with the President of the United States reacting to the harsh realities of war.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XvIUl4Q4YSUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The complete book of pitfalls; a victim's guide to repairs, maintenance, and repairing the maintenance","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LsncUlvyZkkC&dq=The+complete+book+of+pitfalls%3B+a+victim%27s+guide+to+repairs,+maintenance,+and+repairing+the+maintenance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Deck With a View: Vacation Sailing in the Caribbean","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1LNAAAAACAAJ&dq=Deck+With+a+View:+Vacation+Sailing+in+the+Caribbean&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Garden of Greek Verse, A","description":"Odes, hymns, and lyrics from many of Greece's most noted classical poets--including Homer, Hesiod, Sappho, Sophocles, and Euripides--are beautifully illustrated here with details of ancient Greek frescoes, vase paintings, and sculptures.

In a bitter instance of irony, the American Indian peoples conducting the ceremony dedicating the land to the tribe, the city of Salmon, and the nation?the Lemhi Shoshones, Sacajawea?s own people?had been removed from their homeland nearly a hundred years earlier and had yet to regain official federal recognition as a tribe. John W. W. Mann?s book at long last tells the remarkable and inspiring story of the Lemhi Shoshones, from their distant beginning to their present struggles. Mann offers an absorbing and richly detailed look at the life of Sacajawea?s people before their first contact with non-Natives, their encounter with the Lewis and Clark Expedition in the early nineteenth century, and their subsequent confinement to a reservation in northern Idaho near the town of Salmon. He follows the Lemhis from the liquidation of their reservation in 1907 to their forced union with the Shoshone-Bannock tribes of the Fort Hall Reservation to the south. He describes how for the past century, surrounded by more populous and powerful Native tribes, the Lemhis have fought to preserve their political, economic, and cultural integrity. His compelling and informative account should help to bring Sacajawea?s people out of the long shadow of history and restore them to their rightful place in the American story.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xNgHgZ-BHHsC&dq=Sacajawea%27s+People:+The+Lemhi+Shoshones+and+the+Salmon+River+Country&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Microsoft ASP.NET Coding Strategies with the Microsoft ASP.NET Team (Pro-Developer)","description":"Fully updated for ASP.NET MVC 3.

Once I was free; then I was captured and became a slave; but inside me, here and here, I am still a free woman.\\" During a period of four hundred years, European slave traders ferried some 12 million enslaved Africans across the Atlantic. In the Americas, teaching a slave to read and write was a criminal offense. When the last slaves gained their freedom in Brazil, barely a thousand of them were literate. Hardly any stories of the enslaved and transported Africans have survived. This novel is an attempt to recreate just one of those stories, one story of a possible 12 million or more.Lawrence Hill created another in The Book of Negroes (Someone Knows my Name in the U.S.) and, more recently, Yaa Gyasi has done the same in Homegoing. Ama occupies center stage throughout this novel. As the story opens, she is sixteen. Distant drums announce the death of her grandfather. Her family departs to attend the funeral, leaving her alone to tend her ailing baby brother. It is 1775. Asante has conquered its northern neighbor and exacted an annual tribute of 500 slaves. The ruler of Dagbon dispatches a raiding party into the lands of the neighboring Bekpokpam. They capture Ama. That night, her lover, Itsho, leads an attack on the raiders  camp. The rescue bid fails. Sent to collect water from a stream, Ama comes across Itsho s mangled corpse. For the rest of her life she will call upon his spirit in time of need. In Kumase, the Asante capital, Ama is given as a gift to the Queen-mother. When the adolescent monarch, Osei Kwame, conceives a passion for her, the regents dispatch her to the coast for sale to the Dutch at Elmina Castle. There the governor, Pieter de Bruyn, selects her as his concubine, dressing her in the elegant clothes of his late Dutch wife and instructing the obese chaplain to teach her to read and write English. De Bruyn plans to marry Ama and take her with him to Europe. He makes a last trip to the Dutch coastal outstations and returns infected with yellow fever. On his death, his successor rapes Ama and sends her back to the female dungeon. Traumatized, her mind goes blank. She comes to her senses in the canoe which takes her and other women out to the slave ship, The Love of Liberty. Before the ship leaves the coast of Africa, Ama instigates a slave rebellion. It fails and a brutal whipping leaves her blind in one eye. The ship is becalmed in mid-Atlantic. Then a fierce storm cripples it and drives it into the port of Salvador, capital of Brazil. Ama finds herself working in the fields and the mill on a sugar estate. She is absorbed into slave society and begins to adapt, learning Portuguese. Years pass. Ama is now totally blind. Clutching the cloth which is her only material link with Africa, she reminisces, dozes, falls asleep. A short epilogue brings the story up to date. The consequences of the slave trade and slavery are still with us. Brazilians of African descent remain entrenched in the lower reaches of society, enmeshed in poverty.  This is story telling on a grand scale,  writes Tony Sim?es da Silva.  In Ama, Herbstein creates a work of literature that celebrates the resilience of human beings while denouncing the inscrutable nature of their cruelty. By focusing on the brutalization of Ama's body, and on the psychological scars of her experiences, Herbstein dramatizes the collective trauma of slavery through the story of a single African woman. Ama echoes the views of writers, historians and philosophers of the African diaspora who have argued that the phenomenon of slavery is inextricable from the deepest foundations of contemporary western civilization.  Ama, a Story of the Atlantic Slave Trade, won the 2002 Commonwealth Writers Prize for the Best First Book.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=B4SZDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Theory of the Combination of Observations Least Subject to Errors: Part One, Part Two, Supplement (Classics in Applied Mathematics) (Pt. 1 & Pt. 2)","description":"The Current Index to Statistics (CIS) is a bibliographic index of publications in statistics, probability, and related fields.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JeNWAAAAMAAJ&dq=Theory+of+the+Combination+of+Observations+Least+Subject+to+Errors:+Part+One,+Part+Two,+Supplement+(Classics+in+Applied+Mathematics)+(Pt.+1&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"And they dance real slow in Jackson: A play in two acts","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Heart Peace","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Fodor's Costa Rica 2000","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xWMBzwEACAAJ&dq=Fodor%27s+Costa+Rica+2000&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Make Your Own Rag Doll: A Complete Handcrafting Kit","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jUeyAAAACAAJ&dq=Make+Your+Own+Rag+Doll:+A+Complete+Handcrafting+Kit&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The best of Mailway,: With answers we didn't print","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Service That Sells! the Art of Profitable Hospitality - 1995 publication.","description":"Inspired by the principles developed in the \\"Service Profit Chain,\\" Mike Hohnen takes you through each of the steps needed to create an outstanding service business. We live in a world of abundance - there is plenty of choice everywhere. And since 2008 we have experienced significant drops in demand as consumers became more careful. The result is a widening gap between supply and demand in virtually any category you can imagine. When that happens, many companies have a knee-jerk reaction, and the recipe is more or less always the same: initiate rigorous cost-cutting programmes, reduce staff and/or services, offer discounts in many forms, and increase advertising aggressively. This, however, is the equivalent of trying to steer and brake as your car begins to skid on black ice while going through a sharp curve. As you hit that declining demand curve, you need to perform what at first seems like a counter intuitive move: hold your price, increase your services, improve your quality, and narrow your focus in the market. In this book, you will not only understand why but also see how you can do that.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=A0gncvOpK6YC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Filthy Rich","description":"Marcy Mallowitz has just been dumped -- big time!

As such, it is the first major study of the development of child grammar in a Creole context. Mauritian Creole, in common with many Creole languages, emerged under extreme conditions and, as an isolating language, Mauritian Creole is typologically different from languages where syntax is predominantly tied to morphology. There is thus an opportunity to broaden perspectives on language acquisition since until now most work has focused on languages such as English, French, German, Italian. The analysis proceeds within the GB framework of generative grammar, and discussion emanates from psycholinguistic, sociolinguistic and theoretical linguistic viewpoints. The data also provide a means for evaluating Bickerton's theory, especially his conclusion that the acquisition of radical Creoles takes place with fewer errors than is the case for other languages, given that Creole languages are in harmony with the 'Bioprogram'.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yn9Q2kM2XOoC&dq=The+Acquisition+of+Mauritian+Creole+(Language+Acquisition+and+Language+Disorders)+(Vol+9)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"First Love, Second Chances: A Novel","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=H2eZpwAACAAJ&dq=First+Love,+Second+Chances:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Georgia O'keeffe - One Hundred Flowers","description":"The magnificent O'Keeffe flower paintings of the 20's and 30's reproduced to capture her incomparable use of color and delicacy of the brush.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zL1GPgAACAAJ&dq=Georgia+O%27keeffe+-+One+Hundred+Flowers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Undertaker's Gone Bananas","description":"Not even his closest friend, Lauri Geddes, believes the horror stories that sixteen-year-old Bobby Perkins tells about Mr. Hulka the mortician whom Bobby believes has killed his own wife.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kw8iss8x9kYC&dq=The+Undertaker%27s+Gone+Bananas&hl=&source=gbs_api"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:L},data(){return{visibleCount:6,booksData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visibleBooks(){return this.booksData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMoreBooks(){return this.visibleCount<this.booksData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},P=["disabled"],I={key:0},E={key:1};function q(s,i,t,u,r,n){const g=f("PoemCard");return e(),o("section",null,[i[1]||(i[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your Books 📚")])],-1)),a("div",M,[(e(!0),o(m,null,b(n.visibleBooks,(l,p)=>(e(),y(g,{key:p,poem:l},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),n.hasMoreBooks?(e(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:i[0]||(i[0]=(...l)=>n.loadMore&&n.loadMore(...l))},[r.isLoading?(e(),o("span",E,"Loading...")):(e(),o("span",I,"See more"))],8,P)):c("",!0)])}const x=d(B,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-44cf9f95"]]),J=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/58.md","filePath":"glossary/58.md"}'),D={name:"glossary/58.md"},R=Object.assign(D,{setup(s){return(i,t)=>(e(),o("div",null,[k(x)]))}});export{J as __pageData,R as default};
