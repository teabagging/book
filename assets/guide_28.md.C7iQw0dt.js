(Harlequin Temptation)","review":"I absolutely fell in love with both the hero and the heroine. Their story felt real, and they are both such well-rounded, fleshed out charcters. I wish this title was available on Kindle, so it would be easy to grab and reread. High praise, indeed, from someone like me who reads a book once and never wants to touch it again (there's just too much to read and not enough time in one lifetime).The book starts out with letters exchanged between an Army Ranger and a somewhat-annonymous pen-pal (she's the sister-in-law of his best friend, another officer who is deployed with him). Letters pop up sporadically in the book. This is set during the Gulf War, and it's not laden down with a lot of Army lingo or heavy war issues, but it has enough authenticity to show that the author really put time and care into her research. It was so good - I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Dear John... (Harlequin Temptation)","review":"It is one of my all time favourites.

It's true that you may think it's a little bit long, but it was necesary. Asimov had left some ideas opened in his previous books that he had to close. It was part of his magic."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"This was the last and easily the weakest of the books in the &quot;Foundation&quot; series that eventually included the &quot;Robot&quot; and &quot;Empire&quot; books as well. While I am a great admirer of Asimov's work and contributions to the genre, I was left wanting with this chapter.The book picks up where &quot;Foundation's Edge&quot; (one of the best books in the series) left off. One man had just decided all of humanity spanning every inhabited world in the galaxy (and there are several million at this point) should follow one course of evolution and wonders why he made that choice. He decides that he can only find his answer if he finds the mythical &quot;Earth,&quot; the planet where humanity supposedly originated.This is a shaky premise at best. Along the way we discover what happened to various &quot;Spacer&quot; worlds form the earlier books &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot; and the like. The few interesting moments take place on one such world call! ed &quot;Solaria&quot; where the population is kept under draconian control and robots serve the needs of the inhabitants.&quot;Foundation and Earth&quot; feels like a cheap tour of landmarks where you learn nothing more than you have wasted your time. There are some moments that shine as pure Asimov, but not many. This book was not worthy to close such a groundbreaking and entertaining series as thi"},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"(Spoiler Alert)Somewhere buried in Foundation and Earth is a good story, that never quite made it onto the pages. Easily the most annoying aspect, is Trevize and Bliss's constant, tiresome arguments. Now I actually like a good argument myself, but Trevize and Bliss's arguing wears thin real fast. After their 10th argument or so, I wanted to ask them, \\"So, how long have you two been married?\\". And the way Bliss keep's disrupting things and even threatens Trevize at one point, I would have put her off on the nearest planet in a heartbeat, with or without a breathable atmosphere.Anyhow, aspects of story are poorly developed and resolved. Like the Minister who lets them(and there high-tech ship) go, due to, get ready for it, a bad case of superstition. Bliss and Trevize argue some more.Or the Verbose Solarian that informs they he going to have to kill them, rather than simply do it. Not very genre savvy in the future I guess. Then the equally verbose and indecisive 'guardian' robots engage in all sorts of word play rather than simply arrest or incapacitate our heros. This chapter isnt helped by Bliss taking the time out to try to 'save' the robots, rather than simply disable them. If you have read the story this far, you;ll find her actions all the more irritating for it. Bliss and Trevize argue some more.On the dead planet, Trevize, noticing the danger the moss presents, orders Bliss to not open the airlock until he says so. Bliss, being petulant and overbearing as she (usually) is, demands there will be an explanation later. You can tell she wants one right this second, but Really? If shes given an order by the captain, you dont stop and stamp your feet and demand to know *why*, unless you Bliss then everything has to be a big discussion. The moss could have easily killed everyone on the ship, or even infected other worlds, but Bliss cannot grasp the concept of 'do' and don't argue, lives are a stake. After this, Bliss and Trevize argue some more.I also found myself wondering how on an airless world, that the reader was functional after all that time, AND somehow Pel was able to hear was it was saying. Or that Trez;s neuronic whips power cell would even be compatible with it in the first place.I liked the chapter about Alpha Centauri the best, but even there, the galaxy wants to kill our heroes, but someone just cant help keep there mouth's shut, and once again our heroes escape by the skin of their teeth, or something. What's interesting about this part, is the rationale given is the people of AC just want to be left alone in peace. Trevize himself confirms that rationale by suggesting the Foundation would be quite interested in acquiring the biotech and weather control techniques of the Alphans. He of course, never stops to consider if that was what those people wanted. After escaping from Alpha Centauri, Bliss and Trevize argue some more.Finding Earth itself was something of an anti-climax. Little or no description is given and for all the book was about finding Earth, Asimov barely gives us a paragraph about the home world itself. It was good to see Daneel again after all this time, 20k years, but he isn't given much page time, despite this being easily the best part of the story. Asimov then introduces us to the idea questionable notion that Fallom is the alien enemy within all along. While I generally share Trev's assessment of Solaria, and its people, I found the books conclusion on that note a bit a reach, for all that had occured to get us there. Another head scratcher, given how awesome the Far Stars computer system is, dont they have bio-metrics in the future? After all, since the ship was configured for him to pilot, you would think it would be able to tell Fallom was NOT an authorized user and simply ignore his efforts to control it. The ships computer seems to be even less secure than a Micro-soft OS. Maybe they were prime contractors for the ships software system? After finding Earth Bliss wanders off to explore the grounds in the moon-base, thus mercifully saving the reader from hearing anymore of her opinions.Contrived in parts, and too much filler bickering. I can see why Trevize does not like Bliss, even though he claims otherwise. I found myself dis-liking her and her preachy overbearing superiority hard to take as well. A good story, but dragged down by too much exposition, irritating and non-sympathetic characters, and a few too many contrivances\\\\deus-ex-machinas events to make it a really satisfying read."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"You will never guess what all this twenty thousand years fuss was about. Are you ready? Another Maginot line.I am disappointed too..."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"Golan Trevize looks for Earth. The novel picks up right after the end of Foundation's Edge. I found Foundation's Edge slightly confusing in that there was something effecting the minds of both the Foundation confederation and the minds of the Second Foundation, and wasn't completely sure if it was a Third Foundation or what. Foundation and Earth clears that up, well sort of. It is not a Hari Seldon originated organization, it is the planet Gaia, but calling it a Third Foundation could be used if you redefine The Foundation. It is hinted that there may be yet *another* group effecting events in the galaxy; the equivalent of a Fourth Foundation... or maybe a Zeroth Foundation. This is one of the slight, but exasperating aspects of this novel. In the Author's Note of Prelude to Foundation, Asimov wrote that he could and may add to the Foundation series and as for books after Foundation and Earth he could add \\"additional volumes - as many as I like\\"). In parts it feels like that, that Asimov is setting himself for additional volumes, rather than this being the definitive end to the Foundation series, as it now is. Another thing is that Asimov groups his Robot, Empire, and Foundation series in one all encompassing series. For whatever contradictions exist between the series, Asimov gives preference to his Robot series.Foundation and Earth takes us on a tour of seven different planets and the different habitations of each. Some have gone to the dogs, some are autocratic, and there's excitement on each one. Asimov has set up the galaxy in that are no other known intelligent non-human (or human-made) species. Sort of answers the famous questions on the lack of evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence: \\"where is everybody?\\". Well, Asimov's answer is: there isn't anybody else... well kinda, sorta... If you read the book you'll understand. Actually, even though there are these ambiguities on the universe here and there, Asimov does wrap up the Foundation series somewhat nicely (although you may not like it as it differs from the original Foundation series), as well as wrapping up his grouping of all of his series into one."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"After a strange (but still adequate) FOUNDATION'S EDGE, I read Foundation and Earth and was disappointed. By itself, the book was interesting (with the whole thing about the hermaphrodite), but as a Foundation book, it didn't fit. Maybe after thirtysomething years of not writing a Foundation book, Isaac Asimov couldn't really settle back into the original concept. Asimov's final Foundation book, FURTHER THE FOUNDATION, was a lot more like it, so I enjoyed that book much better."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"Title: Foundation and Earth by Isaac Asimov.Pages: 494.Time spent on the \\"to read\\" shelf: 3 years.Days spent reading it: 4 days.Why I read it: I started reading the Foundation series a few years ago. I made it through the first 4 books and this was the next book in the series (in order of copyright).Brief review:Let me start off by saying, I LOVED the first 3 Foundation books, especially the first one (simply called Foundation). Isaac Asimov creates interesting situations that his characters must resolve, and they usually do so with interesting insights. Asimov wrote the first 3 books as a series of short stories, and they were later compiled into what became the Foundation trilogy. I would highly recommend those to anyone who enjoys a truly unique story.Having said that, books 4 and 5 were different. Instead of being short stories, they were true novels. They stayed with the same characters the whole time. I personally think the characters are flat and boring. Asimov's strength is not characters but dilemmas. Unfortunately book 4 (Foundation's Edge) does not have enough dilemma in it, and almost turned me off from the rest of the series. I also really did not like how it ended. However, Foundation and Earth returned to Asimov writing more in short story format, even though he stays with the same characters, the story is revealed as they leapfrog from planet to planet in search of Earth.I will not give away the plot, but it would say it was a decent story. Not the best in the series, but not as disappointing as Foundation's Edge. The conclusion felt a little awkward and forced. Asimov did some strange things with this series as it progressed forward. I think he wanted to make it seem like his writings as a whole were more planned out and connected than he originally intended. In the end it seems gimmicky. I'm sure there are some Asimov fans who enjoy the connections, but I would not number myself among them.Overall, I would recommend this book to the fans of the Foundation series, but slugging through Foundation's Edge along with Foundation and Earth means reading nearly 1,000 pages of frankly sub-par Asimov. For reader's interested in something truly unique--check out Foundation, it really is superior. But realize that the first book (which is awesome) is the best it gets.Stars: 2 out of 5.Final Word: Flat."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"I have to start by saying, read Asimov's &quot;End of Eternity&quot;. It is by far his best SF work and may be the best SF novel I've ever read.I think a lot of the reviews have been unduly harsh on Foundation and Earth. I thought this book was engaging and had a pretty good end that has me excited to go read the robot and empire novels. Also, while the book really gave an end to the series in a meaningful way, it did leave open a possible future story that the Asimov estate could allow someone to write."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"I don't know how people can say that Asimov is slipping in this book. I thought it was great! It brings in lots of new planets, and some old ones, too. It finally explains just exactly why Golan Trevize chose Gaia over Psychohistory. It is a great way to end the series. The only thing is that it's written in a way that let's someone, maybe, write another book that could come after this one.The only bad thing about this book is the price and availability. I couldn't believe the price. Then I looked around, and couldn't believe other prices. This book sells for crazy amounts! And then I looked in my library. It had not one, not two, but three copies of this book. Lent out for free. So instead of me paying 19 bucks for a paperback book, I borrowed the hardcover for 3 weeks for free. If you want to be able to reread the book, don't worry: it doesn't get taken out of the library much. Seriously, consider saving yourself 19 bucks, and take a short trip to the library."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"Sorry, guys - bad news here.I am supposed to be an Asimov fan. Having read a lion's share of his most famous works I expected to see an inspirational ending to Foundation Series.However, I must admit that all four of his books written as supplement to original trilogy (that is two prequels and two sequels, including the one reviewed) pale sharply. Where 'The Foundation's Edge' could at least keep you on the edge of your seat (if not for disappointing ending), 'Foundation and Earth' is just a boring experience worth reading only if you are completely dedicated to finish the entire series and have lots of time to waste.Asimov gave a fair warning to its readers in the foreword by mentioning the challenges set by the publishers. Apparently, some people still judge books by its sheer size, not by the idea. Unfortunately, those \`some' included late Asimov himself.The book introduces not a single fresh idea, recycling his entire repertoire plus possessing some from classical SF found (see Solaria and Alpha chapters and compare them to some of the stories by Arthur Clark). To cup it all, almost half of the book is spent in seemingly endless repetitious debates between Trevise and Bliss (two main characters) around the Galactica future. I could almost forgive all that, yet another bad ending ruined it completely. Asimov managed in a matter of three pages to throw away his entire Foundation legacy and all good that was with it. We saw a hint of it in Foundation's Edge, but not to that extreme! The only explanation I can imagine in sudden introduction of Alien Worlds, is that publishers wanted to squeeze another two to three books out of poor man, and Asimov had nothing to do but to give in to their greed.If you did not read his classical works like short stories collection, the Foundation Trilogy, The Robot Trilogy, or End of Eternity - go ahead and read it right away. For the rest of us - move on to other writers. There are many grand masters of SF that are as good as Asimov (just to mention few in no particular order: Heinlein, Simmons, Herbert, Clark, Brin and many, many more)."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"Asimov fan for over 30yrs., and never been able to find this book!

THANX!!!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"Really, this concluding novel of the Foundation series seems to belittle the original books in the series by trying to tie the Robot Universe with the Foundation.The writing is excellent, and the book is really quite interesting when taken as a stand-alone work... but it wasn't the grand end to the \\"Foundation\\" series that I had been hoping for."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"This book by Isaac Asimov is fascinating in two ways--first, it is the last of the Foundation series; second, it is another link between two of the greatest series in science fiction, the Foundation series and the Robot series. As always with Asimov, there are the irritating things--his characters get talky, plot sometimes breaks down, and there is a certain discursive quality to his writing that does not always serve movement of the story well. However, by this point in his career, Asimov was capable at developing characters (and it shows here) and had otherwise grown greatly as an author. And, as ever, he was capable of developing big picture, galaxy-wide concepts that challenge the reader to think about things in a new way.The work begins with Golan Trevize having already made his fateful decision to impel the galaxy to move toward a major superorganism to be called Galaxia, with its model the planet-wide Gaia superorganism. In that, he turned his back on the vision of either the Foundation or the Second Foundation being the model, with Hari Seldon's vision being transcended by another. In that sense, this really is not a Foundation novel (maybe an anti-Foundation work?).However, he is troubled about his decision and wants to understand better his decision, be sure that it is the right one. So, he begins what might be called an Odyssey, along with his friend Pelorat and his friend, Bliss, a part of Gaia. That sets up an almost Socratic dialogue among the three as they move from planet to plant, trying to find answers--including the location of the mythical home planet of humanity, Earth. The discussions sometimes slow the forward movement of the novel, but they do elaborate the various views of where humanity and the galaxy ought to go.After revisiting some places that will be familiar to readers of the Robot series, the trio finally arrives on Earth, by then a dead planet. And they meet an old friend of every Asimov fan in a way that produces an upbeat ending and a resolution as to where humanity will go, with that character promising to be a guiding hand, working behind the scenes, to help produce that future."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"For anyone interested in the Foundation series, I felt that this was the least interesting of the series.

It's plot is like a spiral of connect the plannets through memory lane. Much too linear. It lacks the intrigue of the previous novels with the exception of the law few chapters. It was that intrigue which made the other novels work for me.The start of the story didn't seem to flow from from where the previous novel left off. The character development is most depressing. The repetitious nature of arguments between the main characters was annoying. It was tollerable at first but bickering grew very tiresome.One possitive thing about this novel is that I think the quality of the writting is better and the language more fluid, much on the par of the fouth book of the series if not a little better. It felt real. I just wish the character development was of equal quality.It's a must read if you've read the others of the series but lacking in and of itself. This novel ties up the alot of loose ends. Enough so that I find it a satisfying closure for the series while still leaving the imagination open to the future."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"This certainly ranks as one of the best of the Foundation novels. Asimov's writing style is much more mature than in the first three, and refinitions can be seen even since &quot;Foundation's Edge.&quot; Beginning with the seamless transition from it's predecessor, &quot;Foundation and Earth&quot; carries Trevize, Pelorat and Bliss across the galaxy, revealing more about Asimov's strange universe in one book than the previous four combined.The characters are also much more thoroughly explored than in any other Foundation book. Though Asimov never quite got the hang of realistic dialogue (the characters often seem to be reciting pre-composed, rehearsed speeches), he does manage to build a good deal of tension between characters. He also takes the corrageous step of making Golan Trevize, no longer a victim, into a much less likeable person than he appeared to be in &quot;Foundation's Edge.&quot;Ammusingly, Asimov constantly pats himself on the back with references to his &quot;Robot&quot; and &quot;Empire&quot; novels, giving the series a sense of closure and eventually tying together a good portion of his novels -- nearly five decades worth of writing. Nice work, Isaac. We miss you."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"This is one of Asimov's best works. If I had not read this one, probably would have never read anymore of his books. After reading Foundation and Earth I went back and read everything I could of his foundation and robot series. The ending was not quite finished, but I believe he attended to finish it with another book. If you really want to start reading Asimov, you should try this one first, you will love it. If you cannot find it try &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot;. You will want to read more of Asimov's science fiction."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"As I mentioned in my FOUNDATION'S EDGE review, these two are best enjoyed read as if one book. The search for Earth continues without missing a beat and leads to a return to two planets familiar to those familiar with the Robot novels, Aurora and Solaria. The mystery of the missing Solarians is solved. Also, a major thread from PRELUDE TO FOUNDATION is continued here.There's much less conflict between factions here, but the spacefarers do need to remain alert to possible treachery during their travels. A new character appears, one which obviously Asimov had plans for in future novels.There's a lot more philosophy in the later novels and much dialogue among the various characters as they voice their perception of events.Asimov remains the consummate story teller and while he came back to this series with a perspective and a perception he lacked in earlier novels, we have not so much a new direction as a logical development as we learn more of the over all nature of Isaac Asimov's galazy."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"I picked it up to finish the Foundation series; a good ending, I will maintain.

However, it does not contain either the First or Second Foundation, but concentrates on a trip by Trevise.Unfortunately, the stops on the trip are uninspired - unless you find conflicts with feral dogs and moss as interested as the tales of Hardin or Mallow. In fact, it's a bore...The only think worth reading is the last two chapters... I'd recommend doing at a library or bookstore if you must, rather than wasting your time with this title. However, I would have rather stopped reading at Foundation's End, because Asimov more or less reveals that both Foundations are completely meaningless.I would have given it 1 star, but it does tie in the Robot Series... but even this is done in a less interesting way than I would have imagined.Very disappointing - I wouldn't be surprised if the editors keep this one out of print."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"The final book in this epic series ties in all that Isaac Asimov has been writing about all these years, Mans struggle to understand himself and his actions.Golan Trevizes and freak child Bliss eventually find what Hari Seldon set humanity out to look for, Earth.It is not the world they expect to find. It is a cold and poisoned world and when they receive a signal from Earth's ancient sattelite, the Moon they go to investigate.A face from the past greets them and the whole Foundation series and I Robot series collide together for the ending with a chilling insight to the future of humanity and so finishing the greatest Sci Fi story ever, leaving you hanging for more."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"The first three books held my interest the whole way through.

But the sequels to the series do not - or cannot - measure up to the original. Maybe the story has been done and it is increasingly difficult to introduce new material.For the Series itself, the Mule and the location of the Second Foundation were welcome diversions. Then there is the entire drama of the robots and their universe. But at some point you have to say, &quot;enough is enough&quot;.The same boring characters that were in the previous work are back and boring as ever. I can put up with the lack of character development if there is a simultaneous introduction of new ideas but that is not the case here. Their journeys are boring, their findings are boring, the writing is boring. I started skipping pages to find something &quot;interesting&quot;. At times the writing is almost like that done by machines - as if word after word were mechanically produced on a &quot;need to be&quot; basis. Wish I could say something more positive but I can't."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"Asimov simply couldn't end the Foundation series at the Second Foundation, instead continuing with two less-than-mediocre books which not only despoiled the legacy of the first three books (rendering them terribly, terribly moot) but introduced a kind of hippy everyone-loves-everyone vision for the future. Besides the disappointing ending, Foundation and Earth is rather badly-written, not at all like the thrilling first three books, and even Foundation's Edge kept you going through till the end. This book, as well the various spin-offs written by other authors (e.g. Prelude to Foundation) definitely let down this otherwise spectacular series."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"Only Isaac Asimov could've comprehensively created a futuristic set of books dealing with humanity thousands of years from where we currently stand. These books are among the greatest books in science-fiction, along with other such books by both Old Masters and Cyberpunk Authors: &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, &quot;Puppet Masters&quot;, &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot;, &quot;Childhood's End&quot;, &quot;Snow Crash&quot;, &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;, &quot;Cyber Hunter&quot; and so forth."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"Oh Gods this book is amazing. The last one (Foundation's Edge), was pretty good, but this one is just amazing! The characters, the visual descriptions, the plot was just fantastic! Besides Foundation's Edge, the rest of the series was just horrid. I read the rest of them AFTER reading this book and there is no comparison. An excellent way to end a hellish series. Didn't like what happened to Earth though. But then again, almost everyone outside of StarTrek has a negative view about Earth's future."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"I thoughtFoundation's Edgewas vaguely depressing. This is worse. Increasingly there are levels of psychic control, and like the Aes Sedai of the never-ending Wheel of Time, those that think they are all-powerful find another above them with more power. But Asimov does all he can to exclude the possibility of a supernatural power that is above it all. Everything is always deeply materialistically and scientifically explainable. All events, whether by Gaians or 2nd Foundationers or robots- originally stem from something that humanity has created, or which has evolved through natural selection within humanity. Nothing is numinous, and beyond the thoughts and understanding of humanity. And ultimately, this creates a very depressing outlook of the world. Real life is more interesting. Real life is more exciting.It's annoying too, when the twist at the end of the previous novel, Foundation's Edge, turns out to be only in the protagonist's perception, and not actually reality. I feel cheated, and tricked. And then, when other mysteries are added on, I find finally that not all the mysteries are answered, and now never will be- indeed, major questions remain at the end of this book. This is a major mistake within the genre- creating castles that lack foundation.I remember now why I don't like Asimov. He shows us a place without hope. I don't like to be depressed after reading a book. I simply have to remember that Asimov's thoughts are divorced from reality."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"This book has too much of everything... except action.There isn't much of a story and it's way too long.There's a lot of endless talk about the same subjectsand lots more sex than any other Asimov book. Theother Foundation books were fine for all ages. This onehas way too much adult content. I think that 300 pagescould easily have been cut out. In fact, to get to thereal story, just skip to the last 40 pages. Boring.Long. It dishonors the enitre series."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"To start, I loved the first 4 books. But this was really bad. The characters were very unlikable. Golan was a child hating old grump and Bliss almost broke down in tears every time she stepped on a blade of grass. The same arguments over and over, no action and then he had to throw in a sex, like it's mandatory for the hero to sleep with at least one woman per planet visited or something. Yuck! This and _Prelude to Foundation_ should have never been written or at least cut down to a reasonable size. Each book could have dropped about 150 pages with absolutely no effect on the plot. If you really want to find out what happens, do the abridged version on tape and save yourself from this trash."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"It's hard for me to review an Asimov work without the overuse of superlatives. Isaac Asimov's Foundation and Earth is part of the Foundation series, which are among the first science fiction books I read and I rank them all as great works of sci-fi. Asimov brings to an astounding close the saga of the First and Second Foundations, with a great twist while leaving open the door to future expansion and exploration. He paints for the reader an excellent picture of how vast the universe is and how human civilization might appear after 12,000 years of space travel and colonization. Despite the incredible reach attained by man during that time, there are still mysteries and unexplored corners of the \\"civilized\\" galaxy, let alone the myriad galaxies beyond ours. Once you start this series, you will not want to put it down until you reach the conclusion, then you will want to go out and get Asimov's other works."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"Remember that this was not written this century but it's classic Asimov with all of the master's touches.With the exception of some dated language/phraseology this is as fresh as tomorrow's breakfast."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"If you liked the first foundation books, this one is a must. There are bo book stores in this, like in the where I used to live. It was great to find it at Amazon. This one is the continuing story of the foundation a bit further down the road. Isaac Asimov did well in this writing as with the others preceeding this one."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"This book, while a stand-alone adventure, also effectively links the Foundation story line with the Robot/Spacer novels. It reintroduces us to the intuitive Golan Trevize, bookish Janov Pelorat and the Gaian avatar Bliss. Trevize had been at a crossroad in the previous novel \\"Foundation's Edge\\" and chose one path for the human race to follow. Not fully convinced of the intuitive leap he had taken, he decides to take up an archaeological odyssey to find the birthplace of humanity - now shrouded in legend.During his search aboard the \\"Far Star\\", followed by Pelorat and Bliss, Trevize finds the earliest attempts at human colonization which are either abandoned or isolated from the rest of the galaxy. Each location gives only the vaguest clues as to where Earth may be. Trevize's search is mixed with frustration and desperate hope.When his search comes to an end, the reader is crestfallen when the ultimate fate of Earth is revealed. The search however takes a surprising turn which seals the link between the Foundation and the Spacers of antiquity.Why Trevize becomes convinced that he must find Earth is not explained in a satisfactory manner. However, when he takes up the search the reader is swept into the drama of finding the world - the pale blue dot as Sagan once put it - that we all take for granted. The main characters are entertaining, even though they tend towards the two dimensional. There is constant, intense discussion between Trevize and Bliss concerning the merits on individuality and collective consciousness. The most frightening encounter occurs on the abandoned world of Aurora, where Trevize is ambushed by an unlikely monster. The most entertaining encounter is when the crew of the \\"Far Star\\" meet the reclusive society living on Solaria and take on a fourth crewmember.Sexuality and gender are prominent points of discussion between the crew of the \\"Far Star\\" especially where the fourth crewmember is concerned. All in all the quest for Earth is an engrossing and entertaining read."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"Asimov's Foundations series is spectacular and one that should not be missed. It is stunning in its scope and highly original for its time. One of the best science fiction writers in not only my opinion, produced a stunning series.

Drags here and there but worth the time."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"Anyone who hasn't read about Hari Seldon and Psychohistory needs to. Though it's a fictional science in the book, I wouldn't be suprised if someone wasn't studying it today. Asimov's writing is compelling ... not too full of sci-fi babble which often sounds odd to readers 40 years later, and that makes it pretty timeless. Many older books constantly irritate me in this manner."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"I can't believe people would comment negatively about this book as it is a work of art! Have some creativity, vision and pure imagination in your lives."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"It's part of the great Foundation saga from I. Asimov.... i really enjoyed every word of it.... you must read the saga!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"I've been an Asimov fan for many years and remember treasuring the original Foundation series. I liked &quot;Prelude to Foundation&quot; too because it moved quickly and had frequent flashes of humor. This book in contrast was cool, flat and ponderous. Someone would have to be a strong Asimov admirer, or be completing a Foundation collection, to sit through this book.I listened to the book in audio form as I commuted to and from my work. It was a fairly good way to pass 13 hours of travel, and the time didn't pass disagreeably, but I don't think I'd want to hear it again or to read it. Much of first hour or so consisted of discussions between Trevize and Bliss about the merits of Gaia versus isolate individuality. The second and third and subsequent hours revisit this topic. The same arguments will occur over and over and Trevize and Bliss will never come to agreement. Trevize staunchly defends his individuality over any kind of merge. He also loves his ship's computer and loves merging his mind and will with the computer. Oddly enough, the book never calls attention to this discrepancy between his beliefs and his behavior.I'm sure Asimov's science is sound in this book too because he explains it often enough. There are multiple thinly disguised lectures on the formation of planetary systems, binary stars, and gas giants. Ecological systems get detailed attention. There are also lectures on the origins of mythology and folk history. All of these are interspersed with brief - very brief - periods of plot action and danger.The emotional tone of the book ranges from flat to chilly. Some of the characters are described as not liking each other, and I didn't like them either. I found myself especially disliking Trevize, who is supposed to be the hero. I didn't find the Gaian Bliss to be any more interesting, nor was the bond between Bliss and Pelorat convincing; and the child who joins the group part-way through the journey has only a few moments of honest emotion. This book was written at the end of Asimov's life, and perhaps is filled with the weary characters of a weary author.Other reviewers have commented that the ending seemed to call for another book. I agree that the ending was open, and I don't want to give it away, but I don't know how Asimov would have written a sequel to the situation he finished with. Perhaps it is best that it ended there."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"Well, 6 months ago I started reading CAVES OF STEEL. I read all 4 robot novels, all 3 Empire novels and all 7 Foundation novels in order. 14 books in 6 months. Some were better than others.As a whole, the Robot series was the best. I found the 3 Empire novels to be the most boring. And the Foundation novels were hit and miss. FOUNDATION AND EARTH is a perfect example of the series; exciting at times and then when you can sense a big climax, it is really, to be quite honest, a let down. I'm glad I read all the books, but I don't think they were really all that well written, Asimov has a curious and cold way of writing. Now onto Lord of the Rings......"},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"Having grown up with Asimov's original Foundation Trilogy and Robot novels this book was an incredibly enjoyable blast from the past. It was like suddenly continuing an old friendship after 20 plus years.Here you have a book that ties up the Foundation Series, the Robot series, as well as, being a very fine mystery novel in it's own right. It is a rare thing for such a large body of work to be capped off so logically and elegantly. Indeed, I would almost say that this book is equal or superior to the originals- the character development certainly is improved.I remember that I couldn't wait to get home from the office to read the next chapter or two when it first came out."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"The last (in terms of story chronology at least) book in the series, and definitely the best. The story flowed beautifully, perfectly plotted, expertly written. It has an amazing timeless quality, and feels as though it left the framework set by the other books in the series to fly freely into the future."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"Continuing the story of Golan Trevize, after the Decision made in Foundation's Edge, he and Janov Pelorat along with Gaia go around the Galaxy in search of long lost Earth. You really get the feeling of immense age, of such profound history, the closer they come to their goal, which is amazing in itself, but along with that feeling is extreme hope that derives from the future that Gaia offers the Galaxy. You won't realize just how deep this book is until at least days after you've finished it. Purely marvelous."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"Great sci fi read. The originality is so that many movies n shows depicting space must have read the series."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"I have read this novel over twenty times and i still read it over again. The dialogue within this novel makes it rich in intellectual stimulation, so this is not a novel for people who are looking for action scenes,sexual situations, or bloody space conflicts. This is a novel to be digested mentaly, with the purpose of making the reader to think about the value of technology and to eradicate the fear of it taking over our lives. The first foundation represents an extreme technological paradigm where human beings are reduced to cogs in a collective high-tech culdesac. This depicts a society doomed to end in perpetual futility. The Second Foundation represents another extreme, intellectual development without a human heart to guide it. The society of the Second Foundation are manipulatators who want to pull humanities strings to their own tune for ulterior reasons. Hari Seldon founded both socities as means of ensuring human survival, but actualy he had created two conflicting rival castes of humanity.The main Characters discovery of the planet Gaia was the sensible choice for human survival, since mankind was meant live a simple existence as one people. This novel is for the thinking reader and not for someone seeking to be entertained."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"I loved reading the Foundation novels a long time ago and was glad I found them on Kindle. Can't go wrong with Asimov."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"How many books did Asimov write? No matter how many I read there are more out there, however, I never get tired of them. I think I have read one other in the Foundation Series, but this one can stand alone just fine. I see many people have a negative feeling for the way the story ended, but I guess this is where I am lucky, I enjoyed this story as it stands alone, and not slanted by how it fits in with the rest of the Foundation series.This story takes you on a journey to the ultimate conclusion of collectivism, where the whole galaxy is interconnected and all sharing in the same super organism. The protagonist, Trevize is a slick space traveler to is put in the position of making the call if this \\"super-organism\\" is a good idea. He thinks it is, but must be sure.His journey to prove to himself that we all should be interconnected took him on an epic journey looking for the answer in the long lost origins of man himself. He was on a journey to find Earth (where man originated). He goes on this journey with Bliss, who is already a part of a single planet super-organism. She is connected to everything on her planet, but wants to see that extend to the whole galaxy. Trevize is also joined with a great historic scholar and together they go planet hoping looking for clues to what seems to be the hidden Earth.Along the way Trevize finds romance mixed in with danger and a deeper love story of a Mother/child relationship that could only be told by Asimov and his skill of working robots with emotions into his stories.What I love most is how Asimov tugs at your scientific side and keeps you wondering if, or when these things he writes about will come to fruition. This story keeps you guessing and turning the pages!!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"I bought the complete series of the Foundation for my husband, because he hadn't read it before. There are 7 books, not three, and I can say that Isaac Assimov is one of the great brains of the past century. His story about the History of the future is so awesome!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"Without second thought I would say Asimov is my favourite SF author and the Foundation series is one my SF favourites. Precisely because I am so fond of both, I was very disappointed with Foundation and Earth.The storyline does have its interesting moments and on the whole I found the quest for Earth ironically amusing from the reader's point of view. The fluency of the plot however, is continually hampered by long and unnecessary lectures. I have always respected and admired Asimov's scientific philosophy but in this occasion his reflections on individuality as opposed to collectivism are embedded in an endless and tiring debate between the Gaian Bliss and Trevize. The debate of this single topic is repeated so many times with such great length that after some time you become annoyed every time they start lecturing, wishing that they would arrange a scientific forum somewhere else, resolve the issue for once and all, then shut up for the rest of the plot.The plot aside, the problem with this Foundation novel is that it is without the Foundation! Having been taken care of in the previous novel, the First and Second Foundations are only vague and trivial references within the novel. While two of the main characters (Trevize and Pelorat) are Foundationers, it wouldn't have altered the plot much if they weren't.The real disappointment for me however was how the novel was concluded. The motivation of Asimov for this and the previous Foundation novel, I believe, was the fusion of the Foundation series with his excellent Robot literature. While he does so, in a reasonabl elegant fashion, the result and the ending, I am afraid, ridicules the Foundation saga in favour of the robots. It is almost as if one might not have read the Foundation trilogy at all.Still I do not regret having bought and read this book. While I did not want the Foundation saga to end in this way I certainly would not leave the concluding book out of my shelf. I recommend this book only to devoted fans of the great master."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"This is the last book (chronologically) in the Foundation Series, and with Prelude to Foundation, the earliest, the Foundation Series has two excellent bookends, or, perhaps, &quot;foundations&quot;, to keep it in place.F&amp;E is a continuation of Foundation's Edge, and is the story of Trevize, Pelorat and Bliss/Gaia's quest to find Earth, in an attempt to determine why Trevize's choice for the future of mankind is the right one.The book deviates substantially from the rest of the series, but generally in a positive way. Whereas Asimov has a habit of making his primary characters out of cardboard, presumably to avoid the people getting in the way of the ideas he wants to express, F&amp;E fleshes out the characters with a certain amount of personality. Whereas the rest of the Foundation Series tends to concentrate on worlds which, after a while, all appear similar, the worlds of F&amp;E are different, frightening, and yet serve Asimov's agendas well. F&amp;E also ties together the Robot series universe with that of the Foundation series far more substantially than the other books in the Foundation Series attempted to, portraying the futures of the Spacer worlds that Robot fans will be familiar with.I'm guessing that the differences are ultimately why this has gotten a lower average review than the others in the series - it's not classic Foundation Series material, and any one expecting a collecton of stories involving a renegade Foundation leader visiting various rebelling worlds and outwitting the dimwitted monarchs that rule over them with some sort of smartarsed politics is going to be sorely disappointed. Hari Seldon makes no appearance. I don't recall even seeing the term &quot;Seldon Crisis&quot; in this book.If you genuinely want more of the same, you'll probably be disappointed by this book. If you've never read any of the series before, it's probably best to start at the beginning with the equally excellent Prelude to Foundation (or even the Robot series.) But if you're excited by Asimov's ability to paint new worlds, to visualise the future directions for humanity, you cannot afford to miss this. Foundation and Earth is the best yet."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"As the last chronological addition to the Foundation series before he died, Isaac Asimov gave SF readers a gem. The story begins immediately after the ending of Foundation's Edge, when Golan Trevize decided the fate of humanity that all should eventually form a single superorganism called Galaxia, enlarging the present superorganism called Gaia. The main characters are Trevize; Bliss, a part of Gaia; and Pelorat, a scholar. The drive of the story is a continuation of the previous book, in that Trevize seeks Earth, mainly to determine why all records of it have been expunged. Additionally, Trevize is allowing his previous decision to hinge upon the end result of their odyssey across the Milky Way - if he wants, he can reverse his choice and Galaxia will NOT go forward, and humans will remain the independent interactors we are today.There are few clues remaining to direct them, and they first visit a planet the readers saw in Robots and Empire, though it was under a different name. The path of the three is constantly accompanied by debates between Trevize and Bliss about the nature of life and whether a superorganism is the best option. Based on the obstacles and encounters they meet, the end decision is relatively predictable.In this novel, we see two of the spacer worlds, one which was the first, Aurora, and one which was the last, Soloria. First stop among the spacer worlds is Aurora, which gives a grim picture of what happens to a terraformed planet once the humans have gone extinct. Their trip to Solaria solves a riddle from R&amp;E as to what happened to the Solarians. Again, not the most pleasant evolution of an advanced society. The implications of this visit really affect Trevize's decision. Their next stop is a nearly completely dead world, but one that gives them a clue to Earth.After a brief stop at Alpha Centauri, they finally locate the home system of humanity, but Earth is as readers of the series would expect from R&amp;E and from the Empire series: Earth is a completely uninhabitable radioactive wasteland. The actual endpoint of their voyage is a nice surprise, in my opinion, but not nearly so much as who we meet at the end, a dear old friend. This meeting wraps up many issues, and Trevize makes his final decision regarding the fate of mankind.This book is excellent, though not quite a &quot;Foundation&quot; book in my opinion, as we never really deal with that government, save in very tertiary ways. Like most of Asimov's novels, the story is the main thing, but there is some good character development. And if you couldn't guess from the rest of this review, it was really nice to re-visit so many once-familiar places and to meet some old friends. I hope you enjoy it, too."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"A forward to this book written by Asimov himself makes reference to his publisher's wish that he write additional foundation novels, and implies that their incessant demands eventually overcame his own reluctance to do so. Almost as if he's saying to the reader, \\"Hey, don't blame me for this steaming pile. They made me do it.\\"If I had Asimov's resume, I'd be reluctant to put my name on this book as well.As the title implies, Foundation and Earth is about the protagonists' continued search for the world of origin. Unfortunately, unlike Foundation's Edge, the journey itself is not long enough to fill the requisite 500 pages, so we're subjected to endless interludes of casual conversation between protagonists which are completely irrelevant to character or story progression. A simple question will launch a character into a tedious three-page monologue that reads more like an essay than dialogue.As other reviewers have said, the primary purpose of these later books was to tie each of Asimov's sci-fi series together into one universe. This works alright for the robots, but does more harm than good to the legacy of The Foundation.If you've read the original Foundation novels, It's likely that no negative review will dissuade you from reading this one. Therefore, I commiserate with you in advance."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"If you enjoyed the ending of Foundation's Edge then you will probably like this book. You will find more analogies comparing Gaia to things in the isolate world, and Bliss squaring off with Trevize about stuff you really don't care about. Asimov does, however, succeed in making you feel the fustration that the characters feel when they don't discover ANYTHING about Earth for the first 450 pages. The most annoying character is Fallom. I found myself wanting Trevize to kill Fallom as he suggests he will do several times in the book. The \\"twist\\" revealed in the last sentence is all but a surprise as Trevize foreshadows it several times in the book. I just read a review that this was more part of the Robot series than the Foundation series. I had only read the first four Foundation novels so perhaps that is why I didn't care for the portion of the book where they meander through space accomplishing nothing."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"I discovered the foundation trilogy early this year and I was blown away at how awesome it was. The first three books are short stories that tell an over arching story. The over arching story is the story about a math problem that predicts the future, and how a small foundation on a remote planet use it to gain control of a collapsing empire. The first three novels, though comprised of short stories, weave this theme in and out. I loved the fact that everyone was a human, no aliens, and how time jumped ahead to show the advancement of the foundation.So when I picked up Foundation's Edge and Foundation and Earth (both published many years after the original) I expected the same format: The short stories, the colorful unique characters, the twist endings, and the how the seldon plan is developing. Instead, this book and it's predecessor (Foundation's Edge) presented us with something that was entirely different and should not even bear the same name.Foundation's Edge, did take us back to the planet Terminus, but only in the beginning. The Seldon plan is barely mentioned in that back, and is basically non existent in this book.Here's my problems with this book particularly.-nobody cares about Gaia, it's weird, it doesn't make sense, and it's not the foundation. Asmiov spends chapter after chapter explaining how this collective conscience world exists. Incredibly boring and meaningless.-He has added unnecessary sex into the book, which I found meaningless and offensive. The first three were good books that I would let my kid read.-The character Bliss is a boring character, and only talks about this awful concept of Gaia, which is incredibly boring.-He builds up the relationship with that Trevise has with the computer only for it to mean nothing. I was sure that Traveise's connection with the computer had something to do with his decision to turn the whole galaxy into Gaia-No Hari Seldon time vault, No Seldon Plan, No terminus. Far from the Foundation trilogy-He shamelessly forces the foundation story to merge with his other robot books. I read I, Robot but none of the other ones. I particularly did not like the fact that his robot character that he must love, is the real one who wrote the psycho-history and then decided that a collective conscience world would be better. Maybe I would have liked it better if I had read the other robot novels, but I didn't think I had to read his other robot books to understand the foundation story. Daneel is a forced and unnecessary character. He ruined it.-Fallom.....seriously?-He scraps the Seldon Plan! The entire trilogy was about the Seldon Plan! And he just kills it to replace everyone with a collective conscience. It makes the first three novels worthless! This was my major beef with it. Because he did this, he completely throws out the Foundation. By the way, this should be not even be called \\"Foundation and Earth\\" because the Foundation has nothing to do with it, not even the second foundation which deserved more spotlight.Truthfully, he should have just made two new books called \\"Gaia\\" and set it in the foundation universe. These are not foundation novels.In a nutshell, this was awful. Read the first three and pretend that Asimov never wrote anything else with the word \\"foundation\\" in it.-"},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"I think this is the only Foundation book not in print anymore, and I have no idea why. Not only is this the most important one in the series in the way that it provides a sort of conclusion to everything, it's just a great book.I liked Trevize in Foundation's Edge and we see more to his character here, which is great. We also see more of that fun planet Gaia. I found the arguments between Bliss and Trevize particularly amusing and what was interesting was that Trevize won just about all of them. Give me the Seldon Plan anyday.The search for Earth took up some much of the book, but when we finally get there it's almost anti-climatic (though any readers of Robots and Empire will know what they find long before the characters do). Fortunately Asimov doesn't allow us to dwell on that by springing the top surprise of the novel on us (which I won't say because I don't want to tip any readers off beforehand).In the process he clarifies and adds to his histories and weaves the Robot, Empire, and Foundation sagas even closer together. What more can one ask in a novel, especially from Asimov?Oh, and I heard about the error, but I didn't see anything that seemed wrong. If anybody knows what it is, the curiousity is killing me and I don't have the patience (or the time) to reread the book more carefully. E-mail if you know!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"Aismov continued the Foundation series reluctantly under pressure from fans and his publisher in \\"Foundation's Edge,\\" which precedes this novel. \\"Edge\\" is a disappointing book and \\"Earth\\" falls even shorter. The plot is very slow, the characters are only mildly interesting, the dialogue is wooden and the ideas just don't materialize in the end. I find the Gaia concept (which was introduced at the end of \\"Edge but plays a prominent role throughout \\"Earth) to be extremely far-fetched, and Asimov sinks to new literary lows as a writer here--gratuitous sex, a planet of hermaphrodites, and a planet where the women are topless. The lack of taste only makes things worse. There was very little substance in this book and it is a dismal way to end the \\"Foundation\\" trilogy, which is the best sci-fi series in history in my opinion. I do not recommened except for those who must have their curiousity to see how it all ends satisfied, but be warned this book is nothing like Asimov in his prime, some 30 years prior."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"It's hard to believe that the man who wrote this book (and its equally disappointing predecessor, _Foundation's Edge_) even READ the original Foundation Trilogy, let alone wrote it.This book is repetitive, tedious, and unimaginative. The conversations about collectivism vs. individuality, repeated _ad nauseum_, for all the constant hashing and rehashing of those themes, do not even skim the surface of the points of contention between them.It's bad enough that this book isn't the least bit about the Foundation(s); the real problem is that it isn't even good science fiction, and worse still, it isn't even good writing. If you enjoyed the original Foundation Trilogy, please don't bother with the last two books (chronologically) in the series. They'll only ruin the whole experience.One star. Maybe less."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"If you're an Asimov junkie like me, you'll buy and read this book no matter what anybody says. But if you were thrilled with the first three books in the series, ecstatic over the addition of Prelude to Foundation, and slightly less than pleased with Foundation's Edge, then you'll be disappointed with this one.I felt Isaac was preaching at me in some sort of new age galactic godspeak rather than entertaining me with a good story. Maybe that's the danger of writing so many good adventure books: eventually you want to advertise your beliefs. I don't know if that's true or not, but I do know that this book was a terrible letdown for me in an otherwise brilliant series.The ending didn't gather together the threads of the story, but only seemed to serve as a steppingstone for books that were never to be written. The Foundation Series is a grand adventure, standing up for the most part over forty years after some of the volumes were written. Well, five out of six of them do, at least."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"I am fond of everything was written by Isaac Asimov and I am buying all his books in english after I read already them in Italian. Nevertheless this book is not his best one, because here and there in it you can feel some weariness, some dialogues are too long (Bliss and Trevize always fighting about their points) and the reader is less breathless than in the others of the Foundation series. Still, I am disappointed that there is no further book in the Series!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"The climax of this book is totally unexpected..You must read the robot novels to fully grasp the end..if you have a copy keep it..Excellent conclusion??to the Foundation books."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"For anyone just discovering the love of this series, this is the most amazing book. When I was just entering Highschool (not that long ago), I was convinced to read the Foundation. My dad promised I'd like it. Well in a month I had read all the way up through Foundation's Edge. Then a teacher told me about Foundation and Earth. I had never heard of it, nor had the bookstores. My teacher let me borrow it and i couldn't believe where Isaac took me. His two best characters (besides Seldon) were back again for an amazing jurney. With a great story line, and even better discusions on god and the universe, and an ending that makes me proud to have read so much Asimov. I was just dieing when I read it. I won't give away what happens but its good to read as many Asimov books as you can! Its sad that this book isn't in print anymore. I have a first edition and a soft cover. One to read and one to treasure. I recomend ordering this book. However long it takes it takes, but it is worth waiting. Trust me. ENJOY IT!!!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"Well, this surely wasn't the best book of the foundation series, but it did gave me a very nice reading.The story is full of action, and I was always in expectation to see what the next planet would be like, and if it would reveal anything. It also shows some aspects of Bliss and Trevize that were not shown before, allowing us to get a better insight on the characters.One thing that gets to my nerve though, is the amount of pages dedicated to Trevize/Bliss arguments (with Pelorat being the referee), some of which are interesting, but soon get somewhat repetitive.The end is very revelational, giving us a whole new view of the story of the first 4 books, and with a little more...Oh, and I haven't found any &quot;error&quot; either... please someone tell me, ok? ;)"},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"This book fulfilled my expectations of a grand finale for the Foundation series. I was captivated by Trevize's journey back to Earth; exploring planets that Asimov had written about in previous novels. The parallels of R. Daneel, Gaia, and God were very imaginative and intriquing. This was one of the more enjoyable Asimov novels to read."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"This is the culmination of the great Foundation Series. Asimov manages to tie the story of The Foundation together with the Robot series and brings in a special guest to finish it off. Make sure you read the Robot Series first. And DON'T buy the tapes of this book, buy the actual book. Great reading"},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"Unscientific? You are probably wondering how I could say such a thing. I could easily get through the heavy philosophysing via the Trevize &amp; Bliss arguments, but when you get right down to it, Asimov just took the &quot;Future is bliss through the oneness/Gaia/connectedness&quot; (pick a mechanism) option. Ho-hum. Really, I expected a better ending to this grand series."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"It would seem that the last batch of books produced by the Asimov aren't quite what they use to be. I'm still and always will be an avid fan, but the last two books in the foundation series were a bit of a let down. Though Foundation Forward (in the timeline between Prelude to Foundation and Foundataion) was relatively the best of his last 3.-chris"},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"My introduction to Isaac Asimov was to read the first 5 Foundation novels. This one seemed to tie up all loose ends (unlike to culmination of Arthur C. Clarke's Rama series). All through the book I was anxious for the return to Earth, to see what really had transpired. Various characters throughout the series had said things like \\"why would you want to go there, everyone knows it's radioactive?\\" Well I for one refused to believe it. I loved the way that the one behind everything to do with the Foundation was not Hari Seldon as we thought but none other than Daneel. The reasons for all that he did were fascinating.My only regret is that Mr. Asimov decided to work on unnecessary pre-quels to the Foundation story rather than start a new series that takes place after this book. Perhaps some of the brilliant scifi writers that have been successful capturing Mar. Asimov's style in other Foundation and Robot spin-offs, may be able to complete the task."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"This novel doesn't work very well as a standalone; you have to be familiar with the Trilogy, not only in terms of plot, but to get the proper emotional impact, because is the moodiest of all Asimov's novels.Trevize is looking for Earth, so he is examining the oldest planets in the galaxy. Most of them have been positively presented in other novels; here we see them in decay, in different ways. Baleyworld/Comporellon was once mankind's newest world and a promise for the future; now it's the oldest inhabited world, lost in the past, and obsessed with wondering what went wrong. Aurora, a utopian world, has not only lost its human population but its ecology has gone feral. The Solarians have gone from being eccentric to basically turning inhuman, etc.In Foundation you kept hearing about the decline of the Empire, but it was mostly a matter of plot. Here you FEEL the decline.Things on shipboard aren't much better. Bliss and Trevize spend the first half of the novel arguing over ideology, and the last half arguing over Fallom; only their shared love and respect for Pelorat holds them together.It's almost as if Asimov sensed death approaching and let the story reflect the loss of zest and life."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"First off I must say that I am a BIG Asimov fan. I have read (and own) all the Robot, Empire and Foundation novels, as well as The End of Eternity, Nemesis, The Positronic Man, and The Gods Themselves, and most of the short robot stories. I have found all of them interesting at the very least. Please note that I read Foundation and Earth BEFORE Forward the Foundation was written, so my opinion may be slightly different than those who read it after. Foundation and Earth was the last book of the Foundation Series, but did more than finish that line. It tied up many loose ends from the Robot and Empire series as well, and unified these three into a single (if somewhat loosely knit) timeline. Some parts were slow moving, like the main plot, while others were not even really understood until the last few chapters. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, but I suspect I would have done so even more if I had read Forward the Foundation first. Depending on how you interpret the ending, it is either finite of open to change, something I like. I recommend this book to any fans of the Foundation, Robot, or (to a lesser degree) Empire series. One small suggestion, I recommend reading the series in the order of the future timeline, not by the dates which the books were written. All in all I feel this book is a good conclusion to the series."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"I read this book several years ago, but didn't write a review. I decided to renew my interest in the Foundation series and since this book was hazy in my memory, I decided to reread it. Now I remember why it's hazy. This has to be the most boring and wordy book Asimov has ever written, period. I found myself skipping over large sections of nonsense dialogue of Bliss arguing with Trevise about Gaia. Nobody talks and discusses as much without saying anything as the characters in this book! I managed to get on by skimming and concentrating on plot points. Asimov in his foreword said his publisher asked him to write a large book and he complied by filing it with 80% useless chatter and boring dialogue. He could have written a good short story about this quest for Earth that would have been enjoyable, rather that this bloated, boring, and frankly turgid effort. I gave it two stars in respect to Asimov, had it been any other author, one or no stars."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"I was disappointed in this book, which is chronologically the last of the Foundation series.The characters act out of character. You have your heroes and your heroine, and in the first half of the book, they're very righteous, debating about morality, and act strongly with conviction. But in the second half of the book, a small event happens and then you get a bunch of whiny wimpy characters. It was really annoying, and if it was anyone but Asimov, a reader would say that he inserted this small event just to build up to another sequel.He could have removed this event and it wouldn't have changed the overall theme of the book. This book just left a bad taste in my mouth -- I was exasperated that our so-called heroes whom we initially rooted for and loved became so stupid."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"Isaac Asimov's FOUNDATION AND EARTH is the fifth or sixth book (depending on how you count) in the Foundation series.The book itself is so-so. Not his best, but even at half-throttle he still runs circles around most other sci-fi scribblers. There's very little about the novel that would appeal to anyone not already a fan, but if you've spent any time in Dr. A's richly imagined galaxy, FOUNDATION AND EARTH does a nice job of bringing elements of both the Foundation and Robot novels to a satisfying resolution. With room for more sequels of course, that sadly The Grandmaster is no longer around to write... though I'm sure someone will (if they haven't already!).The thing that impresses me most about Asimov (other than his incomprehensibly prolific output of some 300+ books) is how he crafted a massive, intricate, interconnected fictional universe. This is fairly common in the sci-fi/fantasy genre: Tolkein, Frank Herbert, Arthur Clarke, even George Lucas (heavily influenced by Asimov), to name a few. But I've found Asimov's work in particular to be filled with isolated little gems to marvel at even if you don't know the whole--an enormous tapestry that can be enjoyed as sweeping panorama or in focussed detail. As much, or as little, as you want is there for the taking."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"'Ol Isaac concludes the weaving together of his outstanding \\"Foundation\\" series with his Galactic Empire and Robot novels. Golan Trevize, continuing from FOUNDATION'S EDGE, undertakes a mission to finally discover the \\"mythical\\" planet Earth, and to learn its secret. Accompanying him are fellow Foundationer Janov Pelorat and Bliss of Gaia. If you're a fan of all the above-mentioned series, your suspense will be keen as Trevize and co. narrow down the search. What was Earth's ultimate fate? We know it became radioactive (seen in ROBOTS AND EMPIRE, and touched on in various Galactic Empire novels), but did it recover? Are people still living there?Along the way, the trio discover several of the ancient \\"Spacer\\" worlds (the basis for many of the Robot novels), and on one of them, Solaria, they take with them a \\"girl\\" who has developed (like all the few remaining Solarians) remarkable powers. What may be a \\"let down\\" to many FOUNDATION fans is that Seldon's plan is clearly shown to be intertwined -- nay, guided -- by probably the most powerful robot of all, now an ancient, worn down figure. It's touched on that there will soon be a joining of robot and human, in the form of the little Solarian girl.Trevize doesn't \\"resolve\\" the dispute of Galaxia vs. Individuality (continued from EDGE); however, the novel ends with him pondering what humans will ultimately become, with his gaze firmly on the little Solarian \\"girl.\\""},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"Foundation and Earth is the seventh and final installment of one of science fiction's most auspicious series. The order of the books, with titles shortened, goes like this: Prelude to F, Forward the F, Foundation, F and Empire, Second F, F's Edge, and F and Earth. F&amp;E picks up almost immediately after where Foundation's Edge leaves off. Both make references to characters, places, and concepts discussed only in the Robot series and Empire series. Therefore, I *highly* recommend that you read those two series (seven books in all) *before* tackling the last two Foundation books. The big revelation at the end of F&amp;E won't have much meaning to you if you haven't read the Robot series at least. Also, Prelude to Foundation and Forward the Foundation help with the continuity.Golan Trevize, accompanied by the Gaian Bliss and mythologist Pelorat, goes on a quest to find Earth. His intuition tells him that something on Earth will allow him to clarify the reasoning behind the critical decision he made at the end of F's Edge. Golan's essential question is: what is wrong with psychohistory? So the trio go romping across space, landing on several planets, in their search for the forgotten planet Earth.Many of the reviews of F&amp;E are negative because Asimov casually shatters nearly everything we've come to believe and hold sacred regarding psychohistory and the two Foundations. But it makes sense: the fundamental flaw in psychohistory that Golan Trevize eventually figures out is very real and cannot be ignored. I never realized this flaw while reading the previous Foundation novels, but now I wonder how Hari Seldon could have missed something so basic. In my opinion, Trevize's decision is justified (even though it sacrifices a vital aspect of humanity).Again I must stress, you'll probably be unsatisfied with this novel *unless* you've read the Robot and Empire books first! I enjoyed F&amp;E; it brought closure to the series and tied it together satisfactorily with his other books. I don't give it five stars because although it was a fun read with a good ending, it wasn't as exciting as previous Foundation books. Trevize and Bliss argue *a lot*, like a husband and wife who are tired of living with each other! The plot moves fairly slowly for most of the novel, but the suspense does build as the trio gets closer to their goal. Overall, worth the read."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"Will humanity pull through? This is the question at the end of Foundation and Earth. A novel that is definitely not Asimov's best.A recyclyng of his favourite ideas,and a preposterous ending,very little like Robots of Dawn,Foundation's Edge and The Naked Sun.Still a wonderful read,but too long,a lukewarm Asimov.I think that when Trevize says that he would retire and forget the Foundations,he is externating Asimov's tiredness on the series.Maybe Peter F.Hamilton's Edenists would make a good compromise ? (read the novel to know what I mean)"},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"This is the sequel to &quot;Foundation's Edge&quot; (1982), immediately following the action in that novel. The main character, Golan Trevize, who had decided the course of the future of the galaxy, is compelled to discover why he chose as he did. He comes to the conclusion that he can find the answers if he can only locate Earth, the forgotten planet of man's origin. He quickly discovers that all references to Earth have been removed and he doesn't know why. Although not the final book published in the series, &quot;Foundation and Earth&quot; is the last volume in the internal sequence of events in the series (as of right now). All of the other books in the series are still in print; so, it is rather hard to understand why &quot;Foundation and Earth,&quot; the last book in the saga, is not in print.

In just a few pages he presented and explored a brain-boggling idea. But in this longer work and two others in the Foundation series (Foundation and Empire and Prelude to Foundation) I admit considerable disappointment. There are some good ideas but they're lost in a sea of shallow characters and needless ramblings. I won't give up on the author because when he hits he really hits. But I'm through with the Foundation series"},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"There seem to be a number of negative reviews of this book, but I think those readers missed the point. I think that most readers do not have the proper perspective to really understand it. However, I don't think this is due to any personal faults on the part of those readers. It just probably resonates more with certain people than others.This book is about the search for origins and the innate desire for personal continuity and harmony with human society. Most people never give this a second thought, but some of us are born into situations where our origins are unknown and our sense of continuity is broken. Consequently, these issues occupy very prominent places in our lives.I am adopted, and I had to do a search similar to the search described in this book in order to find my own origins. In fact, this book was one of the catalysts that spurred me to perform this search, which was ultimately successful. This is one of my top ten favorite books. I grant that my perspective is somewhat colored by my personal situation, so take that into account.At the same time, I think that the issue of connection with the past is one that affects every American, and every white person. White people were forcibly severed from their primal pasts long ago, and the issues raised by this separation were never fully resolved. They persist in our society today. There is a lot of interesting information regarding the ancient history of the white/European cultures freely available on the net; if you haven't investigated this topic, I recommend doing so, no matter what culture you come from.This book doesn't address these issues as such, but it does address the underlying human need for continuity and communication between different societies. It's not the same as other Foundation books, but if it were, there would be no reason to read it..."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"Great book! I started reading the series in the order he wrote them and this book is by far the very best I have read in the foundation series. Now I just need to get the robot series and I cant wait!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"Foundation and Earth picks up right where Foundation's Edge left of as Trevize, Perolat and Bliss continue their search for Earth. The entire story-line includes the famous wit found in all Asimov's novels but seems to pack in even more intrigue than normal as it slowly becomes clear that something even greater than the Seldon plan may be at play. The story is very fast paced making it difficult to put this book down and it stretches the imagination more than any of the previous books. Asimov uses this final book to tie in both the Robot series and the Foundation series as well as clear up many other questions left open in his prior novels. The result is a very satisfying conclusion the the Foundation series.***For those new to the series, here are the specific seven books tied directly into the Foundation story line and their original date of publication. I read these in the order they were published and was very happy to have chosen that order. Asimov also tied in some of this other book series into this one (specifically his Robot series) thus making the entire story line a much larger volume of books.Prelude to Foundation (1988)Forward the Foundation (1993)Foundation (1951)Foundation and Empire (1952)Second Foundation (1953)Foundation's Edge (1982)Foundation and Earth (1986)"},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"I see a lot of parallels to the movie Avatar, except for Avatar's violence. Hollywood is turning to the great masters for new material; it'll be interesting to see how much they stick to the original story line."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"I really wanted to give this book like a four, but upon further reflection I just can't. Foundation and Earth is the conclusion of Asimov's masterpiece Foundation Series (I haven't read the two prequels yet) and it takes the series in a completely new direction. Which is wonderful, and also problematic. The Seldon Plan and the Galactic Empire on which the series were founded become side notes, mentioned in parenthesis and trivial in the wake of Golan Trevize's solving the ultimate human mystery in the story line: Where is Earth and why can't people find it any more. I have to admit, I loved the mystery and I loved the futuristic archeology, mythbusting and history work that went into the characters finding the planet and unraveling its mysteries. But the writing was just not A+ typical Asimov.Golan Trevize becomes increasingly annoying. He is arrogant, pedantic, self-absorbed and just plain mean spirited. Hardly four pages go by when he doesn't have a philosophical argument with Bliss about whether or not its better for humanity to remain isolated individuals or to join together in a superorganism that spans the galaxy, giving up their individuality and humanity to become something far bigger and better. It's repetitive, esoteric and slows down the pace of the story for no good purpose. Once the argument is outlined, at the end of the last novel in the series no less, he then proceeds to beat the dead horse into a bloody pulp until I found myself, quite frankly, skipping pages. It got really old. Asimov also uses Trevize to give mini-astronomy lessons, which altogether weren't that bad and interesting. But he makes Trevize talk in this Sherlock Holmes sort of way where he's always giving the deductive and inductive evidence for every decision he makes - again annoying. \\"I decided we should go to Planet X because A) I'm hungry, B) the Stars align every so precisely in that direction, C) the women on the planet might be hot, D) the computer in it's complex model has illustrated a design flaw in the universe that intrigues me because: D1) the laws of physics forbid such anomalies, D2) blah, blah, blah, blah. You get the picture.This novel was a plot success and a failure in the execution. I think that's my main problem with a lot of the \\"bad\\" books I read. People have good ideas and then muck it all up. I think by this point Asimov was really doing fan-service and really had no idea where the heck he was going with it. In fact, his wife comments in the afterword that he never wrote a sequel because he didn't know how to finish it, so he wrote the prequels instead. I can understand this. The plot shift at the end is dramatic and way out of left field. It's intriguing and quite genius and has enormous potential. It's a shame it couldn't be developed further. But this particular installment is in it's character development and dialogue is atrocious. Wikipedia it to clear up the mystery and move on with life."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"Another good book in the series, Foundation and Earth tells the story from the moment Foundation's Edge left off, detailing Trevize's quest to find the origin of mankind.This book, though enjoyable, was more of a Gulliver's Travels type of format as we hop from world to world meeting variations on human settlement. There is less of the mystery/intertwining plot intrigues I enjoyed in earlier Foundation books."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"Golan Trevize looks for Earth. The novel picks up right after the end of Foundation's Edge. I found Foundation's Edge slightly confusing in that there was something effecting the minds of both the Foundation confederation and the minds of the Second Foundation, and wasn't completely sure if it was a Third Foundation or what. Foundation and Earth clears that up, well sort of. It is not a Hari Seldon originated organization, it is the planet Gaia, but calling it a Third Foundation could be used if you redefine The Foundation. It is hinted that there may be yet *another* group effecting events in the galaxy; the equivalent of a Fourth Foundation... or maybe a Zeroth Foundation. This is one of the slight, but exasperating aspects of this novel. In the Author's Note of Prelude to Foundation, Asimov wrote that he could and may add to the Foundation series and as for books after Foundation and Earth he could add \\"additional volumes - as many as I like\\"). In parts it feels like that, that Asimov is setting himself for additional volumes, rather than this being the definitive end to the Foundation series, as it now is. Another thing is that Asimov groups his Robot, Empire, and Foundation series in one all encompassing series. For whatever contradictions exist between the series, Asimov gives preference to his Robot series.Foundation and Earth takes us on a tour of seven different planets and the different habitations of each. Some have gone to the dogs, some are autocratic, and there's excitement on each one. Asimov has set up the galaxy in that are no other known intelligent non-human (or human-made) species. Sort of answers the famous questions on the lack of evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence: \\"where is everybody?\\". Well, Asimov's answer is: there isn't anybody else... well kinda, sorta... If you read the book you'll understand. Actually, even though there are these ambiguities on the universe here and there, Asimov does wrap up the Foundation series somewhat nicely (although you may not like it as it differs from the original Foundation series), as well as wrapping up his grouping of all of his series into one.Addendum: Regarding The ErrorIt was mentioned previously about some error in the book. Out of all the spoilers given in many of the reviews it wasn't explicitly mentioned what this error is. Talk about tossing a hand grenade in a room and leaving. I thought the error may be referring to some aspect of Asmov's series on Robots/Empire/Foundation . However one glaring error that I saw was that Asimov keeps referring to Alpha Centauri as a binary system while in actuality it's a trinary system. Now although the third star is a rinky-dink red dwarf, so much has been written by Clarke as well as Asimov in that if our very own Jupiter had more mass it would be a red dwarf, so when a system finally *does* have a red dwarf it's hard to consider that it's disregarded. Unless there's some unseen dark matter entity, this red dwarf is (was) the closest star to our solar system, is called Proxima Centauri, and thus should have some special significance to us puny Earthlings. Now the knowledge of this red dwarf was known since at least the 1960's.At only one point does Asimov mentions that Alpha Centauri has two companions stars (chap 83). Maybe Asimov after writing most of the book remembered/discovered Alpha Centauri is a trinary system, or an editor mentioned it to him and then he added it in later afterwards, but decided not to, or didn't have time to, change the sections he already wrote.Note: there are a multitude of additional reviews under Amazon's mass market paperback version of Foundation and Earth."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"This, the fifth book, was probably the worst in the series, but was still worth the read, as far as I'm concerned. (I haven't read the two prequels yet.) The Foundation Series' setting and Asimov's style just seems to be right up my alley. I've liked everything I've read by him so far!One of my favorite aspects of the original trilogy, was how it did a story in one generation, and then went to another story in another generation- A short story or novella for each Psycho-historical crisis. Now, as in Foundation's Edge, we are stuck with a straight forward novel-type book. A little disappointing, but as I said, I guess I just enjoy the Foundation SF setting, and this book was still very enjoyable for me.I have no clue why this book is out-of-print... Did the publishers hate it? Or did they just not like the direction this plunged the series into? Did they want F&E;'s ending out of the way to make room for a new direction in the books by the \\"Killer B's\\" -written after Asimov's death? I didn't read those books yet either, and since they didn't get such hot reviews- I may not read them ever. Oh well.If the low average rating here on Amazon has you wary, you can always try to get it from the library, so you won't waste your money on a potentially bad book. But if you enjoyed books 1 through 4, you owe it to yourself to give it a try."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"The final episode in the Foundation saga in terms of internal sequence.

I like the fact that this book starts right where the last one left off. I thought for the most part that this book was slow going, but entertaining none the less. This is definetly not the best book in the series. The point of finding Earth seems to go on forever and I just wanted them to find it already. The ending is the best part of this book, and it is a shame that he never was able to write more books that would have taken place after this one. As a book I would rate it an 8 out of 10. As a Foundation book I would rate it about 6 out of 10."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"This book reminded me a lot of my experience reading the Wheel of Time books. The dialog is so tedious and repetitive that I found myself hating the characters and skipping any dialog that was obviously going to be a repeat of past discussions in the book. Remember hair pulling and dress straightening in the Wheel of Time books? There are plenty of similar irritating repetitive discussions in this book.The first 3 books of the series are fantastic. The 4th (Foundations Edge) is decent and worth reading. This book should be avoided at all costs. Don't read it. It diminishes the events in the previous books and just made me angry.SPOILER ALERT:The strangest thing is that the first books in the series were supposed to have been written from a successful 2nd empire after the 1000 years was over. I fail to understand how that could be the case if Gaia was really the endpoint.For my own happiness I think I'll just pretend that the 2nd foundation was successful, Daneel's brain froze up well before he could succeed at his idiotic plan, all robots in the universe were destroyed by humans for being hopelessly stupid, and that Gaia ended up dying when its star suddenly went nova.Gaia wouldn't notice it happening because its mode of life caused it to be too uninquisitive. With a whole planet working together you'd think they'd be at the forefront of scientific inquiry instead of being well behind the first foundation!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"I feel pretty sure that Asimov has a huge ego - that his protagonist is some sort of projection of his self image. Trevise is supposed to be a rigorous scientist of the highest intelligence, and in this novel his quest is to find out why he is always right.Hubris city, but with no ironic undercutting.Worlds and characters are flagrantly constructed merely as 2D sets for the strutting Trevise. His two companions acknowledge his greatness and tread around him accordingly. Pel is a sort of Dr. Watson. Every female is absurdly stylised : vain (jealous of any other female), motherly, and devoted. Oh, and stacked. We're deep in James Bond/Star Trek 1 territory here.There are plenty of contradictions and places where supposedly intelligent characters do stupid things.This is obviously a book written on commission: he didn't have any idea for another Foundation book, let alone a 500 pager, but his publishers wanted the money for a guaranteed seller. Asimov really should stick to short stories where you don't need insight (particularly into character) or imagination, but can get by with a single novel 'what if'. He reveals far too much about himself here, which in some authors is intriguing, but in him is disappointing."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"Wow! This last book in the Foundation series definately kept me turning the pages way past my bed time. It was generally less gripping and satisfying than the original series. However since this book was written much more recently than the trilogy, Asimov's adaptation of 30+ years of scientific theories and insights is very insightful and intriquing.The ending however, is quite a disturbing one. It hints that there is indeed more to this supposed &quot;ending&quot; to the Foundation series. I cannot say anymore in fear of throwing spoilers into this review... all I can write is that it's killing me... for there seems to be more than meets the eye to the formation of Galaxia.Oh ya, very strongly recommended you read Asimov's Robot series and of course the original Foundation series and Foundation's Edge. I read Edge before the Robot novels and frankly in hindsight it would have been much more enjoyable and made more sense if I had done otherwise."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"Don't get me wrong. I was enamored by the first three novels. My interest was piqued further in the fourth novel (Foundation's Edge) when both the First and Second Foundation were working together (sort of... but not really) against a supposedly common threat -- a threat that was more powerful than both the First and Second Foundation. But in Foundation and Earth, Dr. A simply dropped the ball. His focus on morality and irritating, one-dimensional characters who talked way too much made for a very tedious-reading novel.I blame this on his decision to tie the Foundation story line with his Robot universe. That decision, I believe, contributed to this poorly written novel -- a novel that strayed from the namesake of its series: the Foundations. He could have written a far better story if he had just continued concentrating on the First and Second Foundations and how each were vying for dominance over the other. This could have been a rich story line that culminated with the birth of the Second Galactic Empire when the First and Second Foundations either a.) reconcile and come to terms with each other, or b.) one dominates over the other at the end of 1000 years of Barbarism. Forget about Galaxia. And all this WITHOUT robots.Better yet, Dr. A could have gone back to the original short story format he used in the original Foundation novel. That way, the story line could have focused on important epochs in the histories of the two Foundations and would have covered the remaining 500 years until the birth of the Second Galactic Empire. Again, without having to resort to robots.Because of his decision to integrate his Robot universe in with his Foundation universe, he was forced to insert useless (if not annoying) plot lines to justify the inclusion of robots. That just ruined the story. For example, the following plot lines were highly contrived, humongous time-wasters:1.) the dangerous dogs on Aurora2.) the homicidal hermaphrodites on Solaria3.) the metastasizing moss on Melpomenia4.) the aging robot that lusted after the young body of the hermaphrodite kid (sounds pedophilish to me)And what was up with the ending? Why introduce a brand-new plot line about malevolent extra-terrestrial aliens from another galaxy when you are at the end of the novel??? I thought that was just a poor way to justify the formation of Galaxia. The better rationale for Galaxia would have been to point to the dangerous developments on Solaria and Alpha. Because the inhabitants of Solaria and Alpha were resorting to murder to maintain their secrecy/anonymity in the galaxy, that would've been reason enough to justify the creation of Galaxia. Galaxia would have brought back into the fold all these wayward humans who were afraid of other humans (namely those living in the Foundation).And one final commentary. Was anyone else incensed by the fact that humanity had to be \\"taken care of\\" by robots? All the major accomplishments and developments of humanity couldn't be attributed to humans at all. Psychohistory and Gaia were all the work of robots. Humanity was never a master of its own destiny! It's insulting for Dr. Asimov to imply that humanity is incapable of taking care of itself. Sure, humanity will occasionally make decisions that lead to mistakes, even tragic ones. But those decisions will be made by humans, for humans, for better or for worse.Overall, a lousy novel and a disappointing end to a series that started out with such excitement and promise."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"Nowhere near the intrigue and plot of the original Foundation Trilogy. Foundation &amp; Earth was an irritating series of hypothetical debates that amounted (usually) to nothing, and a series of trite, rather meaningless visits to far off planets. The ending (I won't spoil it) was hard to believe, to put it mildly. I give Asimov credit for some of the greatest sci-fi around, but he should have retired from the game after the 1950's."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"Very disappointing. Sure, it's readable, but also laughable. The story of finding Earth should have been fantastic, but instead meandered all over the place and seems to be a waste of time. There are a few good parts, mostly for those readers familiar with the Robot series, but the entire book is sadly a disappointment. This decline started with the introduction of Gaia in the previous book, when the whole series got derailed and never got back to what it was.Spoilers ahead!Who else was absolutely convinced that Golan Trevize would turn out to be a robot? For most of this book, that seemed to be the great 'mystery' that would be unveiled. It turned out to be false, but Trevize's ability to merge perfectly with the ship and his basic wooden personality had me willing to bet he was definitely, positively a robot. The guy was unreal. He did not respond at all to the nubile girl on board the ship, he let the old guy have her. Er, not likely, especially as he constantly referred to how horny he was and how long it had been, ect. . .The series officially jumped shark with the introduction of the planet Gaia and never recovered. How could the search for Earth be so pointless? They spend most of the book running from one planet to another and barely escaping alive from each one - it gets a little repetitive. When they finally achieve their goal, it's very disappointing! And none of the larger issues are resolved. What happens at the end of 1000 years? Did the two Foundations achieve their purpose? Apparently, Asimov lost his way and we never find out if the Foundation was effective or not. The story of finding Earth had great potential, but the reader is left hanging at the end wondering what will happen at the 1000 year mark, the point at which the Foundation was supposed to prevent the Dark Ages extending to thirty thousand years.This book was mostly fluff and the silly interactions between the nondescript Trevize and the silly lovers: Gaia girl and the old librarian. This part of the story seems to have been a fantasy of Mr Asimov's . . . The 'surprise' at the end was a total rip off and an excuse not to carry the ideas begun in the first book to their final conclusion. Instead we are left with Gaia on a galactic scale . . ."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"This is the last book, chronologically, in the Robot/Empire/Foundation universe, and it's a very fitting one. The story starts immediately (i.e. days) after the end of Foundation's Edge, so we start with the same three main characters - Trevize, the exiled Foundation councilman; Pelorat, the ancient historian looking for Earth; and Bliss, member of the superorganism Gaia. Since the problems of Trevize and Bliss were solved in Foundation's Edge, we are left to solve Pelorat's in this book - where and what is the planet where all humankind originated? Of course, we already know the answer, but there's a great deal of fun to be had in the journey....Thus, we set off on a search for Earth, and with only a few clues and hearsay, it's a long search. Along the way we visit a number of planets we're familiar with from other series - notably Solaria and Aurora, the two most prominent Spacer worlds in the Robot novels. We learn the fate of the Spacers (including the solution to the &quot;hook&quot; at the end of Robots and Empire - why the Solarians disappeared) and along the way Asimov springs a few additional surprises on us. The characters are interesting and much more enjoyable than the same characters in the previous book - I'm not sure why that is, since their personalities are perfectly consistent. The debates between Trevize representing individual freedom and Bliss representing the telepathically linked massmind of Gaia provides much of the philosophical backbone of the book. There is suffienct action and plot twists to keep you turning the pages right to the end of the book....It's curious that this book is so difficult to find, yet the books published on either side of it (Robots and Empire and Prelude to Foundation) are readily available. In addition, this book spent 15 weeks on the NY Times bestseller list! It's even hard to find used (it took me about 10 used bookstores in 3 different cities to find it, and every one of the ten had Foundation's Edge). Very odd. But, it was well worth the effort to find - it's one of the best Foundation books, certainly better than Foundation's Edge. There is a hook at the end of this novel too, but the good Dr. Asimov passed on before he could write another installment (and apparently, he did not have any idea what to do with it anyways)."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"Foundation and Earth chronicles the search for Earth by Golan Trevize and his two associates. It is a direct continuation of Foundation's Egde. Although it is a good read, I would not recommend this book until after you have read its predecessor.For those who have read the Foundation series, you may be vastly disappointed with one aspect of the book. It has almost nothing to do with either of the foundations. While the search for Earth does indirectly pertain to the foundations, they do not play anything close to a major role.If you can deal with this &quot;flaw&quot;, Foundation and Earth is an enjoyable book."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"***Major spoilers ahead***In a nutshell. The Seldon plan was worthless all along and is to be tossed away so that the Galaxy may unite under one mind to fight off some unknown alien invader sometime in the distant future, perhaps. *groan* This book should have been titled. \\"The Foundation Goes Down The Drain\\"Everything that made the origional Foundation books so great is tossed out the window in this conclusion. After spending 2 entire books searching for Earth our adventurers don't even bother to set foot on it once they have found it. Just a few pages looking through the ruined Caves Of Steel would have made up for the trial that was reading this book. Golan and Bliss would also have to be 2 of the most irritating main characters ever to be penned to paper, Travise has a massive ego and is generally a jerk to everyone he meets, and Bliss is like an umber-greenie who is trying to convert the entire Galaxy into one big garden.Do yourself a favor, just read the origional 3 Foundation books, and the prequels if your interested in the backstory of Seldon's early days on Trantor. Also the Robot books are great especially the Bailey trilogy. Don't bother with Foundations Edge or Foundation and Earth, it will just spoil all the great stuff that has come before."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"I've read all of his robot-empire-foundation books, So i thought. If you have ever noticed, Foundation and Earth never appears in any list on the inside front cover of his books until he decided to clear this timeline mess up.(People were confused over if the three series were related or not, They are.) He creates a offical listin the first three pages of Prelude Foundation. At the end I see Foundation and earth. I read it and find it ok but disapointing. No time jumps, boring charcters, and on top of that, they can't even land on Earth! It is more of an ending to the robot series. There is a surfacing of a dear friend at the end. The best part about this book is, you learn more about the current state of all of the planets in the robot novels, Soloria, Aroura, etc. It is a great adenture book, not a foundation book. There are few references to the foundation. Trevice even says he doesn't even like Hari seldon. (gasp! Overall this book is readable, but very different that his other foundation books.I also suggest:Prelude to Foundation **** 1/2 (Out of Five)Forward the Foundation ***Foundation ******Foundation and Empire **** 1/2Second Foundation *****Foundation's Edge***....And any other Isaac Asimov book. Enjoy!!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"Foundation and Earth reiterates all the ideas cast in Foundations Edge and after a while one wonders why this book was written in the first place. We have the same three characters from Edge: Trevize, Bliss, and &quot;Ple&quot; as they tour the galazy trying to find out about Earth. Along the way we are subjected to endless tiring debates that have long since lost their freshness from Foundations Edge.Asimov doesn't even have much of a plot as each planet they arrive at allows for even further ludicrous plot twists including 'Trev' seducing a high official in order to get what he wants. After about 150 pages of so this &quot;where are we going with this&quot; feeling really reaching its climax. Remember that sinking feeling you got after watching &quot;The Matrix&quot; and then having to endure the painfully overblown and tiring sequel. Sadly, one of the greatest sci-fi writers of our time gives us this feeling.Asimov wrote this novel toward the end of his life and perhaps after this book he realized he needed to explore other book ideas rather than continue with this material.The Foundation series was always about dialogue, but it always led to something. Each conversation was important in driving the plot forward. Unfortunately, in this case their was no plot to drive forward."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"I am an American. I am a New Yorker, like Isaac. This book, like all of Asimov's work, is wonderful. I fully appreciate it, unlike some. Go out and buy this book right now. Buy the full Foundation books, it's the greatest Sci-fi series in the history of man."},{"Title":"Foundation and Earth","review":"...and the ending really sank the series. I wish he'd have stopped with the original trilogy. Ursula LeGuin made the same mistake with the Earthsea books: three brilliant and a fourth turkey.

I received the wrong book (Foundation and Empire) on August 6, 2010 and immediately notified the sender who said they would ship a replacement out immediately. It is now August 29, 2010 and I have still not received the book I ordered. I understand the book I ordered was ridiculously inexpensive, but that doesn't justify terrible service. If you could get the wrong book to me within a week, I don't understand why the correct order couldn't have been here within a week, though since you made the mistake I believe it should have been expedited.

John B. Carroll has given us an impressive review of the factorial analytic studies covered most of the human cognitive abilities. But, he has gone beyond the re-analysis level and has made up a new model of intelligence: &quot;The three strata model&quot; which will help us to avoid hopeless discussions about the nature of the most important cognitive abilities and to advance in the actually interested topics about such abilities. Specially, he finishes with the argument about the existence of the g factor but, he also recognizes the importance of the Thurstone's primary mental abilities and the Cattell and Horn's distinction between fluid and crystallized intelligence. I think everyone concerned in the cognitive abilities field should read this book and keep &quot;The three strata model&quot; in mind in the analysis of his/her research."},{"Title":"Human Cognitive Abilities: A Survey of Factor-Analytic Studies","review":"Claims for the importance of social class are muted today. Surveyed punters say they are all middle class; children's educational outcomes by their twenties are only slightly related to their fathers' occupations; and even the New Statesman and the Spectator have largely given up the class war. Yet might class differences merely be temporarily obscured - perhaps by mass higher education (or miseducation)? Might class differences always tend to be re-created by differences between people in intelligence? Might \`the classless society' prove a chimera?Reassurance for egalitarians has long been on offer in the form of multifactorial accounts of intelligence. From 1935, American psychometrician-psychologists could be found who professed - contrary to the view obtaining in Charles Spearman's \`London School' - that there were many human mental abilities of equal importance and that these cognitive variations were largely uncorrelated with each other. From Louis Thurstone's 7 \`primary abilities' and J. P. Guilford's 150 \`functions' to Howard Gardner's 7 \`multiple intelligences' and Robert Sternberg's 676 \`components' (including a few hundred \`interaction effects'), the anti-elitist implication of multifactorialism was clear: given such statistical independence of abilities, no-one could be greatly superior to anyone else in all-round, general intelligence (g).The 819-page scholarly verdict of Thurstone's one-time graduate, Emeritus Professor John Carroll (University of North Carolina), must therefore attract wide interest. Can the modern egalitarians of Harvard and Yale be allowed to bask in their multidimensional proclamations? Or is the London School - with the assistance of its far-flung outposts, especially at Berkeley - vindicated by results? (Oxford and Cambridge psychologists have deemed it impolitic to participate in a debate of such glaring educational relevance.)Thankfully, few serious readers will miss the main thrust of Carroll's re-analyses of 461 well-found studies of individual differences in mental abilities. Although only a quarter of the studies involved normal population samples, and although most of them had some special focus (and so involved a less-than-catholic selection of mental tests), the positivity of inter-correlation between tests is sufficient to produce a clear g factor in 90% of them. Carroll, it turns out, has no quibble with the idea - introduced in an engaging historical chapter - that around 55% of the variance occurring on anything called a mental test will actually be common, g variance that is shared with most other mental tests. Time and again, tests named as \`language comprehension', \`reasoning', \`auditory discrimination', \`social intelligence', \`spelling' and \`creativity' turn out to correlated well with each other and thus with g. Carroll gladly repeats the handy dictum of the London School: \`g is to psychology what carbon is to chemistry.'Regrettably, the methods involved in Carroll's factor-analytic opus are a painfully familiar mixture of the flat-footed and the mildly self-indulgent. Correctly, Carroll employs Schmid-Leiman procedures: these extract objective, simple-structure factors (usually themselves inter-correlated) before looking of any higher-order g factor; attention then turns to what mutually independent \`stub' factors remain at work once g's influence is statistically removed. The problem is with what happens next. Some studies will show and independent \`verbal' stub factor; others might add \`visualization', \`memory' and so on. Yet if one study fails to show a visualization factor, perhaps it simply did not involve enough tests of that type? (\`Nothing in, nothing out' is a more important principle of factor analysis than is the better known \`Garbage in, garbage out.') Still worse, how is it to be shown that the factors appearing in different studies truly represent the same \`visualization' factor? For that matter, how does Carroll know that any tow studies really do yield the same g factor? Faced with these problems, Carroll honestly admits that his operation is essentially one of \`cataloguing' factors. None will doubt that Carroll has the common sense and scholarly knowledge that make a good cataloguer; but cataloguing by appearance still involves a certain subjectivity and cannot constitute a proof of anything unless the fit of one cataloguing system is somehow compared with the fit of another. Carroll would have done better to have estimated the median correlations between the more popular tests from the better studies, and then to have submitted the resulting notional (but far from fictional) matrix to factor analysis. Keen factorists will buy the data disk that the publishers offer and hope it will enable them to attempt this exercise.Still more regrettable, intent as he is on cataloguing his factors as belonging under the same heading (or not), Carroll misses the chance to discuss most of the more interesting questions of psychometric psychology. What proportion of test variance is actually accounted for by g in each study? Which tests have the highest g-loadings? Which are the best tests of numerical facility, clerical speed etc? Is there real variance in \`creativity' once the influence of g is set aside? What of Mike Anderson's claim that \`differentiation' of independent, non-g abilities is more easily seen in testees of higher levels of g? Repeatedly, Carroll prefers to evade such questions - together with any possibility of interpreting g's nature in the light of its strong correlations with modern measures of speed of apprehension, such as \`inspection time.'There has to be a place for this book in any library covering differential psychology. Carroll takes a firm stand against critics of \`reification', maintaining that general intelligence is indeed \\"a tangible and well-defined entity\\" - quite as much as electricity, heat or gravity; and his scholarship can probably be trusted - despite \`cognitive' being mis-spelled in the Table of Contents. What doesn't need taking on trust is this: only 110 of Carroll's 461 surveyed studies showed 2 or more distinct higher-order factors; and these factors usually involved a g factor plus one other that varied greatly between studies. That human intellectual differences arise principally because of g will be plain to any factor-analytically sophisticated reader; and Carroll's more discursive concluding chapters outline the modern case for recognizing the causal relevance of g to education, to employment and to the final social class positions and cultural levels that people attain."},{"Title":"Maximilien Robespierre: Nationalist dictator","review":"Eagan's book should not be regarded as a convoluted attempt to distort the 'true' values of the French Revolution! it's primary aim was, in 1938, to understand the rational behind the fascist regimes of europe by looking at the nationalistic features of Maximilien Robespierre. One should not disregard it as useless, just because of the images fascism evokes. In 1938 it was a viable form of government which had succeeded in bringing stability to 2 disperate regimes.As a historical source, one can see how the politics of a period can influence a historians perception and beliefs. As historians we strive to achieve an impartial and accurate picture of a certain event, yet this is a nigh on impossible task - as this book shows.As for the accusation that it is distorting the aims of the revolution, this is rubbish! A key part of the revolutions character was the feverent nationalism which emerged, a similarity which Eagan would not have failed to notice in 1938 with italy and germany."},{"Title":"Maximilien Robespierre: Nationalist dictator","review":"Written in the late Thirties, this book is a misguided attempt to interpret Robespierre as a precursor to Hitler and Stalin.

The book is made up of two parts. Part I is called the Social Record, and includes in chronological order articles that Malcolm Cowley published from 1930 to 1941 in the New Republic concerning issues, problems, and ideas of the period. Though the book was published in 1967, and many of the thoughts expressed in the articles are now obviously simply wrong, the publication of them gives an insight into the thinking of a convinced left-winger who in the early years of the 1930s had only admiration for the tyranny which was being carried out by Stalin--in accord with the thinking of many in those years. (In 1935 Cowley wrote \\"The strength of the Soviet writers lies in the fact that the political leaders want and need their support, and are willing to grant a great deal of intellectual liberty at the price of receiving it.\\" A 1967 footnote says \\"This deluded comment must stand for the record.\\") Part II of the book contains many of Cowley's short book reviews, again from 1930 to 1941, published in the New Republic. These stand the passage of the years much better than his comments on the political scene and are of much interest. I found this book an interesting window in the history of the 1930s."},{"Title":"ART SUBJECTS: MAKING ARTISTS IN THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY.","review":"This book was assigned for a required graduate seminar in art history and studio arts.

Many of my questions about the effectiveness and purpose of my degree program were given extensive analysis, and quirks I thought particular to my university were shown to be both historically rooted and popularly applied.The MFA isn't perfect and it certainly produces more artists than the art world can absorb. But this book did not convince me that art school is a sham - and I don't believe that was Singerman's intent, either. This is a well-researched look at how studying art works, and I would recommend it to every incoming student in order that they might more quickly learn the conditions of the institution and produced artistic identity - and more importantly save themselves the trouble of making art about it."},{"Title":"ART SUBJECTS: MAKING ARTISTS IN THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY.","review":"This book is a must read for any academic who thinks they know all about training art students.

It focusses not on the fictional, but the recorded and historically accepted hauntings. Unlike much of its genre, it is not a series of 'Boy's Own Rollicking Good Yarns', nor is it a 'Believe it or Not'-style compedium of the trite and incredulous. It is well written, well researched and, unlike the typical anthology of this style is not parochial. It follows ghostly legends and hauntings globally and presents them in a manner which is enthralling for young people interested in the topic and still makes for a fascinating read for adults as well - hence its 5-star (in my view) status."},{"Title":"50 Great Ghost Stories","review":"I have the Bell edition of 1971.

Often these ghosts in these stories resent the living and set out to terrify them, sometimes even ending the lives of their victims.Many of the stories in this volume involve such ghosts, and often their victims die, or flee the haunted abodes.In short they will excite a large variation of feelings and emotions in the reader.In reading these stories , we also learn much of the customs and life of the people during the times examined. For example the cruel punishment for nuns who fell in love or lost their chastity, of being left to die of hunger and thirst, in an enclosed walled up space.Many of these accounts are taken from the archives of The Society of Psychical Research.Other records were destroyed during the 1940 German Blitz of Britain.What follows is a gripping and entertaining, if haunting and eery set of narratives."},{"Title":"50 Great Ghost Stories","review":"This was the first book that I ever remember reading just for the sake of reading.

My taking the time to log on to Amazon and write this review should tell you something. Perhaps I feel so strongly because the title suggests fiction, the style and structure suggest non-fiction, and it does no justice to the ghost-story traditions of either. It is a mish-mash of barely re-worked legends and rumors, 'legends' that appear to have been concocted de novo, and plagiarized fiction presented as though it were 'real' legend. The editorial style recalls the antiquarian ghost-story tradition by the utter failure of its attempt at emulation. Each entry is laden with gratuitous 'editorial' comments, as though the originals (where they exist) weren't good enough. Even the titles of the chapters are so poorly chosen that they've given away the story before you've begun reading it.

The exercises are also very easy to do (as opposed to some posture books, where the descriptions are hard to follow, &amp; just not practical).My lower back is feeling a lot better thanks to the tips for stretching &amp; standing up straight in this book."},{"Title":"Posture, get it straight!","review":"After using the exercises in this book for about a week, I noticed that I no longer felt nagging upper back tension. Then, inspired, I purchased Janice Novak's video (rubber bands come with it), and started using it about five times a week. The video has the same information, but it's easier for me to follow along with a video rather than flip through pages. The neat thing is that several friends have asked me, &quot;Have you lost weight?&quot; I haven't, but I look thinner and feel terrific. I've had rounded shoulders for 56 years, but my posture has improved enormously. This book should be a bestseller."},{"Title":"Posture, get it straight!","review":"This book is filled with excellent information. The one minute to better posture produced very quick results. When I changed my workstation as specified in this book, my neck stopped hurting. The tips for adjusting car seat, a life saver. I thought my poor posture was hopeless but the info and exercises in this book really delivered. The best $12 bucks I've ever spent. I highly recommend this book. I saw the author on the Oprah Winfrey show and was very impressed."},{"Title":"Posture, get it straight!","review":"Chronic back pain has kept me from getting a good night's sleep. I didn't know what to do about it until I read Janice Novak's book. After my first time trying the exercies I felt my back getting stronger. I like doing the exercises because I always feel better afterwards. &quot;Posture, Get It Straight&quot; is well-writen and the exercises are easy to follow. I recommend it to anyone who has back pain."},{"Title":"Posture, get it straight!","review":"This book is worth it's weight in gold!!! The techniques and posture improvement exercises work so well and fast that I am already receiving compliments on how I look - and it has only been a few weeks. I also found out Ms. Novak has a video containing all the exercises (ImproveYourPosture.com). I find it much easier doing exercises along with a video than from a book. The video has more exercises than the book but the book contains chapters of info on things like how to re-arrange your computer work station to make it better for your back, how to adjust your carseat, sleeping positions, etc. All of these chapters contain simple things you can do that make a huge diference in your posture and back comfort. The book and video have been a GODSEND for me. This program is better than any other on the market. I know this because I have tried them all. Thank you Ms. Novak for very valuable information."},{"Title":"Posture, get it straight!","review":"This is a great book. I would recommend it to everyone. I've been working with my trainer at the gym to help my posture, and this book really helped me to understand some of the underlying concepts of posture.This book is written to women, and I am a man, but I thought that this was actually a very good idea. There are a couple of references to \\"men should do this instead,\\" when they are needed, but I thought that focusing on one gender made the book very clear and very understandable.Which reminds me of the coolest thing about this book, which is the illustrations. All of the illustrations are of the same woman. And this is very cool, because I was able to tell really quickly what good posture was and what was not. By focusing just on women, and by focusing just on one person giving examples of good posture and bad posture, it made the book very understandable.Also, Janice Novak gives the meat of the book in the first ten pages, where she talks about her \\"One minute to better posture\\" exercise. This is a really cool exercise that will transform your life instantly. It's really cool, because the book starts out with a real bang and then the rest of the book supports that initial bang until the end.The only improvement that I would suggest for the next edition is to have pictures of all of the exercises, and have two pictures for the two-step exercises. This would increase the size of the book by about twenty pages, but I think it would be worth it. I can be slow sometimes and pictures help me a lot."},{"Title":"Posture, get it straight!","review":"Janice's book and video have worked wonders for me.

I enjoyed it very much and I will incorporate Janice's suggestions as part of my daily life."},{"Title":"Posture, get it straight!","review":"This book is great for any type of poor posture. I never realized all the different ways you hold your body that cause you to have poor posture. Janice not only tells you to &quot;stand up straight,&quot; she gives you exact instructions, from head to toe, of how to hold your body properly. She then gives a lot of excercises that strengthen specific muscle areas, helping your correct posture become more natural and easy to attain. I found after reading this book, that when I previously attempted to &quot;sit up&quot; or &quot;stand up&quot; straight, I was doing it wrong and actually looked just as bad as in my &quot;naturally&quot; poor posture. Now I know exactly what to do to look great."},{"Title":"Posture, get it straight!","review":"I read a friend's copy while visiting her. Since I have suffered from neck pain (not severe, but real) for about 15 years, I figured I might as well give it a try. I found that results were immediate. I was also shocked by having to confront how bad my habitual posture was.I have been doing the basic one-minute routine for about eight months now. My neck pain (and tension -- I used to have two bands of muscle of almost wooden hardness running down the back \\"corners\\" of my neck) is reduced about 80-90%, and I continue to improve. I also look taller and slimmer, as promised (my parents both said to me, \\"you're so tall!\\" as if it were a new thing -- but then I suppose it was). I would agree that you will look an inch or two taller and ten pounds slimmer. Maybe more. Now, since then I've also *gained* about ten pounds...but that's another story."},{"Title":"Essential Atlas of Physiology (Barron's Essential Atlas)","review":"I teach Key Stage 3 (Grades 6-8), Key Stage 4 (Grade 9) and IGSCE science.

It takes the reader away from the superficial and one-sided way in which the U.S. government and media portray Iraq, its history, people, and politics. The work carries a great deal of information that the U.S. public needs to know. I found it an eye opener that combines scholarship with straightforwardness. The chapters on archeology, Baghdad in the golden age, art, music, literature, history, and Iraq/Iran are most enlightening and charming. The chapters on some religious and ethnic communities, the sanctions, and politics provide information to a large extent unknown to the U.S. general public. The contributors impress me as excellent scholars, who have tried to support their views with historical facts and logic and, and who have undogmatically presented the reader with various points of view about some controversial issues, (see, for example, the issue of Halabja in the chapter on the Kurds). To call this kind of scholarly work \\"politically motivated\\" is to make a politically motivated statement intended to turn away the public from coming to know the truth about certain matters related to Iraq and our policy concerning it.The criticism that the work has no chapter on Saddam Hussein is rather silly. This work is not about a man, but about a country. Hussein and his regime are mentioned in many chapters, and they are described as oppressive. However, to devote a separate chapter to Hussein would require the inclusion of many other chapters about many other man who have shaped the history of Iraq, including George Bush, the father and the son.I strongly recommend this remarkable collection of essays on Iraq and congratulate Professor Inati for his thoughtful and careful work that we badly need."},{"Title":"Iraq: Its History, People, and Politics","review":"This is an outstanding work marked by objectivity and concern for the truth.

Back then, we couldn't afford so much such as those. And I can't just buy the old Infinity Gauntlet comics today. That would mean I have to shell out big bucks per comic. I don't know how much the real comic is priced today, but I am glad I can now own one for Marvel made this compilation.I am no comic-book fanatic nor am I an avid collector, but this is definitely one great read and maybe a guide or a refresher to the upcoming movie, The Avengers 2."},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"Loved it. Great story. Best way to buy it. It would cost to much to buy all six comics. Awesome"},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"I grew up on the comics of the 80's and 90's. I remember reading this back then and being blown away. Reading it again brought back those memories."},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"What an excellent story with a villain who is anything but a flat character. Thanos has a lust for power, but he finds out that it's perks come with a price. Below death's affections now above them, Thanos revels in his own might. With power comes pride, and it is his downfall. But is losing ultimate power and ultimate responsibility really such a bad thing?"},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"I prefer to read the work with all of its crossovers contained, but Infinity Gauntlet completely stands the test of time. Starlin created a masterpiece. he handles all of these characters with aplomb, and you can feel your heart racing as the climax is reached. The only drawback is that George Perez did not draw the entire series."},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"The Infinity Gauntlet is one of Marvel's most famous storylines and one of its best.Thanos gets possession of all the soul gems and essentially becomes god in terms of powers but not his usage and wisdom in using it hwich eventually leads to his defeat. How it comes to that end is an exciting action filled story with excellent art by Perez and Lim though I liked the TPerez work better. A little out of control at times but such cosmic epics usuallyare It is well worth the time and the money"},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"My favorite miniseries of all time, each time I read it I enjoy it more. How does one stop a being so obsessed with the concept of death that he is willing and able to wipe out 1/2 of all life in the universe to appease his mistress, Lady Death, who will not reciprocate his love?. Thanos literally fights the concepts of Eternity, Galactus, Love, Hate, Lord Order, Master Chaos, Chronos, the Celestials and more astral deities all while the Marvel superheroes struggle to even slow him down. Cannot recommend this enough, especially when compared with Silver Surfer's \\"Rebirth of Thanos\\" it is a must read. Jim Starlin's writing and Ron Lim's art are top notch."},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"They don't write them like they use to. The storyline the artwork it all compliments each other in this series that any marvel fan should have in their library."},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"I've owned the original printing of this collection for years, and I've read it several times over. Part of the reason that this story works better than many of the modern storylines is that the struggle is not exclusively about action. When power levels reach a certain apex, there is no point. Would seeing Thanos singlehandedly wipe out all the heroes make for a satisfying comic? Maybe, but there wouldn't be much re-reading value in that.Instead, this story deals more with Thanos's psychological problems, partially because of his fascination with Death, but also with his pursuit of power and his inability to deal with being (effectively) a god.The writing is nice. While many of the characters are a part of the Marvel Universe that I usually don't read (being primarily a Spider-Man fan) the characters - and their abilities - are made clear, without any heavy exposition to introduce characters (such as recounting their origin, or constantly dropping their name).In comparison to some of the other Marvel event stories - This is a step above Secret Wars, if only because that story should have been trimmed down a little bit. This is also a step above Infinity War and Crusade.I haven't read too many of the tie-ins to this title though. But based on what I saw in the Infinity Crusade collection, that was probably a good thing."},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"THE PRODUCT WAS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION BEEN WAITING TO PURCHASE THAT BOOK FOR AWHILE NO COMPLAINTS 110% HAPPY"},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"Probably one of the best Marvel mini-series ever in my opinion. Thanos makes an excellent antagonist and this series gives his character a lot of depth. For all intents and purposes HE is the star of this piece and plays his part well. It's hard to go into much detail without giving away the more essential plot twists but if you like villains that threaten on a scale equal to or above that of Gods and Goddesses, massive battles featured pretty much every Marvel big name and pretty much 99% of their heaviest hitters going head to head with that sort of threat, then this is the series for you. My only pet peeve with this particular collection of issues is I felt that it should have included the 2 issues of the 'Thanos Quest' storyline that details how Thanos obtained the Infinity Gems. This particular collection is assuming you read that or otherwise don't need to know and it feels a bit like walking in on a movie 20 minutes after it's started- you get the majority of the story but the beginning and setup is missing and I think the inclusion of that content would have gone a long way to illustrate just why Thanos having the Infinity Gauntlet is so much of a problem.Regardless, this is one of Marvel's best series ever and while it may not have quite the heart-wrenching moments of something like The Dark Phoenix Saga, it has what should be many jaw dropping moments. I just wish this story was told in this day and age when coloring has made leaps and bounds and the art could have more pop than the somewhat flat coloring in this version does. But it was the pinnacle of mid-90's production.A must have if you like Thanos as character, Adam Warlock, or the idea of watching the biggest names in Marvel-dom fight probably the biggest threat it has seen to date."},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"If you like comic book deities even a slight bit, or even modern or ancient human deities, then this book is for you. Struggles are all of cosmic proportion. I love the reference to all Earth's ancient religion gods as gods who are but a drop in the bucket compared to some of the forces at work here. Even though its a comic book, it tells it like it is. Us, as human beings, can lay no claim to even comprehend the magnitude and sheer myriad of benevolent and malevolent forces that constantly struggle on planes of existence much higher than ours or any of our perceived gods. Religious zealots would do good to read this book and give them a better understanding of how small their religious texts are in the grand scheme of things."},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"Marvel has the best cosmic stories in the industry and this is the best Marvel has to offer. Not only do you have a rather awesome tale of a megalomanic gaining aboslute control over everything, but Jim Starlin's characterizations of dozens of core heroes are dead on.I would have prefered Starlin to have illustrated this himself, but Perez and Lim do admirable jobs in bringing this tome to life."},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"As a kid I was an avid comic book collector and one of my favorites was the Infinity Gauntlet/Wars series. At the time, the Infinity Wars was out at new stands let me able to collect the short series. However, I was desired to read the prequel to it. I did find and buy the Infinity Gauntlet #1 but never invested in more.Move ahead some 15 years later; I decided I needed to get to know the Infinity Gauntlet story. It is great there was a graphic novel of the entire series in one book at a discounted rate. I finally read through the story and must admit it lived up to all my imaginations with one exception.That exception is the non-inclusion of the prequel Thano's Quest into this which would have made it much more complete.The artwork is great as you get to see many, many popular Marvel Universe characters duke it out against the almighty Thanos. You will also see godlike entities in the cosmic universe that are not typical in the X-men, etc books.Overall, this book would have been perfect if it included that Thano's Quest; so I can only give it 4 stars out of 5."},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"I enjoyed this piece as I'm a Thanos fan. The ending was great, with good reasoning...not one of those \\"you're forced to believe it\\" endings.

All in all I loved it."},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"The Good: The artwork and paneling is beautiful - George Perez and Ron Lim have done a top job! I esp. liked the sequence where Captain America, Silver Surfer and Warlock attempt to steal the infinity gems from Thanos. The story and dialogs are also nicely done.The Bad: I found the ending a little confusing and anti-climactic but that may be because I am not familiar with characters such as Warlock and Thanos. Also the artwork on some of the fullpage drawings appears very faint - I don't know if this is true for all copies or my bad luck.Overall a good buy."},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"This is the epic that got all other Marvel epics started, and is still the best crossover (except for The Age of Apocalypse [which any die-hard Marvel-phile should read in its entirety!])) that the House of Ideas ever put out. Not only is the prospect of having all of the great Marvel heroes battle it out against a madman of a cosmic being, but it is also interesting to see the Marvel definition of the Universe. Many characters are present in this book that represent the various ideas of philosophy and metaphisics. Love,Hate, Eternity, the Celestials, the Great Tribunal, Galactus, Mephisto and more all are present for the great climactic battle. Marvel's riveting representations of philosophical and spiritual ideas seem to create its own mythology, with these &quot;rulers of the omniverse&quot; as the gods and the pantheon of superheroes as, well, the heroes. Not only are the ideas and interpretations held within this volume interesting, but the plot and characters (and their respective reactions to each other and their situation) make for a masterpiece of comic book literature. Oh, and the ending and the epilogue are superbly crafted and just a little bit funny. Definately a great read. Check it out, and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"I have always been intriqued with guys like Thanos, Apocalypse, Galactus and so on. These is a great story about the mad power hungry thanos and the super heroes who have to stop him. I learn alot of things I did not know of Thanos.

I am not that big of a comics collector but I decided to buy this and I must say its a great read."},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"I've been wanting to read this for some time and I've to say I wasn't dissapointed. I sat down and read this in one shot; to give you an idea how engrossed I was. The story moves really well, they did a great job of juggling huge list of characters and using them appropriately.That being said, it does have it problems. If you are reading this as a standalone, then some of the characters may/may not be familiar. There was a few that I knew by name, but really knew nothing about (Cloak and Adam Warlock are good examples of this). The art is also not my cup of tea either. I grew up reading comics of this era and wasn't a fan of it then - color in what's important and leave the rest b/w. Be as that may, the book itself is as well put together and as well printed as anything coming out now."},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"Great comic to catch up on when you have some free time. I carried mine with me in my work bag and would break it out when I had some free time to read. Worth the purchase."},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"The story is quite good and the artwork is superb. ANY fan of marvel comics will love this."},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"Some stories have heroes and villains and are about the guys in the white hats punching the guys in the black hats in the face, Most times the guys in the black hats are just ;the bad guys' and have no real definition of character or purpose and the hero just fights them because he has nothing better to do on Saturday night. If that's how you feel about most super hero stories, then you might still want to give this book a second glance.In this tale we have the villain in the role of the lovelorn teenager despite being quite old. His lust for the Mistress of Death leads him to successfully win ultimate power and do her bidding at slaying 1/2 of the sentient population of the universe. From there his bitterness at being shunned by the creature he loves, he turns his absolute power into a toy and the heroes must take down a mad god to win peace.While the synopsis spells out the key points, it does not do justice to the story overall. There are many key pieces and puzzles for the reader to take in and walk away from. Thanos, the mad god, holds himself a Nihilist but still feels (or thinks he does) love for the Mistress of Death. A contradiction that he fails to recognize or acknowledge. The Devil constantly whispering over his shoulder and goading him on to darker deeds and depravity yet never is there the angel in the other ear. The character of Adam Warlock develops a strategy to guide the heroes that he eventually admits is just a distraction and his true plan is for them to die. Yet, in the end, despite sacrificing the heroes he manages to see the power of god taken away from the mad titan. While this story does have the 'black hat' in Thanos he is no Saturday morning cartoon villain and has motives and feelings that feel human even if childish and the white hats do not thrash the bad guy but are instead pawns used by those far less morally rigid to gain the most favorable result for the cosmos.Its not too often that you find a story that blurs the line of what a hero or villain is let alone one where the lines of power and to whom it should rest is so well told. This is a classic story and one that I take the time to read every year. Of this collection, I can only say these two things.1.) Every fan of stories should read this work.2.) Comic fans, like myself, should feel a little jaded in that the 1 story that should have been added to this collection is missing. I would have loved for Warlock and the Infinity Watch #1 (the trial after Thanos loses the gauntlet) to have been included. That first issue was a great epilogue to this tale but, alas, it was not printed in with the less than stellar sequel Infinity War GN either. Despite this oversight, it is still a must buy for those who never read the originals or needs a 'reading copy' to keep those originals in collectable shape."},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"This is a fantastic series and one of the first comic story arcs that really got my attention and kept it all the way through.I admit that I may have had an unfair advantage, as my appetite was plenty whet from the Thanos Quest prequel books (mini-series), which is among my favorite collections to this day.The beauty is that you don't have to be that interested in comics to enjoy this. Even a casual fan will appreciate the story that Starlin has laid out here, which is layered and compelling.But for those looking for a more detailed synopsis...Thanos, now equipped with the complete power of an all-powerful god takes on what seems like the entire Marvel universe in an epic battle that at times if flat out bizarre. I don't want to spoil anything, but let's just say you'll see more than a fair share of Marvel characters enduring strange fates indeed.The beauty of it is that all of Thanos' efforts are to win the cold heart of his lover, Death. Therein lies the beauty of Starlin's entire Infinity series - its core villain's ambitions are in the name of something that is all too human."},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"As something of a comic book aficionado, I have to say this has always been and continues to be my favorite comic mini-series of all time.

Thanos is by far one of the best villians I have ever read about. He appears to be a villian but from his point of view, he doesnt really see a good or bad in anything. The action is great and does make sense in the marvel universe. This story is meant for animation and would easily be on a higher level then the previous cartoon movies that have been released. The story of thanos getting the infinity gems is just as much fun as seeing him use them to mess with everyone including the cosmic beings."},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"The Cosmic Epic to end all cosmic epics!! Thanos trying to become god, universe spanning action, Adam Warlock leading Marvel's greatest characters... AWESOME!!! Starlin does a great job with all of these characters, and with a brilliant strategy to save the universe. In only 6 issues this story flows wonderfully toward it's conclusion. This will help people who've never thought about such things to wonder about the nature of god being omnipotent, and all-knowing, and the nature of time a lil bit too. Can't say enough about this book. Also, don't read this before you check out Silver Surfer:Rebirth of Thanos."},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"I loved this series when I was younger and it first came out.

All Starlin Thanos stories have the same characters and mostly doing the same thing. Here, Thanos is still pining for Death, and trying to destroy the Universe and Warlock is back to trying to stop him with the help of the Avengers and other Heroes. The Heroes all get zapped, but Thanos still loses. Most of the characters are completely irrelevant to the story and are just plot devices to be knocked down by Thanos. It's really really derivative of the earlier stuff. Worse, Thanos seems like a pathetic wuss when he is trying to impress Death, it seems to me that this relationship worked better in the original saga, but I may be remembering it better than it was.

Duramente sconfitto e ferito per&ograve; egli non muore ma circonda il suo corpo martoriato con un bozzolo mistico nel quale recupera le forze e, come un insetto, ne rinasce in parte mutato, pi&ugrave; maturo, per certi versi.L'incontro con l'Alto Evoluzionario &egrave; provvidenziale: quest'ultimo gli affida una sublime missione: salvare un mondo dalle forze malefiche e disgregatrici che lo hanno infettato. Assieme a questo compito Adam riceve anche una gemma verde, la Gemma dell'Anima, dotata di un vampirico potere di assorbimento dello spirito degli avversari.In una incredibile riproposizione della figura del Cristo Adam si lascia crocifiggere dai terribili Uomini Bestia, per poi risorgere dopo tre giorni grazie alla gemma incantata e debellare totalmente la minaccia per il neo pianeta perfetto.E' a questo punto che Jim Starlin prende le redini della serie, puntando molto sulla solitudine e le problematiche di Adam, costretto a vivere in simbiosi con un ninnolo tutt'altro che innocuo.Il ciclo di Starlin porta l'eroe dorato, affiancato dal troll Pip e dalla bella e letale Gamora, a scontrarsi con il suo doppione malvagio del futuro, il Magus e a distruggere il sogno di dominio universale del folle titano Thanos.Tra paradossi temporali e inesorabili deit&agrave; cosmiche Adam &egrave; costretto tuttavia a sacrificarsi di nuovo e la sua anima e quella dei suoi amici sembrano trovare finalmente la pace nel paradisiaco mondo spirituale contenuto nella Gemma dell'Anima.Questo nel 1983, ma all'inizio degli anni '90 Starlin opera finalmente il recupero di un personaggio cos&igrave; affascinante. La Morte, supponendo che ci siano molti pi&ugrave; viventi che morti, fa risorgere il suo amante nichilista, Thanos, perch&eacute; con la sua ferocia e violenza riporti in parit&agrave; la bilancia dell'esistenza. Thanos &egrave; per&ograve; molto pi&ugrave; ambizioso e astuto di quanto l'Oscura Signora potesse immaginare: riunisce le sei Gemme dell'Infinito (tempo, spazio, realt&agrave;, anima, mente e potere) e le incastona nel suo guanto. Ci&ograve; lo rende il nuovo essere onnipotente di questa realt&agrave;.Adam, Pip e Gamora avvertono il pericolo che corre l'universo e sfuggono dalla Gemma dell'Anima prendendo il comando di una \\"task force\\" composta dai pi&ugrave; potenti eroi della Terra per strappare il potere supremo al folle Thanos.Di primo acchito questa miniserie di sei numeri, con una tremenda minaccia cosmica e le matite del sempre ottimo George Perez (sostituito poi in corsa da un pur notevole Ron Lim) mi hanno fatto pensare a una risposta Marvel alla Crisi sulle Terre Infinite di casa DC, ma lo sviluppo della trama non pu&ograve; che portare a conclusioni molto diverse: la morte degli eroi nell'epopea DC ha un impatto certamente tragico ma ognuno di essi in pratica ha una schiera di giovani emuli ed epigoni pronti ad assumerne le insegne, consentendo alle serie regolari di andare avanti, cosa che non funziona per la Marvel che dunque deve giocare pi&ugrave; di riserva.Come si pu&ograve; combattere un potere pressoch&eacute; supremo? E' questo l'interrogativo che logora le menti degli eroi terrestri e questo &egrave; anche il vero punto debole della vicenda: non v'&egrave; alcuna possibilit&agrave; di sopravvivere a una minaccia di tale portata, anche perch&eacute; Thanos, padrone del tempo, dovrebbe prevedere ogni mossa degli eroi che lo fronteggiano. Starlin, che comunque fa un ottimo lavoro ai testi, con focalizzazioni azzeccate sui veri personaggi, pone rimedio a questa falla come pu&ograve;, in alcuni casi anche con una certa classe, ma in generale la spiegazione non regge fino in fondo.Per il resto la grande battaglia, la sua preparazione e il suo epilogo sono decisamente epiche e riportano in auge alla grande il personaggio di Adam Warlock, uno dei miei preferiti e sicuramente uno dei pi&ugrave; affascinanti del lotto \\"cosmico\\" marvelliano.Se riuscirete a passar sopra a queste fragilit&agrave; della trama e vi farete rapire dalla tensione di una tragica guerra senza speranza, questa serie non potr&agrave; che rapirvi."},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"Definitely a good one, but it wasn't really what I was expecting.

Almost a little comic relief, whether it was intended or not... or I'm just really dry?"},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"In the time where Wolervine and Punicher were in EVER comic book, thhere was still good things happening in Marvel. Its just a shame about the many sequels to this series"},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"This is supposed to be one of those classic Marvel storylines. You can tell they were trying to write it that way. And it does have some interesting moments (turning Wolverine to rubber) but as a whole it isn't just that great. You get a lot of minor characters who are all powerful doing major things. It's just not that great of a story."},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"I'm a big fan of comic writers taking a stab at what could be considered the final story for a character. I've endured a never-ending loop of stories about my favorites, and every so often, it's nice to see someone take their shot at wrapping it up. Batman has \\"Dark Knight Returns\\", the Avengers have \\"The Last Avengers Story\\", and in 1990, Thanos kinda-sorta received his, courtesy of writer Jim Starlin and artists George Perez and Ron Lim. To many readers, THE INFINITY GAUNTLET established Thanos as one of the major villains in the Marvel Universe, leading to bigger and better things, but I look at it in another way. I feel that THE INFINITY GAUNTLET can serve as the perfect \\"last Thanos story\\", and I prefer it as such, instead of it leading to more stories, such as Infinity War and Infinity Watch.THE INFINITY GAUNTLET is a continuation of a story that originated in both the regular Silver Surfer series and the THANOS QUEST limited series. The gauntlet is perhaps the most powerful item in the Marvel Universe, as it bestows upon the wearer absolute control over time, space, power, the soul, the mind, and reality. Thanos obtains the gauntlet in order to finally win the hand of his love, Death, through the elimination of half the population of the entire universe. A group of Marvel heroes, one villain, and a host of cosmic characters, come together to stop him, and he fends them off with the sort of casual anoyance that any god would. Adam Warlock, however, is onto Thanos' game and has his own tricks up his sleeve. Warlock's true plan leads to a conclusion that I never expected in one of Jim Starlin's super-duper cosmic epics, but it makes sense and is an ironic finale for a character like Thanos. If only it could have stayed that way. In any case, pick up this book and prepare for a great read."},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"When the Infinity Gauntlet saga originally happened, I was in my comic collecting prime. I missed out on most the saga, sadly, because I was in an area where it was quite hard to get a good selection of comics. I bought a few tie-in issues from other series and sort of pieced together what was going on. The only thing I remember is knowing the Infinity Gauntlet was coming in advance, because an issue of Quasar (my favorite comic at the time. Please don't laugh at me about that.) showed Thanos with the Gauntlet, as he attempted (unsuccesfully) to destroy a super-powerful villian you've never heard of called Maelstrom. (If you care at all, the Quasar series was called Cosmos in Collision and ended with the universe nearly being destroyed. I really wish they'd reprint that one as well, but Quasar has never been, and likely never will be, popular enough to warrant something like that.)This collection, though, is great. All of the original issues of Infinity Gauntlet in one. All the &quot;intergalactic biggies&quot; are there like Uatu (The Watcher), Galactus, Eternity, Death, Living Tribunal and a few more. (Noticeably absent are Infinity and Oblivion.)I particularly enjoyed the scene where all the galactic biggies ganged up on Thanos and started beating him senseless. Or they tried to, anyway.As far as I know, this is one of Marvel's earliest multi-comic title sagas. (Secret Wars came before it, though. And DC also had done Crisis on Infinite Earths in 1985.) Whereas Secret Wars was kind of disappointing, Infinity Gauntlet showed how it should be done. Not bloated and taking well over a year to play out (as CoIE did) and not having a misuse of a good idea (as Secret Wars did), Infinity Gauntlet was nearly as perfect as a concept like this can be.So, now all I'm waiting for is a graphic novel of it's followup story (happening a few years later on), Infinity Crisis. (Not nearly as good, but gives a certain closure and definitely ends the chance of anymore Infinity storylines. Well, as definite as you can get in the Marvelverse, anyway.)"},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"You want true heroism, courage, and raw power? Then pick up The Gaunlet, this is the story that tells you why Captain America is so cool, how important Thor really is, and just how scary evil can be. The heroes of earth put everything on the line to save not only their world, but the universe as well. Drawn perfectly by first George Perez and then by Ron Lim, this is one of Marvels shining moments."},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"Upon reading this incredible book again, I realized that this book is timeless. It has a style that does not require a reader to know anything about comics prior to reading this book. If you are looking to get a young person into comics this is an excellent way to start. Jim Starlin is in rare form and paints an excellent picture of angst and despair, and finally joy and astonishment. The book shows you the majestic quality of the Marvel heroes, and their epic struggle to safe guard their world against even the most impossible odds. This book displays the greatest show of courage and strength ever seen in comics. As the reader, you are given a chance to cheer, cry, and stand in total awe of all the visual magnificence dilivered in rare form by both George Perez (The Teen Titans, Avengers) and Ron Lim (X-Men 2099, Mutant X). If you want to see Marvel at its best, The Infinity Gaunlet is the best possible example."},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"I grew up reading the author's Warlock series reprints in the eighties. Those were masterful and powerful stories. The series climaxed with a cosmic battle involving the Avengers, the Fantastic Four, Spider-man and Warlock. If you're a teenage brat it doesn't get any better than that.Until this story. Starlin writes this one so deftly and so utterly over the top that you walk away stunned. The premise? The dark demi-god Thanos controls the fate of the universe with his Infinity Gems. The players include X-Men, Avengers, Spider-Man, Fantastic Four, Warlock, Dr Strange. If you like to see things blow up, Starlin delivers. (The universe becomes an immense battlefield for the alien gods.) If you want to see someone at last handle the psychology of a super-villain in a convincing manner, Starlin delivers. (Why is Thanos so bad? Jim answers loud and clear.) And if you want a plot that's both formulaic but new, this one delivers. (Like Star Wars.)I also enjoyed the Infinity War series, so I hope Marvel reprints that one."},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"When this originally came out i was big into the Silver Surfer, and read most anything with him in it. Then out of what seemed nowhere came Thanos. I'd never seen him before and didn't know his past with Captain Marvel and his love of Death. (the entity and embodiment) I only needed to read a couple surfer comics and the first two issues of this series to realize Thanos is the most evil and interesting villain in the marvel universe. In this collection he has attained god-like powers. (as told in the silver surfer trade \\"rebirth of thanos\\") Hes used his powers to thin out half the universes population. Whats left of the mightiest heroes earth has assembles with Adam Warlock and Silver Surfer to confront Thanos once and for all. And the result is one of most climactic battles ever put to print. I cannot recommend this book enough. If you like marvel and space oddesys it seriously DOES NOT GET BETTER THAN THIS. Its been around 15 years since this came out and i can still pick it up and read it any time. You'll be glad you bought it."},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"This set of stories is definitely among the best works of fiction ever to reach the printed page! The most important characters such as Captain America, Silver Surfer, and Thanos are handled flawlessly. The entire first five sections just keep building the suspense and you are wondering the entire time &quot;how are the good guys going to win?&quot; and we find out in the sixth. This book shows why Marvel comics are the best because we care about the characters. The book also has Captain America's defining moment: at the end of the battle only Cap stands. He walks up to the God-like Thanos. His shield is destroyed and Thanos brings his fist towards him. Captain America stands there, defiance to the last. The look in his eye, captured perfectly by Ron Lim says it all. In short, if you are a fan of comics, or even if you aren't and want to see why so many of us feel like the characters are friends and, in some cases like Captain America, even good role models, then buy this book!"},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"Having seen the Avengers movie, I wondered who that odd looking fellow with the menacing grin was in the post-credits scene and did some googling when I got back home. His name is Thanos and the info I read pointed toward a book that does the character the best justice - \\"The Infinity Gauntlet\\" - and luckily my local library had a copy so I grabbed it and sat down this afternoon to read it.While the book is 20 years old at this point, I loved it. But what's it about? It's about Thanos and his love for Mistress Death (yup Death is a chick but readers of Neil Gaiman's Sandman series already knew this), he's trying to win her over and he decides to do this by getting unlimited power via something called the Infinity Gauntlet and destroying the universe. Really, this is the weirdest romance story you'll ever read.And that's the premise of the book. Thanos must be stopped but how do you stop a being with infinite power, who is in essence God? The Marvel superheroes decide to give it a go and things inevitably don't work, so a strange entity called Adam Warlock gathers together the ultimate beings of the universe in a final battle to end all battles. The results are pretty impressive.The scale is gargantuan with a being called Eternity weighing into the fight, along with other beings called Chronos, Master Chaos and even manifestations of Love and Hate. Things get very abstract when planets become weapons to be hurled at Thanos and something called the Soul Realm comes into play. I won't spoil how it ends but it's all pretty epic and sensational.Jim Starlin writes a vast and fascinating story about love and power amidst new gods. He keeps the action up and the mysticism and cosmic weirdness going throughout while still maintaining a sense of plot, character, and story so the reader is never fully lost in what's happening. George Perez's artwork, while clearly dated, serves the story perfectly and does a fine job of depicting a near impossible task of unimaginable proportions.I wonder how Thanos' introduction in the Avengers movie sequel will affect the tone of the flick - if Whedon and co. go down this path, the next movie is going to be supremely weird and cosmic really quickly, a huge leap from where the Marvel movies have been so far. But maybe they won't pick up the \\"Infinity Gauntlet\\" storyline and go another direction. Meanwhile, any comics readers who are looking for a mind-bending read in the Marvel Universe would do well to pick up this book - even if the movies won't go there, the comics will and it's definitely worth the trip."},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"This volume collects Infinity Gauntlet #1-6 which is a pretty complete story on it's own. Now,Silver Surfer: Rebirth of Thanosdoes include the events that lead up to the Inifity Gauntlet, but flashbacks and other exposition cover the vital information from that collection as well as the backstories of most of the major players.The story is basically this. A villian by the name of Thanos has aquired the Infinity Gauntlet which is powered by the Infinity Gems giving ultimate power essentially making him God. He is in love with the female personification of Death and as his gift to her he kills half of the sentient life in the universe with the snap of his fingers. On Earth, heros unite with cosmic gaurdians in a last futile stand against a mad god at the end of the Universe. This story has everyone. Adam Warlock, Thanos, Silver Sufer, Galactus, The Watcher, Wolverine, the Hulk, the Avengers, the X-Men, Dr. Strange, Quasar, Dr. Doom, Mephisto, and many more.Pretty much anyone who was anyone back in 1991 is in this. The art is absolutely gorgeous and the story is beyond epic. Space, time, and reality are bent, broken, and destroyed in a cosmic struggle to stop Thanos. I can't recommend this enough. Sequels to this story includeInfinity War (Marvel Comics),Infinity Crusade - Volume 1 (v. 1), andInfinity Crusade - Volume 2 (v. 2). All of which I've read and recommend."},{"Title":"The Infinity Gauntlet","review":"In my opinion this is one of the most wonderful sagas of Marvel Comics of all time. I say that because Thanos is the most brilliant characters of superhero stories, smarter than cosmic entities. Years ago, when this story was published at the first time, we already were waiting for a new Thanos saga, after the cosmic cube saga against Captain Marvel and Earth's superheroes. But a story against all the main Marvel's cosmic entities was really a big surprise. And the idea of the gems with different powers, used in amalgam was priceless. And the conclusion is amazing. In the past we had some other great sagas, like Beyonder's saga (Secret Wars, a milestone in Marvel universe...), but nothing like that... Thanos is impressive, smart, brillant, evil, powerful and sometimes funny. This is one of my favorite villains in comic books and this is my favorite story with him..."},{"Title":"The world at my shoulder","review":"This book, The World At My Shoulder, is a fascinating autobiography of Eunice Tietjens, a now obscure but once prominent poet.Perhaps more than her writing, her legacy is strongest in conjunction with the many prominent poets and artists she met and knew, and with being one of the original staff members of Poetry magazine, in assisting Harriet Monroe with her ambitious publication.But this book is one of the pieces of her writing that I think could help reignite her importance as a writer.This autobiography is an epic chronicle that takes you from her fairly uneventful childhood in Evanston, Illinois to Europe, where she went with her mother at the age of fourteen, after Her father died tragically when she was thirteen.Then back to America and her first marriage to Paul Tietjens, a composer best known for the original musical of The Wizard of Oz...once they divorce, it's a bit later that she discovers poetry and realizes that this is her mission in life, to be a poet.Japan long before World War II...China before the Boxer Rebellion...Tunisia as a French colony...the South Seas not that many years from when Gauguin went to them...all of these are detailed, as well as the thriving artistic world of Chicago in the earlier twentieth-century, and back to Europe again whereshe details her amazing and brutal experiences as a war correspondent for the Chicago Daily News during World War I, as well as many exciting artistic adventures and experiences.Although most of the passages in the book are prose (except for quoted poems), they could only be written by a poet either in the formal sense or the spiritual sense.Some of the vocabulary is a little old-fashioned, and I would suggest making notes of words that you don't understand on a piece of paper with the page number and looking them up later.That way, you don't have to interrupt the flow of reading, as I often did, when I read this book a few years back. All in all, I think it is a wonderful book, and if you can find copies of her poetry books or her poetry in an anthology (probably one that dates before the 50s, which I think was the last decade she was included in Louis Untemeyer's Modern American Poetry, for instance) or on the Internet where there are copies of a few of her public-domain works, then it would be well worth it.For her to be obscure to the extent that she is and for her work to be all out of print is definitely unfortunate. We all must be so thankful for used books, and the ability to find them on the web today!Read this book and be taken back to a world that no longer exists, one of the wonderful things that can happen through reading certain kinds of writing."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"I have been an avid fan of this series of books since it first published. So when I saw a new book in the series was out I couldn't wait to get my hands on it.First, please note this book was NOT written by Eric Flint. Although he did some writing for it, the bulk is essentially fan-fiction.Second, A very large portion of this book deals with poorly written stories about a Goat with poor hair trying to mate with the female sheep. Frankly, I have no interest in this type of story. Additionally, I realize that one has to suspend ones disbelief to read sci-fi/fantasy, but some of what I liked about this series was the well researched nature of it. To think that an American town whisked back to the 1600's and involved in major war operations would spend its time and resources putting on ballet, making video's about, and glamorizing a Ram is pretty farfetched.There are occasionally well written chapters or such as the chapter about Suhl, but overall this book is a waste of money and in my opinion an insult to the fans."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"The authors have taken the opportunity to publish a book of which they wrote only a small portion. The plot progresses through the snippets of first-time writers. This book is not a part of the series but an attempt to milk the series for all it's worth. (See also Grantville Gazette I,II, III).Instead of a cogent style, the book is pieced together from snippets available elsewhere. As a result the book fails to tell a cogent story, forcing the reader to parse disparate language and editorial differences from section to section."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"Very, very disappointing. I loved 1632, liked 1633, was luke warm over the Gallileo book, and really disliked this one. Sad to see a great idea/series start go downhill so fast. The \\"humor\\" in this book is mildly ammusing for the first 10 pages or so then increasing sophmoric and boring for the next 50 pages. I scanned the last 50 pages and then ash canned this turkey. Save your money. I hope \\"CAnnon Law\\" returns to the quality of the first book, but the blurb on it is not promising. Most readers, like me, don't really care how many angels can dance on the head of a 17th century pin and get really bored with endless minutia about religious arguments.

It isn't an anthology of commonly themed stories in fact there are 4 very different sets of stories. It isn't the type of book where the main author writes a skeleton and guests fill in appropriate stories as is seen in Science Fiction and in The Academy: Tales of the Marketplace by Laura Antoniou (BTW read my review before considering purchase). Instead it is a crazy quilt of stories which illustrate the Americans interactions with the native Germans. The first third of the book has three main themes: German land law and how to deal with it (Birdie's struggles to buy more land for his farm), Brillo and how he (a Ram) becomes a symbol and celebrity and lastly in A Night at The Ballet how the American ballet teacher overcomes snobbish attitudes of the German upper crust and Nobles. The last two thirds of the book is set in Franconia which is classically set up for a disaster. The Americans (called the NUS for now) administer it; but only the Catholic parts (Gustavus Adolphus' Protestant allies are exempt). Unfortunately Catholics and at least some of the Protestants are intermixed and the NUS has no real forces to enforce authority. When the rebellion starts the cheif leader calls himself \\"Helmut speaking for the Ram\\" having recently read a copy of Doc Smiths Galactic Patrol. The attempts of the Americans to figure out his motives are amusing. Also is the fact that the rebels choose Brillo as their symbol. While this is a pretty good read it isn't as coherent as it could be with a lot of threads and different characters as well as writers leading so some inconsistencies."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"....unless you have nothing else to spend your money on. I am a great fan of the other books, especially 1633, but this one is a poorly, maybe even unethically, conceived project. Many of the \\"stories\\" contained in the book were written by non-professional writers, and it really shows. Apparently many of them are available on the web, which makes the decision to publish them in book form, without warning the purchaser, rather iffy, in my opinion. The theme that is supposed to hold everything together, \\"Brillo\\" and his use as a symbol for a new form of government, is just, well, lame. The songs are unbelievably tedious, and the idea is not ever presented coherently.Pass on this one, save your money for 1634: The Baltic War."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"First I have to take culpability for buying this book. I did not look at it thoroughly before I bought it. That is my personal mistake and I cannot and do not hold the authors responsible for that.Now the book - I do hold the authors responsible for this and more importantly the publisher. This is a terrible book. A series of little snippets here and there somehow tied to the original 1632 book. Remember reading your high school newspaper? If you don't remember - this book will remind you of it. The level of writing is, in many cases sophomoric. The main thrust (those who have read the book will understand the play on words) is a combination of tales of a determined sheep and an anti-government diatribe. Now I am all for an anti-government diatribe, especially today, but the anti-government diatribe primarily is coming from people who are forming a new government and making the same mistakes the governments they deplore do. So even the anti-government diatribe is sophomoric.I am saving the worst for last - most of this \\"book\\" might be available free on the web.So to close I am giving myself a half star for buying the book.

Left to his own devices, however, or with a lesser editor, he becomes lost in the twists and twirls of his own highly nuanced world. He has a difficult time sustaining realistic characters. (Pretty much the same set of heros again and again.) Here, another reviewer compared this to reading a high school newspaper, which is apt -- but more likely one will find as much benefit reading off of Flint's fan website and finding that various folks have given additional life to his characters in his alternate universe.

I found this to be an enjoyable (and educational) read. OK, maybe there was one too many Brillo stories, but the next time I see the Nutcracker Suite I will watch it with new eyes. I confess to being a hard core action reader who rolled his eyes when I got to 'A Night at the Ballet' but I was pleasently suprised. To those complaining about 'amaturish' stories, this was not one of them! They say 'write what you know' and Kerryn Offord obviously knows a lot more about ballet than I do. I came away from reading it knowing a bit more than I did going in while having enjoyed the experience. That's a mark of good writing. Good work Kerryn! You have the knack. Keep at it.For those complaining that 'The Ram Rebellion' was a collection of short stories instead of a novel,I found that they made enough of a coherent whole that I simply read them as chapters in a larger tale. In all, an interesting experiment in storytelling. It may be that the technique lends itself to pacing problems and a larger than normal cast of characters to keep track of, but I did not find either to be a show stopper, especially with the final novella by Eric Flint and Virginia DeMarce pulling it all together in the last quarter.

This book is about nation building. I really enjoyed it, although parts are a bit amateurish. I think overall it showed the complexity of events, in a slightly non-linear fashion, and how history is made up of people and individual decisions.

Unfortunately, the West Virginians don't have the manpower or resources to officially control all of these lands--much less to impose their democratic political structure on a location where many of the local nobles are strong allies of Adolphus. Even Grantville leader and ex-union leader Mike Stearns knows that his revolutionary committees can't do the complete job. Still, sending a few bureaucrats seems like an exercise in futility.In a series of stories and a short novel, Eric Flint, Virginia DeMarce, and a number of other authors describe the development of democracy in Franconia, one of the areas deeded over to Grantville. Beginning with micro-stories of Grantville itself--the issues of land ownership as a West Virginia farmer tries to purchase enough land for a profitable farm, of breeding high-wool sheep, and creating a ballet company, the story then broadens into the activities of various Americans and allied Germans as they attempt to create a new world.What makes the 1632 series fresh and interesting is that it builds the story--and the political/economic success of the West Virginians and the incipient democracy they create--upon ordinary people. A small farmer wants to buy some land--and exposes the complexities of ownership--and a partial solution. A woman wants sheep with good wool--and accidentally launches a symbol of the eventual revolution. A woman wants to see the Nutcracker ballet--and introduces this part of modern culture to the world of 1634. Ultimately, it is the Germans, the 'downtimers' as the West Virginians refer to them, who must create the revolution that will allow democracy to succeed. By design, therefore, 1634: THE RAM REBELLION avoids the pitched battles and movement of armies that is common in alternate history.Sympathetic as I am with Flint and Co.'s intention, not all of the stories that make up this collection are worth reading. Stories of Brillo, the Ram, are important only in that they symbolize the ultimate agricultural revolt. We could have done with a three page summary rather than the 100+ pages they got. Some of the stories--Bypass Surgery, for example, combine clever ideas and sound economics. Others seemed simplistic, as does the ultimate revolution itself.1634: THE RAM REBELLION is important in that it looks at what happens after the big war, after the conquering heroes have used their superweapons and defeated the enemy. As Flint and Co. point out, winning the hearts and minds of the survivors is harder. Too often, SF avoids this--as if winning a battle automatically means that the ideals of the victors will prevail or even survive. It's a tough delivery--and one that, RAM doesn't always achieve. Still, it's a worthwhile attempt."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"This is not a novel, it is a themed collection of short stories, much like the Thieves World books edited by Robert Aspirin. What I like about this book and the Madgeburg Gazette anthologies is that most of the stories center around every day life in Thirty Years War Germany. Heck, I think all high school sociology and political science teachers should require their students to read these anthologies. This is not concerned with the Baltic war series in anyway, acknowledged by Flint, but it does tell a necesary story about how the New United States operates in areas it has primary jurisdiction. The origins of Bristle The Ram, and how he became the inspiration of the German Farmers is funny, but how an industry can be developed is why the stories are important. I especially like the ballet story and I liked how the many seperate stories lead to a German Farmers revolt. The look at German law and customs of that time is fascinating, and so are the customs. What you aren't going to get is a novel or big combat scenes. What you get is a study of how revolutions are started, and how they can be steered to minimize the damage that most revbolutions cause. If you want BIG conflicts and HUGE heroes look somewhere alse, but if you want interesting characters and good storytelling buy it now!"},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"This book is a frame tale: a collection of stories within an overall theme. They lead into each other, but are separate entities in themselves as well. Some stories on big themes, some on little ones, a lot of humor, and the bad guys get their just desserts. As the authors stipulate, history is random and contingent, and this is an excellent illustration of that concept. I've probably read this one six times, and it improves with every read. The only other author I can say that about is Bujold. Read it! Read it now! Buy copies for all your friends!!"},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"The Ram Rebellion by Eric Flint, et al continues to develop the 1632 alternate history universe.

Then don't bother with this book. It is another anthology and it is by far the worst of the lot. I am sure the writers thought that these stories about the antics of a goat were hilarious, I however found them tedious and after I was on page 100 and the book was STILL going on about domestic farm life and the antics of a perfectly ordinary goat I just couldn't go on any further. Please no more anthologies.

I have bought every book as soon as the come out, and enjoyed each immensely. This is not a novel in the normal definition. It is a collection of stories, kind of like the Gazette, except the Gazette is interesting. I was bored frankly with the stories. I normally read a book in less than a day, but this one took me over 4 days, because i just could not get interested, I just finished it to keep me in the story and to ensure I would not miss anything for future books."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"I love Eric Flint's stories, but he sure missed the mark on this one. Endless pages of politics, religion, too many nobles, margraves, etc., to ever keep track of. The actual rebellion of the title doesn't take place until the very last pages and is supposedly helped along by some very silly stories about a downtime scruffy ram owned by an uptime farmer's wife, who keeps impregnating her pure blood Merino ewes and producing so-so wool. Also, looooong and boring stories about a ballet company started by an uptime ballet teacher, and which has nothing at all to do with the so called \\"ram rebellion\\". Also, he has too many uptime Americans kowtowing to the downtime \\"nobles\\" , which I find hard to believe. American's don't even kowtow to their own president, mayors, etc. I believe most of this book was written by others, and not well, either. I did struggle and finish this book, but only by skipping tons of pages to get to some action. I don't recommend this book if you are looking for a good follow up on his 1632 book. Not worth it."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (2006) is the second theme anthology in the Ring of Fire Series. Like the first such anthology, Ring of Fire, these collected stories are shaped around a common sequence of events; in this case, the stories depict the origins and episodes of the peasant revolt in Franconia. In contrast, the Grantville Gazette stories cover a wide variety of subjects within the general (fictionalized) history of the United States of Europe.This work is separated into four parts, containing one or more stories. The first three segments include everything from brief scenarios to longer stories. The last segment contains a novella length description of the actual revolt.The first segment, Recipes for Revolution, introduces the official and unofficial actions toward modernizing the 17th century. In Cookbooks, three short scenes between Mike Stearns and Melissa Mailey set forth the beginnings of an official policy. Yet, two other stories depict the efforts of Birdie Newsome to establish clear title to additional farm land.The second segment, Enter the Ram, contains three stories about the origins of an enhanced wool industry in Grantville. They also introduce the legends of Brillo the Ram, which somehow become entwined with the organization of the new League of Women Voters. The last tale presents these legends in the mode of a ballet, which leads to the formation of a professional ballet company in Grantville.The third segment, The Trouble in Franconia, illustrates the effects of these popular legends of Brillo among villagers in numerous hamlets within Franconia, leading certain people to read other up-timer publications. For example, the Frankenwinheim village school teacher, Constatin Ableidinger, is much impressed by the German translation of Common Sense, indeed to the point of becoming an activist. Tommy Paine is fully capable of stirring up trouble even prior to his own birth.The fourth segment, The Ram Revolution, consists of a single story tying all these diverse storylines into a single political movement. For the most part, the Grantville contingent stands back and watches the Ram organization take care of the opposition, with one exception. The town council of Gerolzhofen continues to provoke the up-timers to the point of a final solution.The editor of this work admits that classifying the volume is very difficult. In fact, it is much like history itself, which just doesn't fit into neat categories without some trimming here and there. The editor also admits his adversion to the Great Persons view of history, so the tales herein suggest an alternate viewpoint.The Ram revolution is sparked by a farmer who wants to use his talents more extensively, a school teacher inspired by a long dead (or not yet born) revolutionary, a Mormon who never did his youthful missionary service, and other ordinary people following their personal interests. Of course, no real revolt would have so many instigators leading by example and with such a powerful appeal; the Ring of Fire deposited about 5000 agents of change in the midst of one of the worst examples of political madness in history. The responses to these exemplars are destructive to existing laws, yet are ultimately supportive of democratic ideals.Highly recommended for fans of the Ring of Fire series and for anyone else who enjoys tales of history happening from the bottom up.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"I understand the attempt here. Flint has expressed often enough his view (correct, I believe) that history isn't just a neat \\"A happened, then B, then C\\" sort of thing. Things happen all over the place simultaneously, having unpredictable consequences, coming back later to have still other consequences. This book appears to be an attempt to tell a story that encompasses that.Which leads to my title. Nice try.Part of the problem lies in the amateurish quality of some of the writing, as mentioned by other reviewers. And due to the episodic nature of the story, just when you find a non-amateurish author, his/her story is almost done. I think a larger problem, though, is that, in the attempt to show how many different threads come together to make history, there's far too much of a feel of \\"Where did THAT come from?\\". And unlike real history, with fiction it is very easy to create connections that, even in hindsight, seem so tenuous as to be utterly ridiculous. Several of which are found here.Don't go into this one thinking to read a little bit here, a little bit there-this is the first of the 1632 series (which I absolutely love, for the most part) in which I had to force myself to finish the book, over three weeks (unlike the more usual \\"read it all in one sitting because it's so darned good)."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"Bottom line: Read this book only if you are a hard-core 1632-verse fan, but skip it otherwise. Even then, you may want to just check it out of your local library instead of buying it new.This book is not a novel, but rather a decidedly mixed bag of short stories. The Brillo stories get tiresome after the second one, but are somewhat digestible.By far the worst of the lot was \\"A Night at the Ballet,\\" which is written in a breathless but pedestrian style that makes it clear the author thinks 'high society' and the landed nobility are worthy of adulation--quite a different view from the rest of the 1632 series so far. This story is not only somewhat boring, but so jarring in its tone and outlook that I find it puzzling that Flint included it in this volume, which deals with a peasant revolt against the nobility. Personally, I think Flint's view of the nobility is too negative, but Kerryn Offord goes way overboard in the opposite direction.The final novella is not bad, and it does tie together most of the other stories in the book (except for \\"A Night at the Ballet\\"). It does not, however, make up for the mixed bag of tales that fill the rest of the book."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"I have to say that after becoming immersed in 1632 and enjoying 1633, I feel like the author's pretty much abandoned the project to whoever wants to publish some small snippet. This was the worst of the series by far and I actually just gave up on it half way though which I never ever do to fiction. I truly wanted to see the author embrace this universe and allow me to come along for an enjoyable ride. Looks like it's not going to happen. Probably need to hold off or write your own version since that's kind of what got published anyway."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"I have every single Ring Of Fire book, and in general, the series is among my favorite sci-fi works. Except for this one. This book is not only almost unrelated to the rest of the series internally, it consists of a series of incredibly inane anecdotes about raising sheep and rabbits. Certainly the dullest sci-fi book I own. The ONLY reason to read this one is because it's referenced from later works, in particular 1635 - The Dreeson Incident. You'd think that a character in a sci-fi novel should have a story at least as interesting as a normal person in real life - and this book sure misses that goal. Unless you're really, really keen on reading short children's stories about anthropomorphic rams (the sheep kind), this book is sure to disappoint.Skip this one - you'll thank me later."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"The Book is a collection of stories in Four parts.Part 1. Recipes for Revolution is set in 1631 and 1632. It's chiefly two stories about \\"Birdy\\" Newhouse, a farmer on the border of 'The Ring of Fire' who lost acreage in the transfer across time and wants to rent or buy extra land from the local German owners. This presents problems and opportunities which form the basis of the stories. There are also three short glimpses of Mike Stearns with Melissa Mailey.Part 2. Enter the Ram introduces Flo Richards, a farmer's wife with four grown children who had bought a small flock of type C Delaine Merino sheep and some angora rabbits before the RoF in the hope that she'd see more of her youngest daughter once she'd finished her studies out of town. The RoF had left Jan, the daughter behind, and Flo was dealing with this loss by concentrating on her livestock. She, and JD, her husband have local Germans living with them as partners now that farming has become more labour intensive. Flo's laments about the poor quality wool of the locally obtained ram (who comes to be known as Brillo for that reason) stike a chord with some-one and before long a number of 'Brillo fables' appear in the local broadsheet.Flo Richards has mixed feelings about Brillo. He has escaped from his pen and interfered with her merino breeding program, yet his fame due to the stories spread through Grantville out into the rest of Germany. The Women's League of Voters uses a Ram's Head as its emblem, schoolchildren sing songs about Brillo and Elizabeth \\"Bitty\\" Matowski, introduces Ballet to the down-timers with a Brillo ballet.Part 3. The Trouble in Franconia begins in December 1632 with the King of Sweden, Gustavus Adolphus having assigned the administration of those parts of Franconia that were Catholic to the New United States (NUS). They don't have the manpower to occupy the province and there are actually pockets of resistance in at least two fortresses that the Swedish King simply bypassed in his conquest. These, and other things have to be dealt with by a mixture of up-timers and down-timers. All this sets the scene for the longest story in the book.Part 4. The Ram Rebellion. In Franconia, a schoolteacher has been reading \\"Common Sense\\" by Tom Paine. He also finds the Brillo stories interesting. The farmers in Franconia (and Thuringia for that matter) have a history of dissent concerning serfdom and Mike Stearns has hopes of getting some fundamental changes made in the way that Franconia is run as a result of a farmer's rebellion of sorts. He neglects to include this in the briefing given to the civil servants sent down to administer Franconia although Johnny F. and Noelle Murphy, among others have an effect on the schoolteacher's \\"Ram rebellion\\".I think that this book gives useful background about developments outside of the main geo-political story where the greater history of Europe is taking place. Franconia is a local area where things are happenning to local people. I've only given it three stars because although it is entertaining and fleshes out the story-line I think it is an optional addition to the main story of Grantville in the Thirty Years War.Anyone who gets into the series to the extent of The Grantville Gazette and Baen's Bar in the internet will probably find this book a useful addition to their entertainment."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"I liked this book as a series of related short stories. I liked how it provieds some additional background about what's going on in this new time line. It was nice to see how things are chaning in the area around Grantville. I emjoyed reading this, even though most of the writers aren't at the same level as Flint. However, I think the next book in the series from Flint is long over do."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"I love the RoF series. I love the politics, intrigue, planing, and military actions. But this book is borderline horrible! The Ram Rebellion was fun for the first 20 to 30 pages, but then it just got old. Simply felt like bad filler in a worse dinner. How many pages about a dance instructor trying to figure out how to get a dance company up and running? It became a Seinfeld show. A book about 'nothing'. I have read maybe 1000 sci-fi/fantasy books. I can count on one hand how many I have just given up on or skipped through. This is one of them. This is the equivalent of a modern day reality show about little to nothing. Some may like that, some may love that. Good for you. I feel ripped off in time and money.I wont buy any more written by VD."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"To me, the best recommendation for a book is how often I re-read it after I have read it the first time. For example, most of my copies of Robert Heinlein's books and early Tom Clancy novels are almost worn out. By that note, this book gets low marks, unlike other books in this series. It is slow and confusing. Fans of the series probably should read this book as it does contain information important to other books in the series, but these are characters and stories you will soon forget. I have."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"Sorry about the terrible pun in the review title, given the subject matter of this book. But the book is a death march--a long slog through trivia that might be fascinating to a few Baen's Bar fanatics, but which the rest of us find pretty boring. The greatest thing about 1632 was the fact that it told a great story, which was strong enough to hold the history that was hung all over it. The storytelling isn't nearly as strong here, and the history weighs it down. Recommended for die-hard 1632 fans only."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"I'm surprised at all the 1-star reviews for this book. I actually thought it was quite good and told an important story that most likely would have made a rather dull novel. Like many other reviewers, I was more fond of the short stories in the first half of the book than the novella by Flint and DeMarce that finishes it. The stories of Brillo the Ram and his rise to fame are highly entertaining, and whoever thought of using him to inspire the Franconian uprising deserves some serious kudos. Kerryn Offord's \\"The Night at the Ballet\\" was surprisingly good, even though it didn't tie in with the major plot line very well. I never would have thought a story about ballet dancing would have impressed me, but I guess you just never know.The major story thread is the 'modernization' of personal rights in the Fanconian provinces. Land ownership, voting rights, and such for people living in territories of the New United States isn't really an exciting-seeming subject, but by telling these stories from the perspective of regular people, this book really brings the story to life. While written by a number of different authors with varying skill, most of the stories are focused on a common theme and tie in together nicely. No large battles or extremely important events occur here, but its still and entertaining book.One reviewer griped about not being able to keep track of all the characters. I didn't find this to be too much of a problem, but I did read the book fairly quickly. I can certainly see difficulties if you typically read books over long periods or many short sessions. There is a helpful listing of characters and maps at the beginning of the book.All in all, this book does an excellent job of telling an important aspect of the Ring of Fire story, and manages to do so in an entertaining way."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"The early in this book are fun and enjoyable reads. The later stories I found slower with the exception of the final climax of the book. This scene builds up through several of the stories to the final event and it suddenly occurs and is done with. There is less explanation of these final events than I found to be satisfactory. But it is in a series that I really like so it was still enjoyable. For those who do not like the deep intrigue of politics this may not be a favorite after the first couple of stories."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"Thank goodness this book has maps with it! Well, this book continues the saga of Grantville, a West Virginia town suddenly transported into the midst of the Thirty Years War. In this book, the New U.S. has been given the German territory of Franconia to administer by King Gustavus Adolphus. This has the potential for a great story but the way it is written and assembled is disjointed. Still, if you have patience and you've liked what you've seen so far in this series it should be worth it to get all the way through."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"I'm one of those fans waiting for the main line novels to be published. Meanwhile, here is yet another enjoyable filler book that provides a fleshing out of the entire timeline.I'm very happy that the non-canon 'Brillo' stories have been made canon and incorporated into this book. For those not familiar with the story, Brillo is a downtime ram whose only ambition in life is to get acquainted with some uptime ewes. Just how these stories provide the basis for a rebellion in Franconia and headaches for the uptime administration of that region make for a very enjoyable book.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"While this book isn't quite up to the standards of the previous books in the 1632 series, it's still a good read. A bit more analytical and lacking the \\"big names in history\\" factor of it's predecessors, it manages to remain entertaining while examining the ground-level effects of the intersection of modern social mores with 15th century German societal unrest. Fans of the series should be well-satisfied with the book."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"I need to start out by saying I thoroughly enjoyed 1632 and 1633 and am an avid fan of alternate history novels. That said, wow, this book has been some serious work to get through. With a cast of over 50 characters (many who go by several names) and multiple stories cobbled together, this book is all over the place. I tend to read in small sessions and this book is not conducive to that at all. This book is only for the die hard fans of the series, and then only for those who like stories about tedious political maneuvering.This counts as strike two against the entire series, with 1643: The Galileo Affair being the first. Mr. Flint needs to get this series back on track and stop focusing on these side stories. The main story line is solid and makes for great novels. Save these side stories for the short story compilations where they belong. I will try 1634: The Baltic War next, but if it is strike three, then I'm done with the series."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"my husband loves this series.

Maybe five pages worth of rebellion or plot development, 200 pages of dry political education, and 100 pages on ballet recitals. Dry and pointless reading."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"I've read all the previous entries in the Grantville Universe and enjoyed most of them quite a bit. But where the use of various writers and short stories worked well for a time, the quality of the writing has been steadily decreasing.The Ram Rebellion reads as a book totally abandoned by Eric Flint and handled almost entirely by the Regulars at Baen's Bar. I understand Baen's practice of pairing up-and-coming writers with more established writers in order to develop new talent and further the plot of popular series. It's worked well in the past.Here it simply failed. I'm about 1/5 through the book and am so tired of the lackluster writing, the sophomoric humor and the terribly slow plot progression that I'm putting it away for good. I'm probably unlikely to read the rest of the series because it's reached a point where having Flint's name on the cover is totally meaningless and not at all representative of the quality of writing to be expected within."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"It all started with the sheep. Well, actually, the ram - Brillo. In this volume of the alternative history series from 1632 we are treated to a book that is actually a look at how to develop 17th Century German citizens into 20th Century Americans. However, the way this is done is to first develop the humorous character of Brillo, and then develop Brillo into a major reason for the transformation. Overall it works, but you have to stick with this story to really get into it.As regular readers of the series know, the main idea of the whole series is to explore what might have happened if somehow a 20th Century town from West Virginia in the U.S.A. got somehow transported back in time to the early 17th Century and dislocated physically to central Germany so it actually lands in the middle of the 30 year war. This concept has blossomed and grown and there is a whole group of people who are working on building the concept and taking it into various areas that the original authors did not consider. The result of these on-line discussions has been a series of books that explore those other areas. This is one of those books. While the book jacket claims two co-authors, you will quickly realize that there are a series of short stories enveloped in this book that were written by more people. All of these mini-stories coalesce around the Ram known as Brillo, and they all relate to the ram in one way or the other. Of course the ram is just a fable that was built to create an allegory for the politics that are the main discussion of the book. The good news in this approach is that you can always chuckle at the ways in which the ram is brought up and kind of ignore that political science portions. My one complaint about this book though is that the middle sections of it get to be very heavy reading as the political science gets deep. I mean, did we really need a whole section of this book to be excerpts from Thomas Paine's \\"Common Sense\\" and then discussions of how it might apply to this fictional Germany? This was rather turgid writing and took me quite a bit of time to get through.On the other hand, there is a lot of good work here as the various stories are interrelated and connected. To a much greater extent than other books in this series, we read in one story about some event that takes place, and then another story refers to the same event, but finally we get to read the story of the event itself, and then later stories explain how that event helped move the overall volume forward. On the negative side, I always get concerned with books that have to have six pages of the Cast of Characters! My god, will I really need to refer to this as I read this thing? On the positive side, significant amounts of these people have appeared in other books. So, this is not the first time you read of Mike Stearns, Ed Piazza, et al. And some of the people who are new to this volume are clearly people who will appear again in other volumes in the series.So, as you can see, this is a mixed bag of a book. From the multiple storylines, through the multiple authors, and the multiple approaches, this is not a great book, nor is it a fiasco. I think it is better than some of the other volumes I have read the series, but it is also not as good as many. All of which explains why I am giving this book three stars, although I am more inclined to have awarded it three and a half stars- if only I could."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"This is the first-published (and, I think, weakest overall but still very good) volume of what I would term the Side-Group of the Ring of Fire (ROF) hypernovel, and the only (so far) of what Eric Flint (EF) calls a braided-story anthology. Besides this, the Side-Group includes (so far)1634: The Bavarian Crisis,1635: The Dreeson Incident, and1635: The Tangled Web. Several of the characters (e.g. Constantin Ableidinger) who appear first in this Side-Group later find their way into the main sequence, which begins with1632.The title novelette is worth the price of the book, and several of the shorter stories are excellent as well, especially Kerryn Offord's \\"A Night at the Ballet,\\" ***** (and this from a reviewer who finds ballet utterly boring); they are like icing on the cake, making the book that much more than worth the price. The weak point, in my estimation, is the Brillo stories, which cumulatively are like a joke told too many times. The first telling may be hilarious, but it gets older with each retelling, until it becomes just tiresome. And Brillo himself speaking is already old by the second word and gets much older with each word that follows.But perhaps the best reason to read this volume is that is contains some of the backstory for later volumes of the main sequence of the greatest alternate history yet.HISTORY TEACHERS ATTENTION: This and the other volumes of RoF provide a very enjoyable way to learn about life in early seventeenth century Europe.[...]"},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"A good sidebar to the \\"1632\\" series of books.

I've read four so far."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"The hard part about writing a review for this book is that it is an anthology followed by the (main) novella. The intention is noble (read the introduction by Eric Flint for details) - to collect the short fan fiction originally destined for the Gazettes into a coherent whole to tell the story from the \\"common man's\\" POV.Interestingly, the anthology authors are quite entertaining (for the most part), especially the Brillo stories =]. Then the novella begins and I had a really really hard time getting through the rest. One problem is an overabundance of characters with detailed histories, neither of which are too relevant to the plot. It's the first book I've ever read where I had to continually keep skipping to the character list at the start of the book (part of the problem was that so many of the characters were thoroughly interchangeable in terms of personality and \\"voice\\", despite the detailed histories - as if the author had forgotten to use different templates for different characters). In some parts, it reads like an old ladies' gossip club (with weirdly detailed family histories that I actually started skipping through after the Nth time I encountered one). After reading MANY books by Eric Flint, I feel reasonably confident that it didn't feel like he had written much of the novella part *shrug*.If you split the anthology and the novella, I would give the anthology 4 stars and the novella 2 stars (figured on an average of 3 =P). I know the Baltic war will be good (Flint and Weber - how could it not?) but I'm apprehensive about the rest of the series - DeMarce features on too many of the later books."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"The Ram Rebellion details the exploits of the citizens of Grantville as they attempt to bring democracy to war-ravaged 17th century Germany. This installment in the Ring of Fire series is told in a series of short stories (written by many authors) from many points of view. In fact, there are too many points of view to make this tale anything beyond lackluster. There are too many \\"main\\" characters to focus on and we only really get to know a meager handful of them in any depth. (Despite this, some of the characters are quite interesting). This story would have been much better served had the multitude of authors focused on three or four characters instead of twenty or thirty.This tale succeeded, however, in one significant way. The primary author, Flint, makes it a point to mention in the preface that history is never made entirely by the \\"hero\\", but is lifted up and molded by the ordinary people swirling around the hero. The Ram Rebellion succeeds in highlighting this fact. Yes, there were too many characters to focus on. But those characters are creating history...and we get to read all about it.Despite this installment of the Ring of Fire's mediocrity, I am looking forward to reading more about the citizenry of Grantville as they struggle to make a new life for themselves in old Germany. I believe it is a story worth continuing."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"Some of the stories in here are great and others are just heavy reading. The editor needed to remove some of the preachy and slow moving ones which unfortunately make up over half the book. The first stores about Brillo the Ram are hilarious and as a sheep raiser (Romney and Border Leicester) I can vouch for their authenticity. I too have had problems with tricky rams who want to breed when you don't want them to. Ewes have no concept of a standard and are going to breed who they want if you give them a choice or they can make one. After we get away from Brillo and his escapades and the musical that is made by the drama club on him which is quite entertaining,it got boring very quickly. There are one or two more stories after that that are good but the rest unfortunately are not. If you are looking for an irreplacable part of the alternate history being created by Eric Flint you can skip this one because it is only going to get a slight mention in the other main stories such as The Baltic War."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"The Ram Rebellion is easily the very least of the otherwise great 1632 series. Flint, in the introduction, says that the book is not quite an anthology and not quite a co-written effort. That middle of the road approach hurts the book. For a series that is normally a political action series with a great deal of research behind it, this book feels like a massive collection of events and characters that might be important some day (say, in 1636 or so), but weren't interesting or important enough to warrant their own treatment.(Spoilers)Also, the idea of Brillo the Ram gets irritating and repetitive so fast that I found myself wishing that they'd just kill it already; if the damn sheep is tainting the gene pool, EAT THE SHEEP. Don't complain about it so much that you start a cultural icon! If the Brillo stories were actually interesting, it wouldn't have been so bad; but they were called funny by so many characters and were so uninteresting that it rubbed me the wrong way.(End Spoilers)Speaking of so many characters, there were a LOT of characters that were utterly unimportant. I'm sorry Mr. Flint, but you yourself acknowledged that writers typically write about Great Men. There is a good reason for this: the commoners are frequently boring. Important, yes. Interesting, no. After feeling cheated buying the hardcover edition, I decided not to look into the other anthologies of the series and stick to the main storyline."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"\\"1634: The Ram Rebellion\\" is, in the words of Eric Flint, \\"something of cross between a traditional anthology and a novel\\". All the stories, written by various authors, are threaded together into one central storyline: \\"liberating the peasants from the nobility\\". This book shows how the \\"Revolution\\" starts unremarkably and grows. With this book Eric Flint intended to show how a great moment in history can have very humble(and in my opinion: uninteresting) origins.\\"1634: The Ram Rebellion\\" is an ambitious undertaking that has its roots on the Baen Bar website. \\"Regulars\\" of the website have had a major influence in the making of this book. Unfortunately, this where I believe the book fails; \\"too many cooks in the kitchen\\". I also believe that most of the readers of the \\"Ring of Fire\\" series, who do not \\"frequent\\" the Baen Bar website, will have a difficult time connecting this book to the rest of the series.As this book is not a \\"traditional anthology\\", like \\"The Ring of Fire\\" or the \\"Grantville Gazette\\", skipping stories is not an option. I have read some of the other anthologies and I had skipped stories that I did not find interesting. Not reading all the stories contained in \\"1634: The Ram Rebellion\\" will keep you from understanding the whole story.The pace of the book suffers. I found that I would get mired in the minutiae detailed in some of the stories. I also felt the book pulling me into several different directions with no clear direction. The overall feel of the book was rough and disjointed.This book, like \\"1634: The Galileo Affair\\", is NOT a sequel to \\"1633\\". Both are side stories that do not continue the epic plots and grand machinations set down in 1632 and 1633. I question the validity of putting 1634 in these titles. The sequel to \\"1633\\" should be titled \\"1634\\". Adding \\"1634\\" to \\"The Galileo Affair\\" and \\"The Ram Rebellion\\", to me, seems dishonest. I can already imagine the titles of future volumes of side stories that sprout up like a many-headed hydra: 1638: The Hoof and Mouth Disease Gambit, 1639: Brillo's Bond Referendum, 1640: Blah Blah Blah.\\"1634: The Ram Rebellion\\" is an attempt to bring a group of stories into one volume. But I feel this book is a case of \\"the lunatics running the asylum\\". The writers received alot of support in the creation of their stories via the Baen Bar website. Maybe too much support. I doubt that many people on the website have ever suggested that this book should not be published or that this volume of stories may not be popular or well-liked. If you dislike(or like for that matter) \\"1634: The Ram Rebellion\\" go to the Baen Bar website and let them know what you think.To quote John Ringo, another popular Baen author, \\"I never \\"blamed\\" the author. In the case of books that simply shouldn't have been published... I blamed the publisher.\\" I certainly agree.Judging from the reviews, you will either love or hate this book. I found it to be, in a word, UNSATISFYING."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"This novel has a novel stucture, not a novel event in this expanding series. Ram Rebellion is not part of the original plan for the \\"1634: xx\\" series of parallel novels, but a serendipitous product of stories submitted by avid online fans of the Alternate History initiated by Flint with his novel \\"1632.\\" So, it is unevenly written, it jumps around, has an many characters as War and Peace (just kidding, I think), but isn't that a great and confident idea on editor Flint's part? Still, one gets a rare fictional look into the makings of a revolution, a concatenation of preconditions, accidents, happenstance, mis-planning, bold individuals, stupid opponents (really, obviously, evil ones), a good slogan, and luck. Up-timers like the modern West Virginians dropped back into a past world of 17th century war can't expect such success. Do you remember Pohl Andersson's story, I think it was, about a modern sailor thinking he can tell good ole Vikings how to build their long boats...? Here one has to keep straight a thoroughly multi-pronged nation building effort in Franconia, just south of Grantville, by the new \\"United States\\" working through peasants, principalities, cities, castle lords, religious-freedom commission, committe of correspondence, embassies, military advisors, garrisons, another state, and Noelle Murray (who knows nothing about pistols but is super at subversion). If you don't know what I'm talking about, then you need to go back and first read Flint's very satisfying \\"1632\\" and \\"1633\\" novels.This \\"novel\\" gradually comes into focus through a series of short stories and jokes revolving around an ugly short-haired ram who has designs on modern long-haired ewes, against the modern breeder's wishes. Only after numerous stories illustrating the pre-existing political and economic situation in Franconia, does the main story of how Franconia will be democratized really get under way. I have no objection to this device, the \\"gathering storm\\" technique, since I prefer the short stories to the the concluding novel written by Flint and Judith DeMarce. Its sprawling episodic structure detracts from its suspense, drama, and climax.While some may object to the combinations of short stories, broadsheets, sophomoric humor, novela, and novel here, I don't. Can you imagine what having to slog through a pedestrian novel like Flint and DeMarce's concluding section would be like, if it expanded to 400 pages to include the matters touched on in the shorter, prefactory pieces? Tired feet! I had a frustrating time tracking characters variously identified by their first or last name or title, and it took me a while to put \\"three\\" characters into, oh!, just one. Still and all, this \\"novel\\" is marking time as we await the return to a \\"real\\" novel that will use the principal series characters (hardly seen here) to advance the main story. Consider this one a parallel story of \\"1634\\" that documents one of the alternative ways of coping with the fractious European neighbors confronted by the \\"alien\\" Americans. (That also means there are some unexplained cross-references to other stories, even ones that haven't been written yet.) The other \\"1634:xx\\" books will surely have other structures, places, people, procedures, and prospects. Hopefully, a few will be less insistently upbeat and have some flashes of adult ambiguity, grimness, and desperate moments in them. It should be fun."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"I am one of those rare birds who actually enjoyed 1634: The Galileo Affair. I thought this would be an interesting sequel of that type. When I first started reading, I was very upset that it appeared to be a mish mash collection and it certainly was an up and down read. The final part of the book finally took off and ended up being an above average read, but come on already! Eric, GET OFF THE COUCH, STOP making excuses for your partners and WRITE THE REAL 1634 SEQUEL! THE REAL FAN REBELLION IS COMING AS WE ARE TIRED OF BEING TEASED! Write it yourself if Drake is too busy. So much for the joys of collaboration. We want the real thing, not more delay!"},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"Eric Flint is really trying the patience of those of us who want to be his fans and liked the first few books set in his 1632 universe. Because honestly, he's been over the year of 1634 enough times that we're ready to move on. There have been something like 7 different issues of the 'Grantville Gazette,' plus 'The Galileo Affair' and 'Ring of Fire,' all of which are essentially treading over the same ground again and again ad nauseum. Enough already.The entire second half of this book was so boring that I just gave up with 2 chapters to go before the end. I didn't care about any of these characters and I didn't really understand what was happening anymore. It's just page after page after page with nothing happening.By the way, this isn't actually a novel and it isn't by Eric Flint, strictly speaking. It's a collection of short stories and a novella edited by Flint and packaged into something that at first seems to pass for a proper book. He co-wrote the novella but the bulk of the book was not written by him.The only reason to buy this book is if you are obsessed with reading each and every little scrap and sentence written about the 1632 universe. If this isn't you then don't waste your time. In fact, buying this book will only reward Flint and his publisher for feeding their readers warmed-over fan-fiction (again) instead of going to the trouble of writing a real book. Perhaps slow sales will encourage him to write an actual novel set in 1635 already. Hopefully this series will return to the promise held by the first 2 or 3 books."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"Eric Flint and David Weber have promised that 1633: The Baltic War, the next \\"main line\\" novel about the adventures of Gustav Adolphus, Mike Stearns, and company will be out early next year. Until then, fans have been \\"making do\\" with the various side stories in The Galileo Affair, The Grantville Gazettes, and such.This, is another side story, the adventures of the crew of Americans tasked with administering the region of Germany called Franconia, which Gustav handed them at the end of \\"1632\\".Tasked with the nearly-impossible job of explaining to the various groups in Franconia that they were to spread the good word of \\"Mom, Apple Pie, Democracy, and Freedom of Religion,\\" they discover in the middle of it all that, inspired by Thomas Paine, the peasents are revolting!With a good sense of humor, a feel for the complexities of real life, and a good sense of politics, The Ram Rebellion is a worthy addition to the 1632 canon. That said, I and everyone else I know who are fans of the series are anxious for the main story line to get moving again. Those poor people have been trapped in the Tower of London entirely too long."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"Another big disappointment. We seem to be getting more and more filler books. I absolutely loved the 1st two (1632 & 1633). From then on this series has been going downhill. The Ram Rebellion is a dis-jointed series of short stories about goats, of all things. Made no sense to me and ended up just tossing it in the trash where, I feel, it belongs. Again-the first two books were absolutely spellbindin. I'll be much more careful (read all the reviews) before I get sucked into another turkey like this one. Only gave it one star because there is no zero star rating. I'm really dis-appointment because Eric Flint is one of my favorite authors. Nothing personal Eric, just business, but this is a real piece of junk."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"I'm not going into much detail re: the story or plot line, since several otehr reviewers have already done so. This book is obviously a \\"sidebar\\" to the main 1632 tale, and is pretty dry stuff.My major criticism is the introduction of a whole new cast of rather meanigless characters. The publisher should have included a pull-out \\"scorecard\\" in one of the ends of the jacket. I found it difficult to read, since I was continually trying to figure out \\"who's who\\" in the story. Additionally, the whole tone of the book was FLAT.Overall, I really like the 1632 Universe, and feel that the Grantville Gazette anthologies do a much better job of keeping up the fan interest in the series.On the positive side, Ms. DeMarce handles the \\"German\\" aspect of the writing better than most other authors of this genre.This novel was a real disappointment for me; I was expecting something more entertaining than I was given."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"The Ram Rebellion is a parallel to the highly popular 1632 series. The book takes place roughly a few weeks after the Ring of Fire until just after The Galileo Affair. It is, as many have pointed out, a dry collection of works intended to be a filler book for the rest of the series. Unfortunately, it barely touches on the main series and instead, reads like a jumbled mish-mash of shorts worked out by various authors.One of the biggest problems with this book is just that, the collection of stories. Each writers voice is slightly different, and after the second or thrid story, you get the impression that this book was put out to simply shut up the more vocal of the people who are demanding a sequel. The stories have a tendency to drag at points, and worse of all, there is a section called \\"The Brillo Letters\\" in the book which completely took me out of what little story was running.The book does, however, improve towards the end, and not because it's the end. The actual story of the Ram Rebellion, by Virginia DeMarce and Eric Flint, follows along the more traditional 163x story ideas, \\"voice\\" and is highly enjoyable. It reminded me of the original book, in fact. So much that it, quite honestly, saved the book.The stories, while independant shorts, were all linked to the story and appeared to be a long, pass the conch and let him speak type of book. This, in itself, is not a great idea. Only a masterful weaving of this tapestry could possibly pull this off.I'm familiar with most of these writers featured in the book, having read their stories in the Grantville Gazette. This review is not a knock on their writing talents, since I have enjoyed nearly every one of their stories. It is more a problem with the actual layout and \\"flow\\" of the book. The book, as a whole, just doesn't flow."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"I discovered Eric Flint's work when a friend loaned me 1632. I had not read much speculative fiction other than some Harry Turtledove and I have to say I loved it. Then I went out and bought 1633, it was another gem. Things skipped a bit with The Galileo Affair, just a little too much sermonizing. But this latest, The Ram Rebellion, just stinks. Most of the stories were written by obvious amateurs fascinated with sheep, cooking, agriculture and whatnot. Now those are all fine things, but I bought the other books to be entertained with action+fantasy+history, in that order, not history+agribusiness+feminism. I am going to read one more book in this series and if it does not improve I will swear it off for good."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"I am a huge fan of Eric Flint, and generally love anything with his name on it. As others here have pointed out, though, one problem with this book is that, while his name is on it, most of the material was actually written by others.That's not necessarily a bad thing; 1633, co-written with David Weber, was great. And I disagree with some of the other reviewers here that criticize the \\"Grantville Gazette\\" stories in general; some of those have been good, too. (For example, the tale about the introduction of the potato chip to down-timers was a hoot.)But ... how can I say this diplomatically? While I think some of the writers in this compilation show promise, they are NOT Eric Flint or David Weber.Next, I think this book is just too blamed busy. Instead of one or two lead characters, there are a million, whose names begin to jumble together (badly!) after a while. Trying to keep up with the zillions of different Margraves and Dukes and Counts becomes something worse than tedious, too (\\"wait a minute ... was he the Protestant who hated Gustav Adolph, or was he the Catholic who secretly worked with so-and-so ...?\\").I think this book proves something else, and I hope Jim Baen is paying attention: just because the guys in Baen's Bar like something doesn't mean that it's a good story. Yes, those who are DEEPLY into the 1632 universe will sit in the Bar and discuss it for hours on end. No doubt they will thoroughly enjoy this book, which goes into ton after ton of detail about those Margraves and Dukes and Counts and how land leases work and all that.But Jim? Those of us who just want a crackin' good read for an evening's diversion will find something like this horribly tedious. If I need a history textbook, I can go to the UAB student bookstore.The art of good historical fiction is knowing what to LEAVE OUT. 100% historical accuracy and \\"nth\\"-level detail is for textbooks, not novels.

Bushwah! It's an anthology.As a novel, there are wayyyy too many protagonists, the plot wanders all over the landscape, the writing is too uneven--I'd have to say \\"thumbs down\\" and not recommend anyone buy it.But as an anthology, like \\"Ring of Fire\\" before it, I can enthusiastically wave \\"thumbs up.\\"Another review said that the fact that most of the stories in the anthology were available in some form on the internet before being edited into their final published form in this anthology was a reason not to buy. Well, I read most of these stories in the rough at www.baensbar.com, in the 1632 slush conference, and the key word there is \\"rough.\\" It was a privilege seeing the thought processes of the authors as they shared their unfinished stories.It was even more marvelous to see how the slush stories became the polished, interwoven chapters of this book, especially some of the \\"throwaway\\" stories never expected to become part of the canon of the 1632 universe.It's an anthology."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"As many reviewers have noted, this book has a lot of characters, and none of them are the \\"main\\" characters of the 1632 world. It takes place off the beaten path. If you haven't been reading this series, then by all means go and read 1632 and 1633 first.The book's lack of a single central plot and a small set of characters is very much the authors' point, though. This book is deliberately set against the \\"great man of history\\" approach. The idea isn't the usual plot in which a small number of characters seize control of events. Instead, events steamroll along in the interactions of many seemingly unrelated characters, each trying to figure out their own small part of the world.In many ways this book comes closest to the spirit of the 1632 enterprise, which at its heart is about \\"ordinary\\" people shaping history with \\"ordinary\\" resources.If you read it with that theme in mind, instead of by trying to see the one central plot that ties everything together, you'll probably enjoy the book.If you don't enjoy somewhat chaotic stories with lots of completely unintended consequences, then by all means go far, far, far away from this series. There are plenty of excellent alternate histories in which a few incredible people drive events (S M Stirling probably writes the best of these, though John Birmingham is worth checking out). The 1632 series, on the other hand, is an experiment in chaotic history.This philosophy does lead to a lot of books in the series that seem like \\"sidelines\\" compared to the main military histories that have big armies blowing each other to pieces at the command of kings and presidents and cardinals. But to the \\"ordinary\\" peasants of Franconia, all of that stuff is the sideline, and in many ways that's the point!"},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"I am a great fan of Eric Flint's works but this one is just plain awful.

Stories about sheep farming and ballet, are you kidding me?

Suffice it to say that if there is anything about Eric Flint's writing that annoys you, that flaw will be magnified in the contributions by other authors. The one that really bugs me is the tendency to establish things by having characters talk about them instead of being shown the thing directly (the biggest offenders here are the various conversations that go: \\"Gee Ann, these Brillo stories sure are hilarious!\\" \\"I agree!\\").The second problem is a little more subtle. Eric Flint has stated in text or in author's notes that the big themes here are that Life is Shades of Grey and Great Men are Overrated. But the entire 1632-verse presents us with a black and white world where your goodness can be judged by how far you deviate from the ideals of Mike Stearns. Moreover, no character ever really goes from good to bad or bad to good--the closest thing is John Simpson, and he doesn't really change, we're just supposed to like him more once we discover that he's more like Mike Stearns than we originally thought.Meanwhile, this whole story is about how Great Men are super-cool. Not only is Mike Stearns Better Than You, we also get a cameo by Gretchen Richter to illustrate that she is Better Than You, and the other characters mention in passing that her husband is probably Better Than You too. None of the mainline characters is ever outsmarted, out-toughed, or shown to be wrong about anything (except by other mainline characters, and always in strict accordance with the deviation-from-Stearns hierarchy). I think some of these problems come from the warmed over fanfiction origin of a lot of the writing, but they're creeping into the series as a whole, and they're a lot more noticeable when a book is as devoid of action as this one.This book can safely be skipped unless you are a 1632 completist or you (like me) desperately need reading material for a long plane flight."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"I thought this was a novel. It looks kind of like a novel and it read kind of like a novel but it is an anthology of closely related stories from the 1632 universe.Something incredible has happened. The authors have taken a decidedly dull subject, land and electoral reform in Central Europe, and have made it readable and interesting. That would be worth some kudos all by itself.Any reader would do well to first read 1632 and get the background. Once that highly convoluted framework is in place, this work should be accessible by anyone who wants to read it. It is worth the reading.This collection of stories seems at first to be related only by virtue of taking place in the same framework. It is not until the end that the various threads of the stories seem to come together in a unified whole and that whole is well done.The problem, in the stories, is imposing a modern electoral system and system of land ownership upon the patchwork of Germany in the midst of the 30 Years War. It is a complex problem. What is even more difficult is promoting the revolution without unleashing a bloodbath.I suspect that solving this problem by writing a book about it would be exceedingly difficult and probably uninteresting. Instead, a series of short stories were written. Each builds upon the previous ones and the problem works itself out. It still has a share of mayhem needed for any decent revolution but it is controlled.Well Done."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"I loved 1632/33 but this book put me to sleep.

Here, though, is something new in my experience. Eric Flint is both an acknowledged author and the editor. He shares credit with Virginia DeMarco as co-author; but, there actually many co-authors, some of quite small pieces.This book is a collection of stories, short stories, and a novella that actually pursue a coherent plot that has a number of parallels to velvet revolutions (I am not enough of an academic to describe them, find them on your own), in short an anthology. At times the stories seem diversions, as the stories about the rebellious ram, but in the end prove to be as much in service to the plot as the longer intermittent stories.Here, in the twisted way of real life, is a clear story of an oppressed and poorly governed people (Franconia) finding in the ram stories allegories for their own suffering and a structure to organize and develop their own responsive government. There is military action, but it has not the same weight as 1632 or 1633, more in the nature of how a few individuals (Americans) can help others find their own voice. The action is, as in real life, disconnected, intermittent, short and intense; the action responds to the plot rather than being the plot (again different from 1632, 1633, and, probably, 1634 - Baltic War).Most of the main characters are built fully, but not necessarily laid out baldly by the authors, but through the vision of others, the character's thoughts and reactions to events, and how other respond to them. And, as action moves out of their sphere, these characters drop out of the storyline, just as they do in real-life.This book (for the reader) is more like being a stateside CIA analyst reading bits and pieces in local (foreign) papers and hearing the stories of travelers who have been in your area of interest, and finding the coherent whole out of many individual pieces. Eric Flint has opened his \\"universe\\" to others with creative right of editing (meaning much more than correcting spelling and grammar) to guide the work of others to fit into, and be published in professional work. These different authors demonstrate different skills, point-of-views, word choices, etc.; yet that is one of the strengths of this work. It allows the reader to participate in the work, but his editing allows us to do so with much less effort than the supposed CIA Analyst.For those who wish to be spoon-fed action, turn your attention to the cartoon universes on TV. For those who can link separate events into a coherent whole; that is, those with a memory longer than a few minutes, whose imaginations can see broadly from little pieces of data, this is a magnificent effort to describe a gentle subversion from one type of government (absent patron - noble) to another (participatory) with little killing or military requirements. Just as in real life, military efforts are required, but, now, not with massive armies and heavy artillery action, but carefully and thoughtfully supplied in very small doses.I found this a very fulfilling read, able to stop almost anywhere, but not really desiring to do so. I have found myself ruminating over this book far more than others in the series and I am currently rereading it for enjoyment."},{"Title":"1634: The Ram Rebellion (Assiti Shards)","review":"I was eagerly awaiting the release of this book.

This book would be 5 out of 5 but for the fact that the dust jacket makes no mention of it being a series of short stories."},{"Title":"For a Better World: Posters from the United Nations","review":"I GAVE TO SHEPARD FAIREY!

Those included are probably a good cross-section of what has been published by various UN agencies. I think it's worth remembering that the agencies are situated in various cities round the world and they reflect poster styles of different cultures. This most likely explains why there is no real design style to any of the work shown.Surely as a world organization it should be possible to create some sort of \`brand feel' to all this work, a simple idea might be to have a colored strip across the top or bottom of every UN poster (say: about ten percent of the total depth) which has some sort of color design and the UN logo.Although most of the posters have colorful imagery, either as graphics or photos I don't think many are what might be called eye-catching award winners. So many of them have interesting images but use very ordinary designs and typography and as you look through the book there seems an even blandness that is only broken by something truly creative and eye-catching. To the other extreme there are a few that are just awful, in particular two that show all the members of the Security Council and General Assembly in group photos.The book will have a mild interest for graphic designers though I bet most copies were bought by the various agencies whose posters are featured.***SEE SOME INSIDE PAGES by clicking 'customer images' under the cover."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"I have read alot of Gary Paulsen's books and he writes some good books. But Transall Saga was amazing with all of the adventurous action that took place in this book. I thought the book was a really good read because it explains in gret amount of deatail on how he survives in this new world and how he encounters new civilations and new creatures that he has to get alonge with in order to make it out. I thought this book was great and I would reacomend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"The Transall saga is a very good book for a person who likes books about survival and who have read other Gary Paulsen books. In this book Gary Paulson writes about a man named Mark who goes on a solo camping trip in the dessert. One day he was out for a small hike and he saw a beam of light coming from the dessert sky to the ground. He went close to it to examine it ,and a snake bit him. He fell into the light, and he is transported to an alien world. He has no bites ,and now he has to find a way to survive in the world that he does not know of. I definitely give this book two thumbs up."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"I would recommend this book to people that are becoming young adults. In this book Mark, the main character, is on a trip in the Magruder Missile Range all by himself. He is there because he likes the outdoors and is trying to find his inner self. He finds himself and many other people along the way. After being sent to an unknown place, he must adapt to his new surroundings, and fulfill the 3 basic needs (food, shelter, clothing). He ends up staying in this &#65533;world&#65533; for quite a while. He ends up having some really good friends and quite a few enemies a couple in which he ends up killing. I really enjoyed reading this book even though the ending kind of leaves you hanging. I would definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"I couldn't believe this book when I read it.

At first, I didn't really want to read it because it was 250 pages long, but I read it anyway and hoped for the best. And, you know what, it probably was. It's about some guy named Mark camping in a desert trying to survive when suddenly a blue beam of light transports him to what appears to be another time on another world. He adapts and meets tribes of other people and so on.I would definently have to reccomended it."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"This is a non-humourous book by Gary Paulsen, which seems to be an exception to most of his other books. It's very dramatic and I loved it when I read it the first time. Certain parts of it remind me of the Lord of the Rings books, especially toward the end of the book. It has a creepy conclusion too, a world destroyed by disease and then rebuilt from the ashes.Trevor"},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"There's no place like home. Thirteen year-old Mark finds this out once he enters a new world called Transall, where everything is a shade of red. While camping in the Arizona desert, a blue light transports Mark to Transall, a place that looks like a different Earth changed by nuclear war, complete with deformed humans and animals. That's when Mark's struggle to survive and find his way back to present-day Earth begins. It would be very hard finding your own food, water, shelter, and protecting yourself from harmful animals such as buffalo creatures and violent tribes, but Mark does this throughout his journey.Mark starts out as a regular teenager on a camping trip who turns into a strong survivor by using his knowledge and skills. He lives three years in Transall before finding the blue light again. I often asked myself what I would do in his situation in order to live. At the end, Mark becomes a doctor finding a cure for Ebola. I want to have a career in medicine by helping animals so I could identify with Mark in that way.This book showed me what it's like to be alone, afraid and having to make it by yourself, but it also showed me how to have courage and never give up. Survival and believing in yourself are themes in The Transall Saga.I would recommend this book to young people who like science fiction and adventure stories."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"The Transall Saga is a really good book. It has a lot of action in it like when Mark is in the woods and a buffalo thing chases him. It also has a lot of suspense in it, for example, when he follows the monkey human things to their tribe.

It takes place on Earth and another mysterious location. It is mainly about Mark, a teenage boy that is mysteriously taken into another world and tries to survive. He finds people, but not exactly like us and fits in. After being a slave he becomes a member of the tribe by his actions. He then makes the shocking discovery of where he is and tries to find a way home.In my opinion, this is a great book. It has everything in it from drama, to comedy, and survival in the wilderness. I strongly reccomend others to read it. I love the writer's style. It moves along at a good clip, but not too slow or fast. He describes everything well without going into excruciating details."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"Mark's solo camping trip in the desert turns into a terrifying and thrilling adventure when a mysterious blue light transports him to another world.

At the time, I hated reading but I loved this book! It was the first novel that I had read where I didn't want to put it down. We finished the book and years went by with a momentary thought about it here or there. Each year I found myself wanting to read it again. I finally bought it for my kindle and I was so happy when I was able to read it again. It is a classic that will stick with you for years and years. I would recommend it to everyone!"},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"Paulsen should write more dystopians. He's good at them. Even though they're geared towards a younger market, I do think his books appeal to all ages.The Transall Saga finds Mark, a teenager on his first camping trip by himself. He's not out long when a brilliant tube of light transports him to what he thinks is another world. Here things are just off, animals are different, vegetation is different, and the people while similar, aren't like they were where he came from. But after facing numerous hardships with these people, he grows to like them. But a man called Merkon isn't too keen on Mark, and isn't afraid to do everything in his power to rid the world of Transall of Mark.Mark's a pretty cool guy. We only get a little bit of description about him, but it's enough. I get a very good sense of what he looks like and his actions speak loudly enough for him. He's a pretty good guy and cares about others. The rest of the characters weren't nearly as fleshed out as Mark, but they certainly add to the story. Megaan especially was great as she was a strong person and had quite a few flaws making her real. I think the other girl, Leeta, got kind of left in the dust when compared to Megaan, but we can't all be special.The plot is dystopian, which I love. Anywhere where the main character is sent somewhere where things aren't quite right and people are living primitively is interesting. And the bad guy in the Merkon was pretty menacing. I do think that the ending was a bit rushed, and I would have liked to see the book longer with more detail, but for a young adult/children's book, this is probably pretty good for the detail.Definitely one of the better ones by Paulsen in my opinion. I've read some stinkers from him, but this one is not one of them.The Transall SagaCopyright 1998248 pagesReview by M. Reynard 2012"},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"I bought this book for my brother for Christmas. He has been very into Gary Paulsen books and was thrilled to receive it. I had read this book several years ago and loved it so I thought he would like it. It is a great gift that is well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"Realizing this novel is aimed at the young adult market the author still seems to make insufficient effort to create a believable situation for young Mark, the story's central protagonist. Like many books aimed at a younger audience, the plot has little foreshadowing and the character arcs are short with little flesh on the bones. Despite this the reader is drawn along effortlessly, enjoying the little narrative nuggets without having to consider the ultimate destination.Mark is portrayed simply. He seems to stay positive regardless of the situation and if he knows fear, we rarely see it. I suppose my biggest grip is with how simply all his problems get resolved. Need to hunt; make a bow out off your shoe laces and stick. Need a distraction, create an explosive from an ill-remembered recipe, (success on the first try, without testing and nor a container for the powder).In short, I'd recommend this for a ten year old, but not a thirteen year old. Anyone that realizes that problems are hard to solve, decisions have long term consequences and success depends on planning and preparation - will find this novel frustrating at times. On the other hand, it's an easy read and fun most of the time."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"The Transall Saga by Gary Paulson is a great book that anyone should read.

While camping he discovers a strange blue light. He fell through it and found himself in a strange world with many alterations. There are different animals and plants. Colors of things are different too. some how he has to survive in this world, as he is learning he is also growing in many ways. Read this book to find out how he survives in this wilderness.

Transall Saga \\"hands down\\" has been the \\"top choice\\" best book of the year all 9 years running. As matter of fact it has created a love and excitement for students who dislike reading.I would love to see Mr. Paulsen do us all some justice and get busy writing a sequel. Mark needs to go back to the desert with his scienctific cohorts and show them what he's really made of. Please Mr. Paulsen get busy... we're all waiting for part 2. Also, I can't believe a producer hasn't pick this story up for a movie. I have read the \\"Hatchet series\\" and love it. But Transall Saga I feel by far is his best adventure!"},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"As an avid fan of Gary Paulsen since fifth grade, I look forward to and usually enjoy all of his books. \\"Transall Saga\\" was no exception.When Mark goes out on a hiking trip in the desert, he is enveloped in a strange blue light and transported to what appears to be another world. He's injured in the ordeal, and must recover while trying to stay alive. Once he's well enough to move around more freely, he makes discoveries, namely monkey-like creatures and fruit...as well as evidence of people. One day, he is captured by and enslaved by a group of indigenous people. As time progresses, Mark takes on other roles in the comparitively primitive society, and discovers something rather unsettling about his new world.The premise of \\"The Transall Saga\\" is a tried-and-true one, as is Paulsen's adolescent, male protagonist. Fans of Gary Paulsen will notice similar themes to his other books, but they don't detract from the story.My only real criticism is of the ending. It was very abrupt, and didn't clean up all the loose ends. For that reason alone, I gave \\"The Transall Saga\\" four stars instead of five.Recommended audience: fans of survival fiction, science fiction and/or speculative fiction."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"What can I say. I've read about 17 of Gary Paulsen's books in the last few months and this is the only one I wasn't crazy about.The idea is interesting-- it's standard sort of scifi fair; boy whisked away mysteriously to an alien world where he has to fight to fit in-- but the book is way too short to cover all the ground that Paulsen has lined up. As a consequence there's no character development, and scenes flip one to another without much to connect them at times.I blame the YA publishers for this, by the way. As Tamora Pierce has noted, it took Harry Potter to convince them that kids' attention was longer than a gnat's. And I'd be willing to bet that they required Gary to keep his word count down, which is a darn shame because I would have loved to have seen this book fleshed out.In any case, let me add a caveat that if you are in the mood for a fast-pace adventure without anything of weight to slow you down, you might like this. [If I were to give an equivalent it would probably be the old Robert E. Howard \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" books-- minus the fur clad babe on the cover.]But if you like \\"The Haymeadow\\" or \\"Sarny\\" give this one a miss, or check it out at the library.Pam T~one of the moms at booksforkids-reviews"},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"When I first read this book in the 6th grade, I wasn't keen on reading it. It did not look interesting. But once I started reading it I could not stop. (I am 12 years old) It has alot of action and exitment and once you start reading it, you wont want to stop. I have been reading this book over and over and it seems to get better every time! A 13 year old boy called Mark fell into the light and had to adapt to this new world called transall. When he finally meets people on this world, he finds out that he is in the distant future on Earth. Read this book and find out how he will get home!"},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"This book was really good, it had adventure, amazing plot twists, and fleshed-out characters. Then, Paulsen just seemed to get tired of writing. The main character was just by chance whisked off and dropped back home. I mean, that could have happened any time in the story. I liked the book but was highly disapointed with the ending."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"This book is quite a change from all of the other Paulsen books, although it retains Paulsen's usual underlying theme of survival in the wilderness. Yup. And I'm afraid that several of the other reviewers were misguided or perhaps confused, as the book is not overflowing with \\"goar\\"; nor was the main character-Mark-on Mars. I found this novel captivating and entertaining. I enjoyed Mark's attitude that he aquired on Transall, which is the name of the world Mark is mysteriously transported to after falling into a bizzare blue light. This book has a satisfying ending and leaves the reader both awestruck and contemplative."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"The title of the book I read is called Transall Saga, written by Gary Paulsen. I really enjoyed reading this book ultimately, because the whole thrill of the main character's survival on a planet that he just so happened to warp on. Every significant method or strategy Mark uses to survive on this planet mesmerized me and kept me in suspense. I kept asking myself, \\"What is he going to do next, what is he going to do next?\\" For the past few years of my life this book has been the only one that has kept my interest. This is a little piece of evidence of the book: When Mark camps out in the canyons he spots a mysterious blue light just over a boulder and falls into it, warping him into another world. As he is unfamiliar with the planet and its surroundings, he uses magnificent methods to survive. As you read more of the book, after he has gone through the warp, you get a sort of feeling that you're at a tropical rain forest because of the imagery. If you enjoy science fiction or your favorite genre is associated with science fiction, then you'll definitely love this book and will find it very intriguing. My name is Peter and I hope all of the viewers out there had taken a look at my review thoroughly and hopefully you will read Transall Saga sometime in the near future."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"This book was recommended to me by my 12-year-old niece. She enjoyed it and convinced me to move it up on my reading list. I'm not sorry I did. While this is not Paulsen's best work, it is an enaging story that kept me captivated right through the end. When, 13-year old Mark falls into a mysterious beam of light while on a solo camping trip, he is transported to what seems to be a solitary jungle-world. He eventually discovers he is not alone and becomes involved at several levels with the native peoples. He learns some of the local languages, lives through being a slave, transforms himself into a hero, gains friends, and falls in love - basically he grows up - under very trying circumstances. Mark's story is interesting not only for the adventure but also for the growth that can be seen in Mark.

I say this because Mark travels all over Transall, and while traveling he meets up with different primitive tribes. He has different exciting adventures with each tribe.People who like adventure or action stories would love to read this book because of all the exiting things that happen to Mark on his search through Transall to find the blue light that warped him into the distant future. I think this book should be read by ages seven and up and mostly read by boys.My two favorite events of literature are setting and theme. The setting of this book is a mixture of the forest and the mountains. The theme of the book is what it's like to live in a place you don't know anything about.I would rate this book like this: five stars on a 1-5 star scale."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"This book was a great book. I liked it alot. I do admit the book was slow at times but at others it made me want to keep on reading and reading. It went along the line of Hatchet but more of a fantasy book.

He got warped into the past present or future. He had to survive alot of things in the wilderness, even being a slave. He found out towards the end he was in the future.

He is immediately sucked up into it and transported to a strange new place. The suspense I had kept on building as I wondered if he was going to survive this weird place, and what was going to happen to him, until one day he meets some strange inhabitants of the planet who take him in. As not to ruin the book, let me just say that there are some other people on the planet that are different from and fight with the people he stays with, and this leads to wars, friendships, and eventually, an incredible climatic ending.

This book is soooo good i cant even explain it!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"I am a teacher, and try to read most books that we have in our school library for children and teens. I'd have to characterize this story as a man-against-nature adventure-fantasy science-fiction coming-of-age novel. It was one of the best books I've read this year. The book is a real page-turner. I couldn't put it down, and read the whole thing in a day (I'm a fast reader).It is the story of a young teen-aged boy who gets transported into another world, which we later find out is actually the Earth, in a future time. He first has to learn how to survive on the new planet, and then he eventually comes in contact with several new groups of people, who are all at war with each other. He survives slavery, to become free, and a warrior, while all the time searching for the blue light that will take him home. After a number of years, he gives up, deciding to make his life in the new world. Unfortunately, the ruler of that world, who also came from Mark's time, is his deadly enemy. This is a fascinating book with a little of something for everyone--and also manages to have nothing inappropriate for children or teens. I recommend this book for mature 11-year-olds, all the way up to adult. I loved it myself!"},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"My opinion on this book is that it is one of the best books that is have ever read out of this series. Yes, Brians Winter is a good book in all but Transall Saga blows it out of the water. With the time traveling and how he has to learn a hole different way of life and speak a hole differnt language it really cool. Beacause of all the changes and every thing that goes on between Mark and the other tribes it is really differnt type of book that i have read. This book i would recommend for people from the 5th grade to all the way to my grade(8th). All and all this is one of the best book I have ever read, and hopefully you will ever read."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"The Transall Saga has been one of my all-time favorite books ever since I've read it! It was recommended by an AWSOME good friend of mine and I read it and LOVED it! It's about Mark, a guy heading on a trip across a desert by himself. He gets sucked into a strange blue light and finds himself stuck in another world. He finds himself in a world that is totally different than his own. He has to find out how to survive when he doesn't know how this world works. This book is such an amazing piece of science fiction and it's practically GUARENTEED that you'll LOVE it! So try reading this, PLEASE you'll LOVE it, trust me!!!!"},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"I thought this book was a great survival story. It had sudden twists to the end of it. It always had you guessing what he was talking about. When I read this book I disliked reading entirely. This actually brought hope to me. It has such good detail you can practically visualize what the author is talking about. How he killed the massive creature or how he destroyed the evil enemy at the end. This book made you wonder what really was this \\"dimensional portal\\" linked too. A new world, another dimension, universe, the past, or even the future? You didn't know how Mark was going to survive in the jungle. He had to scavenger and make friends out of nowhere. A unexplored and unfamiliar world to him. This was actually a great, exciting, and an awesome thriller in my opinion. Until later in the story you realize this is the future not the past or another world. And the supreme king of the \\"future\\" Earth is a escaped convict from the 1960's who found the portal in a canyon and unknowingly went inside it because he knew he was going to be captured at any second from the man hunt being held in the state. Since he knew about the advanced technology in the past compared to the present in the \\"future\\" he ruled quickly and swiftly. No one knew where he came from but Mark found out what truely happened and how he came to rise in power. He was sort of a communist not letting other people discover those technologies to improve their weapons to create a rebellion against his rule. Not knowing what had happened in the past he still tries to slay the prisoner, knowing that he'll help the people in the present time. In my conclusion to this book I believed it was one of Paulsen's greatest masterpieces of writing. I've read The Hatchet and it compares greatly to this book. It has the same concept and I rate The Transall Sage a 5/5 *Stars* Great book! I recommend this to anyone who loves to read adventure books."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"I have read the book called The Transall Saga. This review will be what I thought of the book. I'd definitely have to say this is one of my favorite books of all time. It has action, mystery, adventure and even some sad parts! My favorite thing about this book is that from beginning to end it will leave anyone guessing until the very end. If I could make one recommendation for the readers I'd like to say, the book starts out a little slow but it gets much better as you go on. And that was my review on this book, The Transall Saga.

It's not like most books that look good at the book store but when you start reading it, you can't lift your hand to turn the page it is so boring. Mark is the main character in the story and he is a die hard camper. He decides to go out camping in the desert one time all by himself. No he doesn't get eaten by a bear or anything scary like that, he gets sucked into a light that's takes him to the place he knows as Transall. Gary makes the scenery so real and vivid in the book that u actually look around to make sure that there are no monkey-bears around. The farther you get in the story the more you see mark develop, he starts to understand that he could be in Transall a while, so he starts to in a way grow up. As the books goes on Mark finds primitive people, he is glad he found people but he is still stuck on trying to find the light he came in on. Through Paulsen's writing style you get more familiar with all of the characters and terrain because there is not too much dialogue to slow it down. I think that anyone would enjoy this book and I really recommend this book to people who would rather sit there annoying themselves by saying \\"I'm bored,\\" 364 times before finally getting something to eat( Don't think I don't know how you people work, because I do.)"},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"This book is really good.

The only bad thing is that I thought that Mr. Paulsen could have put more into the ending where Mark is back in his world."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"This book fascinated me, it was like going back in time and living as the cave-men did, but with the knowledge of today.It excited me, and the more I read the more I wished I could do as Mark did in this wonderful adventure."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"Thought provoking tale of a teenage boy suddenly dropped into a foreign world, forced to adapt or die. It was interesting to see Paulsen's view, through the eyes of a teenage boy, of what the world might be like 2000 years into the future if plague and the detonation of our nuclear weapons devastated the world today. I liked his vague descriptions of the animals and plant life, because they left room for me to imagine what Transall looked like for myself. The story reminded me of O'Brien's &quot;Z for Zaccharia&quot; (another post-WW3 teenage survival story). My only fault with the story is that we see none of Mark's adjustment period on returning to the present time. If you liked &quot;Hatchet&quot;, and like science fiction, you will love this."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"My favorite Paulsen book was the Transall Saga because it mixed wilderness survival with imaginative sci-fi. The book has a wonderful plot of twists and turns, where Paulsen used his imagination to create a whole realm of surprises. Alas, nothing is perfect, and I do have a least favorite part... which was the ending (not the epilogue though). It would be nice if there was a movie, but with so many important details and so much to the story, it would be hard to make a good one. I suggest this book to anybody who would want to read an amazing story in a unique setting."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone who seeks adventurous and mysterious books. This book has many problems and conflicts that result and rise up to the main idea or plot of the story. The characters throughout the story are very different and strange but in all, they all have vital parts in the story that affect the main problem, and small problems that arise in the story. The details are distinctly described, and are very clear. When you start to figure out what will happen next, something unexpected pops up and changes the whole story. After starting this magnificent book, you will never want to put it down. I myself thought the book was an incredible adventure book."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"You won't be able to put this book down. I read it for four hours straigth and finished ot.

Where is Mark, and will he ever get back? Read the book to find out!"},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"This book is not the usual Gary Paulsen book.

It is about a boy who loves the nature, and hits the jackpot when his parents let him go backpacking across the Magruder Missile Range.He finds a mysterious blue light. When he aproaches it it transports him to another world. He struggles to get back to his parents. At first he does not think he will survive and get back to his parents.

In his time he meets people of a trbe.What kept me reading this book was I wanted to see what happens in the end."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"This book contained many characters and was easily confusing, but every moment I spent reading this was way worth the while. I read this book from 2:30 in the morning to just after four. I could have watched TV, one of my favorite hobbies, but I chose to read, instead!"},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"I thought this book was a very good book. It had elements of fantasy, but it also delt with survival. I liked many of the characters and their personalities. The events were interesting, but the book was sort of slow between them. The ending was ok, but I think that the author needed to elaborate more on what happened when he first returned. There was nothing about his parent's reaction. Overall, I think I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"The Transall Saga, by Gary Paulsen is a great book. It has a great plot, and well developed characters. This is an excellent book for anyone that likes science fiction or adventure stories. The story begins in the desert, where a young boy named Mark goes on a hiking trip. Then out of nowhere comes a big bright blue light that transports him to an unknown place. To Mark it all seems like a different planet. Everything has changed including the anatomy of people, plants, and animals. People have webbed hands and feet with strange looking eyes, trees and grass are red, and animals are like creatures from a horror movie. The story is a non-stop roller coaster ride with thrills, chills, and spills. However I think that the ending was lacking. The conclusion was too abrupt and left too many lose ends...I advise any readers to stop at page 243, because the ending is so dissapointing, you would be better of making up your own."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"I read this book as a kid and loved it. It's a great science fiction adventure with a great twist towards the ending.

But don't think it's a kids book...just read it, okay?\\" I was skeptical but so glad he finally coaxed me into starting. This book is GREAT. The characterization is excellent, there's a perfect amount of side characters, description of the world, action, to keep everything flowing but you're still engaged in the thing. Really, a great book; I'd recommend it especially if you have a tween boy who you want to coax into reading. The only complaint I have is the ending--the last fifty pages, at least--felt really rushed and I was conflicted over the ending. That's not to say it isn't suitable for the book, because it's a perfect ending, but it's because you're so invested... well, you'll see, because you just HAVE to read it."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"I just got done reading \\"The Transall Saga\\" by Gary Paulsen. I have known about Gary Paulsen for sometime now ever since reading part of \\"Hatchet\\" in elementary school. This book however kept me more interested than Hatchet could ever hope to. The Transall Saga in my opinion is Paulsen's best book and I recommend it highly to readers of all ages. Paulsen wrote a Sci-Fi novel that actually gave me that feeling of being a kid again for the first time in my life! It contains an imaginative world with wonderful characters that you grow attach to. It has a little something for everybody: action, adventure, sci-fi, romance, survival, and good vs. evil of course. Truly a wonderful story that is of the highest in children storytelling."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"I read this book in 7th grade and man this is a very intresting book.

BUY IT READ IT."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"The Transall Saga by Gary Paulsen used to be one of my absolute favorite books. It is a very simple and entertaining read. It is about Mark's hike in the desert when he discovers a strange blue light. He falls into it, and is telaported to a strange and interesting world. In this new world, Mark musty learn to survive, and how to live in this new and dangerous world. That being said, this used to be one of my favorite books. It is definitely written for the junior high or middle school crowd. If you are above that age, feel free to read this book, just be warned that it may seem a little \\"childish\\". Parents, I highly recomend this book for kids. Me and all my friends really enjoyed this book when we were younger. I highly recomend this book to all kids in junior high or younger. Few people will regret reading this very entertaining story."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"If you like books about adventurous, sci-fi stories about the world then you are sure to enjoy reading the Transall Saga by Gary Paulsen. This story is about a 13 year old boy who falls into a mysterious blue light that transports him very far into the future when he is hiking through the missle mountain range. When he thinks that he is alone on this deserted planet he is proven wrong when he finds and arrow in a tree. He is determined to find the people who this arrow belongs to. When he finds them he is rudely awakened by the style of life they live and decdides to move away but is captured by another tribe and forced into slavery but is granted his freedom because of his noble deeds and his different looks than everyone else. After the virus hit almost everyone died and the remaining people were changed physically and they had to start over because the virus had kept the population so low for so long that people forgot about normal life and went back into the stone ages. I really enjoyed reading this book because it has very good description and a very good storyline and plot that I could see maybe happening in the future if a virus like that hit or if there was a nuclear disaster. If you are looking for an adverturous, science fiction, page turning novel Gary Paulsen's The Transall Saga is right for you.Nick Stauffer"},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"I am a 13 yr old who reads a ton. my room is a library. This book was exceptionally good. I think everyone should read it. It is very creative. I think it has a good plot and is exciting. This book is to me, better than the Harry Potter series.It is not gory, but it has some fighting which makes it exciting. It also keeps you on your toes. It is a little funny at times. IT IS A VERY INTERESTING BOOK AND I THINK YOU SHOULD READ IT."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"Gary Paulson has once again written a compelling book on one boys struggle to survive in a strange world. Immediately in the first chapter the main character Mark is thrown into a dangerous environment making an interesting read right from the beginning. With the evolving plot line and the numerous surprises you'll have a hard time doing anything but read Mark's adventure.As I read this book I loved the various ways Gary Paulson showed how Mark became a master of survival and gained status in the strange world of Transall. He describes everything perfectly so that you can picture it in your mind. Another great thing about the book is its ability to cover many genres; with the mystery of Transall it covers (you guessed it) mystery's spot, the alien world and mutated creatures will keep a sci fi fan happy, and it could even pass as an apt survival guide.Anyone who has read and enjoyed the Hatchet books will definitely want to grab this book, like the Hatchet books it tells the story of a boys struggle to survive in a unfamiliar place, but it is also very different so it wont feel as if your reading a rewrite of Hatchet. Some of the variations I liked were that it was set in an entirely different plant, there's interaction with other humans (some hostile), the mystery that unravels as you read, and how it is set in more of a medieval time frame."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"Mark is a bigger kid who loves to explore.

He has to find ways to survive on this weird planet. He finds what looks to be human life and becomes part of the tribs or villages. He has to fight and protect his village that he grew to love and learns that we are all the same and there is no need for wars. This book teaches how to survive in the wild and how to love one another. Gary Paulson finds amazing ways to tie together the book at the end. It is interesting."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"Now I don't read much, in fact I almost hate reading! But I saw this book and a decided to read it because I have to read a book for school. I started to read and it started out with action and that made me read more. Each page I read, I wanted to read more and more. It had a lot of action and the story had several exciting twists and turns. It starts out like this. A boy convinced his parents to let him on a hiking trip alone in an old military missile range in the dessert. He rarely goes on trips and he mostly reads hiking magazines. Mark, the boy, starts to sleep after a long days hiking when a fireball falls right next to him and flickers out. He goes to investigate and sees this strange blue light. He thought it was some old military experiment. He goes to touch it. Suddenly, a rattle snake snaps and he falls into the light... He awakens and searches his hand for bite marks from the snake...Nothing... He looks at his surroundings and finds himself to be in a field. He walks a bit and finds himself sinking in quicksand! He manages to get himself out and lies down. Suddenly, he feels himself getting pinched by the red bug creatures! He shook them off and took off his clothes to see if they're all of. Ant then a buffalo creature comes by he climbs up a tree but the buffalo creature took one of his boots and ripped his shirt to shreads. He climbs down, puts onhis remaining clothes and moves into a jungle. He meats a creature that looks like a cross between a teddy bear and a monkey. At night he hears the noises of the jungle and a loud howl. He gets used to the jungle. One time when he was out hunting he saw a puddle of something on the ground...Blood... He heres shreaks outside and tries to find them. He sees a wolf creature, a.k.a. the howling thing clawing at someone in a tree. Mark shoots an arrow in the back of the animal. It turned around and attacked... And that's just the beginning. Read it for yourself. You'll love it, I did."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"Mark, our main character, is a hiking and camping fanatic. So much so that he manages to convince his mom and dad to allow him to go out onto an abandoned missile range for a week of hiking and camping.While fixing himself dinner on the first night a bright blue light appears from the sky and tunnels down to the ground. As Mark struggles to see the light he accidentally falls in, which begins the story.Mark wakes up to find the grass red, the sky reddish, strange plants surround him, and then he is nearly mauled by a strange animal. Mark quickly realizes that he is a long way from home, and maybe even a long time from home. As he struggles to survive the harshness of the wilderness Mark ends up fighting a war.The author of the book, Gary Paulsen, was able to create an environment for the book that had never been seen before, along with this he was able to add major plots developments that fit expertly into place, and threw in struggles along the way that are unimaginable for the most of us. Now although this is a science-fiction book to the max, Gary Paulsen doesn't try to wow the audience with tales of technology beyond that which is conceivable but rather goes a different route altogether and paints a picture of what it may be like should humanity as we know it went against a force that could not be stopped.Now it does sound like this is more a horror story based off of the above paragraph, it is because I have failed to mention the smaller bits and pieces. Mark who finds himself in a world all alone finds a friend (monkey), a family, human-like friends, and helps defeat the major protagonist of the story. After some years Mark finds his way back home, and using his knowledge that he gained from his journey through the light is trying his absolute best to fix what he knows is bound to come.My personal opinion of the book in its entirety is that it was very well written, a page-turner, an absolute must for those who enjoy science-fiction on a more regular basis, and a regular classic. Though the end chapter leaves you on a major cliff-hanger which cause's you to scream out loud (I yelled out in the middle of the class when I finished the book), it is still one that I would never change. (But a sequel would be well appreciated)."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"I read The Transall Saga to my two children, ages 13 and 7. The 7 year old thought it was a great book. The 13 year old thought it was good until the end. He hated the ending. I thought the book lacked depth and description and the ending was abrupt and unsatisfying. If this book had a sequel, it would be a decent series for youngsters 12 and under."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"I first read \\"The Transall Saga\\" in roughly sixth or seventh grade after reading \\"The Hatchet\\". I absolutely loved it, although the ending left me infuriated (in a way that left me begging for more). I ended up reading it many more times after that, then lending it to everyone I knew who liked that style of writing. Eventually I lent it out and it was never returned. Years later, as a high school graduate I was able to obtain this book again and read it for what could easily have been the eighth time. Every part of it was as great as I remember. Granted, some of the slower parts were a bit duller, but a wonderful book nonetheless.Each character was something everyone wants a character to be, memorable. The landscape is unique yet familiar, which draws readers in, and the style is simple enough to be easy to read and understand, (as I have done many times) yet not too simple as to bore the reader.All I can say is that I pray that someday Mr. Paulsen does a \\"Brian's Winter\\" style sequel to this book. The only trouble would be making it a survival book like his many other great works. Either way, I will be ecstatic if/when I hear of a new addition to \\"The Transall Saga\\"If you're looking for a little of the best of everything, and a book you can always turn to when all else fails.

This book is about Mark and his adventures being teleported by a blue light to another planet, or so he thinks. He must fight for survival as he finds his way home, but the question is, where is home? Mark must set on a quest to find answers like where is he, why is he here? Will he be able to find the blue light?This book's genre is science fiction/fantasy/adventure. It contains many battle scenes, romance, and some thriller. If you like exciting action, this book is for you. This book is good for kids ages 11 and up. The book has grammar about in the midle of easy and hard.

It was one of those boring summers we kids suffer from, and I needed action.This book delivered. Just when I guessed the plot, I was proven wrong. When I thought I knew how it was going to end, I was wrong. When I thought the character was in some deep trouble, I was wrong (of course, when I thought the character was in smooth-sailing, I was also wrong!) That is why I love this book so much... It challenged me to think of how it was going to change rather than the cliche endings and plots we have read thousands of times before.Needless to say, I returned the book (it was very hard. I was ready to lie to the librarian to keep it!) As usual, life beckons and I never really sought to get a copy; this was, of course, prior to my Amazonian days.For the last five years I have often thought about the book, and for the life of me, I could not remember what in the world the name of the book was... Wouldn't you guess that I would find it while looking up Monty Python movies?In any event, if you like action-adventure-scifi-cool wormhole travel beams that magically appear in the desert-and more, then you will totally dig this book.

I think this was the coolest book I ever read."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"Wow!This book was excellent,I don't think there's one part I disliked.I would rate this book with 5 stars because it was outstanding how Gary Paulsen matched the characters with what they feel.I liked how Mark was able to survive in another culture ,after being transported from the desert in a blue light to another planet in another time.I really liked how Mark became a very important member(a warrior) of the Tsook.I thought it was a little weird though, how Mark fell in love with the cheif's daughter,Megaan, from the Tsook, rather then the slave that he had known from when he first got there.I was suprised at how many people turned against Mark and wanted to be the one to stop the outlander.If you like science ficton and mystery, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"The Transall Saga by Gary Paulsen has to be one of the best books I've ever read.The Transall Saga is an adventure book.

You will like it so much you won't be able to tell someone about it in 5 minutes or less.If you like you read this book is calling your name!"},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"The Transall Saga is a thrilling book that would appeal to many young adults. The fast pace plot keeps your thoughts in the book even when you are not reading. It makes it very hard to put down. Gary Paulsen is an exceptional author that has captured the minds of many young adult readers through his books of survival and adventure. The Transall Saga is no different. Being one of the first science fiction books Paulsen has written, he has proven he can write just as well in different genres. His vision of the new world in this book is fascinating. He doesn't leave any of the senses untouched as he goes in depth in the setting. Paulsen has a way of bonding the reader and the character. Mark, the main character, must adapt to a strange new world and survive long enough to find a way back home. But as the reader, you feel frustrated and start to loose hope along with Mark. On many accounts my heart was working up a sweat as Mark ran or was threatened for life. Overall, I thought this was a great book for young adults or simply a quick read some of the more advanced readers. Either way, the book will catch you, and Mark's adventure to find a way back home will keep you reading. Then, you can find out for yourself if the ruler of the new world will give Mark the secrets he needs and still allow him to keep his life. The theme that we should all adapt to change is something that we could all use. If this is your first Gary Paulsen book, your in for a treat. Hopefully, it will open you up to more of his pieces."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"I read this book in about 8th grade for a book report.

They should make it into a movie when they have better special effects for cheaper costs.

Who knew it could be so much trouble?.........But is it really trouble? This thrilling adventure actually shows mark's purpose in life.It puts him in the best shape of his life, causes him to put his live survival skills to the test, and causes him to build friendships he never thought possible.When Mark goes on a camping trip in the desert he falls into a strange iridescent beam of light and is transported to another time or planet he must find his way back to his own time.I really liked the medieval setting. Gary Paulson is also an awesome adventure/survival author. He describes settings and creatures very well. Along with that he uses smaller words to describe whatever he is describing. That way younger kids will understand what he means, and at the same time he describes it just as well as if he had used larger words. It can also teach you some survival skills too. I also can teach you a little of a made up language. The plot is really clear throughout the entire book. Another good thing is all of the suspense. This book has a never-ending chain of suspense. This book also has a lot of themes: friendship, courage, patience, survival, loyalty and trust.Oct. 1 - Oct 31Paulson, Gary. (1999).

Some parts I feel like I am in the book but of course I am not!!!I recommend this book to any one that enjoys adventurous reading. I had a great time reading it I hope you have the same feelings as well!!!"},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"It's the mark of a great writer when he can take the same concept (A young man is dumped somehow in a harsh, unfamiliar world and must struggle to survive) and still make it refreshing and interesting no matter how many others we've read before.In the Transall Saga, our protagonist is Mark Harrison, a likable young man who is kidnapped by a mysterious blue light and dropped into a dangerous yet strangely familiar world. Paulsen shows his skill by making us see how Mark learns and adapts to his new world. It's entirely believable when he makes and uses crude wepaons to find food, and his pragmatism shows him as an intelligent character who learns to survive while still remembering his roots.Now, I won't spoil anything for you, but let me just say that this book still has a lot of twists. Paulsen writes them in such a way that you'll accept them easily while still being surprised. The mystery of the blue lights and the strange world was very well laid out, just like in most of Paulsen's other works.I recommend this book to anyone who likes fantastic settings, survival stories, and ingenious and compassionate heroes.--Five stars."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"The book that I read was Transall Saga by Gary Paulsen. This book is about a boy named Mark who went camping with his family. While he was camping he heard a noise, and went to go see what it was. When he got closer he found out that it was a rattle snake, and he got to close and jumped back. He landed in a blue transporter and when he landed, he realized he was in a totally different planet. At this different planet he was looking for people and he saw all these people. He found out it was a tribe, because they captured him and they made him help them. Mark started asking the tribe about this transporter and they said it only bring you back when it wants to bring you back.I liked Transall Saga overall because I thought it was very exciting. This book was also by Gary Paulsen and I have always liked his books because they have a lot of action. The part I liked the most was when Mark was in the transporter and didn't no where he was.I also had some dislikes for my book and one of my dislikes was in some parts of the book it was confusing. Another was when Mark jumped back and fell into the transporter; I thought it could have had more detail.I would recommend this book to boys who like Gary Paulsen. I would also give this book to boys between the age of twelve and fifteen. Boys would also like this book if they like reading action or adventurous stories."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"The book The transall Saga by Gary Paulson is very interesting.It is a survial story about a young man named Mark. Mark was a very young man who was on a solo backpacking trip for one week. When he fell into a blue light he was transported to another world. He is trapped in a very primitive and unaddvanced world. If he wants to get back home he must survive and between the scarce food, the violent tribes, and the predatorial creatures this will be quite an obstacle. The author did a very good job of decribing the scene. This was very important because it was an entirely diffrent world. The story is set in modern times but the story spans through many years.The thing that is different than other adventure books is that other books take place on Earth. Mark's adventure is on a completely different planet.people who like survival books would definitly love this book. The author made it so that no one chapter was boring, they were all interesting. At the begining of the story mark's quotes are all very short and simple because he was talking to his monkey friend, Willie. I had to read this chapter by chapter because there is so much happening in between the chapters that it is hard to put down.This book is similar to Treasure Island by Robert Stevenson. It has many near death encounters and is very exciting. I felt that this book was very fun to read and in a style of writing that was easy to understand.The Transall Saga is a great book, but this only applies if you read it."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"Mark went solo camping in the mountain range. He was going to meet his parents at the end of it, and then head home. He heard this hissing sound and went to go check it out. It turns out that it was a rattled snake. When he got close he jumped back because he didn't think that the snake was that close. When he did that he landed in this blue light. This transported him to a place he thought was a different planet. But he figured it was a time far after his. When he is there he goes through pain and a lot of it. He thinks that he is the only one on this \\"planet\\". He finds thinks that proves to him that other people are there. He gets captured by tribes and helps tribes. Throughout this time he looks for the blue light but can't find it. He soon figures out that it strikes where ever it wants, and that makes him hopeless.For the most part I liked this book it was full of action and adventure and it is a little funny. I really didn't have any dislike beside some times it was a little confusing.

Also there are new types of humans. Now Mark must use everything he knows to survive and to find the mysterious light to get back home.This book has a lot of action in it and it keeps you wandering the whole time. That is one of the reasons I like this book. The only thing I didn't like is the book just kind of stops at the end. It is a great book though. I can compare this book to a lot of books Will Hobbs writes because they both have a lot of action. I could also compare this book to any survival books because Mark has to survive.

Robert Heinlen, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Andre Norton... In the same vein this is a good adventure yarn of a stranger lost in another land.The author is well known for his great teen survival stories (like Hatchet) and western adventures, has written a new teen adventure in the genre that I grew up with and miss so much.

He spun around and received a crashing blow to the side of his head.\\"(Pg. 15) You feel like you're there going through that with Mark throughout the whole story.I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys a good adventure and anyone that has ever read anything by Gary Paulsen.I was sorry that it had to end."},{"Title":"The Transall Saga","review":"Noone has ever been in to the future but the author, Gary Pausen, makes it seem so real.

He awakes to be on what appears to be another planet. THE TRANSALL SAGA is all about survival of the fitest.Mark is a relatively calm and cool character. I mean, who can survive in a world that they knows nothing about with the clothes on his black and a pocketknife. All his life, Mark has wanted to saomething like this. Know he is forced to. Through out his journey, Mark makes loyal friends and dreaded enemies.Mark soon learns the dangers of the new world . The first thing that attacks him is a buffalo like creture. He learns about the scorpion things when he layes on top of a colony. In the jungle, there is always the danger of falling out of a tree while collecting food. There is the chilling howl of the Howling Thing which he hears every night before he flls asleep.One day while on a scouting trip, he finds an arrow. That means there are other humans in the area.

Mark gets through his teenage years first as a slave, then as a hero, then a lover and finishes a warrior.

I laughed and laughed when Mark got a bird poop right after he got out of the quicksand. All the parts of the story was fun and interesting except for one part. That was the part when Mark got in to the beam of light accidently while he was being attacked in the last part of the book.

The history was written in the late 1930s, so many of the historical characters he writes about were his contemporaries, albeit somewhat older and he was personally acquainted with a few of them. Much of the story is antidotal with some downright hilarious tales. The story of Tabor in Leadville is so outrageous, it could not have been made up. His contemporary descriptions of the towns in 1940 are now historical accounts. It makes the reader want to travel to them today to see how they have changed in the past 70 or so years. Highly recommend this historical read."},{"Title":"Who's Bugging You? (Sliding Surprise Book)","review":"Charles Reasoner has designed a whole series of these interactive sliding books. All of them will probably have to be read with your child since the sliding feature is simply too hard to them to work. Each pages describes the action of a particular bug and then asks which bug does such and such. In all of his books, the animals are hidden between the page (which you are supposed to pull apart to reveal the animal). If your child was to look at it alone, he would simply be viewing pages of scenery. The bugs also look very cartoonish and don't entirely resemble what they are supposed to be. Having said this, I don't regret the purchase and recommend this book - with some reservations."},{"Title":"Who's Bugging You? (Sliding Surprise Book)","review":"This series of books (all by Charles Reasoner) is a lot of fun. Each book has pages that split in the middle and slide open, revealing a hidden picture on a page hidden inside. On each page there is a question - for this book they start with, &quot;Which bug ...?&quot; (i.e. which bug does such and such) and the answer is a picture of the bug inside. The illustrations are colorful and bold and the bugs are cute.The books in this series are some of the favorite books of our friends' daughter (toddler). Our daughter (also a toddler) loves the pictures but the mechanics of the sliding pages are stiff, so she can't slide the pictures in and out herself, and that makes her very frustrated!! This is a great book if you have a toddler who likes to have you read to him/her, and it's also attractive enough for them to read on their own without sliding the pages (though they don't get to see the bugs that way). If your toddler wants to be independent and &quot;read&quot; to him or herself, though, it could be frustrating. It's a very creative idea, and I still rate it at 4 stars because it really is a fun book to read. I think, though, that it doesn't work as well as was originally intended."},{"Title":"Heaven's Prisoners","review":"Heaven's Prisoners by James Lee Burke is the second book in his Dave Robicheaux mystery series. While Burke's series has grown to be one of the best ever, in Heaven's Prisoners, he's still in the growing stage.Since book one, Neon Rain, Robicheaux has quit the New Orleans Police Department, cashed in his pension and bought a boat-and-bait business on a bayou in New Iberia. He has also married Annie Ballard. They have tried to settle into a quiet life, but it's just not in Robicheaux's nature. Robicheaux and Annie are boating on the Gulf when they see a plane go down. Robicheaux straps on his scuba tank, and is able to rescue a small girl (the four adults are already dead). The girl is a Salvadoran refugee and Robicheaux and Annie name her Alafair and decide to raise her as their own. But when federal authorities report that only three bodies were onboard the plane, Robicheaux starts investigating the identity of the mystery man and the reason for the cover-up. He is first visited by the DEA and Immigration. Then he is threatened by mob enforcers and told to mind his own business. It soon becomes obvious that the Iberian Sheriff's Department is clueless (the sheriff runs a dry cleaning business with greater efficiency), so Robicheaux reluctantly joins the sheriff's department as a deputy.Heaven's Prisoners follows the same formula of most Burke books. Robicheaux stumbles onto something illegal or suspicious. When he starts investigating, he gets threatened and warned off by some bad guys (mobsters, feds, crooked cops and/or unscrupulous businessmen). Robicheaux can't just leave things alone, and the situation quickly escalates. He's not the bumbling Inspector Columbo, armed with only a wrinkled trench coat. Instead, he bursts on the scene with a loaded and cocked .45. And then something catastrophic occurs.This book is Burke's darkest book yet, and Robicheaux deals with his alcoholism, Viet Nam flashbacks and death. While he claims to loathe \\"the political hypocrisy and the addictive, brutal ugliness of metropolitan law enforcement,\\" Robicheaux finally admits that he actually \\"loved the adrenaline rush of danger\\" and his \\"feelings of power over an evil world.\\" Unfortunately, this comes at the expense of his family.What made reading this book especially sobering was reading it immediately after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina to New Orleans and southern Louisiana. Burke has a true love affair with NOLA and the bayou, and I hope that this area can be brought back to its former beauty (rural areas, towns and cities alike). Burke quotes an eerily prophetic set of lyrics from a John Fogerty song that read: \\"Don't come \`round tonight/It's bound to take your life/A bad moon's on the rise/I hear hurricane's a blowing/I know the end is coming soon/I feel the river overflowing/I can hear the voice of rage and ruin.\\"I enjoyed Heaven's Prisoners and it definitely filled in more gaps about Robicheaux's background. Also, Burke continues to be a master of down-home witticisms. One of my favorites is \\"I'm floating around on an ice cube that's melting in a toilet.\\" I have two more books on deck, but then I think I'm going to take a little break. I need to start reading something a little less dark for a spell."},{"Title":"Heaven's Prisoners","review":"I've read most of Burke's Dave Robicheaux series, and enjoyed them quite a bit. Heaven's Prisoners is one of the two best, the other being In the Electric Mist with Confederate Dead. Mist is Burke at his most exotic--Dave's on an acid trip for a substantial part of the book; Heaven's Prisoners is Burke at his darkest. I'm unwilling to go into the plot; in fact I strongly urge you not to read further reviews as there are substantial spoilers in many of them that will ruin the experience for you. Suffice it to say there's plenty of action, plenty of suspense. Of course, most any thriller or action novel today promises that; where Burke is unusual is in his ability to handle language. He writes like he's in love with language, and it's a pleasure to read him. Mickey Spillane once said about himself that he didn't write novels, he wrote books; Burke definitely writes novels, and extremely literate ones at that. He's one of a generation of novelists, along with Michael Connelly, James Hall, and Dennis Lehane, who have inherited the mantle of Raymond Chandler and wear it with pride; in Burke's case, he seems also to draw inspiration from William Faulkner. Robicheaux's a complex man, tortured by his own inadequacies and yet immensely strong simultaneously, and he's a prisoner of the dark, decaying Southern environment he was raised in. If you prefer simple action, plots, and characters like Mike Hammer or Robert Parker's Spenser, you'll surely think Burke is overwritten. But for a real literate treat, with an electric story, fantastic dialogue and descriptions, and characters you'll want to revisit, read Heaven's Prisoners. I almost never reread a fiction book, except by accident--there's just too much new stuff out there; but I deliberately read this one again, and enjoyed it just as much the second time."},{"Title":"Heaven's Prisoners","review":"Readers expecting a standard detective novel will be amazed at the literary quality of Burke's characters and landscape. Even those who know nothing about Southern Louisiana or Cajun culture will feel that they have been there. The story is tautly constructed but the dialogue and descriptive passages are some of the best in the world of today's writers. Burke's use of colloquial names like the &quot;four-corners&quot; rather than the &quot;crossroads&quot; makes an individual place very real. It is very frustrating to Burke/Robicheaux fans that the movie, well cast, beautifully photographed, and with the same atmosphere as the book was caught up in Hollywood studio politics and when finally released after a lengthy delay received no advertizing or other promotion. Alec Baldwin's portrayal of Robicheaux gives all Burke readers a mental image to carry as they read all the other seven books about this complex literary character. James Lee Burke has also written a number of! books NOT about the Cajun detective and they are all worth a read and a re-read."},{"Title":"Heaven's Prisoners","review":"James lee Burke is one of thosed underrated masters of prose,forever delegated to second rung because of his genre. Heavens prisoners, the second in this series,is,in many ways, the best. Dave Robicheux, the alcoholic new Orleans cop,is out fishing when a single engine plane crashes into the lake,and everything changes.Mr. Burke's descriptions of alcoholic despair and rage are perhaps the finest,and least sentimental I have read. The violence is brutal and freakish in its intensity[as violence is],the dialogue is so well written that i feel for these characters,and want to read more. Though much Longer then Neon rain, the first entry,Mr. Burkes seems to hold the intensity through the narrative. From the lousiana locales to histroical comments on Cajuns, from Cletus Purcell{his sort of sidekick]to the suprising[at least for me] ending, Mr. Burke solidifes himself as one superb writer.And, fortunately, the series goes on ..."},{"Title":"Heaven's Prisoners","review":"That James Lee Burke is one of the most talented writers of modern fiction cannot be denied. Few superlatives would exaggerate the power of his lyrical prose; the lucid images his words conjure. Burke's southern Louisiana bayous are no mere backdrops in which a mystery is dropped, but such forceful allegory that character and plot sometimes must play a secondary role to his poetry. But therein lies the problem - Burke's mood and moodiness, as reflected in the character of Dave Robicheaux, can eventually wear down even the most ardent Burke fan. Nowhere is this sense of despair and desperation more apparent than in \\"Heaven's Prisoners\\", the second in the Robicheaux series. Ostensibly a thriller/mystery involving a suspicious plane crash and Robicheaux's unofficial investigation of the forces behind it, this is really the tale of Robicheaux's (and Burke's, one would assume) internal struggles with alcoholism, guilt, self-doubt, and eventual revenge. In the Louisiana of \\"Heaven's Prisoners\\", it seems to rain only slightly less than in \\"Blade Runner\\", providing the perfect settings for the author's rather bleak outlook on culture, love, and the inequities of life in general. Bleeding heart liberalism is always lurking surreptitiously between the lines of Burke's fiction, though in this one, the cause of Burke's despair is less apparent. In summary, \\"Heaven's Prisoners\\" is an effort typical of Burke's superb literary skills, though not his finest. If the reader is looking for redemption as a reward of following Burke's meandering journey of self-pity and doubt, I fear that, like our hero Robicheaux, in the end will come up short."},{"Title":"Heaven's Prisoners","review":"\\"Most criminals are stupid. They creep $500,000 homes in the Garden District, load up two dozen bottles of gin, whiskey, vermouth, and collins mix in a $2,000 Irish linen tablecloth and later drink the booze and throw the tablecloth away.\\"One of many quotes of brilliance from Dave Robicheaux, of course, written in the many novels of one James Lee Burke. You read this guy, you might find him kind of rough around the edges. But you'll find among the grit, a poetic edge that most authors would die for! He knows how to write, and he really knows how to put together a mystery in Louisiana territory, right in the heart of the Bayou. My Robicheaux adventures began with \\"Cadillac Jukebox,\\" went on to \\"Jolie Blon's Bounce,\\" and then I finally decided to go back in time to where it all began, \\"The Neon Rain,\\" and I was literally blown away. And \\"Heaven's Prisoners\\" was the next grinding long haul for Dave Robicheaux. Would I be impressed? You bet!Dave and his wife, Annie, are getting on with their lives, selling bait, and enjoying what is simple. That simplicity is about to become complicated rather quickly with a plane crash on the Gulf. But with the crash, a sweet little girl comes in the picture, and we know her as Alafair. And Dave rekindles his sense of being a protector, bringing this little one into his home. Things do not completely go as planned.A childhood friend, Bubba Roque, and his unusual wife, enter the picture, whether they like it or not. Roque has a boxer's chin, and his wife isn't the sharpest tool in the shed. But murder and crime are a part of this picture, and whether Dave is a detective or not, the murder of Annie makes everything personal! Robicheaux is back on the scene with a badge, and he's on his own mission.I'm calling James Lee Burke a legend in his own time, and I hope he stays that way. I don't get sick of his stories, and I thrive off the passion he puts into the moment! He's quotable in everyday life, maybe even your own personal podna throughout the journey. He can be dead serious, yet he can also bring a sense of humor to situations when the time is right. He speaks of delights such as catfish dinners, or Grapenuts with strawberries for breakfast, while still enjoying his morning coffee, with or without a hangover. There are certain demons to be battled with Burke and his work. But when those demons are conquered, you can't wait for the next round!"},{"Title":"Heaven's Prisoners","review":"I am a pretty big fan of the Dave Robicheaux series but this was my least favorite book so far. I understand that Dave has a \\"cowboy\\" personality and always wants to rebel against any kind of authority figure but it was way overdone in this book.Also, I got pretty tired of young, really attra active women begging to sleep with Dave (a not-so-young alcoholic who has tons of issues and isn't particularly attractive). Once the third girl came after him, I was really rolling my eyes...All of that said, I really do like the series and have enjoyed many of the other books.

He goes at it with Bubba Rocque, a man he grew up with and has known for years. Bubba in one of the bad guys now. But, is it Bubba or his wife that is the worse. Burke writes so you can feel like you are there. You can see the people fishing and moving through the darkness. Except for his flashbacks I would give it a 5 rating but I don't care for those. A good book that will hold you attention."},{"Title":"Heaven's Prisoners","review":"I picked up this second book in the series because I had very much enjoyed The Neon Rain which was gritty, violent and dark, and very well written. The writing here is still very good but there are a few major things wrong with this book that made me want to put it down.1) The plot basically doesn't exist. Here's my summary: Our hero is bored with his worm & bait business and beautiful wife, so he decides to meddle in other people's affairs. Those people send him a warning. He's insulted and meddles some more. The bad guys retaliate, and our here decides it's time to take revenge because \\"they\\" did him wrong. How much more basic could it get?2) The hero is middle aged, right? Yet all the women have the hots for him, no matter if it's the busty country girl, the busty hooker with the good heart or the busty lesbian gangster chick.3) And further to number 2 ... his wife, the busty country girl keeps nagging him about not sticking his nose into other people's business. Yet when the going gets tough she for no believable reason decides to stick around until it's her turn to get shot.4) But most infuriating of all ... Dave just decides to give the newly acquired refugee girl a new name, calling her Alafair of all things. The girl can talk, has a past, and probably a name. We don't know though because no one ever asks her.Actually, this book is pretty terrible compared with The Neon Rain. However, I'd give it about 1.5 stars because the writing is still superior, the second half is better than the first, and I actually finished reading it. I'm hoping that this author who writes so beautifully will actually have something to say in the next book of the series."},{"Title":"Heaven's Prisoners","review":"I was a little disappointed, not one of his better books.

He's also married to his love interest from book one but DR can't avoid a mystery and one stumbles upon him while he's out fishing on the bayou and just like any good fictional detective he pokes his nose into places and violent, corrupt people get angry. But the real strengths of this tale (other than it being a solid mystery) are the focuses, as usual, upon the bayou and New Orleans (NOLA) and DR's alcoholism for a dark tragedy comes down upon him and he finds himself drinking that \\"golden fire\\" once more. Rarely have I read something that has made me understand the addictions of alcohol and how hard it is to shake off. But even all those reading pleasures are a still a notch down from the character of New Orleans/The Bayou with its balmy heat waves, summer rains, poorboy sandwiches, evening skies that are the color of torn plums, cicadas in the purple haze, fireflies lighting up the trees, and, of course, the charm of not just New Orleans but its French Quarter. That makes it a pleasure to read and bumps up the overall quality of the novel. I look forward to reading the next one.

Burke has done a great job in creating a realistic hero in Dave Robicheaux. Rather than your typical perfect, mistake-free protagonist, Robicheaux is clearly flawed but you want to root for him.

I started in the middle and have been alternately reading new ones when they come out and older ones to fill in the gaps. I enjoyed this novel but have to admit that I could probably write the same, or a similar review, for all of his novels. They follow a formula - although it's a good formula that works - but even so, the novels are so rich in character and atmosphere that the fact that the novel's plots are almost interchangeable can be easily overlooked.If you prefer straight-forward action and characters you'll likely find Burke to be a little overwritten. But if you like flawed characters, moral ambiguity, and prose that is pure poetry you'll appreciate Burke's ability to elevate crime fiction. Burke evokes incredible imagery with his words, writes some of the best dialogue going, and unleashes some great southern witticisms.The plot of course, is a familiar one. Dave stumbles onto something suspicious (in this case he witnesses a plane crash and even though four people are killed, the media reports only three). He investigates (even though he isn't a cop at the time), gets warned to back off but clearly that isn't in his nature. In quick order he sets his sights on a rich & unscrupulous business man/mobster and things escalate. The stakes get higher and lives are lost but inevitably Dave, tenacious and principled as always, is determined to see his quarry brought down. Of course in Burke's world, Dave pays a heavy price for his obsession.Dave is a tortured soul wrestling with demons and his own flaws and violent nature. Heaven's Prisoner's is another dark entry in the series. The story isn't as complex as some of the newer novels but it's a solid entry in the series. If you enjoy Burke, I'm confident you'll enjoy Heaven's Prisoners. The only thing it's missing is Clete Purcell who is one of the best fictional characters ever created. As someone reading the books in random order, this novel filled in a few gaps in the characters lives for me which is an added bonus. If you don't care for Burke, there's no reason to think Heaven's Prisoners will change your mind."},{"Title":"Heaven's Prisoners","review":"\\"Heaven's Prisoners,\\" (1988), is the second installment in the American author James Lee Burke's New York Times bestselling Dave Robicheaux series. Like the first of the series,The Neon Rain: A Dave Robicheaux Novel (Dave Robicheaux Mysteries), and most of the works to follow, the book, a Southern noir, police procedural/mystery, is set in and around New Orleans, Louisiana, more or less home country for Burke, who was born in Houston, Texas, in 1936, and grew up on the Texas-Louisiana gulf coast.We first met detective Dave Robicheaux, previously briefly mentioned in Burke's first book,Half of Paradise, as a detective on the New Orleans police force; he lived on a houseboat in nearby Lake Pontchartrain. The detective is of Cajun ancestry, and is still reliving the nightmare of his service in Vietnam. He has a drinking problem, and a tendency to violence. His first wife had already left him for a Houston oilman.In \\"Heaven's Prisoners,\\" Robicheaux will be married to his second, Annie, a social worker, whom he met in \\"Neon Rain.\\" In this second installment of the series, Robicheaux has quit his job with the New Orleans P.D., and moved back to his birthplace, New Iberia, the actual house in which he was born, in fact, where he owns and operates a boat rental and bait business. He is assisted in this enterprise by a black man, Batist, whom we also briefly met in \\"Half of Paradise.\\" We will also see quite a bit - as we will throughout the series-- of his former partner on the N.O.P.D., Clete Purcell, an overweight, heavy-drinking, brawling, heavily-scarred survivor of the city's tough Irish Channel neighborhood.We will also again meet some other characters we'll continue to see in the early Robicheaux books: his half-brother Jimmie, who has drifted into underworld associations; like Dave himself, he has in his black hair a skunk-like white streak (said to be a product of childhood malnutrition): Dave is known to some, in these early books, as \\"Streak.\\". We learn a lot about Dave's mother and father - we are told about \\"the collapsed and twisted wreckage of the offshore oil rig on which [his] father drowned over twenty years ago,\\" a reference only too current in light of the summer, 2010, explosion of an offshore oil rig, and undersea gas leak into the Gulf of Mexico.In this outing, a plane crash on the Gulf brings a young Hispanic girl, whom he will quietly and illegally adopt, into Robicheaux's life. Robicheaux will name her Alafair and thereby confuse generations of mystery readers familiar with the fact that Alafair Burke, James Lee Burke's real life daughter, now also writes mysteries. We're told in the book that Alafair is a Cajun name that runs in Robicheaux's family: apparently it also runs in Burke's. However, the plane crash also throws Robicheaux into harm's way in regard to local rings that smuggle drugs, and illegal immigrants. The detective will find himself up against Bubba Rocque, a brutal gangster he's known since childhood, and his beautiful, hungry Cajun wife Claudette; Toot, a sadistic former Tonton Macoute from Haiti, and Eddie Keels, a hitman from Brooklyn.More than anything else, seems to me, we'll enjoy some of the most beautiful, knowledgeable writing ever committed to paper about the flora, fauna, geography, and human occupants of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast, now so much in the news. Just read the opening page of this book: what a treat it is.Burke attended Southwestern Louisiana Institute; later received B. A. and M. A. degrees from the University of Missouri in 1958 and 1960 respectively. Over the years he worked as a landman for Sinclair Oil Company, a pipeliner, land surveyor, newspaper reporter, college English professor, social worker on Skid Row in Los Angeles, clerk for the Louisiana Employment Service, and instructor in the U. S. Job Corps. His work has twice been awarded an Edgar for Best Crime Novel of the Year. At least eight of his novels, including the more recentJolie Blon's Bounce,Purple Cane RoadandCadillac Jukebox (Dave Robicheaux Mysteries)have been New York Times bestsellers. The books of the Robicheaux series of course, stand independently, and you can happily begin it with this one, still, you might want to go back to the beginning with \\"Neon Rain.\\""},{"Title":"Heaven's Prisoners","review":"Dave Robicheaux and Annie are married and live in New Iberia, far away from the trouble in New Orleans. They are happy with their bait shop business until a plane crashes and Dave saves the only survivor-a little girl named Alafair. Annie and Dave adopt her, but the family is put in danger when Dave starts asking questions about the plane crash, particularly why Immigration only reported three people died, when Dave knows there were four. Then a brutal murder takes place and causes Dave to go on another alcoholic bender. In the end, It's not clear who the murderer was and why. But oh can Burke write!"},{"Title":"Heaven's Prisoners","review":"Maybe I was expecting too much from this first sequel since the first book 'Neon Rain' was so good. This book seems to have enough murders to make a Sam Pekinpah movie look PG-13. Especially the killing of Annie would have no reason behind it except to make Robicheaux even more pathetic a human being than he was before.The parts that deal with the little girl are well done and quite touching without being saccharin. But, every time he mentions what she's wearing he has to add that Annie bought that for her. Then his dealings with Robin, seem to come out of nowhere, and then all of a sudden, she's gone too.His hunting down of Annie's killer(s), does seem right in line with the type of person Dave's suppose to be; but his use of his old friend in going on to the police force for no other reason than that, seems way out of character.At one point, Burke makes him so depressed that his descriptions of the weather and the look of the bayou, got me to the point where I was afraid that I would need to increase my medication to prevent myself from doing something rash.So much is left open at the end, that it should have discussed the next sequel, so we would know what was going to be addressed in the next novel. Needless to say, I like the character and hope that Burke will get on with whatever he has planned for him."},{"Title":"Heaven's Prisoners","review":"Dave Robicheaux is a classic, tragic hero. He has retired to the Bayou to find serenity, but trouble falls from the sky and brings him a blessing and a curse. Dave's weakness for poking bullies in the eye with a sharp stick starts a chain of events that costs him his wife and a trip into Hell. James Lee Burke paints beautiful, cruel pictures of Dave's Bayou world, and he has created a noble, battered character that fights his internal demons as hard as he fights the monsters in the real world. Heaven's Prisoners is one of Burke's best."},{"Title":"Heaven's Prisoners","review":"I have finally found a new character to be completely facinated with. I read this book because of the movie and was surprised to find that the movie was a fairly faithful representation of the novel (much moreso than &quot;The Lost World&quot; and other movies). Dave Robichaux is a facinating character and you really get a feel for his world. James Lee Burke pulls no punches as he drags his hero through the depths of the sleezy underworld of the lower Louisiana Parishes. This book is facinating fast read and I couldn't put it down. I have to pull out the Visa and buy the rest of the Dave Robicheaux books. I suggest you do the same"},{"Title":"Heaven's Prisoners","review":"One of the tightest, well-paced and atmospheric novels you could hope to read. Burke brings the atmosphere of Cajun lore, past and present, so vividly to life, you'll start calling people 'Podna'!"},{"Title":"Heaven's Prisoners","review":"I listened to this one on tape. The reader was perfect for the part. The story, however, left me high and dry. I felt like I'd fallen asleep and missed the part where he avenges his wife. Maybe I did. This was a depressing story for the most part but done by a talented writer. Too bad it seemed to stop instead of end. Loose ends left blowing in the wind all over the place."},{"Title":"Heaven's Prisoners","review":"Burke is a master at language. Most of his characters have depth and humor. Even those you dislike, and believe me there are a few. And he writes a hell of a mystery.

I saw the movie and I thought that was very good but the book is still much better."},{"Title":"Heaven's Prisoners","review":"I think readers want to know whether or not a book is worth reading, rather than my telling the story. I think it is a really good book in this series. As a woman, I think he went from Annie, his wife that is killed, into another woman's bed a bit too quickly. I think the ending could have been made clearer. All in all it is a good, moody book. Dave has a lot of intelligent insight into his own psyche. May help us to have a peek into our own. From reviews, I can see the movie made from this novel is a loser, so I will skip it."},{"Title":"Heaven's Prisoners","review":"This is the second in the Dave Robicheaux series and continues the story after The Neon Rain...I started out with the 7th in the series (Dixie City Jam) and liked it so much I went back and started from the first to get the character's background etc. Mr. Burke does describe real violence and you have to get used to that but he is a wonderful writer. Having lived in New Orleans (before Katrina thank God) I have loved the books for the descriptions he gives on the city and area. His books are really \\"good reads\\"..."},{"Title":"Heaven's Prisoners","review":"If you don't know - buy it - or search the author and start at the beginning! Louisiana detective Dave Robicheaux has been my book buddy for years... well in my world!"},{"Title":"Heaven's Prisoners","review":"Former New Orleans homicide detective lieutenant Dave Robicheaux has returned to his roots in Cajun Louisiana and is running a bait and boat rental shop in the bayou surrounding his home town of New Iberia. Assisted by his nurturing, corn fed, Kansas farm girl wife Annie he is living a peaceful existence but always fighting off the demons of alcoholism.Robicheaux's quiet country existence is shattered as he and Annie espy a small plane flying overhead billowing smoke from its fuselage. They watch as the plane crashes and hurriedly cruise over to the site in their motorboat which they had been fishing in. Robicheaux straps on diving tanks and submerges to the wreck where he rescues a young Hispanic girl who is miraculously still alive and breathing from a small air pocket in the plane. Robicheaux notices that the four other passengers were not so lucky and have perished.Robicheaux and Annie a childless couple intend to keep the child and name her after his mother Alafair. A visit from agents from the Immigration and Naturalization Service suggests that the plane might have been used for drug smuggling and that only three bodies were recovered. He gets contacted by the DEA who are obviously out of the loop because they also confirm only three victims.Robicheaux's interest becomes piqued and he begins to investigate. He turns his attention to an old friend and high school rival of his Bubba Rocque a wealthy local crime kingpin who has his fingers in a wide array of illegal enterprises including drugs and prostitution. Rocque is fueled in part by his wife the fetching dark haired Cajun beauty Claudette, who is known for her flirtatious and dykish ways. Robicheaux is warned to back off but unfortunately this isn't his way. In the middle of the night the Robicheaux's get a visit from a shotgun wielding gunman who he observes as he's outside trying to fight insomnia. In a murderous barrage meant for him, the innocent Annie is brutally slain, before he can intervene.Robicheaux is supported in his quest to unveil the circumstances behind Annie's killing by among others DEA agent ex-star college basketballer Minos Dautrieve, a principled man with no love for Rocque and his associates. He scours the Louisiana countryside searching for associates of Rocque who he suspects of the murder.Robicheaux tottering on the slippery edge of sobriety joins up with the New Iberia sheriff's department to add authority to his now obsessive investigation.Burke's descriptive narrations of the setting creates a bewitching and enchanting natural landscape in which this emotional drama transpires. His flawed hero Robicheaux is thoughtfully portrayed as he struggles to corral the turmoil he feels within to orchestrate an all encompassing inquest while averting extreme danger to himself and his extended family."},{"Title":"Heaven's Prisoners","review":"I ordered Heaven's Prisoners by James Lee Burke on July 15th, 2008 using \\"Standard\\" delivery and received the book on July 17th!!

See my review of Crusader's Cross for a general review."},{"Title":"Heaven's Prisoners","review":"After reading most of Mr Burke's books, I finally got around to reading this book because a movie was coming based on it. This book tells how Dave comes about &quot;adopting&quot; Alafair and how she got her name and how he lost his first wife which he alludes in his other books.His black helper is here also and other assorted denizens of the parish. Some may find our hero's constant fighting of his demons depressing, but this only adds to the humanity of the protaginist. The movie was credible but ending left a little to be desired as it was changed from the bok's finale"},{"Title":"Heaven's Prisoners","review":"Though I am definitely hooked on Burke's writing, this was not his best effort. In fact, I couldn't help but feel this book was written to eliminate Annie so the series could continue unencumbered. I don't think Annie could survive in Dave's world with any real contentment as they have such polarizing personalities and sensibilities. The scene where Annie gets killed but Robicheaux survives was a bit too convenient to be convincing. Nor does it seem that the man I've come to know as a tough straight talking introspective thinker like Dave would so quickly get over the likes of Annie and take up with a woman like Robin. This was a bit of a stretch and made me dislike his character for using others as he engaged in what appeared to be self-indulgence. I didn't see any real remorse or sorrow over Annie's passing--no period of bereavement, as I would expect from a man like Dave.The scenes regarding alcoholism and the demons that plague Dave are very believable and appear to be drawn from the author's own experiences. But, even in this regard, Burke went a little too far to the dark side. While we want a believable likeable protagonist we don't want to spend most of our time feeling sorry for him and in this novel Robicheaux seems to be wallowing in his own self-pity and using his wife's brutal murder as an excuse to act out.Burke has a special way of turning words into flowing prose unmatched in his genre. This book was no exception. While it was a gritty and horrific story, the setting, mood and dialogue sparked like electricity, leaving the reader panting for more. The prose is poetic in a lot of places and written so you're compelled to go back to taste it again and again.Burke also brings in characters that we care about, such as Alifair as well as characters that are vile and/or twisted--all of them fully fleshed out and multi-faceted. Again, Burke brings us into a place where we can feel the humidity and smell the bayou. At this, he is a master. He also has the potential to reminisce about the good old days and we remember along with him as though we too had experienced his history and it becomes our history. Burke creates a storyline that is tense, layered, and filled with complex characters and even though I felt this book was a bit of a filler for what is to come, it was still a exciting action-packed read that will keep you turning the pages far into the night."},{"Title":"Heaven's Prisoners","review":"Plot-wise and writing-wise, this book is as good as Burke's others. But it lacked heart, considering Dave's loss. For a guy who's pretty introspective (about his drinking and the war,etc.), he doesn't seem to give a second thought about Annie after she's killed. He talks a little (very little) about his guilt, but not about how he misses her and loved her. Instead he turns almost immediately to Robin, which just doesn't seem in character. It bothered me and got that fifth star knocked off."},{"Title":"Heaven's Prisoners","review":"definitely use these guys again if the price is right..."},{"Title":"Heaven's Prisoners","review":"Total beach book.

I have read all of his work and recently traveled to New Orleans and found it like it had been described in his novels. Its like I had been there before. I consider him the best writer in his field. His character development is uncanny. He can't publish them fast enough for me."},{"Title":"GenX and God - A GenX Perspective","review":"A great book! Until this point, all Generation X books I've read are ABOUT the generation and contain ministry tips. But this book, while it contains some helpful demographic information, is written TO Generation X. It moves from discussion about the generation into action for the generation. You may or may not agree with everything Cox presents, but his fresh angles will definitely make you think! I especially appreciated his discussion of life as a project. At first, I was unsure of whether to purchase the book, but now I'm glad I did. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"GenX and God - A GenX Perspective","review":"Cox correctly outlines issues faced by Generation X, and he then brilliantly widens the picture to include God. He is both sociologically and theologically astute, and also very intuitive. Cox is obviously very in-tune with his generation. In fact, I am sure he must have had me in mind when writing the book! It is full of the relevance and hope that Xers like me need to hear, and it has significantly deepened my understanding of God! I liked it so much the first time that I am now reading it again!"},{"Title":"GenX and God - A GenX Perspective","review":"I concur with the previous on-line reviewer that this is not a text on how to proselytize the GenXers (as if &quot;they&quot; are &quot;other&quot;!). But therein lies the value of this little book, for it does not apporach GenXers as &quot;other,&quot; but rather explores Christian theology from a GenX perspective! Cox takes Sin seriously and does not candy-coat the gulf between God and mankind. But equally seriously, Cox proclaims the good news that God is for you! All this Cox does in a conversational manner, not in a persuasive lecture. I guess if a GenXer wanted to know what the Christian message is--and not be preached at or lectured--this is a solid start!"},{"Title":"GenX and God - A GenX Perspective","review":"First off the title is misleading. It should be Gen X &amp; Jesus as Christianity is the only religion that the author cares to discuss. I guess Jewish and Muslim &quot;Gen X-ers&quot; can go get other books. Secondly the whole exercise is cliched. Pretty much everything said about Generation X has been said about any group of people between the ages of 18 and 25 who have only just begun to abandon cynicism. Third, Generation X and it's hip nickname GenX is such a horrible term to begin with and it's not completely Douglas Coupland's fault, but one would like to have someone to blame.Ok, that said this book is a fairly average preacher manual for youth of America in order to answer a few questions posed and to clarify Christianity. Besides the title's hook, it doesn't say anything particularly original about either Christianity or the generation of youth. Worse is that it feels like the author is reaching. He sounds like one of those people who walked through high school with his Bible out, never dating or socializing, but who wanted to be with it anyhow.It's an ok book and a pretty good one to give to a teenage fundamentalist, but it doesn't really live up to its title."},{"Title":"GenX and God - A GenX Perspective","review":"From the title of this book one gets the impression that this book is a Generation X perspective of God. This turns out not to be the case. It has more to do with the theological preferences of its author Kristoffer Cox. Mr. Cox comes from a Protestant background and offers up a spiritual scheme that is non-dogmatic and void of hellfire and damnation gibberish. His focus is primarily on the love of Christ and the establishment of God's kingdom. And this is what the overwhelming bulk of the book is about. There was one sliver of insight in to the lessons that Generation X could learn for the Christian faith. Examples of this are comparisons between Xers and Jesus were both often mocked and not taken seriously by those in control. Or the way Xers have inherited a damaged world and that an imperfect world is foundational to Christian understanding. But the notion of such ideas only gets scant attention as it is preceeded and followed by Mr. Cox's proselytizing. The weakest part of this book is attempts by Mr Cox to put at the heat of Gen X's problems a generational conflict with the parent gengeration of Baby Boomers. At best this attempt sounds much like the contrived notions that someone might adhere to after completing a high school sociology course."},{"Title":"Applied Regression Analysis","review":"Draper and Smith have long had a reputation for an outstanding book on regression analysis written at an elementary to intermediate level. I have long had a copy on my bookshelf and continue to purchase the revisions. They are careful to keep the book current by always incorporating new advances. This edition includes many of the recent advances in regression diagnostics as well as a description of the bootstrap approach to regression problems. Those interested in regression graphics should consult the book by R. Dennis Cook. More on the bootstrap can be found in my book \\"Bootstrap Methods: A Practitioner's Guide\\" or the other fine books by Efron and Tibshirani, Davison and Hinkley, and Lunneborg."},{"Title":"Applied Regression Analysis","review":"I used this book for an undergraduate class in college. It was on the bookshelves of most of my Statistics professors (older editions of course). I found it to be a very intuitive and strait forward introduction in Regression Analysis. It contains all the basics needed to understand the bread and butter of Regression."},{"Title":"Applied Regression Analysis","review":"This book falls into some strange no-mans-land where definitions, proofs, and the underlying statistical theory are skipped, but formulae are stated in a symbolic language complex enough that it is hard to imagine any readers that could understand the book yet not desire more mathematical rigor. The authors do give extensive references to material they don't explain--on the other hand, for $90 most readers probably want the explanations. The authors also present many of their own opinions about the relative merits of certain statistical quantities. While their opinions, based on their years of experience as researchers, may have some merit, all too often they are forced to admit that other researchers, with comparable credentials, have opposing opinions! In that case, why include the opinions _in a textbook_? Debate in scientific journals. Explain in textbooks.The organization at a chapter level is clear enough, but within chapters the exposition is ad-hoc. This is probably a side effect of the authors' commitment to eliminating explanations and proofs--there's no need to organize since they are just enumerating formulae and opinions."},{"Title":"Applied Regression Analysis","review":"This book is severely outdated to the point that it cannot serve any audience. Simply reading this book and noting phrases such as computations which can be carried out on a \\"pocket calculator\\" or these procedures typically require specialized programs to be \\"run on a computer\\" indicate how severely outdated this book is.Those wanting a modern applied book focusing in data analysis (using R or SAS) will be disappointed, and those looking for a baby version of Seber (and Lee) will also be disappointed. A significant disappointment of the book is the lack of focus in setting up ordinary least squares regression, and hence the lack of step-by-step generalization that a fundamental presentation of regression should entail (least squares -> generalized least squares -> iteratively weighted least squares -> robust regression -> generalized linear models).The book also lacks \\"good\\" problems. Most of the problems focus on computations using small matrices and do not focus on proving the easily proven fundamental results. In addition the book takes the habit of stating formulas and not deriving them from the fundamental problem."},{"Title":"Applied Regression Analysis","review":"I used this book as a reference for an advanced statistics for finance class that I took. Applied Regression has a really good balance between the theoretical foundation of least squares and the application. The introduction to the linear algebra of least squares is particularly gentle. The authors introduce all of the linear algebra that you'll need to know. They also provide some background for least squares as a mapping into the column space of X. But the theory never becomes over whelming.As the title suggests, the book is about regression analysis. In addition to multivariate least squares, the book covers advanced linear regression topics like ridge regression.The book could be criticized for being dated in that it does not give examples in R or Matlab. However, the material that is covered is timeless. Regardless of the mathematics software you use, the foundation is the same and this book provides a good in-depth introduction to the regression analysis.A good complement to this book (which I also used in my advanced statistics class) isLinear Models with Rwhich shows how to build most of the models discussed Applied Regression in R."},{"Title":"Applied Regression Analysis","review":"Presents regression and the associated statistics in the framework of linear algebra.

Cheaper, just as beautiful, and the fact that McCreight has been teaching for 25 years really shines through. I would also have more confidence following McCreight's directions than Codina's, though Codina's are thorough and well laid out. The little tips McCreight slips in are great and his suggestions for improvising and making your own tools would save you the cost of the book in short order."},{"Title":"Jewellery and Silversmithing Techniques","review":"I recently purchased this book and two others by the same author: \\"The Art and Craft of Making Jewellery\\" and \\"The Complete Book of Jewelry Making: A Full-Color Introduction to the Jeweler's Art\\".

It is also great look at the mysteries that still puzzle stargazers everywhere."},{"Title":"Winter Warriors (Drenai Tales, Book 8)","review":"Once again, David Gemmell leads us into the harsh yet fantastic world of the Drenai. The book is \\"Winter Warriors,\\" and it showcases Gemmell's steadfast refusal to try to fix something that just isn't broken. If you're familiar with previous Drenai novels, the themes should be familiar - three old soldiers (a master swordsman with a tragic past, a bowman whose eyes are failing him, and a hulking brute with more heart than brains) find themselves embroiled in a quest to save Queen Axiana and her unborn son from the hordes of demons who seek them out. If the unborn king is sacrificed... yep, you guessed it, the world enters an age of unending darkness, and all mankind will suffer.It's true, you could fault Gemmell's cast of characters for being too archetypical, and bearing more than a passing resemblance to previous characters in the Drenai series (compare Nogusta of \\"Winter Warriors\\" to Chareos in \\"Quest For Lost Heroes,\\" or Bison to Beltzer in the aforementioned tome)... but be that as it may, each and every principle character in \\"Winter Warriors\\" is a living, breathing, flesh-and-blood human being, and few fantasy authors can achieve such a claim. Each man and woman behaves in a realistic, believable fashion, and comes out of the adventure dramatically changed by the experience. In an attempt to wow you with magical doo-dads, action set pieces, and enigmatic creatures, most fantasy authors forget to inject humanity into their work - but not David Gemmell. \\"Winter Warriors\\" is a deeply human story, no matter what demons or magical spells come into play. The action works because you genuinely care about the people fighting for their lives... and if you know David Gemmell, you know too that no hero is immortal.I can find few faults in \\"Winter Warriors,\\" to be quite honest. Granted, the premise is not very original, and the plot sometimes gets a little bit convoluted. Yes, \\"Winter Warriors\\" mimics the same themes of previous Drenai books (see \\"Legend\\" and \\"Quest For Lost Heroes,\\" to name but a few), but I'm not sure that qualifies as a fault. It's very moving, inspirational stuff packed with at least as much drama as action. I just don't get tired of desperate men, underdogs by all accounts, standing up for what they believe in against seemingly insurmountable odds in the David Gemmell vein. If more of us lived our lives like Nogusta, Chareos, or Druss the Legend, I think this world would be a better place. Can I truly pay Mr. Gemmell a higher compliment than that?"},{"Title":"Winter Warriors (Drenai Tales, Book 8)","review":"I have read all of the Drenai novels written by David Gemmell and I can assuredly say that this is one of his best books set in this world. While the plot is somewhat similar in style to his QUEST FOR LOST HEROES, the execution shows that he has grown considerably as an author. It is a tightly plotted novel that will take you on an emotional rollercoaster and leave you wanting more. Add to this some of Gemmell's best dialogue in ages and you have a book worthy of space on your bookshelf. You will revel in the exploits of Kebra, Nogusta, Bison, as well as Antikas Karios and Dagorian as they attempt to stop a demon-lord from plunging the world into darkness. I can't recommend this book enough."},{"Title":"Winter Warriors (Drenai Tales, Book 8)","review":"Gemmell has a gift - he writes stunningly good fantasy which is gritty and realistic. There is no airy-farie whiff about his work, and no long, over-complicated backstory either (such as in the Wheel of Time). Gemmell keeps the story going at a blinding pace.The ancient Drenai empire, once besiged from all sides, has been saved by the armies of its warrior king, and now he has marched onward to glory. However, his newly-taken empire is full of strife and tretchery ... and dark sorcery.A Demon King is attempting to return his people to the world, and destroy humanity. To do so, he only has to kill the unborn child of the warrior-king. That child's only defence is three old men, discarded by their lord: Nogusta the Swordsmen, Kebra the Bowman, and the slow but sure Bison. In their hands rests the fate of the world.This is a tale of sheer brilliance. Each of the characters is clearly defined and explored throughout the book, and we care about all of them, even the Demon Lord. It's a great story, and Gemmell is a great writer. Well worth and look for any fantasy reader."},{"Title":"Winter Warriors (Drenai Tales, Book 8)","review":"Well, after a recommendation from someone awhile ago I started reading the Drenai series. I started with Legend and read each book in proper order.I absolutely devoured them, finishing them at a speed that I couldn't believe. Each book was outstanding as a whole. Occasionally in one or two of the novels I felt like I was going down a path that Mr. Gemmell had blazed before, yet there is always something fresh, and I'll tell you what it is; The characters.I have had more lumps in the throat reading these novels than I can ever recall with any other author. Certainly, these books are heavily influenced by combat, but there really is so much more. I can relate to these (fictional) people, and perhaps that is the best compliment one can pay to an author.So after feeling like I had read every major fantasy author of the past 30 or so years I came upon this series, and I am grateful.Winter Warriors is my favorite thus far. Yes, I love Waylander and Druss, and actually a few of the other major chars in the series. But I just finished WW and I was sitting here at my desk practically sobbing at the end.Mr. Gemmell has an interesting view of Father Time and the way he impacts humanity. In my view there is more than a little existentialism in his writings. As an aspiring writer, I cannot remember the last time I was this motivated and inspired by an author.Thank you David Gemmell."},{"Title":"Winter Warriors (Drenai Tales, Book 8)","review":"Ive read alot of David Gemmell and he is consistantly good and very often great and occasionally utterly brilliant. This book is the latter of the three. The characters are all memorable and all deliciously imperfect, the story is never as black and white as it may appear. Simply put I can think of no fantasy author ive enjoyed as much as Gemmell, and of his work this stands alongside &quot;Hero in the Shadows&quot; as a truly astounding and well crafted tale."},{"Title":"Winter Warriors (Drenai Tales, Book 8)","review":"If you have read any of my other reviews, you will notice that I'm a big fan of Gemmels. I love all his books, but none (except this one) have I ever rated 5 star. The characters are fantastic and I even became mournful when ever one of them died. In most novel I'm able to pick out a favourite character right from the begining, but in this story I could not decide who I liked the most.The demons are brilliantly contrasted from one another and I love the way all the odds are stacked against the goodies. You really feel that there is no way out for them, and I can promise that you will never predict the ending.This is a Drenai book, yet it is seperate from the Nadir war story line. So you don't have to read it in link with the others. Simply put: this is one of the best stories you'll ever come across."},{"Title":"Winter Warriors (Drenai Tales, Book 8)","review":"Some authors manage to completely ruin great characters by simply stopping to care about them. I think most readers of this genre love it when we get the great awe-inspiring acts of fresh on the scene heroes. David Gemmel manages to show the readers what happens when those same heroes get old.Gemmel has a talent for creating great scenes. There are other authors out there, who can perhaps describe a fight scene with more detail or zeal, but David Gemmel can deliver a simple scene and make it seem like a pearl hidden in an oyster. The action is not packed into this book, but there is enough for readers like me to keep us turning the pages. I enjoyed the character intereaction in this book. He doesn't try and make you love all the characters, in fact with one of the characters it is quite the opposite.Simply put it is a great book, by an author who writes some great fantasy. It is definately worth picking up if you love the fantasy genre."},{"Title":"Winter Warriors (Drenai Tales, Book 8)","review":"This is the first book I ever purchased from Amazon, so I feel a special responsibility to review it.As other people have said, this does have a similar feel to Quest for Lost Heroes. It's the latest in the chronology, set some 200 years after QFLH, and the Drenai (a vaguely Greco-Roman hybrid) version of Alexander the Great is off conquering the vaguely Persian empire. As the book opens, the older warriors are being sent home, as their enlistments are up. We're introduced to the three main characters, and the book goes from there into the obligatory great magical threat.The writing is very good; Mr. Gemmell only improves as he goes along (aside from the fact that Legend still was his masterpiece), and certain scenes are enormously powerful, such as one of the main character's self-sacrifice.One thing I noticed is that the cosmology of the Drenai keeps changing. We've had the Source and demons, but the depiction of the demons in this novel, as the Windborn, is more than we've ever had. It does explain their love of being summoned, but at the same time, I found it a bit...odd. It doesn't detract from the book at all, but it's worth noting.All in all, a great read, especially since it's paperback."},{"Title":"Winter Warriors (Drenai Tales, Book 8)","review":"I only &quot;discovered&quot; David Gemmell very recently but he's rapidly moving onto my list of favorite authors. In this book, complex characters are drawn with intricate detail, but they are never boring.Herioc, honourable and yet flawed in some way, the heroes in Winter Warriors are eminently likeable. You can't help but empathise with them, their quest and principles. There are so many shades of gray in the book, it is a breath of fresh air in an overcrowded fanstasy genre.Highly Recommended!"},{"Title":"Winter Warriors (Drenai Tales, Book 8)","review":"I have read Druss the Legend and Sword in the Storm. I also have read all of the books by Jordan, Edding, Modesitt, Knaak; This book beats them all hands down. I have erad it seven times in ten days! The characters are more likeable, and more profound by their weaknesses, than their strengths. Each character, no matter how small, adds to the plot. Gemmell did so many things I didn't excpect, it still shocks me. Since reading this book I have set out to buy all his works. If they are half as good as this one, they are all works of art!"},{"Title":"Winter Warriors (Drenai Tales, Book 8)","review":"I had to go to school to support atheletics, trying to stall as much time to get there i bought the book as something to keep me occupied.

I thought the characters where great. Nogusta, Bison, Kebra, and Antikas Karios make great heros. I really didn't care for the ending though. This book was action-packed."},{"Title":"Winter Warriors (Drenai Tales, Book 8)","review":"Winter Warriors was the first David Gemmel book I became entranced in. If there are any readers out there who have already been absorbed by the magic of Narnia, I believe you will find an even more scintillating, awesome adventure here. A good compare to Narnia, David Gemmel vividly maps out a world, a land of good, evil, and as one of his characters puts it, &quot;the shade of grey inbetween&quot;. But unique is this book in that never before, not even in the fantastic tines of Tolkien, have characters been developed, fleshed out, and woven together by destiny's bonds than in Gemmel's reads. Winter Warriors is one of his best. In fact, he causes his readers to become so attached that the emotion conveyed in the text leaves the page and becomes sentient. There were points in this novel where I cried, sections that made me laugh, and parts where I felt dread and horror. Can fantasy really be so powerful? Reader, it is up to you to find out."},{"Title":"Winter Warriors (Drenai Tales, Book 8)","review":"This book is great. This is a fantasy novel that does not involve a quest, is self-contained, and the CHARACTERS are the most important element--not the quest. The only probelem is that the story takes awhile to move forward. However, you don't really notice because the characters are so interesting and fun to read."},{"Title":"Winter Warriors (Drenai Tales, Book 8)","review":"I read this book in 4 hours only getting up to use the bathroom. I recommend this book to all high action fantasy lovers who like to be pushed over the edge as subtle as a hammer blow to the cranium. It is amazing is all. The plot is original as well and will keep you turning those pages."},{"Title":"Winter Warriors (Drenai Tales, Book 8)","review":"Fortunatly, of all of the people who have read my reviews so far on Gemmell Books (the only ones I wrote reviews on), all has found them to be helpful (check my review on Quest For Lost Heroes by a Reader From New York). So I shall have the peace of mind to go and review this recent title in the Drenai series... this book is reminiscent of a certain older title that I have reviewed quite a while ago, in that the story focuses on a small group of middle-aged men who sets out on one last quest to right a wrong, unwillingly or unknowingly at first, and then gradually becomes aware that it almost their destiny to complete the quest. But Gemmell books are never this simple... they are action-packed with very realistic battle scenes and even more realistic human emotions, there is no set right or wrong in Gemmell's books, and there is rarely true chivalry or nobility in the charachters, often times if a hero in Gemmell's books does a seemingly good deed, it is often for his or her own gain, though very rarely there are unselfish charachters. In Gemmell's books, the charm is that Gemmell describes all the main charachters and minor charachters in such detail that the reader feels that they know the charachters very well. The minor-charachters or &quot;sidekicks&quot; are made known so well to the reader that they seemingly are as important as the &quot;main charachters&quot;. Even the villians are described so that we feel perhaps they are the main charachters in the stories. Indeed it is often hard to tell just who is the main charachters in Gemmell's novels, the exceptions being Waylander in the Drenai Saga Series, and the lone warrior with two guns in the Stones of Power series. And not to be overlooked, Royo's excellent cover arts for most of Gemmell's books have undoubtedly added to the appeal of the books, they are pure masterpieces of excellent artwork.Overall, Winter Warriors is another outstanding title by Gemmell, in fact it is the great stuff that we almost happen to expect from Gemmell, that is realistic tale of human emotions, tragedies, and triump. The opening chapter in this book is much like the others...excellent and very detailed that puts the reader into the book. There are just so many twists and turns in Gemmell's books that the reader can rarely predict what happens next to the plot, and that is only of the reader is exceedingly lucky and gifted. I certainly look toward the next books written by Gemmell, not to mention the next cover art by Royo."},{"Title":"Winter Warriors (Drenai Tales, Book 8)","review":"Along with King Beyond the Gate, this book is assuredly one of Gemmels best. The gritty realism of human interaction is the main strengh of Gemmels work and this book is a perfect example of how the author manages to breathe life into his characters. The protagonists are not paragons, although they are skilled warriors (they had to be to live this long) they are have failings, doubts, and even childhood trauma. What is amazing in this novel is how the characters change completely by the events that occur. You will end up even admiring the enemies. The beauty and tragedy of Gemmels work is there is rarely good or evil characters...just people caught up in events they cannot control. However, Gemmel is such a skilled writer he could make a character cleaning a cooking pot interesting! This book is a must read."},{"Title":"Winter Warriors (Drenai Tales, Book 8)","review":"David .gemmell is the master of fantasy.the hero's leap from the pages and he leaves your imagination scoring and wanting more.a must read"},{"Title":"Winter Warriors (Drenai Tales, Book 8)","review":"Well, this was a simplistic tale, quick read while waiting for the Masters to release their next of their series (RR Martin, Anthony Ryan, etc...) I would feel must better if this whole series was price at the 3.99 or worst 4.99 but as is, its overpriced for what it is.For 7.99 you can get the omnibus Theft of Swords (Riyria Revelations) and it has two books of the series (the other two Omnibus books are also 7.99 each). Point being that there are better and cheaper alternatives, this was my first David Gemmell book so I did not know what to fully expect. Check out \\"The Hammer and the Blade\\" by Paul Kemp, great fun, well written and 4.89!"},{"Title":"Winter Warriors (Drenai Tales, Book 8)","review":"Anything David Gemmell wrote wound up being epic gold. This is an example of his greatest as a writer. There's no need to go into plot here just start with the first Drenai book, Waylander, and continue from there. A massive epic ride powerful characters, awesome battles, and a human factor which makes the reader think about the characters and story after putting the book down. You will not be disappointed. The closest movies I could think of to match these would be Braveheart, 13th Warrior, or Gladiator."},{"Title":"Winter Warriors (Drenai Tales, Book 8)","review":"Wonderful reading!!!!Just don't use Amazon shipping....just buy the book from the local bookseller for the same price and begin reading immediately instead of 2 weeks later!"},{"Title":"Winter Warriors (Drenai Tales, Book 8)","review":"Winter Warriors is Book 8 of the Drenai Tales written by David Gemmell. Unlike some of the other books in the series, Book 8 can be read independently of the others. Personally, I think this is the best book of the Drenai Tales because of the strong characters, the epic feel of the book, and the expanded use of magic and demons.The PlotAfter fighting for decades, a band of battle hardened war heroes are being dismissed after winning a long and bloody war. Treaties have been signed and the younger soldiers of the Drenai Army are teaming up with the Ventrian Army. It looks like there will finally be peace in the city of Usa. But an army of demons lurks in the shadows, ready to plunge the world into darkness. The retired heroes must spring into action one last time in order to stop an evil prophecy from coming true.The CharactersWhat sets this book apart from most other fantasy novels is that the characters seem like real people with ambitions, emotions, and flaws. They are men of honor forged on the fields of battle, but all of the characters have their dreams as well as their regrets. These are the underdogs that you can easily cheer for in the face of overwhelming odds.The WorldUnlike Gemmell's other books, this one features quite a bit of magic and demons. It's a great balance of swords and sorcery, rooted in reality.Writing StyleThe action is exciting, the scenes are truly epic, and the characters will earn your cheers. As far as writing style goes, this is Gemmell's best.For Drenai FansIn terms of plot and characters, this book is similar to Book 3, A Quest for Lost Heroes, but it is better in every way.If your fantasy MUST have epic dragon fights and armies of elves, then there may not be enough magic in this world for you.If you like heroic fantasy, you WILL enjoy reading this book. It's got a great story, great action, great characters, demons, magic swords... It's epic, dramatic, fantastic, and most of all it's entertaining.Note: I've read about 200 fantasy novels and I gotta say, as far as stand-alone books are concerned, this might be my all time favorite."},{"Title":"Winter Warriors (Drenai Tales, Book 8)","review":"A book that does not contain any of Gemmell's major heroes, but instead focuses on three aging men, warriors all. Nogusta the Swordsman, Kebra the Bowman, and bison. This hearkens back quite a lot of Quest for Lost Heroes, but the underlying theme is a bit different.The warriors set out to rescue the unborn child of a woman, and end up confronting demons and a man they have taken over, in a heroic last stand."},{"Title":"Winter Warriors (Drenai Tales, Book 8)","review":"Winter Warriors by David Gemmell is a continuation of the Drenai saga. In fact this is book number eight in the series. Like most Gemmell books you do not need to read all the books before reading this book. There are some references that have read the prior books will make more sense, but it is by no means mandatory to read all the others first. I think that is one of the beauties of Gemmell's writing. He ties things in, but not overly much.Fans of previous Gemmell books will see a little bit of a difference between this book and the other Drenai books. He writes about more magic use and more monsters and creatures in this book. Yes, there is the human element in this book, but there is also the added element of spirit travel, demons, summoned creatures etc. It is something that Gemmell rarely utilizes much in his writing, but he pulls it off quite well here.The overall story line of this book is at times classic Gemmell - fighting for what someone believes is the right thing no matter what others think, but also something different from his normal fare - the demon riders want to bring their brethren back to the world in the flesh. As with the majority of Gemmell's books the plot is rather straight forward with not many subplots. Yet, for this book in particular it works very well.. with the pace of the book and the limited number of pages he is allowed, there is simply not much room for subplots to be really developed so basically he just doesn't include them in this novel. I don't believe the novel suffers from lack of subplots, in fact I think it is made stronger because the reader is not forced to read about irrelevant things that merely fill up space.Again, as with most Gemmell books the real strength of the book lies with the fantastic characters that he creates. These are characters that all have flaws; they are by no means ultra-powerful nor perfect in any sense of the imagination. They are who they are. The main characters in this book are not your traditional characters, young, spry and energetic. In fact they are quite the opposite, they are old men who are in the twilight of their lives. Having the heroes in the end of their careers adds an element that very few fantasy books have ever explored. Gemmell pulls this piece of information off wonderfully and it adds a very nice addition to the story. Of all the characters in the book Kebra was my favorite with Bison being a close second. They were all interesting in their own way and never did I not want to read about one of them.Overall, I enjoyed this book very much. It's refreshing to read fantasy books that don't try to be something they are not. Gemmell writes engaging stories that are easy to relate to. This book was no different. I would strongly recommend the Drenai books to any fantasy fan, be it the fantasy fan who has read hundreds of books or the person that is just starting to read fantasy books, everyone will find something they enjoy within Gemmell's pages."},{"Title":"Winter Warriors (Drenai Tales, Book 8)","review":"While George RR Martin is my favorite fantasy author David G. is a close second.I don't care that all the stories are the same with flawed yet noble characters fighting the good fight against impossible odds the books are very well written.This book is interesting because while events from previous books are vaguely mentioned no one is standing around going \\"my father was a solider under Druss the Legend\\" every five pages.Some people I know can't stand \\"Legend\\" the first book and if that's you here might be a good place to start."},{"Title":"Winter Warriors (Drenai Tales, Book 8)","review":"David Gemmell, I think, has played out this scenario a few too many times. I loved it in Legend and The King Beyond the Gate and enjoyed it in Quest for Lost Heroes, but I think this one felt too similar to the others when it came to the character development. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed reading about the new characters and their history, but it seems like they have been reproduced too many times now. The story was good and the writing was the same type of Gemmell writing that I have come to love, but it lacked something new that all of his others included.Nogusta is an aging Blademaster who just wants to go back to his Drenai home and start up his family again. Bison is prone to drinking and making a mess of things, but his heart is always in the right place. Kebra's eyesight is failing, but he is still one of the best in all the land. They are finally released from their military duties, but their path leads them away from home when they have to protect a newborn babe and his mother.Even with the same classic Gemmell characters, this book still has enough magic and action to make it fun, but it is not one of Gemmell's best. I look forward to the next in the series, White Wolf. Enjoy this one!"},{"Title":"Winter Warriors (Drenai Tales, Book 8)","review":"Winter Warriors is listed as a part of the Drenai Saga, and although it does take place in those lands, specifically Ventria, to me it feels very much as if could be a standalone novel that is only peripherally connected to the earlier books. The plot of Winter Warriors is set well after any of the previous books, with only a passing mention of Druss the Legend to tie it to earlier books in the series. So, even if you haven't read the other books in the Drenai Saga, don't let that stop you from diving into this excellent novel.As is usual for David Gemmell's novels, there are two characteristics that make this book stand out: nonstop action and excellent, well-crafted characters. Gemmell is one of the best when it comes to writing tightly-plotted, action-driven fantasy and this tale qualifies as one of his best. He keeps the story moving at a quick pace, sending his heroes from one seemingly impossible situation right into the next.At its core, this book is the tale of three aging heroes, whose time has seemingly passed. However, as fate would have it, they find themselves in the position of saving a kingdom, and possibly the world, from a demonic threat. It's these three heroes, Nogusta: the master swordsman with a tragic past, Kebra: the archer with unsurpassed skill, and Bison: the giant-sized fighter with a heart of gold, that gives this tale its soul. While these characters may seem similar to others in the series, Gemmell is always able to make them real and unique in their own way. He has the rare ability to make you as a reader really care about what happens to each and every one of them. Don't become too attached, however, as Gemmell is also known for being willing to kill off any character at any time.One thing that distinguishes this book from others in the series is the fact that the main antagonist is of supernatural origin, the Windborn, or demons from another realm. In the prior Drenai Saga tales, magic has played a secondary role. Here it takes a much more prominent role. Gemmell handles this very well, although it gives the book a slightly different flavor, especially when compared to a book like Legend.Overall, this is another top notch read from one of the masters of fantasy adventure. If you've read the other books in the Drenai Saga, don't pass this one up. If you're looking for a place to sample Gemmell's writing, this is a good place to jump in. If you're a fan of fantasy, David Gemmell is a can't miss."},{"Title":"Winter Warriors (Drenai Tales, Book 8)","review":"This is my last Gemmell book for a while, that's nine straight! Not that I'm tired of reading his books (ok, maybe just a bit), but this is the last novel of the Drenai series and it's time for me to move on to other authors. What do I have to say about this one?For starters, the story's really good except for the rushed anti-climactic ending (though Bison's final sacrifice was fantastic). The characterization is good until you realize that the heroes are almost rote from previous books in the series. Signature Gemmell action scenes, perhaps more than average for him. A bit of unconvincing sorcery but within reasonable limits.Overall, I don't have much more to say because it's all been said before in my previous reviews, that's how similar this book is to them. It's a four star book standalone, but only three if the rating premise includes breaking new ground from previous novels. Yes I read it and enjoyed it. Would I do it again in hindsight? Probably not, this one offers nothing really new.It's instructive to compare Gemmell's writing style to what I'm reading now, Tad Williams' \\"The Dragonbone Chair\\". Williams has more interesting and flowery prose, but moves slower and sometimes seems as if he's trying too hard to impress the reader. Gemmell is more direct and to the point, which works great but eventually ends up sounding monotonous after nine books."},{"Title":"Winter Warriors (Drenai Tales, Book 8)","review":"Once more David Gemmell catches my imagination... but Winter Warriors is a cut above other Drenai Sagas. I liked Legend a lot... but this book goes a step further ! Gemmell is a master and this book brings his world back to life... with new myths and new legends in the making.I can't recommend this book enough. Hard to stop reading."},{"Title":"Winter Warriors (Drenai Tales, Book 8)","review":"&quot;Winter Warriors&quot; is another breathtaking book by David Gemmell. It is set in Drenai and focuses on Nogusta the black swordmaster. The swordmaster and his friends Kebra and bison have been discarded along with Banelion the white wolf and the veterans of Skanda's army. Then Anharat the demon lord takes over and the three old warriors must defend the queen's unborn son to save the world otherwise the windborn would come back with a vengeance.I highly recommend this book to everyone. Readers who enjoy Science fiction and fantasy books will especially like this book. It's masterfully written and the plot fantastic."},{"Title":"Winter Warriors (Drenai Tales, Book 8)","review":"Arguably the best of a series of books written by Gemmell in his mature phase of his career commencing in 1996 with the Legend of DeathWalker and including Dark Moon and Echoes the Great Song. Thoughtful and deeper than most of Gemmell's best work, he captures the sense of heroes growing old; their once excellent talents slowing and fading. Who thinks normally about older characters in fantasy? We have old wizards and the like, but warriors? What happens to them when they are ready for the scrap heap? Gemmell mixes the psychology of this with his most familiar and famous realm: Drenai to paint the picture of a threat matched against the doubts and needs of unwanted heroes. The plot would have been mediocre with normal young characters, but here the dimension of age makes a Jewel in Gemmell's career. Read this and Dark Moon together for top British fantasy."},{"Title":"Winter Warriors (Drenai Tales, Book 8)","review":"This is a brilliant Novel with a brilliant plot and twist toi the tale. It at first seems pretty simple with demons needing to sacrifce a baby to bring about the end of mankind and only three old men can protect the child but as you read the plot gets deeper and twists and turns at breakneck speed. The action and sword fights it has to be said were not as well detailed as in some of his other books but still good enough for enjoyment purpses.The charachters are all human and you do find yourself caring for the main Hero's of Nougasta,Kebra and Bison (although I just could not like Antikas Karios.Overall this is a brilliant fantasy novel and should be read by all fans of the fantasy genre."},{"Title":"Before the Beginning","review":"A cautionary tale of a family of patriots fighting for their freedom and very survival as the American nation is betrayed by it's own government.

I enjoyed the quick pace of the book and the just-the-facts writing style. The story never dallied in any one place so the story moved quite quickly, which I really liked. The way in which it was written provided a fresh look at a very old, ubiquitous story without being trite.I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Jesus: God and Man\\". I didn't want to put it down once I started reading it. I didn't expect to be so taken with it to be quite honest, but I most certainly was.I absolutely recommend this book! It is enlightening and gut wrenching, soulful and thought provoking."},{"Title":"Jesus: God and Man","review":"A beautiful story, beautifully written.Jesus, God & Man by Larry Mullins poetically summarizes the inspirational truths from the Urantia Book. It covers, delightfully and succinctly, the origin and spiritual history of our planet, our place in the cosmos, the explanation of Jesus' loving choice to bestow himself on our planet, and an awe-inspiring retelling of his life on earth.Those who know the story of Jesus will delight in the beauty and essence of Larry's style. You may also find a few happy surprises about Jesus' life which bring this being, both God and Man, to life in new and engaging ways.You can read the book in a couple of hours...and the effect may be lifelong!Although the story is not always lighthearted, it captures a light of spiritual truth which left me inspired and uplifted. I am drawn to reread all or parts of the book again and again because it is just so beautiful and authentic. Although it is only words on paper, I experience the content as if it were being delivered by an arresting voice from the source of all love and wisdom."},{"Title":"Exploring New Religions (Issues in Contemporary Religion)","review":"Many of the prominent 'cults' or new religious movements are discussed here. Chapters cover offshoot developments from the major religions and include well known groups such as the Mormons, Jehovas Witnesses and Hare Krishna. One chapter covers the 'death cults', and the last looks at the anti-cult movement.I very much enjoyed reading this book, and think others with similar interests will like it as well. It gives us an in depth look at the cults and is one of the few works to examine the issue in a detached, methodical way. Most books are written either to attack or defend particular groups in question. Chryssides desires only to learn about them. This is close to a five star book.Well, almost. The author suffers from a typical academic inability to make judgements, even in the easiest cases. No group can be condemned. Of course we understand that one must be open minded to the claims and arguments of these cults, and not believe everything said about them, but matters are taken to an absurd extreme here. Time and again crimes are excused and immoral practices played down. The worst examples are found in the section on the death cult Jonestown. Chryssides goes as far as to suggest that the sect was driven to mass suicide by a hostile and racist world. What nonsense! I suppose if he was writing about the Japanese cult responsible for the underground gas attack in 1995, he would say they were only seeking to reduce subway crowding. True enough, we shouldn't be too quick to attack new religions in our midst. But they shouldn't all be let off the hook either."},{"Title":"Exploring New Religions (Issues in Contemporary Religion)","review":"It would be easy for anyone embarking on a exploration into new religious movements to be swayed by the sensationalist media reporting that many of these groups have been subjected to. This book, however, deals with a host of faiths and belief systems in a subjective and unbiased way, however bizarre they appear to be. Even Jim Jones gets a fair hearing!A great source of information for anyone interested in NRM's which wets the appetite for further study."},{"Title":"Old-time games (Good old days)","review":"I expected this to be a large book like the other Good Old Days books that I bought.

The Massacre of Glencoe by John Buchan is a refreshingly simple, easy to read but very informative narration of that fateful day in the Glen and the events that led up to it and those that followed. I have read many books on the Macdonalds and specifically of the massacre in Glencoe. The Granddaddy being \\"Glencoe\\" by John Prebble. Prebble's book is full of background and swimming in facts that should satiate any avid scottish historian or those with an interest in Glencoe. But John Buchan's book was a wonderful read in its telling. It was easy to read and read like a story, although sadly it happened. The characters were real and alive. I appreciated his words and although I knew how it would end I was sucked in with every page and could not put it down. This book is a wonderful history of the trials of the MacIans of Glencoe. I highly recommend this book for the novice or the seasoned veteran of Scottish history."},{"Title":"Nature Follow-the-Dots Coloring Book (Dover Little Activity Books)","review":"This small book contains about 50 different animal connect the dots projects.

His stories take us from the Spanish battlefields of the Penninsula campaign, through Russia (and the retreat), the Battle of Waterloo, and a fanciful failed rescue of L'Emporer from St.Helena.THese are stories of dashing doo and have all the Doyle hallmarks of Honor and Gentle-Manliness. One has to keep in mind that these stories were written eighty to one hundred years after the actual battles. Many of the people he wrote about, had been known to people of his parents age. So that Doyle had great insight into how these people thought and acted.The reading (I listed to the tape read by Bolen) of the stories prevents me from commenting on the character of Etienne Gerard. Some of the comments are very drole and may be Doyles way of making the Colonel less conceited that he comes off on tape. As it is, he has little of Flashy's insight into luck and cowardice and is totally consumed by his own abilities (very french indeed). The Flashman suceeds often in spite of himself (and is the first to admit it), Gerard always suceeds because he is the best swordsman, the best horseman, the greatest......(fill in the blank).The stories are worth reading for their marvelous description of the life of the cavalry in the early nineteenth century, and the romanticism of that time at the fin de siecle."},{"Title":"Recommendation 666: The Rise of the Beast From the Sea","review":"Recommendation 666 is a succinct, concise and easy-to-read treatise on the subject of Bible prophecy and recent events in the E.U. While containing details on what may possibly be the most earth shattering news of the last two millenia, the book maintains an even tone and balanced perspective throughout. At no time does the author claim, or even presume, to have discovered the answer to the 666 riddle of Rev. 13:18. However, he gives a very detailed and well researched account of what may be the most credible, sensible and logical explanation yet. Herb's website, Fulfilledprophecy.com, serves to keep the reader up-to-date on what may turn out to be the saga to end all sagas, quite literally.Deserves at least twenty stars."},{"Title":"Recommendation 666: The Rise of the Beast From the Sea","review":"Herb Peters unleashes his knowledge of Javier Solana to the world through is new book Recommendation 666: The Rise of the Beast from the Sea.There are so many end time prophecy books out there, I dont know where to begin. Recommendation 666 presents the actual events that are going on overseas and in our homeland, and compares them to scripture.Before Herb begins to describe these events, he shows the reader how to interpret the events of prophecy and the bible. And these skills and keypoints are worth the entire book alone.When Herb starts showing the scriptures along with the recent events overseas--the reader will be amazed. For the reader has realized where and how prophecy is being fulfilled.If you like this book, or to learn more about Javier Solana, be sure to visit Herb Peters website, www.FulfilledProphecy.com."},{"Title":"Recommendation 666: The Rise of the Beast From the Sea","review":"I accidentally stumbled across Herbs website a few months ago, and was struck by his insight. I bought his book practically the first day it came out, and I was not disappointed. There is no hocus pocus going on here, just the facts - ma'am.

His incredible insight has seemingly pin-pointed the best possibility or scenario of the identity of the infamous 666 I have ever seen. Herb's book is by far the most plausible and factual argument that I believe exists on this issue. As far as I'm concerned, I feel the Lord is using him to make this announcement to this world, as John writes: \\"let him that hath understanding calculate the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man\\". Herb demonstrates an uncanny understanding, prophetically speaking, of this soon to be \\"last great empire\\" more than anyone I've seen, bar none. This is an absolute must read for the serious student of prophecy. I highly recommend this book, its an incredible eye-opener."},{"Title":"Recommendation 666: The Rise of the Beast From the Sea","review":"Herb you have done a wonderful job at explaining the prophecies.I am so glad someone finally wrote a book on this, great points of interest.I have been watching the EU and Herb explains it the way I have read it,His web site explains it daily.Great information."},{"Title":"Recommendation 666: The Rise of the Beast From the Sea","review":"A book need not be packed with scripture to be termed scriptural in nature. Indeed, many pastors can talk for an hour on one verse. This book focuses on how certain prophecies from the Bible could very well be coming to pass with little fanfare or attention from the modern world--secular and religious.Despite the previous review, this book never says it is guessing the identity of the AC. It merely documents how events and circumstances around one office in the EU (and the current man who holds it) are extremely close to prophetic expectations for the end times.As someone else listed below, the author's website contains frequent updates of the months of news since publication. The information is compelling and it cannot be dismissed or ignored."},{"Title":"Recommendation 666: The Rise of the Beast From the Sea","review":"There are a number of things I think are worth noting about this book:1) The author presents his material in an intelligent, non-sensational fashion.2) He consistently states that you should not take his word for anything, nor should you build your faith around what he says in his book. You should judge for yourself.3) I did not get the impression that the author is dead set on naming Javier Solana as the Anti-Christ. What I DID come away with was that the author believes it is very possible that the position Solana now holds in the EU could very well be the position from which the Anti-Christ eventually rises, whether it's Solana or someone else.While Mr. Peters' book is not perfect, it is worth reading - with your Bible open - as it details many of the things that have occurred and are occurring in today's world. From a Christian perspective, I often wondered how someone like the Anti-Christ could come onto the world's playing field unnoticed. I assumed the signs would be so obvious that it would be difficult NOT to notice. This book delves into the origins and growth of the European Union and its impact it has had and continues to have on the world's stage. It seems that the EU has been quietly working in the background for decades and while the organization itself has built up what appears to be a tremendous position of power within the world's community, it has largely gone unnoticed by most of the world.Is Javier Solana the Anti-Christ? Only God knows. Is this book worth reading? Absolutely, for no other reason that to be brought up to date on the EU and the true power it possesses as well as learning what its political aims might be, based on the articles that the organization has written, approved and put into effect.It boggles my mind that an organization like the EU can become what it has become, right under our collective noses - a perfect venue for the eventual rise of the individual that will one day make a pact with Israel, only to break it 3 and a half years later, and turn then to fight against God and all who side with Him.Christians need to know what's going on in the world. Things are moving at breakneck speed and too many Christians are asleep, or have long given up trying to figure out anything about the End Times because they have been too long confused by it. Me? I like to know what the human powers are attempting to accomplish in this world. Whether the Anti-Christ comes on the scene in my lifetime, or my children's lifetime, the EU has quickly become a powerhouse that can no longer be ignored. There are far too many coincidences occurring now in the EU for that organization to NOT be part of the prophetic package of the End Times.The only reservations I have about Herb Peters is the way in which he seems to focus primarily (and possibly ONLY) on the End Times, preferring to not even deal with other controversial issues within Christendom today. This is in evidence at his posting forum, where his moderators are allowed to run the place however they like and as it turns out, if you tend not to agree with THEIR particular theological bent, then say \\"good-bye.\\"While Herb's book is a good one, there is much more to being a Christian than focusing solely on the End Times debate."},{"Title":"Recommendation 666: The Rise of the Beast From the Sea","review":"First of all, if you're not a Christian, you can respect this book for the verified research presented.If you are a Christian, I think this book not only illuminates the nearness of Christ's return, but in doing so, brings your own spiritual life under the blade of the Holy Spirit and if there are things that need to be delt with, after reading this book it will be hard to let them go.A must read for anyone serious about end times prophecy (which is NOW times prophecy) Jesus is coming soon. Yes they have been saying that for a long time, but when you read this book, you'll see that we are VERY VERY close to the actual event happening."},{"Title":"Recommendation 666: The Rise of the Beast From the Sea","review":"I sincerely applaud Herb's effort. This is an interesting book with an interesting theory, but I have to give it one star because it's based on very weak evidence and an aboundance of speculation. I suggest that anyone interested in the end times read the Bible. God doesn't write mysteries, and everything you need is in there. For example, the \\"ten nation alliance\\" read Ezekiel 27-32. What are the nations? They are clearly not European. Herb's EU theory holds little weight. The problem is that he started out with the theory that the EU is the end-times beast empire and then tried to find evidence to fit the theory, which is why it just doesn't work. What he should have done is read his Bible first to find out what God had to say about the end-times empire and then see where that evidence took him.If we truly are in the end-times, then what nations/political system fits the description of the end-times alliance? What major religion denies that Jesus is God's son and our savior? What people will go to any length, including suicide, to take peace from the earth and persecute and kill God's people? I recommend you read God's War on Terror by Walid Shoebat instead. It'll get you headed in the right direction, but you still need to read your Bible."},{"Title":"Recommendation 666: The Rise of the Beast From the Sea","review":"This book was very interesting, it described some history of the European Union and how it appears to be playing a role in prophecies (Daniel and Revelations). I do not claim to know a lot about Revelations symbolism and meanings but the book will make you set back and say \\"hmmm\\". Revelations can be interpreted so many different ways and so many people could qualify for the part of the AC. But, you have to admitt, once you know who Herb is talking about (and Google him), this guy has his hands in a lot of stuff and has a great deal of power. Is Herb correct in his analysis? Well, he could be and then again he could be wrong (as many people in the past have been). In the book he doesn't say one way or the other, he provides the facts and lets you decide. He just points to prophecies and relates the prophecies to things that have happened in the EU. My only issue with the book is that so much has happend since it was printed, a lot of which Herb thought/suggested would happen. However, his family maintaines a website that is updated frequently. I highly recommend reading this book to become fimilar with the EU and its role in prophecies."},{"Title":"Recommendation 666: The Rise of the Beast From the Sea","review":"Herb has made this book very easy to follow, and it makes for a very interesting read.Although I may not agree 100% with everything he says, I haven't found anyone yet that I do agree with 100% of the time.I would recommend the book if this sort of thing interests you.There are a few 'Herb Peter bashers' that I've found on a well known 'Christian Forum' who are likely the ones that left the negative comments about his book here."},{"Title":"Recommendation 666: The Rise of the Beast From the Sea","review":"I definitely would not recommend this book. The author is completely wrapped up in his conspiracy theory about his choice for the AC. He refuses to look at the whole picture because afterall, he wrote a book that he wants to come true.As another person said previously, stick with the Bible. Don't allow yourself to get caught up in this conspiracy theory because his version of the AC and the AC Kingdom is not Biblical no matter how hard he tries to twist scripture."},{"Title":"Recommendation 666: The Rise of the Beast From the Sea","review":"Another poorly written \\"guess the antichrist\\" book. Herb has weak theology and even weaker doctrine. Better stick with your bible and read the future events for yourself rather than read fictional tales made up to sell books. antichrist will be a figure that would deceive Christians - even the VERY elect (if that were at all possible) not someone most Christians would be able to point out as antichrist before the rapture.If you must read, purchase on the secondhand market or check it out in your library's fiction section.Don't be deceived! Jesus said antichrist would be deceptive - and most would not accept him for who he is until he is revealed after the rapture.Joins a growing list of \\"guess the antichrist books\\" who have identified Juan Carlos (of Spain), Prince Charles, Prince William, Henry Kissinger, several Russian leaders, etc. as the antichrist - all with \\"proof possitive\\" - they all can't be right (and likely none of them are)Don't waste your money - buy a good study bible instead - and if you are a Christian, LOOK UP FOR OUR REDEMTION IS NEAR!"},{"Title":"Recommendation 666: The Rise of the Beast From the Sea","review":"Herbs book recommendation 666 focuses on a ten nation alliance that will rise to power from the former Roman Empire, however what I think he misses the point on is that ten nation group does not have to come from modern day Europe to be called the fourth beast, in my opinion it will arise from the mediterranean and will be made of Arab countries with the harlot being the city of Jerusalem. Remember Jerusalem was under the control of the romans during jesus day and the Roman Empire went all the way up to Morocco. The bible only says the ten will be out of this empire. The Roman Empire encompassed Iraq and Jordan at one point in history.2 Thessalonians 2:3--Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;4--Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God (IN JERUSALEM), shewing himself that he is God.Daniel 8 seems to eliminate Herbs belief that the Anti-Christ will be from the E.UDaniel 8:9--And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land.10--And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.11--Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of the sanctuary was cast down.12--And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.The region being spoken of in Daniel is where Alexanders empire was. Which leaves us with a few possibilities for the beast to come from, Iraq or Jordan. I'll place my bet whith Jordan.I think Herb is jumping to conclusions too quickly, it is in my opinion easily conceivable for a free trade area to arise in the middle east consisting of ten nations. Look for large changes to take place quickly after arafat loses power and Syria is dealt with. However only time will proove either scenario, I think its good that someone is at least getting people to focus on the region."},{"Title":"Hong Kong Action Theatre!, 2E.","review":"This is a solid system for a Kung Fu movie action game. This is made by Guardians of Order, so it uses the Tri-Stat System (if you've played BESM, this will be very familiar). The basic system is based on three stats: body, mind, and soul. You use these base stats to calculate your health, energy, starting star power, and attack and defense values. You then buy attributes and defects that customize your character. HKAT! 2 offers a wide variety of attributes and defects that allow you to build any kind of character. And if the attribute or defect you need doesn't exist, you can make a new one! (The GM, of course has say on what is allowed.) HKAT! 2 has the unique concept that the PCs (Player Characters) are actors playing roles in movies. When you make your character you make an actor, and can only buy an attributes and defects that are open or actor only. Then you use star power to bid on the role you want to play. Now you buy role attributes and defects to add to your character to simulate the special effects crews and such (the role attributes and defects go away at the end of a movie), and you can use leftover star power to improve the role too. What's cool about the role/actor concept is that your group can play a wide variety of games, say a horror action thriller one time, then a waxia (as in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) next. Also using star power, one person can have the lead role one movie, and some else can outbid him for the lead next time, so everyone gets a chance to be at the center of a game. At the end of a movie, the GM hands out star power rewards you use on the next movie. What you get is based on what you bid as well as how well everyone did and bonuses the GM may hand out. This encourages everyone to work as a group, as if the group \\"wins\\" the movie, everyone will get more star power. Another good point is that if you die, it's not necessarily bad, because it's only your role that dies, not your actor, and if you die heroically, this can be worth bonus star power!Make no mistake, this is a Role-playing game, with emphasis on role-playing rather than dice roles and statistics and rules. While creation is a little involved, it's fairly straightforward one you get use to it. For resolving actions the Tri-Stat system offers one of the simplest systems I've seen.Combat is also petty simple, I won't go into the details here, if you've played other tri-stat games, you'll be on familiar turf. HKAT! 2 does, however offer some optional combat rules that are worth mention. When you attack, you can choose whether to deliver a high, low, or medium kick or punch and you can target an opponent high, low or torso. The type of blow you deliver gives a bonus or penalty to your damage and initiative, for example, a light punch will let you attack sooner, but won't do as much damage as a hard kick. The attack location affects your opponent's defense, if you attack low, but you opponent defends high, your opponent will have a harder time defending.The system, in summary is simple, yet flexible enough to handle any thing from swordplay and magic attacks in ancient China to a fierce shootout in modern Hong Kong.And finally, I'll cover the quality of the book. As is typical of Guardians of Order, this is a well-done book. It's a good read with cool art and it is very clear. There is also a lot of extra martial here besides just the game. There is a section on Hong Kong, one on the history of Hong Kong film, one with summaries on a lot of Hong Kong films, and finally some sample adventures to get you started. The extra info is really great, especially for some like me who only has little knowledge on Hong Kong film; this book is a treasure trove of info for creating you own Hong Kong action film game. The only flaw I saw in this book is that the last line in some of the sidebars at the beginning of the book was truncated, and while this is annoying, no impotent information was lost (it was mostly flavor text) and this flaw doesn't greatly detract from enjoyment. Given how error riddled other role-playing games (just look at the errata on 3rd edition D&D;) are, I couldn't justify taking off a point for this. I highly recommend this book if you want a simple and flexible system for an action Hong Kong style game."},{"Title":"Hong Kong Action Theatre!, 2E.","review":"Hong Kong Action Theatre! 2nd Edition is a game based on Chinese action films such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and The Killer. It attempts to accurately portray the style of these films and tries to cover all the genres: kung fu, wire fu, gunplay, and so on.Players portray actors in Hong Kong cinema. Characters are created using Guardians of Order's simple Tri-Stat system, rounding out the character with skills like gun combat and kung fu and special attributes to set the actor apart like Director's Friend or Cantopop Star.The actor is the character that players will be portraying every single game. Their abilities and attributes will remain stable. However, the character's Role changes from one session to the next.Each session is a movie, and the Role is the actor's part in the movie. A Role can be anything from Triad Assassin to Hard-Boiled Cop to Drunken Fisherman. Each Role has unique abilities that stack on top of your actor's for that specific session.Another interesting quirk of the game is Stunts. During combat, players are encouraged to have their characters do the wild and death-defying stunts of Hong Kong cinema. The wilder and more dangerous the stunt, the better the reward. Characters are rewarded by the gamemaster with Star Power points which represent the Actor's pull in the cinema world and his or her popularity with the audience. These can be cashed in for rerolls and other goodies such as script rewrites (e.g. the villain happens to be standing next to barrels of flammable liquid).The game also contains a lot of \\"real-world\\" information on Hong Kong and the history of Hong Kong cinema that some might find interesting and others might find to be a waste of space in a roleplaying game book.The game is great. With an energetic group with a feel for the Hong Kong action genre, you can make movies to rival Hong Kong blockbusters. In some respects, I feel that HKAT lumps too many of the genres together with no demarcation between gun fu, kung fu, and wire fu films, and so they all get smushed together. In general, it's fun, original, creative game and a worthy second edition to the original by Gareth Michael-Skarka.Gameplay is episodic, with each game session being a \\"movie\\" independent of other game sessions. The movies can cover any of the traditional Hong Kong action film genres."},{"Title":"Using Lotus Approach 96, Special Edition: Version 96 for Windows 95","review":"&quot;Using Lotus Approach 96&quot; (Special Edition) by Cynthia Morgan and Susan Sloan provides the reader with a thorough understanding of Lotus Approach. It is not limited in terms of application to the Approach 96 version. It certainly applies equally well to Approach 97 and probably to the latest version included in the Millenium edition of Lotus SmartSuite. The book is long, more than 600 pages, but many pages are devoted to actual hands on skill building exercises that are extraordinarily helpful. Anyone who expects to use the database application more than casually would, I believe, find this book answers most of his or her questions and probably will keep going back to it as a reference resource."},{"Title":"Using Lotus Approach 96, Special Edition: Version 96 for Windows 95","review":"Having purchased this book in 1997 in an attempt to learn &quot;something&quot; about Lotus Approach, I discovered that not only was this a suitable guide for the novice, it was also a reference manual of some mighty weight.

Thank you!"},{"Title":"Gross Margin: 26 Factors Affecting Your Bottom Line","review":"What makes this book special is that it isn't about how to make more money than your neighbor--though you could put it to that use. The book helps you think about what you do best, and how to match your gross margins to match how the customer wants to compensate you. He takes the place of the person selling to a neighbor, revisiting a store only to find a price on a certain item raised by obsene amounts, and other pricing issues most people face. He tackles these tough subjects with aplomb. He even works in some of his experience with prostrate surgery.

The discussion of the poets together as well as the discussion of their individual poems proved sharp. But, the author has spent much effort, too much to my liking, trying to situate the discussion of all of Pessoa and Crane as well as the methods of comparison and analysis among the diverse ridges and plurality of valleys of literary and cultural criticism.The book is useful to be sure, but there is so much to be ignored as an excrescent carapace willing itself rather unnecessisarily to the bodies of poets who not only lived without it, but also employed far more piercing modes of definition and discussion in their own works.It is possible that other readers also will find these chapters try hard to justify themselves. No justification was necessary. These poets share a remarkable amount with respect to their attitudes, efforts, and poetic forms. The author is perceptive and had the opportunity to write a stunning appreciation of an Atlantic bound by the poems of Pessoa and Crane. The author chose instead to define a literary category (Anglo-American Modernism) and write just as much for a diverse camp of literary theorists as for Pessoa and Crane loyalists. I feel an opportunity has been missed, other readers may not share this sentiment considering some of the book's bright analyses."},{"Title":"These Honored Dead: How The Story Of Gettysburg Shaped American Memory","review":"Thomas A. Desjardin's _These Honored Dead_ is a decent introduction to some of the popular myths that have spawned and lingered from Gettysburg since the battle occurred. The popularized version of Gettysburg from Michael Shaara's _The Killer Angels_ (1974), Ted Turner's _Gettysburg_ (1993), and Ken Burn's _The Civil War_ (1990) have ensured that millions of visitors come to the battlefield each year, but Desjardin argues that the majority of these visitors are seeking a distorted, incomplete, and exaggerated story. With a PhD in history and years of experience providing tours at Gettysburg, he has the credentials to address these myths.Desjardin is not afraid to slaughter any sacred cows. He does not just question the importance of Little Round Top (it was not), whether Chamberlain actually ordered the famous bayonet charge (he did not), or whether the Confederates aimed for the \\"copse of trees\\" during their final assault (they aimed for Cemetery Hill), but Desjardin questions the overall importance of the battle in the scope of the war. Civil War buffs may find these topics to be outdated trivia, but the author provides insight into how modern-day historians and entertainers simply built on the myths that the contemporary historians and even participants initiated. Desjardin sees it as human nature to want to be part of an important experience and as a result, participants tended to inflate or perpetuate myths so as not to be left out of the post-battle glory.The book provides a decent chapter on the Meade-Sickles controversy that helped shape many of the early beliefs of the war that still exist today. Those familiar with the details of the battle will no doubt be familiar with the story of how Union corps commander Daniel Sickles (1819-1914) perpetuated his own version of the battle that tarnished the reputation of Union army commander George Meade (1815-1872). More interesting is the chapter on John Badger Bachelder (1825-1894), the painter-turned-historian who became \\"without question the single most important Gettysburg historian of all time\\" (106). Desjardin provides a detailed chronicle on how Bachelder created the concept of the High Water Mark and the copse of trees. In the process, he methodically retraced the battlefield with veterans, wrote down their stories, and marked the positions of their brigades and regiments. In addition, he managed the approval and placement of monuments in the early years after the war. Those unfamiliar with Bachelder will find an intriguing story of just how much this historian influenced the historical understanding of Gettysburg.The book offers analysis of how some of the monuments came into existence including those around the High Water Mark and on Little Round Top. While interesting, the book only skims the surface on these topics. This is forgivable when one realizes that there are \\"more than thirteen hundred monuments, memorials, and markers\\" scattered across the battlefield (153). Those who find this sort of history fascinating will get their appetite whetted, as Desjardin explains origins that are almost comical. For example, how 72nd Pennsylvania actually paid for the General Armistead memorial (170).There are some issues with the book. The most annoying is the tendency to repeat points. The author seems to do it in threes. For example, he reiterates thrice that Ted Turner told 40 million Americans via TV that 50,000 died at Gettysburg (58, 180, 202-203) or that the notion that the battle started over the Confederate Army's need for shoes is a myth (57-59, 121, 189-191). Given the brevity of the book (roughly 200 pages of text), the redundancy can be annoying.Still, that should not detract those interested in knowing more about how the popular story of Gettysburg came to fruition. If you are familiar with _The Killer Angels_ or the film _Gettysburg_, but are not familiar with how they present an incomplete and in other instances exaggerated story, then you will find this book interesting. For the experienced Civil War buff, this book is still a good introduction on the origins of some of the monuments and memorials. Regardless, this book will ensure that you will never look at the Battle of Gettysburg in the same way."},{"Title":"These Honored Dead: How The Story Of Gettysburg Shaped American Memory","review":"Any student of the Civil War who seeks the basic knowledge and the events behind the events would find, in my opinion, this to be a phenomenal read. It has placed a new hue over the event in my eyes and now many aspects of the behaviors of the officers both during and after the event make sense to me. The key point is that the participants were men--simply men. Their motivations were driven by many emotions and aspirations. Some of these were altruistic. Some of these were selfish and self-serving. The author provides the back story and makes the case that you should not believe everything you see or read.I will be visiting the battlefield again, as I have done a number of times over the years. Except, this time I will have more questions about what actually happened. This battle is so important to some of us because it was the turning point not just in the war, but in the nation that resulted. It is more than just a battle. For the men who fought there, the events over 3 days affected their perspectives and even their lives for the rest of their lives. How many of us can identify the events of 3 days in our existences that affected how we behave for the rest of our lives?Extraordinary."},{"Title":"These Honored Dead: How The Story Of Gettysburg Shaped American Memory","review":"Although Desjardins' book contains a number of interesting revelations, his arguments are often compromised by sloppy research. For example, his key claim that &quot;Little Round Top&quot; was not known by that name until &quot;years&quot; after the battle was proven false nearly a decade ago. Desjardin is especially weak when he tries to play photo-detective. He mentions with praise the research of photo historian William Frassanito, but doesn't seem to have actually read Frassanito's books very carefully. Desjardin's arguments also suffer from the obvious omission of pertinent, but contrary information"},{"Title":"These Honored Dead: How The Story Of Gettysburg Shaped American Memory","review":"The author raises some very good questions and points. His focus does drift away from Gburg from time to time and covers more of the myths of the overall war.The book is actually somewhat heart breaking for us students of the ACW because you walk away realizing that many of the accounts of the war you may have read are not necessarily entirely factual. Again, the point of the book is to explore the myths and in doing so the author asks many questions. Unfortunately there are not many answers, although many of the key points are put to rest (i.e. Gburg for shoes, \\"Historicus\\", etc.)There was something missing from the book that doesn't allow me to give it a better rating, and I'm not quite sure what it is. It is a little scatter brained and redundant at certain points. Another pass from an editor would have helped. There is also a somewhat half-assed attempted to psycho analyze some of the motivation behind the embellishments/straight out lying, etc. that was a bit elementary, and quite frankly presumptuous. But most of all, I think the book needs to be re-organized. There should have been a \\"top ten\\" of sorts, myth #1 Shoes, myth #2 Ewell controversy, myth #3 Longstreet controversy, myth #4 Sicles controversy, etc. I have the feeling that the book was on the short side, and things were added and restated to beef it up. The writing almost would have worked better as a series of articles in a ACW or history mag.That being said, it is very insightful and for that it gets my 3/maybe 3.5 star rating. Not for the novice, I think you are better reading a treatment of the battle, at least to help you understand why men would lie/exaggerate their reports. The biggest surprise of course is the heroic stand of the 20th Maine which gets toned down to realistic proportions and brings Chamberlin back to earth.In short, good reading overall, but could use the touch of a better editor, and less preaching."},{"Title":"These Honored Dead: How The Story Of Gettysburg Shaped American Memory","review":"...I decided to invest in Desjardin's book to add to my modest Civil War collection. At just over 200 pages it is extremely thin for the $26 list price. More distressing, the author makes it thinner still by repeating the same passages over and over. No less then four times does the author recount (in detail) how Michael Sharra's \\"The Killer Angels\\" was written as a quasi Shakespearean history, that Sharra's book was rejected by countless publishers, that it did not sell well in post-Vietnam America, that the book won the Pulitzer Prize and eventually sold millions of copies before it was made into the movie Gettysburg. At least three times does Desjardin inform the reader that Ted Turner mistated the number of Gettysburg dead on national cable televesion after the showing of the movie he bankrolled. In consecutive chapters early in the book the author relates the same long quotation, attributed to Charles Wainwright, as if the reader had never heard it the first time. He wastes enourmous time talking about the claims of Daniel Sickles and Jubal Early as forming the basis of accepted myth about the battle when both men's assertions have long since been rebutted and have no popular credibility whatsoever (as long ago as 1965, I remember NPS employees manning the electronic battlefield showing the Sickles' salaint and stating that the General threatened the entire Union posistion by advancing his Corps into the Peach Orchard against orders). In any event, these are old stories that are, at least, twice told. In telling the Chamberlain myth, the author stills gives his fellow Maine native (and the subject of his prior book) a big break by saying that the myth sprang up without Chamberlain's sanction. What he omitted was the Colonel's venoumous, vindictive and very sucessful campaign to prevent the Confederate commander, Oates, from placing a memorial to his men anywhere close to Little Round Top, believing it to be his exclusive province. These are some examples of hit and miss scholarship and poor writing. The editing is a mess, as apparent in the footnotes and the bibliography where the wrong authors are credited with the wrong materials. Lastly, Desjardin falls into his own trap when he says the Bible is a contradictory text because it advises to take \\"an eye for an eye\\" while also commanding to \\"turn the other cheek\\". First of all it is intellectual dishonesty to compare the law of the Old Testament to the Gospels of the New Testament. Second, the \\"eye for an eye\\" language is not the Bible, it is the Code of Hamurabi.

And I must also agree with the reviewer who thought this book desperately needed an editor.You might compare this book to a Senior Thesis...long on words and shorter than you'd like on fact and substance. But then, I came to this book wanting the arguments, wanting the sources and an evaluation of them. Not a simple, terse statement that a source was unreliable followed by an entire dismissal of anything to do with the tainted source. (Disregarding some sources would be ignoring as much truth as fiction.)I was especially interested in the issues and history surrounding some of the accounts of Col. Chamberlain and the defence of Little Round Top. But I wanted to know what the likely truth was, not just what the author thought was suspect. And I had a hard time believing that many of the details the author wanted to discuss (like the kind of hat someone might have worn or whether there was a Buster Kilrain) were important enough to put in a book. And most readers aren't that worried about the exact spot where someone might have died.If this book was directed to a general audience, it often failed to raise issues sufficiently meaty to merit any hype. If it was directed to an audience of specialists or buffs, they would be disappointed by the lack of detail and documentation.Desjardins seems to take his audience for fools, typically portraying the worst examples of ignorance, vapid credulity, and mercenary exploits connected with Gettysburg. No thinking person assumes everything happened just as it's portrayed in a movie. I can make up my mind about various myths just fine. I just wanted information to work from and I was quite content when I got it.Just my perspective. There was definitely some worthwhile material. I think the author was reflecting more of his background in the park than is useful for a wide audience...most of us don't care too much when or how certain monuments were put in place, though some of the machinations behind them were interesting. And I think he erred unhappily on the side of talking around some of the real debates so as not to become embroiled in them. But it isn't really a waste of time. What I want to know is what the battle means to the author. Was it significant or not, and in what way? Just curious!"},{"Title":"These Honored Dead: How The Story Of Gettysburg Shaped American Memory","review":"If you type \\"Gettysburg\\" into this site's search engine, you'll find more than 500 books that include the name of that famous battle in their title. It's likely that more has been written about those three days at the beginning of July, 1863, than any other battle in the history of the United States. Yet in \\"These Honored Dead\\" Thomas A. Desjardin brings fresh insights to the Gettysburg saga by beginning his account on July 4, 1863--the day after the guns fell silent.In this thoughtful work, Desjardin explores the legends and myths that have developed around Gettysburg in the ensuing decades. He argues that the actual record of what happened has been open to conflicting interpretation by just about any group or individual with enough persuasive ability to bend the story to its own purposes \\"History has a way of coming out as we hoped it would rather than the way things really happened,\\" he observes, then spends the next several chapters exploring how the reality of the conflict has been obscured, through accidental or deliberate misinterpretation. In the first decades after the battle, it might have been a disgraced officer seeking to salvage his reputation; in more recent times, it's likely to have been a novelist or filmmaker in search of a dramatic hero or moment to illuminate his story. But whatever the motives, the result has been to shroud the reality of those days in myth.In one chapter, Desjardin considers the conflicting versions on what happened on Little Round Top. Certainly it's a pivotal spot on the battlefield; but if we can't determine the truth of what happened on a piece of real estate barely 100 yards wide, how can we hope to sort out the myths from the reality of the battle as a whole?Do you believe that as many men died in the three days of Gettysburg as in the entire Vietnam war? Have you read that the Confederate army headed into Gettysburg hoping to raid a shoe factory or warehouse? Do you believe the positioning of a horse's hooves on an equestrian statue at the battlefield is designed to convey the rider's ultimate fate? Do you blame James Longstreet for the Confederate defeat, or credit Joshua Chamberlain for the Union victory? Then be prepared to re-think what you know about this most famous of American battles. Desjardin's book is not only a thoughtful look at those three days in July; it's also an intriguing exploration of the entire history-making process.--William C.

It is written in an engaging style that does not mean to discredit any previous historian who has spilled ink on the world's most famous battle yet the book offers a stimulating thesis on how we remember things as humans. History is a mystery. That's why studying it so fascinating. There is no &quot;true history, just clues. It is our job to solve the case.

Desjardins raises some of the fundamental historical and historiographical questions in trying to determine: &quot; How do we know what we know?&quot;Obviously, using Gettysburg as the centerpiece for discussion, but branching into &quot; Lost Cause&quot; critiques, Desjardins has produced an entertaining, often humorous, an ultimately valuable assessment of the many myths that surround Civil War discussion.Perhaps the most striking and revealing commentary deals with how the tradition of Gettysburg worship and celebration evolved, and how the controversial selection and placing of monuments transpired.Although some of the probing covers previously analyzed terrain, the author brings a new angle, and thankfully, non-ideological viewpoint to the topics.

Desjardin reveals how history and memory often conflict and how many of the battlefield legends came to be. A refreshing look at a much written about topic!"},{"Title":"These Honored Dead: How The Story Of Gettysburg Shaped American Memory","review":"Having a great-great grandfather who fought in the Battle of Gettysburg, I have more than a passing interest in this Civil War battle. After reading Thomas A. Desjardin's These Honored Dead: How the Story of Gettysburg Shaped American Memory, I learned that much of what we believe about this pivotal battle is incorrect.Desjardin goes into great detail on how and why our take on this battle has changed over the years. \\"The truth about Gettysburg is buried beneath layer upon layer of flawed human memory and our attempts to fashion our past into something that makes our present a little easier to live in.\\" There are all kinds of myths that have been passed down, including that General Lee led his Confederates to Gettysburg because it was the location of a shoe factory (it wasn't) or that Lincoln wrote the Gettysburg Address on the back of an envelope (he didn't). Many errors can be attributed to the fog of war. \\"Adrenaline, chaos, confusion, noise, anger, pain, blood--all capture the mind's focus when one's life is on the line in combat.\\" Other errors can be connected to the fact that most Civil War soldiers waited until 20 years or more after the war before writing their version of events. Many eye-witnesses wrote to put their \\"spin\\" on the battle, or to make specific leaders or regiments look good. General Dan Sickles, who created a major blunder on Day 2, spent the rest of his long life claiming that his actions were the result of mistakes made by General George Meade (they weren't).In some situations, art is responsible for these untruths. The famous Gettysburg Cyclorama was painted by French artist, Paul Philippoteaux. It shows a definite French influence including \\"French-style hay bales,\\" Union soldiers \\"wearing the white-legged uniforms of the French army,\\" and wounded soldiers being transported from the battlefield in French \\"two-seated mule-borne apparatus.\\" In 1994, the movie Gettysburg made its television debut. In commentary before the film, Ted Turner states that 50,000 men died at Gettysburg--more than the entire Viet Nam War. Actually, only 10,000 died at Gettysburg, although millions of Americans think otherwise, thanks to Turner.My husband and I saw first-hand how such errors were made. My great-great grandfather fought with the Pennsylvania 115th Infantry, which saw action on Day 2 in the Wheat Field. The PA 115th monument can be found there. On my last visit, I had a personal guide who was very knowledgeable about the Wheat Field. He informed me that the PA 115th actually fought on the other side of a small stream. But when monuments were being erected, that ground was still private land. So the monument is not correctly placed.These Honored Dead has definitely changed the way I look at the Battle of Gettysburg."},{"Title":"These Honored Dead: How The Story Of Gettysburg Shaped American Memory","review":"The Battle of Gettysburg (July 1 -- July 3, 1863) was the largest battle fought in North America and a pivotal event of the American Civil War. The battle, its causes, environs, personalities, events, among other things have been written about and memorialized endlessly, literally from the moment the troops on both sides left the battlefield.In his study \\"These Honored Dead\\", Thomas Desjardin examines some of the the legends that have grown around this great battle. He has written a historiography which shows how and why it is difficult to determine what in fact occured during the battle from the mass of conflicting accounts in the literature. Desjardin holds a PhD in American history. He is the author of \\"Stand Firm Ye Boys from Maine\\" which examines the activities of the 20th Maine and Colonel Joshua Chamberlain on Little Round Top during the Battle of Gettysburg.Desjardin offers several reasons contributing the the difficulty of separating fact from memory in understanding a complex historical event such as the Battle of Gettysburg. First, during the battle, the participants were under, obviously, severe stress and tend to focus only on the activities under their direct observation. With the passage of years, memories tend both to fade and to become embellished.Second, after the battle many of the participants tried to shape the story for ends and meanings of their own. Thus Union General Dan Sickles tried to destroy the reputation of General Meade, the Union commander at Gettysburg, to cover Sickles's own misdeeds in moving his Third Corps to an exposed position which threatened the Federal position and resulted in great loss of life. Similarly, various Confederate writers, including General Jubal Early, tried to find scapegoats for the loss of the battle to foster a \\"Lost Cause\\" mythology and absolve General Robert E. Lee from blame for the defeat.Third, Gettysburg has become regarded as a key moment in understanding and giving meaning to the American experience. Historians, artists, and the public have shaped the meaning and events of the battle to meet perceived national and frequently individual ends.Desjardins examines a number of key moments of the battle, including the fighting for Little Round Top at the extreme left of the Union line on July 2 and \\"Pickett's Charge\\" at the center of the Union line on July 3. A great deal of mythology has grown around these two moments. With respect to Little Round Top, Desjardins examines the bases for some of the claims put forth about Joshua Chamberlain and Gouverneur Warren, among others, and concludes that a number of the claims are extravagant, unsupported by, and in some cases contradicted by the historical record. Desjardin discusses in some detail Michael Sharaa's famous novel, \\"The Killer Angels\\" and the television series and movie based upon it and shows the fictitious character of much of the account.A work such as Desjardin's could easily degenerate into an exercise in debunking, which is all-to-common in understanding American history. But I found Desjardin's book moving and instructive precisely because this does not happen. Desjardin discusses a battle and a battlefield that have a great deal of historical and personal resonance for him, and he takes it seriously. Gettysburg may not be, indeed, an American Valhalla, but the site is hallowed ground and it, and its combatants, have earned the study, memorializations, and legends they have received. Taking away some of the legends about Chamberlain or Warren, for example, we are left with highly impressive individuals and with incidents of heroism. Upon completing the book, I was left with the feeling that, in Gettyburg as in so much else, the truth and the search for the truth about what took place, are more impressive and shape the legends. The battle, its consequences, and meanings are properly ways in which Americans discover themselves.Readers who enjoy this book will also benefit from many other studies about the relationship between history and memory at Gettysburg. An example of such a book is Carol Reardon's \\"Pickett's Charge in History and Memory\\" (1997). Desjardin's book will have its greatest appeal to readers who have a background in the Battle of Gettysburg and an interest in questions of historical truth and interpretation.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"These Honored Dead: How The Story Of Gettysburg Shaped American Memory","review":"Prospective readers should not approach this book simply as a history of the Battle of Gettysburg, although the book can be recommended to any student of the Battle. For the book goes beyond history; it is more a work of metahistory or historiography. Its themes are the evanescence and corrosive nature of memory and the related need of humans to create stories and how those two phenomena inevitably shape, and skew, history -- all as played out in the ever-evolving popular history of the Battle of Gettysburg. These themes are well-known to professional historians, but many amateur historians and Civil War buffs probably are not as cognizant of them as they should be. Desjardin illustrates them again and again in the course of his exploration of the development of a number of the popular legends surrounding Gettysburg -- including Dan Sickles' quest to disparage General Meade and have himself anointed the Union hero and savior of Gettysburg, the \\"Copse of Trees\\" as the \\"High Water Mark\\" of the Confederacy, the role of Gettysburg in \\"Lost Cause\\" mythology, and the celebration of Little Round Top and Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain in more recent mythology such as Michael Shaara's \\"The Killer Angels\\" and the movie \\"Gettysburg.\\" THESE HONORED DEAD is a fascinating and instructive book, with the added virtues of being relatively brief and quite readable."},{"Title":"These Honored Dead: How The Story Of Gettysburg Shaped American Memory","review":"This is actually a pretty unique book on Gettysburg in that it's not a study of the battle itself but of the history of the battle and how people's perceptions of Gettysburg have been shaped over time. Tom Desjardin does a wonderful job of looking at some of the more famous parts of the battle such as Little Round Top and The High Water Mark and explaining why and how they became focal points. Many myths are explored and how they came into being such as the myth that the Confederates were a ragged shoeless army (They were actually well equipped).Sickles' endless campaign after the battle to smear Meade's reputation also gets a close look as well as the evolution of the 20th Maine's role in the battle thanks to the book Killer Angels and the film Gettysburg.The book also has some interesting info about the monuments on the field.

Moll was quite a remarkable woman in her time. He covers her earlier life of crime and the punishment that ensued from that right up to her later days where she reformed. She made quite a few marriages, and learned and grew from these. Although most of her marriages and her intrigues were undertaken in the pursuit of money, she was actually not without passion or generosity. There is quite a bit of moralizing throughout the book, but it is totally enjoyable nonetheless because Moll was so human and Defoe has created a living, breathing heroine that is as realistic as they come (especially during this era). Quite an accomplishment, especially for a male author."},{"Title":"Moll Flanders","review":"This book is absolutely hilarious! Moll Flanders is a woman who loved money a bit too much and in turn was loved by many a man with money. The comedy in this book stands the test of time (at least for me) and in my opinion, the language is not as archaic and difficult to follow as one previous reviewer stated. There are some words that aren't in use today, but their meanings are pretty self-explanatory. If you love scandal, you'll love this book. This chick has baby after baby, sleeps with almost any man with money, and even marries her own brother! If Moll were around nowadays, she'd probably be on Springer!

I mean with nice writing, plenty of sex, and daring characters you'd think this book would have more reviews. :)I recommend this book not only for those of you who enjoy fine writing for its own sake, but also to those who like an intriguing tale about adulteresses. A+ Defoe."},{"Title":"Moll Flanders","review":"Though inevitably overshadowed by his immortal Robinson Crusoe, Moll Flanders is another excellent, important, and influential Daniel Defoe novel. Anyone who has not read Crusoe should of course do so first, but its fans are encouraged to continue here, as Moll has many of the same virtues.Crusoe has long been called the first real Western novel, making Moll, which came out a few years later, an early entry. Like Crusoe, it can be highly enjoyed and appreciated simply as a rollicking adventure. It is nearly as entertaining, drawing us in quickly and never letting go through a remarkable series of plot twists continuing to the very end. The novel is fast-paced and intriguing, and its sheer readability is very noteworthy. It reads almost as well as ever despite archaic spellings and punctuation. Unlike nearly all classics, it need not be drastically edited, footnoted, and introduced for comprehension. This is hardly true of even many twentieth century works, much less one of such vintage. Even casual readers who have almost no experience with classics, to say nothing of ones three hundred years old, can pick it up with practically no trouble. The documentary style and clear, concise prose that made Crusoe so ground-breaking and absorbing are continued, but Moll is in many ways even more impressive because Crusoe had the easy draw of an exotic deserted island, while this is set in contemporary England and colonial America. The attractive element now comes from Defoe's focus on society's oft-overlooked underbelly, which he knew well from hard personal experience. We get a profoundly up-close look at the poor and downtrodden, including criminals, prisoners, indentured servants, and other laborers. Moll indeed focuses near-obsessively on the low and gritty, including prostitution and incest. This fascinated initial readers and continues to do so, helped by newly acquired historical value. The plot is highly improbable - far more so than Crusoe's in most ways -, but the stark realist tone and attention to everyday detail make it an invaluable record of early eighteenth century English and American life, including the dark side most never mention.The character of Moll is also of great importance and highly lifelike despite being written by a man. Though lacking almost all conventional virtues save beauty and at times seeming to positively revel in what the era would have called deadly sin, she remains sympathetic. This is mostly because, like Crusoe, she remains resolute and optimistic in extremely adverse circumstances; the eternal values of courage, determination, and perseverance are on strong display, making her - against all odds - in some ways conventionally admirable.More important from our perspective is Defoe's penetrating presentation of women's issues. Calling Moll a proto-feminist work would be too much, but Defoe shows a truly incredible knowledge of and sympathy for women's issues for a man born in the seventeenth century. He vividly shows the hardships women faced, many of them patently unfair, and the drastic lengths they had to go to in order to ameliorate their woes even a little. Moll may be unscrupulous from most perspectives but lived in an unjust society and did what she felt necessary to survive; there is much to look up to here, and she is arguably even noble in her way. She is in any event supremely interesting, as are the issues and themes she represents.All told, while not one of literature's greatest works, Moll is a highly readable and important book that fans of Defoe and other early English novels will enjoy."},{"Title":"Moll Flanders","review":"Moll Flanders , written in 1722, is a remarkable example of crime literature and may be the earliest example in English. The language is archaic and for the first 50-60 pages I felt myself struggling a bit but then the story and the character of Moll herself compensates for the struggle and the reward is a fascinating tale of a woman's fight to survive poverty by any means she can in 17th century England. Defoe created a character that is so grounded in flesh and blood that it seems to me that it must be based on someone he knew during his own time in prison. This is truly a remarkable achievement for it's time and it holds up very well once the language hurdle is overcome. The plot has many twists and turns as Moll Flanders relates her life story and describes her inner thoughts regarding her circumstances and the people she encounters over a period of almost 60 years in terms that truly result in a tense page turner of a novel despite the span of centuries.I could see the influence of this book on the yet to be written novels of Dickens and Thomas Hardy with their tragic feminine protagonists. This is really unmissable for any reader interested in the development of the novel in the English language. Excellent."},{"Title":"Moll Flanders","review":"Moll Flanders is one of the few 'classic' books I have read in which a MALE author parallels the thought of a woman as the narrator. Moll Flanders is the ultimate tribute to a woman out to make a name for herself in a world of poverty, protitution, and love, who eventually learns more about her own strengths than the lessons of any morals. Moll Flanders is an embodiment of feminism... but oddly enough is written by a male author-giving the text a female and male essence of love, twists, and, of course, misfortunes."},{"Title":"Moll Flanders","review":"Moll Flanders / 0-451-52633-3Defoe's novel, Moll Flanders, one of the first English novels follows the \\"true\\" story of a lower-class woman who eventually turns to a life of petty thievery and prostitution - partly as a means to survive, and partly in the hopes of reaching a middle-class life of relative riches and ease.This thin little novel is a fairly quick read and the story pacing moves at a quick clip as we read through the salacious and scandalous life of this matron. Moll Flanders is not particularly clever nor particularly beautiful, but she is persistent, dogged, and increasingly amoral enough to make a life for herself above and beyond desperate poverty. Through the course of her life, Moll takes several husbands, bears multiple children, and chooses to view her life with pride and detachment, rather than with the shame she 'ought' to feel. In this regard, Moll is perhaps the most modern of historical novel characters, because she views with a jaundiced eye the societal norms which would compel her to pious poverty, and because she recognizes that the 'shameful' things she does to survive, the gentry do on a much wider (if more socially acceptable) scale.~ Ana Mardoll"},{"Title":"Moll Flanders","review":"Daniel Defoe, hot on the heels of \\"Robinson Crusoe\\" came under considerable fire when \\"Moll Flanders\\" was published. She was called immoral, when, in fact, she is amoral. Churches and universities could not understand why Defoe was fascinated with characters considered \\"low\\". The fact is, the public adored her and the novel. And it continues to do so to this day.But, as I've repeated in other reviews, the Dover Thrift edition makes it even more of an attractive purchase. Well-bound and sturdy, it's the best thing you can do with the $5.00 you can spare in your pocket. And, if you're like me, and you have to teach this book, it takes a great financial burden on your already overburdened students."},{"Title":"Moll Flanders","review":"\\"It is true that the original of this story is put into new words\\" thus Defoe tells us in the Authors Preface that he has re-written the original manuscript delivered to him by Moll. Of course since there was no original manuscript or no real Moll , except for a model for her he might of met while in Newgate prison, Defoe is creating fiction within fiction. This is just one of the many devices Defoe uses to depict Moll to the reader as a real person not just a literary creation. Moll comes to life in these pages and seems to be a person of history instead of fiction but Moll Flanders is not really a novel.Defoe's \\"Roxana\\" is the first English novel. Some would point to Robinson Crusoe or Moll Flanders yet the time before and after the Island in \\"Crusoe\\" seems to fit the Tall Tale genre and Moll Flanders is a picturesque adventure. Roxana is more of what the \\"novel\\" evolves into.Moll is born in Newgate prison. Her mother, a thief, after pleading her belly and delivering Moll into this world is deported to the colonies in America. Moll is passed around even living and travelling with Gypsies for awhile. During her early years she relies on men to keep her afloat because in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries a woman alone had few good options for survival and Moll is nothing if not a survivor. On into middle age Moll turns thief to make ends meet. In one scene she is going to a house fire to see what can be had in the panic and confusion ,since she had luck that way once before, and a maid throws a mattress out of an upper story and it lands on Moll knocking her out. If they threw more goods out onto the mattress, Moll reflects she would have been \\"inevitably killed; but I was reserved for further afflictions\\".Also recommended is the excellent film \\"Moll Flanders\\" starring Alex Kingston."},{"Title":"Moll Flanders","review":"First off, it is surprising to me to read a male author so comfortable in the female perspective. But DeFoe definitely is comfortable and superb as he presents the 'memoirs' of Moll Flanders from the time that she is given up by her mother in Newgate through a turbulent and action packed life. He presents her flawed choices as reasonable under the circumstances in each case. And what choices they are!The best punch is about three quarters of the way through the book when she is starting to get on in years and is trying to better her position through marriage. He, through her, chastises women who put too little value on themselves. He/She spells out certain rules to gain control in relationships with men and how to best watch for your own interests. It struck me that this would be useful information for a young girl to read today (or any unmarried woman for that matter).If you are concerned about giving a book to a young girl that contains premarital sex, theft and a score of other things you wouldn't want her to do - don't be. DeFoe presents the memoirs as a warning, a parable if you will, and Ms. Flanders is always repentent. This is standard DeFoe style - and a wonderful story."},{"Title":"Moll Flanders","review":"Moll Flanders was written by Daniel Defoe, the same author of Robinson Crusoe. Although the settings are different, we can see many similarities between the stories, like the implicit criticism of british society of the XVII/XVIII centuries and the importance that society gave to exterior looks.Moll Flanders can be divided in two parts. In the first one, Moll, being poor, is raised in a foster home, and, being pretty, catches the attention of the elder son of the family whose house she lives in. It is when her misfortunes begin. Misled and deceived by this elder son, she has to leave the house and be on her own. When she was a child, she wanted to be a &quot;dame of society&quot;, and that's what she desperately tries to become, looking for a rich man who will support her financialy. To catch the eyes of such men, she has to pretend she is very rich herself, and then all she manages to have are false &quot;gentlemen&quot;, trying themselves to marry a rich woman. Even then, she is able to find a man she loves (more than one, in fact), but through a series of bad luck she always looses everything.The second part of the book is where Moll Flanders transforms herself in a successfull thieve. This is a fun part, where she describes her struggle to accomplish the thefts without being caught and thrown to infamous prison Newgate. And then, the ending seemed a little too sudden to me.Defoe's book is a stinging critic to his society, and that's why he chose to write in a female first-person, self centered (there are almost no other names in the course of the story) and desperate to get to the high level of society, showing that everybody could be affected by hypocrite puritanism and moralism.Grade 8.5/10"},{"Title":"Moll Flanders","review":"\\"Who was Born in Newgate, and during a Life of continu'd Variety for threescore years, besides her childhood, was Twelve Year a Whore, five times a Wife (Whereof once to her own Brother) Twelve Year a Thief, Eight Year a Transported Felon in Virginia, at last grew Rich, liv'd Honest, and died a Penitent\\" (original title page), this is the beginning of an exciting book, Moll Flanders by Daniel Defoe. It is written in elevated language making it a difficult, but rewarding read. The novel is an accounting of the narrator, Moll's life. The focus is on how Moll deals with the hardships of her life and with being a woman in the seventeenth century. Defoe does an excellent job of showing how Moll's experiences change her outlook.Moll Flanders was written in 1683, during a time in which women were considered subservient to men. Women were expected to get married and be content with the household affairs. However, money was the key, without it one would be unable to find a husband of position that would be a good provider. If a woman, like Moll, found herself alone and herself to rely upon, she discovered that there were not many options available, \\"I found by experience, that to be Friendless is the worst Condition, next to being in want, that a Woman can be reduc'd to: I say a Women, because \`tis evident Men can be their own Advisers, and their own Directors, and know how to work themselves out of Difficulties and into Business better than women; but if a Woman has no Friend to Communicate her Affairs to, and to advise and assist her, tis' ten to one but she is undone\\" (121). Men dominated the business world and women were never taught to manage their own affairs or given the skills to enable them to make it in the business world. In fact, it was illegal for most women to do so. Without any acquaintances or contacts, a woman of this time was put at the mercy of strangers and fate. A woman that managed to be on her own was often suspected to be of ill reputation, and if she was labeled as such then life would be much harder.Moll had a hard life from the beginning. She was born in Newgate prison, then taken in by a woman she dubbed Mistress Nurse. From an early age she wanted to become a gentlewoman, \\"...what I meant by being a Gentlewomen; and that I understood by it to be nothing more, than to be able to get my Bread by my own Work\\" (15). Upon her Mistress Nurse's death she was hired a servant in a high-class home. She became the lover to the eldest son, but the younger son fell in love with her and Moll was forced to marry him. He soon died and Moll married a \\"Gentleman-Tradesman\\" who spent all of their money, and had to leave the country to escape his creditors. Being very much desolate Moll realized, \\"Beauty, Wit, Manners, Sense, good Humour, good Behaviour, Education, Virtue, Piety, or any other Qualification, whether of Body or Mind, had no power to recommend: that Money only made a Women agreeable\\" (64). So Moll passed herself off as a woman of fortune, and married again. She moved with her husband to Virginia, and there realized that he was her brother. Upon that realization, Moll moved back to England. Upon her return she met another man, and over time became his mistress. After a terrible illness he decided that he could not live in sin with Moll any longer and turned her out. Moll then was tricked into marrying a man she believed to be very rich, and he was also deceived into believing she is a fortune. Having no money, they parted ways. Moll then married her accountant. After his death she was very poor, and out of desperation she became a thief. \\"The thoughts of this Booty put out all the thoughts of the first, and the Reflections I had made wore quickly off; Poverty, as I have said, harden'd my Heart, and my own Necessities made me regardless of any thing\\" (182). After a successful career as a thief, Moll was finally arrested and sent to Newgate. There she meets up with her fourth husband who was discovered to be a highwayman. They are both transported to Virginia where they buy a plantation together and eventually grow rich. Moll thus became a Gentlewoman.In the male dominated society of the seventeenth century it was extremely difficult for a woman to make it on her own. Through Moll's experiences Defoe shows the difficult position a woman was faced with the lack of social liberty. Every plot development changes Moll slightly. Her Character almost completely changes as she becomes manipulative to get what she wants and needs to survive. This is apparent through her comments about her fifth husband before she married him, \\"I play'd with this Lover, as an Angler does with a Trout: I found I had him fast on the Hook, so I jested with his new Proposal\\" (133). The change in Moll's personality occurs slowly, but it makes her a more convincing character as well as highlights the effects of the hardships she endures. In the depiction of Moll's life, Defoe succeeds in questioning the subservient position that society forced women into in the seventeenth century.The elevated language in Moll Flanders makes it a complicated read, however, if one is able to get past that obstacle the reader is rewarded with an outstanding story. Moll's life was a true adventure. Defoe's focus on Moll gives the reader insight into the hardships of the life of a woman in the seventeenth century, as well as shows the difficulty of getting ahead in those times. In a period where women were considered to be subservient to men, Moll was an assertive woman whose life was a great adventure."},{"Title":"Moll Flanders","review":"Did you see the official title of this book?

Didn't have much of a problem with the writing style, but others might.As a mom, I just couldn't get over the fact she gave birth to about 10 kids, didn't give a flying leap about any of them, and abandoned every single one of them at her earliest convenience. I have heard of a lot of REALLY bad mothers, but none that just walked away, never gave another thought to any of them - on about 6 different occasions.My modern mind wants to guess she had reactive attachment disorder since she was abandoned herself, but of course she just may be the imagining of a man who didn't really care to write about a woman's relationships with her children. (Wikipedia says he had 8 kids by the same wife and 6 survived, so he should have known of the bond a woman has with her children).It's an interesting book, but I can't fully recommend it as a story.

Here for the meeting are highwaymen, convicts and clergy, landed gentry, disenfranchised priests, and Virginia colonists. And if you read between the lines you'll also find Moll's story has more sex plastered through it than a season worth of Desperate Housewives with half of HBO's lineup thrown in to boot.

More fornication, theft, sacrilege here than a month of junk-TV and yet it's assigned classroom material. Oh, man.

The novel is written in a format that Moll tells her story in the first person to the audiance of a journalist. If this was a movie the format would be best described as a &quot;Mocumentary&quot;.

If you enjoy reading classics, you'll definitely like this book."},{"Title":"Moll Flanders","review":"For a nearly 300-year-old lady, \\"Moll Flanders\\" has held up surprisingly well.She lives her life according to her terms, doesn't define herself by any of the many men she's with, circumvents society's laws when it suits her, and goodness knows doesn't let any of her children tie her down. Reading this Daniel Defoe novel from 1722 is like opening a window across the centuries to discover someone very much like us staring back. So too, it seems, is the author, whose first-person account of Moll presents her rationalizing without pity or judgment. What a shame this novel seems to come before the invention of the chapter!That was a big stumbling block for me in enjoying this novel, that it just runs without break for 300 pages. It's also very densely packed with incident. If you don't read through each paragraph carefully, you may miss one of Moll's marriages. The first 100 pages throw everything at us from a saucy maid's adventure with a pair of passionate brothers to a tale of incest taking place in Virginia (Southern Gothic 200 years before Faulkner!)\\"As covetousness is the root of all evil, so poverty is the worst of all snares,\\" avers Moll in the first-person narrative, yet it's never as simple as that. It's less poverty than fear of poverty that drives Moll to her extremes. She also is in the habit of throwing aside her relations for the prospect of a better deal. Finally, as she becomes a member of the underworld, her avarice exceeds her want to the point where even her own fence pleads for her to quit while she's ahead.Yet even as we may disdain her actions, Moll retains our sympathy. The feeling of having a ringside seat to such a character makes up for a lot of flaws, and so does her no-nonsense way of telling us what's what and letting the cards fall where they will: \\"The moral, indeed, of all my history is left to be gathered by the senses and judgement of the reader; I am not qualified to preach to them.\\"The sordid nature of Moll is a bit of a hang-up, and so is the spouse-flipping monotony of the book's first half. Once she's involved in her criminal doings, however, \\"Moll Flanders\\" becomes a fascinating, full-bored examination of how criminals operated in early 18th-century London. It's worth knowing this going in, because if you find the first part too much of a drag, you might want to skip ahead and whet your appetite as Moll lifts fabrics from mercer-houses and cleverly manages to steal a heavy portmanteau full of pistoles while keeping a step ahead of the law.My Signet edition includes an afterward by Kenneth Roxroth that suggests Defoe was using \\"Moll\\" to satirize the emerging middle class, with its desire for material gain. Defoe was a prominent Whig of his day, but I don't think it fair to reduce his novel that way. This feels more like an attempt by a brilliant and sensitive writer to take life the way he found it.While not without a moral dimension, sometimes most present in its apparent absence, there's no feeling here of being spoon-fed a moral, the way so many authors of the time did. Defoe takes pains not to point fingers or create villains. The men who have at Moll, and even the woman who nurses her into her life of crime, are not written as lacking for good points, just following their impulses where they may. At one point, Moll tells us it is a good thing we can't read what is inside each other's hearts, or we'd never learn to trust people. Insights like these are another way \\"Moll\\" has held up rather well."},{"Title":"Moll Flanders","review":"Moll Flanders: Who was Born in Newgate, and during a Life of continu'd Variety for threescore years, besides her childhood, was Twelve Year a Whore, five times a Wife (Whereof once to her own Brother) Twelve Year a Thief, Eight Year a Transported Felon in Virginia, at last grew Rich, liv'd Honest, and died a Penitent by Daniel Defoe has been an interesting read. This is a true story taken from Moll Flander's own memoirs. This book is a story of wickedness until the last fifty of three hundred pages when 'Moll' finally becomes penitent. It then becomes a story of forgiveness and God's mercy no matter what a person's past life or background has been. Moll is a clever woman who, although wants to be honest and pure, cannot become so because of the society she lives in and what it has reduced her too. This, however, does not exempt her from responsibility for her actions, it just serves as a catalyst and partial cause of her circumstances. The bulk of the book serves as a warning that once a sin is set in motion it is very difficult, if not impossible, to stop. It is a lesson for those who are willing to read the book. I give it a lower rating because the story, although quite thought-provoking, became dull at times and was a little too graphic. Another note worth mentioning is that there are no chapters or separations in the book. It is written without any quotation marks so that dialouge is written as 'he said' 'she said.'"},{"Title":"Moll Flanders","review":"The'plot structure of Moll Flanders is conventional: it's the usual plot about a deviant who, in the end, regenerates oneself and kowtows before conventional morals - Moll's ultimate fate being no different from that of the late Sex and the City foursome.

The title caught my eye!"},{"Title":"Moll Flanders","review":"Daniel Defoe's 1722 novel, &quot;Moll Flanders,&quot; remains a fascinating imaginative work, and is in many ways more interesting than his famous first effort, &quot;Robinson Crusoe.&quot; Having seen bits of two recent film adaptations in the last couple of months on television, and being a budding 18th century scholar, I decided it was time I picked up my own copy of &quot;Moll Flanders&quot; and see the actual product on its own terms. A story no less about a castaway and delinquent than &quot;Crusoe,&quot; in &quot;Moll Flanders,&quot; Defoe attempts to set down the history of a woman with a wild and often desperate life. A character of infinitely more interiority and reflection than Crusoe, Moll gives us through a first person narrative, a look into various stations of life in 18th century England and America.The novel begins with a tip of the hat to that fine progenitor of the novel, &quot;Don Quixote,&quot; a Gines-like acknowledgment that Moll, as the author of her own story, cannot complete that story within the text of the novel, unless people can write when they are deceased. Amusements aside, Moll begins her story as Crusoe begins his, with an immediate acknowledgment of the instability of the modern self - the corruption of her own name. Born in Newgate prison, and having never known her mother, Moll finds herself among gypsies and landed gentry before settling in Colchester for the term of her youth. Here, she founds her sense of social ambition, unusual even for Jane Eyre in the 19th century, as one in which she figures to be a gentlewoman by earning her own living. Various mishaps and misadventures lead her through marriages, whoredom, and thievery as Moll attempts to find her place in the world as a woman of common birth. Early on she learns the lessons that will aid her on her journey, viz., the value of money, quick wit, and a sense of her own sexuality.While Defoe certainly does not sugar-coat the wrongs of woman in the early 18th century - delving deeply into issues of feminine helplessness before the law, the difficulties of procuring stable employment, and various reproductive issues such as adoption, abortion, and infant mortality - yet he maintains a consistent character of Moll as an extremely strong, adaptive, and resilient female character. The most riveting facet of Moll throughout is her own sense of self-worth and importance, especially in her own history. For instance, while chronicling an encounter with a former lover, Moll tells us that while his adventures are worth their own narrative, this is &quot;my story, not his.&quot; Moll's strength in the midst of doubt, desperation, and general loneliness keeps the reader's constant interest and admiration.Defoe's exploration of inter-gender relationships are worthy of note themselves for the sheer variety of social, economic, and personal situations he includes in the novel. The economic theme stands out among these, and provides a link back to the preoccupations of &quot;Robinson Crusoe.&quot; Like Crusoe, Moll is always aware of the value of her personal possessions, and conscious of how to exploit and husband her resources to best advantage. Also like Crusoe, &quot;Moll Flanders&quot; is keenly aware of the possibilities and drawbacks of English colonial ventures in America. Defoe's efforts to link all these themes to the lot of the English prison population, the family unit, and indentured servants and African slaves, are all managed extremely well within the text of the novel. For all this, &quot;Moll Flanders&quot; remains an entertaining, satisfying, relevant novel, and stands for me above &quot;Crusoe&quot; as a work of high literary value."},{"Title":"Moll Flanders","review":"'Tho the plot, being interesting in the extream, must be confess'd to be well-done, and alike the characters, being well-develop'd, plausible, and even sympathetic ('tho they be theives, felons, bigamists, and worse), must be similarly confess'd, still the writing style, being as it is extreamly archaic as well in spelling, grammar, and syntax, as in punctuation, the modern reader must be foarwarn'd: if he had difficulty with the parsing of this, the principle paragraph of this review, or finds the prospect of reading a story consisting of eight and forty more than two hundreds of pages in a like style daunting, he should give the project up as impracticable.If, on the other hand, you had no trouble with that paragraph, I daresay that you'll enjoy this book, even if, as the father of the English novel, Defoe had yet to engender the chapter break.Also it should be pointed out this may well be the first novel in which a male author attempts to write a story in which the lead character is female, and Defoe does a surprisingly good job of it."},{"Title":"Moll Flanders","review":"To fully understand and appreciate Moll Flanders you should have some understanding of the status of fiction at the time Daniel DeFoe was writing and some knowledge about the man himself. As Nancy Springer has indicated, the novel is an example of a \\"picaresque adventure,\\" a style of writing that was popular at the time. These stories glorified a new kind of hero--the ordinary person, who engaged in a series of often wild and improbable events in exotic places. The picaresque rouge was a rebel against the remains of the feudal system with its hierarchy of human worth. Such novels featured a clever, strong-minded, low-born character who knew how to survive. What DeFoe did differently is to make his character a women and have her adventures take place largely in England.The novel is also largely autobiographical. DeFoe himself experienced many financial ups and downs, yet he persevered. In fact it wasn't until he was 60 years old that he began writing novels and achieved some measure of fame and financial success. He spent time in Newgate prison and deeply in debt. He was also an outspoken political reformer who wrote more than 250 political pamphlets.Having said the above, the novel still has its faults. One is that it is written in a continuous manner with no chapter breaks. While DeFoe may have been trying to say that time is continuous and that distinctions (such as hours, days, weeks, etc.) are mere fabrications, still readers like to have books broken down into chapters. A more serious flaw is the lack of names. Apart from her first husband there are virtually no names given to the characters. Even Moll herself is not identified by the title name until well into the book and even this name is not her actual name (which we never learn). Instead characters are identified in some impersonal way (my Lancashire husband, my governess, etc.) The lack of names makes it hard for the reader to engender any sympathy for Moll and the other personages in the book. Also the action is so fast paced that it flashes by like looking through a kaleidoscope, the scenes and action constantly shifting and changing. For example, within the first 100 pages Moll is married five times, has several children, goes to Virginia, finds her mother, etc. There is no time for the reader to reflect on the tragedies that befall her, especially given that they are told in a matter-of-fact manner.The book can be divided into two parts. The first half deals with Moll's amorous life--her marriages and love affairs. The second part focuses primarily on her criminal activities. Both sections tell the story entirely from Moll's perspective. In many respects Moll is a match for Thackery's Becky Sharp. Both are low-born, both get positions in well-to-do families, both marry one of the sons in the family, both are attractive and quick witted, both scheme to get money and both have various adventures and misadventures. But Vanity Fair is written as a social commentary and Thackery uses the omnipotent story teller to advantage, even having him speak directly to the reader. DeFoe, by comparison, limits himself to having his protagonist say, in effect, now I did this, then I did that, then this happened, etc.To give DeFoe his due, the book does provide a realistic and detailed account of life in England at that time. His description of Newgate prison is but one example. Perhaps Moll's attitude also reflected the times accurately. It can best be described as \\"a woman is nothing without a man and to get a man a woman must have money.\\" Thus Moll spends the entire book pursuing both. But one can question how realistic Moll Flanders really is. She has a number of children, but seems to have little regard for them. Perhaps DeFoe, needing to rid Moll of encumbrances such as children in order to engage her in so many adventures, gave her what is an unnatural attitude for a mother. In the end he does reunite her with a son, but we should note that her motivation, at least at first, is financial not familial.All in all, the book is worth reading, but it is far from great literature."},{"Title":"Moll Flanders","review":"I think MOLL FLANDERS is my favorite novel of all time. The novel form was in its infancy at the time MOLL FLANDERS was written. In fact, Defoe is often called &quot;the father of the English novel.&quot; Actually, as a novel it's very primitive. Defoe's fiction is usually a first person narrative told by an ambitious person, recounting how he got where he is today. In Moll Flanders, Defoe presents the autobiography of a woman who rises from an ignominious birth in Newgate Prison, and a childhood as a servant. Early on, Moll learns that she is beautiful and that she is attractive to the opposite sex. What's great about the book is its delicious irony. Oh there are times when she gets caught in her own traps, she's a sly one, that Moll. It's very difficult at times to think of Moll as a fictional character. But she is, in fact, the first great female character in English prose. I never cease to be amazed that the book was written by a man. There are moments in the book that I find very moving, like when she realizes that she's no longer pretty enough to attract men without resorting to makeup. &quot;I never had to paint my face before.&quot; And of course there's that unsettling surprise she receives toward the end of the novel. This is a great and important book and hardly anyone has read it. I don't know why. I have recommended this book to probably a hundred people. To the best of my knowledge, not a single one of them has taken my advice. It's their loss. I LOVE Moll Flanders."},{"Title":"Moll Flanders","review":"An eighteenth century novel recounting the life and survival of a strong willed Moll Flanders, a woman who, abandoned as an infant, finds her way to self sufficiency, in a world then dominated by men. Through ingenius schemes she still some how always regains the illusion of imaginary high standing and good reputation throughout it all.I found Moll Flanders to be resourceful and ingenious in her methods for securing her own survival. The book puts prostitution and premarital sex in a whole new perspective. As one can deduce from this book, life was not so simple for women in the 18th century, especially if they were abandon as children, or even if they husband died and left them without means to exist. Moll takes her position as a dependent woman and finds power in her mind to devise schemes which will allow her a secure lifestyle without compromising her self.I found Moll to be a woman of character and repute, with self esteem, who made her own way in a world where women had no power, money or choices aside from their dependence upon men."},{"Title":"Moll Flanders","review":"The only thing I truely like about this tale is the insight to the times of over three hundred years ago. One is really struck by the more things change, the more things stay the same-at least when it comes to the human mind. Other than that, I really found a great majority of the book mind-numbingly dull-especially when when reach the part where our heroine becomed the infamous Moll Flanders. Nearly sixty pages of my edition (c. 1965 Dell Publishing) is devoted repetition of how Moll stole this or another and the innumerable times she'd almost gotten caught. A few incidents would have been fine, but the author seemed really taken by how these thieves scratched out their living. Given how DeFoe spent most of his life in debt, one wonders if his detail account came from of his own experience. Most of what happens to Moll Flanders while she bounced from one extraordinary event to the next stretches the threshold of believablity to the breaking point. This woman popped out so many kids and would just get up and walk away with no thought of the children-until the ONE toward the end of the story. The first half of the book caught and held my attention, but it was down hill from there."},{"Title":"Moll Flanders","review":"This human portrait of a woman is also an excellent sketch of the living conditions and the social stratification in England in the 18th century: 'the Age is so wicked and the Sex so Debauch'd'.It shows the immense chasm between a small class of wealthy people and the rest (Swift: a thousand to one). The latter were struggling for sheer survival and praying 'Give me not Poverty, lest I steal' ... to be hanged: 'If I swing by the String, I shall hear the Bell ring, and then there's an End of poor Jenny.'But both classes intermingled.As E.J. Burford quotes in his masterful book 'The Synfulle Citie':Those who were riche were hangid by the PursseThose who were poore were hangid by the NeckeDefoe's Moll Flanders: 'the passive Jade thinks of no Pleasure but the Money; and when he is as it were drunk in the Extasies of his wicked Pleasure, her Hands are in his Pockets.'Defoe paints the poor's religion as fatalism. Moll Flanders is all the time reproaching herself her Course of life, 'a horrid Complication of Wickedness, Whoredom, Adultery, Incest, Lying, Theft', but in the face of death at the gallows, 'I had now neither Remorse or Repentance ... no Thought of Heaven or Hell ... I neither had a Heart to ask God's Mercy.'Defoe's work is eminently modern, with his psychological insight 'What a Felicity is it to Mankind that they cannot see into the Hearts of one another', and 'Modest men are better Hypocrites';or, the ravages of alcoholism: 'the Drunk are the Men whom Solomon says, they go like an Ox to the Slaughter, till a Dart strikes through their Liver';and his feminism: 'the Disadvantage of the Women is a terrible Scandal upon Men', and 'Money only made a Woman agreeable.'Defoe's appeal to the reader - 'every Branch of my Story may be useful to honest People' - seems to be a smokescreen to circumvent censorship, because ultimately Moll Flanders prospers. This book is a perfect illustration of BernardMandeville's 'Triumph of Private Vices' in his 'Fable of the Bees'.Although some developments in this story are rather improbable, this superbly ironic and lively text constitutes an immortal portrait of the 'horrid Complication' to be a woman, here personified in Moll Flanders.Not to be missed."},{"Title":"Moll Flanders","review":"This book helped me to understand the perils of being a poor woman in Seventeenth Century London. The character Moll Flanders was born poor and she had no family to support her, therefore her only ways of survival was to get married, sell her body, become a servant at very low wages. She chose to become a thief, and to always to appear to be something that she was not.It is almost like a travel book because Moll is always moving from town to town, and from life episode to next episode, across the ocean trying to find a place to be herself and not a fake representation of a good woman.Sometimes the narrator is too detailed and tells more than I needed to know, but it does seem like a woman is speaking, or writing in a journal, even though the book was actually written by a man. I enjoyed reading the book and felt some sympathy for Moll Flanders because of her struggles, weaknesses, and her ability to endure."},{"Title":"Moll Flanders","review":"As many other reviewers have noted, it takes some effort to deal with this books old english style of prose. But, what do you expect? The book was written several hundred years ago! Once you get used to it, this novel is really very interesting and just gets progressively better as it goes on. By the end you cant put it down, you just have to know what happens to Moll. I thought Defoe offered very perceptive insights into human nature in sometimes very amusing passages. The novel has this curious aspect in that throughout the novel Moll displays a deep degree of moral self-awareness but then she has this ability to essentially ignore the impact of her often outrageous behavior. I guess this was Defoe's point. We all have to rationalize our actions to some degree to make our way in an imperfect and often cruel world. You will cheer and abhor her at the same time but at least she wont bore you!"},{"Title":"Moll Flanders","review":"I had read Robinson Crusoe earlier, and enjoyed it. So I looked forward to reading another great classic when I picked up Moll Flanders, also by Daniel Defoe. Unfortunately, it was not as good as I had hoped.Written in the eighteenth century, Moll Flanders is the story of a woman who is born in England, lives a lamentable life filled with many husbands, relationships outside of marriage with bastard children, a decade or so of shoplifting, a bit of prison time, all with success and happiness only in the last few years.As with Robinson Crusoe, the book's best feature can be found in its attention to detail. When describing her thieving experiences, for instance, Moll Flanders illustrates exactly how each encounter happened with such exactness that one could easily picture the event.Unlike Robinson Crusoe, however, this book dragged a bit more and was more difficult to follow. When reading RC, I had previously thought that Defoe's omission of any character's name was a deliberate attempt to characterize Robinson Crusoe's detachment as a character (The ship's captain was always referred to as \\"The ship's captain,\\" and nobody ever was referred to by their name). I was surprised to find that Defoe does this here, and unfortunately it made it much more confusing. When Moll Flanders refers to a man as \\"her husband,\\" I always wondered which husband it was, since she had been married many times. Because of this, the men seemed to run together and blend into a generic depiction of a man. Perhaps this was deliberate, too, but it got to me after awhile.The other problem is that this narrative is much less exciting than with RC, a man who is shipwrecked on a tropical island. Although the bits about the life of crime are more interesting, the beginning portion of her life unwinds at a slow pace.If people really like Robinson Crusoe, I think they will appreciate Moll Flanders. I think readers should go for Crusoe first and see what they think of it."},{"Title":"Moll Flanders","review":"I have been trying to read this book for several months now and I can't become interested enough to get into it for more than one or two evenings a month. The story itself is intriguing but seems to go on forever, though the novel itself is quite short. Keeping all the men in Moll's life straight gets confusing. Renting the movie would be much less cumbersome."},{"Title":"Moll Flanders","review":"It is a shame that for most Americans the only knowledge that they have of Defoe's MOLL FLANDERS is that which was taken from the various movie and television adaptions. The screen Moll focuses on the superficially glitzy part of what Defoe meant to be the edifying tale of a street trollop who uses her wits unrepentingly to enrich herself without worrying about the consequences. The transition of Moll from page to screen leaves out the feeling that life was, for her, one long debit page with the cost of an item to be balanced by its functional use.Moll did not start out as an unregenerate guttersnipe. At the book's start, Defoe is careful to portray her as the innocent lamb cast adrift in a sea of unscrupulous men. The world of Moll Flanders, the England of the 17th century, was not one designed to harbor any illusions that innocence could long remain that way in the face of ubiquitous lechery and poverty. Moll is seduced, then abandoned, and at the ripe age of 16,must fend for herself. The only coin that she retains to provide herself with the necessities of life is the one that she sits on.MOLL FLANDERS is unique among fallen from virtue women tales in its structure and incessant theme that to survive in an immoral world, one must be more immoral than everyone else. The novel itself is not divided into chapters. It is simply one very long series of vignettes, extending over many years, that portray Moll as the most infamous flat character in English literature. Moll's story can be summarized thusly: Moll steals, Moll eludes the law, Moll has innumerable (and unnamed) children, Moll commits incest (unknowingly) with her brother, Moll gets caught and is imprisoned. Throughout all of this, Moll changes not a whit. Her primary defense against a very nearly nonexistent conscience is her powerful sense of rationalization. One day, she sees a young child with some valuables hanging about his clothes. She pickpockets them, telling herself that the loss of these trifles ought to alert his parents that they could just have easily has suffered the loss of that child. Moll glides through life, usually coming out on top. As she gains reknown for her ill-deeds, she takes the time to compare her lot with those other poverty-stricken women who chose a life of virtue over crime. Moll cackles at their foolishness. The only time in the novel that she shows any remorse occurs when she is finally caught. At Rhett Butler said to Scarlett O'Hara in GONE WITH THE WIND, 'You are not sorry you committed wrong, but you are very sorry you got caught.'The question that modern readers have to grapple with is the intent of Daniel Defoe in presenting a woman whom today we would call a whore-grifter. Despite the tight focus on Moll, all that we learn of her after 300 pages of whoring is that she enjoyed her life with a gusto and cared not a fig about the consequences to her or to anyone else. Morality, Defoe seems to imply, is infinitely elastic, and its ultimate use is to justify the taking of material objects that rightfully belong to others. Moll, then, is the ancestor of Madonna's 'Material Girl,' one who blithely assumes that the bill for immorality need never be paid. Perhaps Defoe's inner lesson about Moll is that this elasticity of morality does result in an inevitable, if unwanted, payoff after all."},{"Title":"Moll Flanders","review":"One of the all time best works in the annals of literature, this highly involving and rich comic novel has perhaps the best heroine of any classic book. What a great narrative style, if not altogether a good role model; still, you can hardly blame Moll for all the trouble she gets into. Defoe really gets into the mind of this memorable female protagonist, so deftly, you will sympathsize with her from the first page. A truly sublime work of art. Add it to your personal library today."},{"Title":"Moll Flanders","review":"This human portrait of a woman is also an excellent sketch of the living conditions and the social stratification in England in the 18th century: 'the Age is so wicked and the Sex so Debauch'd'.It shows the immense chasm between a small class of wealthy people and the rest (Swift: 'a thousand to one'). The latter were struggling for sheer survival and praying 'Give me not Poverty, lest I steal' ... to be hanged: 'If I swing by the String, I shall hear the Bell ring, and then there's an End of poor Jenny.'But both classes intermingled.As E.J. Burford quotes in his masterful book 'The Synfulle Citie':Those who were riche were hangid by the PursseThose who were poore were hangid by the NeckeMoll Flanders: 'the passive Jade thinks of no Pleasure but the Money; and when he is as it were drunk in the Extasies of his wicked Pleasure, her Hands are in his Pockets.'The poor's religion was fatalism. Moll Flanders is all the time reproaching herself her Course of Life, 'a horrid Complication of Wickedness, Whoredom, Adultery, Incest, Lying, Theft...', but in the face of death at the gallows: 'I had now neither Remorse or Repentance ... no Thought of Heaven or Hell ... I neither had a Heart to ask God's Mercy.'Defoe's work is eminently modern with his psychological insight: 'What a Felicity is it to Mankind that they cannot see into the Hearts of one another, and 'Modest men are better Hypocrites';or, the ravage of alcoholism: 'the Drunk are the Men of whom Solomon says , they go like an Ox to the slaughter, till a Dart strikes through their Liver';and his feminism: 'the Disadvantage of the Women is a terrible Scandal upon Men', and 'Money only made a Woman agreeable'.Defoe's appeal to the reader 'every Branch of my Story may be useful to honest People', seems to be a smokescreen in order to circumvent censorship, because ultimately Moll Flanders prospers. This book is a perfect illustration of Bernard Mandeville's 'Triumph of Private Vices' in his 'Fable of the Bees'.Although some developments in this story are rather improbable, this superbly ironic and lively text constitutes an immortal portrait of the 'horrid Complication' to be a woman, here personified in Moll Flanders.Not to be missed."},{"Title":"Moll Flanders","review":"I enjoyed the ending of the book because I felt as if I knew Moll but I felt the plot repeated itself and she continiously did the same things.

One interesting aspect is that it's a man narrating as a woman, but the style gets a little crusty, and you can almost read the second half by just skimming the adjectives and nouns, good gentleman, good governess, horrid wretch, thief, and etc. Things go from bad to worse for Moll as she ages, and loses her money making beauty, but she eventually regains her peace of mind and some comfort through something like a stroke of luck and her re-deliverance to Virginia. Interesting that Virginia is considered a step down from the home island and a world of hard labor and servitude in the year 1683 as opposed to England.I would say that this story is a bit outdated, since it becomes just a list of misfortunes, and the premise that she is a penitent woman at the end of the story with many secrets and no confessional available is a bit hackneyed and lame. It's got it's points though and it serves as a valuable point for looking at literature of this time period. My main problem is that the story is broken into chunks of three page stories of misfortune and then another chapter starts (although there are no actual chapters) of misfortune.

Moll Flanders is a bleak read. Everyone in it is pretty awful. Moll herself can be read in numerous ways. She is a conniving, evil women, brought low by her sins (this is arguably the way Defoe meant to portray her) or, she is a strong women, who uses the resources at her disposal to survive in a world that consistently abuses her. I prefer the second reading. Either way, the ending where Moll finds a sort of spiritual redemption seemed contrived to my sensibilities, even if that possibility of redemption is likely the reason Defoe wrote the book in the first place."},{"Title":"Moll Flanders","review":"Think that sex,,violence, and scandal are only a modern invention? MOLL FLANDERS, written by Daniel Defoe in 1722, will prove you wrong. Incest, adultery, bigamy, prostitution, and thievery stain her background as she tries to rise above her birth and gain wealth in 18th century England.Moll Flander's tale is told so lightly and humorously that the reader tends to forget about the seriousness and the sadness of her situations. It gives and accurate and clear picture of English life in the 1700's. The language Defoe uses is 18th century English, yet readers shouldn't get scared away. The reading becomes easier after the first couple of chapters.So, if you are looking for a good book to curl up by the fire with, read MOLL FLANDERS"},{"Title":"Moll Flanders","review":"This book is about a woman, Moll Flanders, who was born in a prison and raised by a governess that brought her up as a \\"gentlewoman\\".

I would almost call this book feminist, although I don't like to use that term, since it makes men run from those books. I use that term very loosely, since it really does not go into any deeper feminst issues. This book is filled with adventures and is funny and witty, although its storyline is somewhat grim. I really wanted to give this book 3 1/2 stars because it left me wanting for more, not just at the end, but throughout.

I have long been a lover of classical language. As such, I am enchanted by the engaging rhythm of Defoe's words. His dialogue is charming as he uses a tongue and accent not much different from today's but far more elegant. The plot of the story, however, disappoints me. The story is wholly comprised of events, making it nothing more than a flowery timeline of one woman's life. For me, this odd combination of excellent language and mediocre plot makes for an ultimately readable yet slightly dissatisfying novel.Moll Flanders is the story of one woman's struggle to avoid the plight of poverty in seventeenth-century England. Moll is born in Newgate prison and orphaned by her criminal mother. From there, she is taken in by a kindly woman and raised as a \\"gentlewoman,\\" and thus her story begins. Moll's childhood innocence is quickly transformed as her life turns from that of a simple servant into that of a common prostitute. She soon learns that sex and marriage are merely tools for bartering with, and love is only worth its weight in gold. Eventually, Moll turns from prostitution to stealing in order to supplement her finances, and her life goes drastically downhill from there. Her story is littered with unresolved sin and shame, until one momentous event changes her entire outlook on life and on love and teaches her what it means to be righteous.Ultimately, what sounds like an intriguing story line results only in one continuous stream of events. Defoe's style of writing, although nicely worded, is impersonal in that he includes very little about the thoughts and feelings of Moll. Everything the reader learns about the main character is derived entirely from the events that comprise her life. Although this is supposed to be Moll's story, she has no reaction to the world around her. She simply reiterates what actions she has taken on her journey through life and what the resulting consequences are for those actions. Though hardly imagined to be a complete imbecile, Moll has absolutely no thought. The only words that I hear spoken directly from her mouth to the reader are words of dialogue to another character. The banality of this style of literature is highly disappointing in my eyes.I am also highly disappointed with the content of the story. Only the first few pages and the last few pages are void of any criminal or adulterous behavior. Every other page contains a perfect recollection of one sin after the other. Although the story claims that this unrelenting wickedness should be useful to deter other sinners, I find that the continuous stream practically drowns me with boredom. Eventually, I lose track of Moll's numerous husbands and her countless thieving exploits. Any time a reference is made to her past history, I am forced to flip through the pages to find the mentioned sin as I have gotten it confused with some other of a similar nature. By the end of the story, every adventure sounds the same and every man has the same amount of money. I would have liked to see more variety in these pages.I would not discourage another person from reading this book, however. I would gladly recommend it to those who love classical language, for I find Daniel Defoe was a great author for the words he could write, not necessarily for the stories he could create. The language is beautiful and enticing, for that alone I would recommend the book. Keep track of events and people while reading, though, because everything starts to sound the same after awhile."},{"Title":"Moll Flanders","review":"I particularly loved this book. I thought it was very cleverly written. I was able to get into the character's life situations and I always wanted to see what would happen to the woman next."},{"Title":"Moll Flanders","review":"Moll Flanders is a typical 18th Century book that one would read in a class about early English novels. Daniel Defoe's so-called \`masterpiece' gets labeled sometimes as one of the first novels ever written, and sometimes the prose shows. Written from the first-person perspective of the title character, MollFlanders tells the tale of a poor social low-life who has to turn to a life of crime after five failed marriages. Readers receive a rambling narrative of colorful characters that reside in the underbelly of 18th Century London. Moll Flanders was written originally as a sordid account that was to be taken as\`fact,' because of the way that Defoe mimicked the book after a popular form at the time that interviewed criminals on their deathbed. Defoe and his contemporaries used to compile these tales of redemption or non-repentance into what was called the Newgate Records. As the reader feels bad for Moll throughout the text, readers will see her go from a life of barely getting by to marrying her brother by accident to living a life of crimethrough her own agency. A sophisticated critique of the prison system and class economics of England, Defoe's work stands the test of time for fresh commentary and readability. While most people might find Defoe's writing style to be a bit antiquated, the story is not, and will most likely reach its intendedaudience. It's still true today that those criminals who become public examples are the ones from most of the lower castes, as are most criminals in general. The biggest question in Defoe's Moll Flanders still remains unanswered: How can one move up in a society that benefits those without any sort of inherited wealth or the means to further their position?"},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"+++++This book, as author Dr. Michio Kaku says, \\"is about a scientific revolution created by the theory of hyperspace, which states that dimensions exist beyond the commonly accepted four of space and time.\\" As a result, Kaku explores the world of geometry and space-time--that is, he explores the invisible universe.This book makes accessible to the general but intelligent reader the fascinating research on hyperspace theory.Scientifically, the hyperspace theory goes by other names such as Kaluza-Klein theory and supergravity. But in its most advanced form, it's called superstring theory. This theory predicts the precise number of dimensions: ten.This book, which has a main narrative of about 330 pages, is divided into four parts:Part one (four chapters) develops the early history of hyperspace (which began in the mid-1800s), emphasizing the theme that the laws of nature become simpler when expressed in higher dimensions. For example, in space-time, the laws of gravity and electromagnetic radiation (such as light) each obey a different physics and a different mathematics. However, if a fifth dimension is added to the space-time continuum, then the equations \\"governing light and gravity appear to merge together like two pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.\\"The main conclusion of this part is that space-time is inadequate or \\"too small\\" to describe the forces that shape our universe. When expressed in higher dimensions, however, there is \\"enough room\\" to explain these forces.The second part (five chapters) elaborates on part one's conclusion emphasizing that the hyperspace theory may be able to unify the four fundamental physical forces of nature (as well as their collection of subatomic particles) into one major theory (the so-called \\"Theory of Everything\\"), a unification that Einstein was unable to achieve.Hyperspace theory suggests the possibility that everything we see around us (such as trees, mountains, and stars) is nothing but vibrations. \\"If this is true, then this gives us an elegant, simple, and geometric means of providing a coherent and compelling description of the entire universe.\\"Part three (three chapters) explores the possibility that, under extreme circumstances, space may be stretched until it rips and tears. From this, we get the concept of \\"wormholes\\" or tunnels that link distant parts of space and time. Thus, time travel via time machines that exploit these tunnels may be possible.Cosmologists have proposed the possibility that our universe is only one among an infinite number of parallel universes. By analyzing Einstein's equations, they have shown that there might exist a web of wormholes that connect these universes.Although theoretical, hyperspace travel may eventually provide the most practical application of all: to save intelligent life, including ours, from the death of the universe by collapse. In the last seconds of our universe's death, intelligent life may escape this collapse by going into hyperspace.The last part (three chapters) concludes with a final, practical question: If hyperspace theory is proven to be correct, then when will we be able to harness its power? Answer: when our civilization develops the technical capability that enables us to harness the immense energy required for manipulating space-time or hope for contact with an advanced technical civilization that has already mastered hyperspace. (Included in this book is a good discussion on extraterrestrial civilizations.)In the meantime, we can calculate the precise energy needed to create a \\"time-warp\\" (where space and time are twisted into a \\"pretzel\\") or to create wormholes that link distant parts of our universe. This book ends by speculating on the level of technology that's needed for us to perform these feats, a technology that will make us \\"masters of hyperspace.\\"This is a history book, a storybook (that contains both true and hypothetical stories), a physics book, a mathematics book, and a book of scientific speculation. All physics and mathematics is explained by analogy and with good diagrams. This book as a whole is enjoyable to read but I found it necessary to slow down sometimes to grasp some major concepts.The only prerequisite needed to read this book, in my opinion, is the ability to visualize and to have an appreciation for the power of physics and mathematics.Finally, I recognize that some theories presented in this book have advanced since its 1994 publication but I feel that this book is an excellent starting point to become familiar with key concepts that are needed to understand more advanced topics.In conclusion, Kaku's final words in the book are as follows: \\"Some people seek meaning in life through personal gain, through personal relationships, or through personal experiences. However, it seems to me that being blessed with the intellect to [understand] the ultimate secrets of nature gives meaning in life.\\" This book exposes some of those \\"secrets of nature\\" and makes them understandable. Thus I urge you to go beyond space-time and experience the hyperspace odyssey.+++++"},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"Hyperspace by Michio Kaku is a very lucidly written account of the multidimensional approach to a unified field theory, of the possibility of parallel universes, of superstring theory of particle physics, and of the future of intelligent life and the fate of the universe. That's quite a feat in 334 pages, but he does a superb job of putting these complex concepts across for the non-math/physics types like myself. I had some difficulty getting through his discussion of superstring theory, of which he is one of the primary architects, but the other aspects of the text were more comprehensible. His style is very conversational, and he often calls upon his own experiences as a student, as a human being, and as a peer with others in the field to illustrate some aspects of his topics. The illustrations, though few, are clear and helpful. The bibliographical entries are a little old for a book written in 1994, many from the late 70s and early 80s. I've read some of the entries in the past and enjoyed most of them. They will definitely give one a thorough background in the recent history of physics and cosmology. I've put several of them on my wish list for later purchase.

After recently rereading it as a college student, I feel I have a much deeper understanding of the subject in general, and feel qualified to give a short review of this book. Much of the critical acclaim received by this book is, indeed warranted, for two main reasons: First, it provides an accessible route for the casual scientist to explore theoretical physics, an area in which I believe many books fall far short. Second, it reintroduces theories such as wormholes, higher dimensions, and superstrings to the public, and in doing so, creates more interest in the sciences. (e.g., more funding, etc..). This book will be a disappointment, however, for the person already well aquatinted with Hyperspace's subject matter. Bottom Line: A great primer for theoretical physics, suitable for anyone interested in exploring this area, but the seasoned reader/professional physicist will likely find this a very elementary, albeit entertaining read.

But the book lives up to its promise.Mr. Kaku is an absolutely terrific teacher. He writes in laymen's language and makes his topic not only understandable, but even fun. He uses the concept of Flatlanders to help us understand what our world would look like to one who is only able to perceive in two dimensions (and by extension, helping us to understand why our three-dimensional brains have so much trouble conceiving of four or more dimensions), and he gives a truly hilarious sketch of how wormholes in space may be formed by imagining what would happen if you heated an ice cube on your kitchen stove to 10 to the 32nd power K (at this point, Mr. Kaku advises, it may be advisable to leave the kitchen). The illustrations are not only fun, but really illumine the points he is making.Mr. Kaku not only knows how to explain his ideas in readily comprehensible terms, he gets you wanting to explore further.

This concept of force is as beatiful as profound. And it came so early as 1854 in a legendary lecture by Bernhard Riemann. In fact, the chapter on Riemann was a complete discovery to me. It was a revelation to know the place of Physics in the work of Riemann, whom I only knew from a mathematical perspective.I never knew of the large cultural influence of the Fourth Dimension after Riemann in general in late 19th Century Society (why?). The visual metaphors of Charles Hinton to illustrate a fourth spatial dimension (Hinton's Cubes), and the science fiction tales on hypercubes are simply delicious (if you've watched the \\"Cube\\" films, you must read these pages).Then after learning that a time-fourth dimension had already been put down by H.G. Wells in his \\"Time Machine\\" I was in full context to enter Einstein's Theory of General Relativity. The deep meaning of the equivalence principle (force=geometry) came naturally: Riemann the mathematician and Einstein the physicist coming together in a sort of inevitable, fated meeting. An ongoing fate that brought the fifth dimensional theory of Kaluza-Klein in the 20's, ending up recently in the Supergravity and Superstrings theories.It was a revelation too to behold the place of Quantum Physics in this \\"hyperspace living thread\\".

But I would not recommend this to anyone who actually studies string theory and higher dimensional subjects; this book exaggerated quite a few things that shouldn't have been focused on, and it read more like a story-book than a physics text. In other words, it's great if you don't plan on delving into the field very far, but if you're an aspiring student, I'd much rather have you read Feynman's lectures."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"I'm no expert on physics, so I have no idea what to say about this books. Having read Sagan's, Hawking's, and Feynman's \\"public consumption\\" pieces, I can say that Kaku has a flair for style and can communicate with the layman--as best as can be expected.In one of the funniest asides in the book, He told about the long equations he dealt with. They were so long, they had to use large sketch pads to write these equations on. And one equation would go on for several pages (149).But this highlight underscores the problem. Physics is expressed in numbers and equations, while this book is expressed in letters and paragraphs. There is a gap in the medium of communication. So I applaud efforts like these books to serve as a Rosetta Stone of sorts, expressing the same idea from numbers to words, and yet keeping integrity.Kaku also lets the cat out of the bag when he makes the point--several times--that there is no data for string theory (viii, 9, 48, 105, 106). The power to experiment on the theory is currently beyond us.So he has the math, and a lot of hopeful expectations, but no hard data. Therefore no falsifiability. So I think the book's weakest point is Chapter 8, where Kaku gives us a lot of rah-rah cheer-leading and a clever analogy. But no scientific data.This is not to say the theory is bad, but that, like in Scottish law, it is \\"not proven.\\"And there is another flaw, and I think for a professor with his resources, is inexcusable. He discussion of God in Chapter 9 leaves much to be desired.The facts:\\"Did God have a mother?\\" Evangelicals have a book that deals with this issue. Surprisingly enough, it's calledWho Made God?: And Answers to Over 100 Other Tough Questions of Faith. And let us not forget Mormonism's insight on this issue (The Truth, the Way, the Life: An Elementary Treatise on Theology (Byu Studies Monographs);The gospel through the ages)\\"What was going on before the first day of creation?\\" This is the same question as \\"What was going on before the Big Bang?\\"He quotes a poem attributed to Aquinas, but does not quote the Summa itself.Anselm's Ontological Proof. He asserts that Kant was \\"the first to isolate the error in the ontological proof.\\" However, Aquinas was also critical of Anselm's proof, which he explains early on in the Summa.Kaku explains that the cosmological proof is invalid because the First Law of Thermodynamics accounts for motion. However, Aquinas addressed this objection back in the 1200s. Also, the cosmological argument is about motion, in part, but also about the order, which cannot be accounted for by the Second and Third Laws of Thermodynamics.For a good summa of the Summa, I recommendA Shorter Summa: The Essential Philosophical Passages of Saint Thomas Aquinas' Summa Theologica. I'm not Catholic--indeed I am quite opposed to many things they believe and do. But we should honestly represent what they believe.I don't think that Kaku is intentionally misrepresenting Aquinas--or Christianity for that matter--but he falls into the common rut quoting secondary sources."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"I'm new to downlaoding books.

Arguably, the theories under discussion in this volume are outside the realm of science since they are at present, as they are likely to be into the far distant future, empirically unverifiable. Even so, as Kaku argues, science may yet uncover indirect evidence of wormholes, dimensions 5-10, and strings. Whether or not this proves true, one cannot help but be awed and delighted by the mere possibility that the universe -- fascinating already in its meager 4 dimensions -- is structured and functions in the ways MK describes. To see the mathematics of higher dimensions so neatly subsuming the laws of physics as we know them (electromagnetism, relativity, etc.), one cannot help but imagine that a beautiful and simple unified theory might indeed lie just round the bend. Hyperspace thrills with the excitement of that possibility. It is a terrific read."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"The book is a good introduction to hypersapce,parallel universes, supergravity, string theory and every other physics theory difficult to understand for the lay person.

I recommend it.

We keep adding dimensions! Newton started with three and we were in awe, but we understood. Einstein added a fourth and we were thunderstruck. We had to fight to overcome our intuition, but with determination we still understood. Then Kaluza and Klein added a fifth dimension and we scratched our heads. Intuition was less helpful and we started to lose the thread of understanding. Superstring theorists seem to have alighted on a final figure (I hope) of ten. This is way beyond the capacity of our brains to understand. So what do we do now?If you're the kind of person who lies awake at night wondering how it all works, this is a frustrating trend. You are never going to learn the advanced math, so you must search for books to help you understand. Some are better than others. This book is among the better ones, for a few reasons.First, Kaku is quick to point out that physicists who understand this stuff, understand the MATH, but are no better then we are at visualizing how the math is reflected in reality. I have come across a few writers in the genre who make this clear, and I always find it to be a relief. There is not some great truth that you are unable to grasp. The human brain is just not capable of perceiving hyper-dimensions. Don't worry.Second, this book focuses more on a colloquial explanation of the math than merely on its implications for reality. For me, this is an important link in understanding hyper-dimensional physics. Think of it this way. Phase I is &quot;Do the math&quot;. Phase II is &quot;Explain the math&quot;. Phase III is &quot;Explain what the math implies in the way reality is structured.&quot; Phase I is opaque to most of us, so writers of these kinds of books rightly discard it. However, most writers jump right into Phase III. I don't know about you, but when someone asks me to visualize a hypercube unfolding in four-dimensional space, my eyes start to water. Kaku is the first writer I have encountered that first seeks to explain how the mathematics developed and why they imply multi-dimensional space. Only then does he begin to explain the nature of a tesseract (a three-dimensional representation of a four-dimensional cube). I won't tell you I was suddenly able to visualize hyperspace, but I did have that &quot;a-ha&quot; experience of understanding why the concept matters to us.Finally, Kaku puts the mind-bending nature of modern physics in an important historical context, one that helps explain WHY it is so counter-intuitive. For years, experimental physics led the way. Theory developed through the explanation of actual observed phenomena. (For example, Einstein stumbled on special relativity by seeking to explain the photo-electric effect.) But Kaku points out that this trend has now reversed for two reasons. First, we stumbled on string theory much earlier than expected. It is a theory well ahead of it's time. Second, the amount of energy that must be generated to verify the theory experimentally is well beyond our technology. Therefore, we are entering an age when theory will have to lead experimentation by the nose, thus challenging a human intuition that does not yet have the experience to fit it all into the big jigsaw puzzle. Buckle up. It's going to be a bumpy ride.If you need to build the context to understand physics, this book is an excellent choice."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"In his book, Hyperspace, he duscusses time travel, parrellel universes, extra dimensions, and the list just keeps going.

Having watched Michio Kaku on TV, I was curious to read one of his books; hence picked this up.The one point I carried away from this book (which I have not seen mentioned elsewhere) is Kaku's assertion that the Physics is well-understood and all we are lacking is some \\"21st century Maths\\" to solve the equations that come up in String Theory (which is often described as a piece of 21st century Physics that just happened to be discovered in the 20th century)"},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"This book is more of a story than it is actual science.

My perspective on the universe and our place in it has been forced open to view a much bigger picture of existence. I never even heard of cosmology when I was that young, but after reading this book, I began devouring work by Thorne, Hawking, and other cosmologists and physicists. The concepts are solid and explained clearly with examples and that can be related. I don't think that this book is over anyone's head.

It blew me away back then, and it still does to this day. It was my first introduction to the notion of quantum mechanics, or higher dimensions, and it captured my imagination. I'm entering graduate school for physics next fall, as a result, in part, of reading this book over a decade ago.It is well written, and covers the history of quantum mechanics and relativity, the notion of higher dimensions and curved space (both culturally and scientifically), and then moves on to particle physics and string theory. You want it, this book has it: wormholes, time machines, fate of the universe, quantum mechanics, relativity, they're all there! Oh, and not to mention the fantastic style in which it is written. It is very understandable. If you have a bright youngster who seems enthralled with time travel, Einstein, black holes, or anything like that, I highly highly recommend this book. It could change their life! And if you are buying for yourself because of an interest in science, it is a fantastic introduction to the subject. If you are interested in learning more complex things, then I'd suggest checking out Brian Greene's books.I should also note that in my opinion this is the best book Michio Kaku has written for a popular audience.

However, after being assigned this book in a class on Physics and Quantum Philosophy, I was pleasantly surprised to find that Michio Kaku has clearly explained not only the basics of higher-dimensional physics, but also the ramifications of this information in an engaging and thought-provoking manner. Using realistic situations and very visual examples, this book is definitely a worthwhile read for those of us who are interested in the material but less than fully competent in the fundamantals, it takes you where you want to go and then some, but skips the dull stuff you may not care to know.

What the sages of yore proclaimed is just what scientists of today theorize: The physical universe is not what it appears to us through our five senses confined to the known dimensions of space-time continuum. At the microscopic and macroscopic level one encounters a state of incomprehensibility that later evokes a sense of awe and wonder, which as Einstein put it is the prime motivation behind all scientific discoveries. Both the devout scientist and the curious layman tread a very narrow path as they venture into the unknown where one need not always find the explicable counterpart of what is known. This is the juncture when the layman seeks a plausible explanation from the scientist who to a great extent is baffled by the immensity and diversity of creation fractionally revealed by science. From this perspective Dr.Michio Kakuo appears triumphant as he tries to explain in lucid terms the scientific reality, without much technical jargons, which is but a reflection of unified cosmic reality. But still, one should keep in mind that often the nature of physical reality with its increasing incomprehensibility points to the metaphysical realms of reality as well. Prof.Kakuo in his book surveys the major discoveries and developments in physics spread across the past 150 years right from Newton's theory of gravitation to the latest theories of Superstrings and Hyperspace. Kakuo's exposition of a multidimensional universe, which he limits to ten, makes even the lay reader think of imaginative possibilities one comes across in Richard Bach's novel \\"One\\", which in fact is inspired by the book \\"Many World Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics\\". He pays his homage to Srinavasa Ramanajum when he says the mathematics contained in the lost notebooks in essential to develop a mathematical framework to supplement the emerging new theories in physics. Riding on Einstein's equations he takes us on a sojourn through hyperspace and explores the startling possibilities of building a time machine. Any discussion on such topics will be incomplete without mentioning the mathematician Kurt Godel who school the foundations of mathematical logic with his monumental incompleteness theorm. In Hyperspace there is a detailed discussion on Godel that points to the limitations of logical thinking, much like the way a Zen koan eventually makes the aspirant realize the in effable nature of reality, when one tries to explain in scientific terms the mysteries of consciousness and insight. The inner universe is also as complex as the outer world, but it encompasses all. Hyperspace is one more step towards the understanding that the very nature of physical reality is metaphysical in essence and one understands the universe deeper in all its splendor at the experiential level than at the rational level...the borderline between Physics and Metaphysics is but a virtual division of the united whole..and the sum is more than the parts put together!"},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"This book suffers from so many flaws it should be taken as a compliment to Kaku that I finished it. First, the style, while enthusiastic, is a bit murky at times; this is not helped by the excessive length. Further, this is a cheesy popularization of physics in that it is more of a &quot;wow isn't physics weird&quot; than a cohesive explanation of physics in general.Worse, however, is the anecdotal quality of most of the book; an entire chapter is devoted to summarizing one of Asimov's books. Puh-lease! If you can't do better than that, Kaku, stop writing books like this. The worst part of the book is that little of it is actually an exposition about multi-dimensional approaches to physics; the beginning of the book has zero to do with physics, and the end has nothing to do with multi-dimensional physics and everything to do with social and political issues, science fiction speculation, and so forth.The -only- chapters of this book worth reading are the ones on superstring theory, which are too short and inadequate as they are. Certainly his brief surveys of QT and GR are completely worthless except to further confuse the reader. If he'd spent more time in this book on actual scientific theory and not gushing, I would've been impressed; but 340+ pages for this felt like a big waste of time and money. Sure, this is sour grapes, but I won't make the mistake of buying another of Kaku's books; borrow this from the library and read the chapters on superstring theory, but do nothing more.I am sure Kaku is a brilliant guy: he certainly makes it clear, in one of his many anecdotes, that he was no ordinary high schooler. I can only hope his other books, which I haven't read, are better than this one."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"We finally have a science non-fiction writer of our times, just like the 50's had Asimov, George Gamow, Clarke etc. Michio Kaku's books fall somewhere between books such as Tao of Physics and slightly drier reads such as those by Brian Greene and Hawking. There are no practical ways to imagine dimensions beyond three, but he comes up with so many fascinating analogies that you feel like you are tantalizingly close to understanding them. The thought examples of cylindrical spaces are extremely fascinating and the ramifications are so mind boggling that you can imagine twilight zones within twilight zones! Somewhere in between the book gets heavier, with mathematical descriptions of Strings and SuperStrings, but even among these pages you will find brief historical notes and anecdotes about Physicists and Mathematicians, that will lift your waning interests. But then the book emerges back into the layman's three dimensional world and the reading gets breezier with more descriptions of star life-cycles and black holes and worm holes.Overall, its a thoroughly enjoyable read for non-scientific folks and others for whom it may been a long while since they read a physics text book. I really wish such books had been available when I was in undergraduate and graduate schools. I would have probably appreciated the dry quantum physics math more."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"When the author wrote this book string theory was very \\"hot\\"... it has since cooled a lot.The main problem is that string theory is a limiting \\"scale\\".Physically and geometrically that seems to be just wrong.This book is somewhat better than the run of the mill Popularization or\\"dumbing down of physics\\", because he is faithful to history and names specific equations( mostly without giving them) like the modular functions of Ramanujan.I think the author could learn something about this kind of writing from Robert Kanigel ( biographer for Ramanujan).This author appears to be a pathological string field theory and superstring physicist in combo of 10 and 26 dimensions.But he by being faithful to his materials gives even more advanced readers Google searchable names and important papers.And unlike the Nobel prize winner Steven Weinberg , this author hasn't lost either hope or faith in the future or faith in humanityto solve impossible problems.

I strongly recommend this book for anyone with even a slight interest in the topic, whatever your background may be. For those who have no knowledge of the subject, Michio Kaku is an excellent and amusing teacher.

It is not the case. In a recent few years many honest physicists started thinking about reconstruction of Maxwell's electrodynamics.

The author is surprised that proofs for God have lasted so long, and claims than new discoveries concerning the laws of physics and biology change this. But it is apparent the author has abandoned logic and good science to appease his own personal beliefs.The author claims that the equivalence of matter and energy (e=mc2) proves no need for a creator, or first mover. Has he forgotton entropy? Molecules may move forever, but they cannot exist forever, energy would have so long ago disapated that life would not exist. How can one believe in the Big Bang, the creation of all that is, and still say energy and matter have no beginning?Furthmore, both science and logic dictate that something outside of the uninverse, independent of it, started it off. Apparantly the author has also ignored the overwhelming evidence for design in the universe, unatainable by chance.Despite claiming &quot;laws&quot; disprove God, the author appeals to the &quot;theory&quot; of evolution claming it proves complex life can come from primitive ones. Very few will claim that they know this is possible, logic is against it and science doesn't support it. The author even invokes the famous Miller experiment that tried to show how life could have formed spontaneously on early Earth. Only problem with this is that the Miller experiment has been discredited as being an unrealistic depiction of early Earth's atmosphere.Physics requires something independent of the universe to have started it off.

Nothing else.If someone have had some the smallest indication that there is at least one extra dimension, I would look at these virtual ideas as at something more sound. Meanwhile we should develop a more realistic approach affin with everyday reality. Unfortunately, some of advanced modern theories predict the possibility of extradimensions. It is worse for that theories and, of course, it makes us think that something might be wrong with the previous theories (Maxwell's, Einstein's etc). I do not say everything should wrong because of visible success of that theories in explaining most known phenomena. But we do not know if the explanation is the best one or if something lacks. Without that knowledge we should not develop so abstract mathematical theories, because the may have nothing common with the reality.

Kaku and other &quot;leading physicists&quot; working in other dimensions are so blind with their own ideas that do not even admit the possibility that their &quot;scientific work&quot; is only isotheric game. It is most likely lead to nothing but he is pushing to follow his (very possibly wrong treck), descarding other important alternatives. What about his words that the modern string theory is more the faith than science? I agree because its verification is so far from allmodern experimental facilities. It is a curious mathematical game but nothing else.If Kaku and other &quot;leading field physicists&quot; knew that there several recent indications about incompleteness and inconsistency of classical Maxwell's electromagnetic theory than they would have a bit doubt on the completeness and overall correctness of Einsteins's relativity based exlusively on Maxwell's electrodynamics.First of all, physics should have very sound consistent fundamental ground and after that go further. It is not the case. In a recent few years many honest physicists started thinking about reconstruction of Maxwell's electrodynamics. It just lead to the conclussion that there is something wrong with the notion of local field. It should be modified on its bases. Someone who does not believe that we can be on partially wrong track since Maxwell, can follow Kaku's and other string physicists and eventually lost their life for nothing..."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"Mr. Kaku would say that this is a fundamental fact resulting from his mathematical construction. Nothing else.If someone have had some the smallest indication that there is at least one extra dimension, I would look at these virtual ideas as at something more sound. Meanwhile we should develop a more realistic approach affin with everyday reality. Unfortunately, some of advanced modern theories predict the possibility of extradimensions. It is worse for that theories and, of course, it makes us think that something might be wrong with the previous theories (Maxwell's, Einstein's etc). I do not say everything should wrong because of visible success of that theories in explaining most known phenomena. But we do not know if the explanation is the best one or if something lacks. Without that knowledge we should not develop so abstract mathematical theories, because the may have nothing common with the reality. Extra dimensions looks like a typical example of this absurd extrapolation of not fully confirmed modern theories.It is better forget about Kaku and his extravagant ideas and come back to the REAL WORLD. It would be much more fruitful for our Civilization."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"never received book, never received refund as promised.

The lecture and the book were mesmerising. The book is worth reading again and again. I just finished reading it a few weeks ago and thought it worthwhile to make a brief comment.Kaku diligently takes the layman through the odyssey of time and space and explains complicated theories in simple terms. Did you know that all of us have heard about the theory of Hyperspace? Read Alice in Wonderland, read Hyperspace, and then read Alice in Wonderland again.The concept of multi-dimensions to a 3D audience has been simply explained by Kaku and, like Richard Dawkins, makes the reader feel intelligent! What used to belong in the realm of science fiction is now being accepted as a plausible theory on the evolution and end of our universe. It is a shame that we won't live long enough to see if Superstring/Hyperspace theories are proven to be true or not!I do like Kaku's debate into various philosophers and their ideas about the universe and their concepts of God. I also liked his slight digression into the classifications of possible intergalactic civilisations into 3 types depending on the advancement of technologies and management of their solar resources. These are worthwhile digressions which support the main body of the book, which is a multidimensional universe.If you are a Star Trek fan or interested in Astronomy or you are just plain interested in our universe, this book is for you. I can't wait to get hold of Kaku's newer books!"},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"I may seem a litle young for this type of book, but even though it contained some equasions (which in \\"A Brief History of Time\\" Hawking stayed away from) it was well put and should be easy to understand by anyone who has some general knowledge of the general and special theories of relativity and some quantum physics too. I am not a braniac kid or anything, I get by and like to desighn things. Theoretical Physics Isn't exactly the hardest thing to comprehend (I think understanding our own mind probably is) and this is a good book to get. There are good descriptions and graphic illustrations (no this is not a kid's book) make this easy to understand by the layman. It tells of Superstrings (now known as the M-theory) and Worm holes. It also describes how we must evolve in the tree types of civilizationary stages, and includes many stoies and anecdotes all in all this was a good book"},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"I am a big fan of Michio Kaku. We see him everywhere now in the tradition of Carl Sagan, while TV documentaries flourish on cable.Hyperspace was my first exposure to Haku. He's an extremely readable science writer.

In fact until writers like Michael Behe, Heinz Pagels and Michio Kaku came along science was totally unapproachable for me. For a writer to take such incredibly complex information and present it, not only clearly and understandibly, but also enjoyably, one has to be uniquely gifted. Kaku and Behe can do this and remain my favorites. It's been years since I read this and to this day I can't forget it. So, here's my point. If you, like me, long to understand fascinating ideas that have always seemed incomprehensible, let Michio Kaku help you out. Get this one."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"This book was written ten years ago but it still holds up well. Michio Kaku examines the theories of multi-dimensional space in an entertaining and educational book. His explanations are so clear that 10-dimensional space actually made sense. The book is somewhat a rambling adventure. Kaku takes us on a tour, introducing us to an interesting cast of characters including the sad story of Georg Bernhard Riemann who developed key equations for analyzing multi-dimensional space in the 1800's. The tour differs from a typical physics book in that instead of giving us the basic lecture of the advance of physics, Kaku approaches everything from a slightly different angle. In trying to help us understand multi-dimensional space, he looks not just at science but in art and literature. To emphasize a point he might explain it using something from his own career or from a science fiction story. The main problem with the book is that the author does tend to get off topic and ramble at certain points in the book. Stories about what an intelligent culture might do as the Universe ends doesn't really fit into the flow of the book and since we really have no idea how the Universe will end, it all seemed a bit pointless. I started to get the idea that Kaku had a number of pages in mind and was trying to fill the book with a lot of different ideas he has had floating around to reach that number. But don't let me scare you away. At least two-thirds of this book is brilliant writing that will make you think, help you understand modern theories of physics, and entertain you. I can forgive the author's ramblings when he provides that much in a few hundred pages."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"This book may be a tad difficult for many readers but If you keep working with it, it will change the way you see your world, it will open new views on the universe and how things work. If your at all interested in science or space travel even this is a great book to get. Michio Kaku is a wonderful writer and he shows this well in Hyperspace."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"This is an amazing book. Kaku, a physicist at Princeton, has written one of the best surveys of what modern scientists and mathematicians are struggling with - namely resolving the paradox of reconciling quantum mechanics with Einstein's theory of gravity to come to the Theory of Everything, which would explain our universe from its beginning to its eventual end. Kaku writes that in mathematics and theory, it is simpler and more elegant to come at such a theory when dealing with higher dimensions, and thereby introduces ideas such as superstring theory, which works strangely enough, in only 10 and 26 dimensions. Although Kaku deals with the fascinating ideas of parallel worlds, time travel and etc., he examines and approaches these ideas not with a feverish enthusiasm of a sci-fi hack, but with a sober scientific analysis; he quickly puts down many of these sci-fi ideas on scientific grounds while proposing a tantalizing possibility of existence of others.It's not these ideas themselves but Kaku's presentation of them that deserves merit. These ideas have been written about before by other writer/scientists, but never have all the ideas been so convincingly unified and energetically explained for all people. I have no background in science, and found this book fascinating to read for its ideas and passion. There are humorous biographical and autobiographical anecdotes. Many of the concepts are illustrated (albeit a bit poorly), and Kaku does an excellent job of giving us examples for visualization of a concept that he wants to get across.This is an excellent book that serves as an important introduction to one of the central inquiries of modern physics - finding a unified theory to explain the nature of the universe itself."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"This was the first book I'd ever bought on Hyperspace, and it was great.

Moreso it didn't present itself in a confusing manner."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"Art Bell interviewed eminent physicist Dr. Michio Kaku on his night time talk show Coast to Coast AM (still on the air but hosted by George Noory). He explained theories of the universe in a rational manner which made complex theories come alive in this listener's imagination. He provided descriptions that were palatable to a lay audience. He even entertained answering questions on the air. This taste led me to buy the book. Mankind has contemplated his or her place in the cosmos and exploring \\"what lies beyond \\" or \\"how the universe functions\\" since time immemorial. This book provides explanations to enhance the understanding many people seek ...The most fascinating and intriguing concept in the book refers tothe ten dimensions of hyperspace. Basic explanations are given for the strong force, weak force, gravitational force, electromagnetic force but the magic in this book lies in the descriptions of the quest for \\"unified theory\\" which will explain the operation of the universe in one single equation to the satisfaction of every theorist. The new geometry first conceived by George Bernard Reimann in 1854 was the most important mathematical conceptual discovery heading toward solving this puzzle. This mathematician first revealed an equation for the fourth dimension. This revolutionary equation created the geometric patterns possible to explain the existence of higher dimensions in the universe. Space travel, multiple dimensions, parallel universes, superstring theory, black holes, time warps, and paradoxes are described with lucidity in this book. The \\"Big Bang\\" theory is compared to the Biblical explanation. Anyone who has been mesmerized by viewing stars at night and wondered what lies beyond, will benefit from reading this book. The book is now over 10 years old but holds valuable ideas for readers interested in this complex subject. Other recommended books are \\"The Tao of Physics\\" by Fritjof Capra and \\"Dancing of the Wu Li Masters\\" by Gary Zukov. After listening to Dr. Michio Kaku I was hooked on learning more theories which explain the universe. His book is a great start on this quest.

Taking up to an extent where Stephen Hawking left off, Kaku builds on the idea first introduced in &quot;A Brief History of Time&quot; and takes your understanding of Hyperspace and wormholes, etc . . . to a whole other level. This is definately not a beginners book, unless you're really intuitive about this kind of thing. It's better than some of Kip Thorne's bulkier works. The best thing of all, is that Kaku makes you understand everything he's talking about without using one single fancy-schmancy mathmatical equation that you'd have no idea of ever understanding. There are a few in the back for furthur referencing . . . I think it's a metric tensor, but I'm not sure. Easily, one of the greatest and most inspiring book s I've ever read.

It expanded my consciousness to an explosion that created and/or activated a new way of thinking, dreaming, and changed my entire being. (bowing to Mr.Michio Kaku), to have this effect on people. With the super intense subject manor, it's amazing how he put it in simple terms that the lay people can comprehend. The examples, stories, and excerpts from other books were put together very cleverly. I can not say enough about this book and it's author. This book puts a new classification in the words &quot;theoretical physics&quot;. I had no idea that I and others would be effected in this way. A total life change from just one book. &quot;Hyperspace : A Scientific Odyssey Through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension&quot; is a must!

Although this isn't up to date on the latest developments in strings and M theory, the reader isn't likely to be looking for the latest technical findings and conjecture. If what you're seeking is an interesting and absorbing account of this intriguing but untested field, then this is probably the first book you should read on the subject. What makes string theory so fascinating is that it is following the same sequence as previous breakthroughs in physics: a concept is thought out, found to be mathematically consistent, a model is developed, and finally, testing confirms the model. String theory (M theory) has progresssed to the model stage, but we currently lack the technical means to test that model. But the fact that the numbers are in agreement makes it look promising.Don't be concerned about the math, though. The book mentions some mathematicians and their contributions, but the reader isn't required to get out his pocket calculator to follow along. The book is 99% fact and science, in popular form, and about 1% interesting speculation on what the model implies, if it's accurate. And those implications are stunning: parallel universes, possibly infinite in number, with every conceivable permutation of reality, and many more beyond our comprehension."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"When I bought this book, I expected to read a book that focused on cosmology, quantum theory, relativity, and the like.

Kaku covers cosmology, quantum theory, superstring theory, relativity, mathematics, the extinction of the dinosaurs, wormholes and blackholes, time travel, numerous scientific and mathematical achievements and achievers, and a plethora of related (and, sometimes, seemingly unrelated) topics! This book is written in terms even readers with a very basic, fundamental knowledge of math and science can understand.

It's not so much a \\"scientific odyssey\\" as an oversimplified summary--often obnoxiously so, for the benefit of the bookstore shopper reader--of some break-out topics in theoretical physics. Since it was written 15 years ago, there's much more to be said about some of the things he leaves hanging as 'mysteries'. Additionally, the last few chapters--while presenting some novel concepts--are purely speculative ('The Fate of the Universe') and seem a bit like filler material, or Kaku was feeling the spirit of some of Carl Sagan's works dedicated to such topics.Kaku himself is a brilliant individual; his ideas and writing are beyond solid. I'm very excited to read his more recent work.I'd recommend Brian Greene's \\"The Fabric of the Cosmos,\\" as it covers nearly the same ground with considerably more detail.

In a parallel universe, you might be drinking expensive champagne on your yacht and talking shop with Donald Trump.So, your wife ran off with your brother and took the truck and the dog to boot. Take heart. One universe over, the shrew is serving you drinks and vacuuming floors in your palatial estate. Your dog watches over your fleet of trucks and your brother is in prison.So, the Red Sox finally win a World Series after 86 years of heartbreak. It's been year after year of thwarted hopes, for as long as you can remember. But somewhere in the multiverse, the Sox have won so many championships, it's sickening.Every possible outcome. Those horrible mistakes you made here never happened there. You ate right, exercised and took vitamins every day in some other universe. You are buff and not ashamed to take your shirt off on the beach in another dimension.The multiverse has its privileges. And it is scientists who claim it as fact, not tabloid writers drunk on cheap wine. To account for errors in the math of quantum physics, some say the existence of multiple universes is the only possible solution.Before you go scoffing and stuffing this review into the bird cage, think about the possibilities. You can eat ice cream all you want because in another universe, you do ab crunches every day. You can tell your boss off right now because in the other world, you are independently wealthy.Personally, I feel liberated. I'm going out to buy a boat and some cool cars because I can probably afford it one or two dimensions over. If that money-grubbing Mark LaFlamme in the next universe isn't good for a loan, who is?Really, man, it's time to relax. String theory dictates that our time here is really not that important. We're just an insignificant speck in an infinitesimal bubble in the froth of a sea of universes. Stop hollering and worrying all the time. Chill out and let some other you do all the heavy lifting. This applies especially to politicians and city leaders.Few scientists can write with the clarity and enthusiasm that Kaku achieves every time. Read him or watch in on countless science specials on TV, and you start thinking about these possibilities in a real world way. Kaku is a brilliant man and one who loves to share his knowledge and theories. Kaku may be formulating the theory of everything this very moment.I'm getting carried away. I know I am.

The reader is then thrown into discussions of the complications and repercussions of humans harnessing or even understanding the results of these theories. Much of this book is spent introducing new theories, proving them, and then proving that there is actually no experimental proof to prove these concepts right or wrong at this time. Before the reader is even given time to fully grasp the intricacies of these new theories, the author throws more questions at the reader, possibly causing more confusion than was present before the theories, these so-called \`answers', were even posed.Constantly in this book, the author tries to show that the laws of nature are unified, and therefore simplified, in higher dimensions. At the beginning, it's hard for the reader to comprehend this statement, or even its relevance. However, throughout the book, as the reader learns the basics of Einstein's theory of gravity, Maxwell's theory of electromagnetic forces, the Yang-Mills field that describes weak and strong forces between electrons, and quantum physics, a vague understanding of this unification begins to materialize. After the reader understands these basics, it is more easily understandable how these topics relate to the universe as a whole, our galaxy, the fate of humans and the universe, the theoretical possibilities of time travel through wormholes, and numerous other interesting thoughts. Given the right amount of patience, the reader leaves this book with a slightly better understanding of the laws of nature, and more informative and stimulating questions about the creation of the universe and the fate of humanity."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"I wish that he had gone more into depth explaining strings, but that is not the kind of book it is. it is an overview on higher dimentions. but it is definitally fun to read. once you hear the story about him and his parents, a football feild, and 30 miles of wire... you will be on the floor."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"I'm a fan of science but never took &quot;real&quot; physics in college.

This is the trade-off you get for having an easy-to-read format. There have been some bad reviews about this book, mainly because it really doesn't teach the reader much about the subject matter. If you are really wanting to learn in depth the ideas presented in this book, then I wouldn't suggest reading it.

I found it delightful and intriguing."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"For a theoretical physicist, Professor Michio Kaku possesses the rare skill of being able to distil complex ideas down to basics to help the layman unschooled in Riemann's metric tensor, general relativity, quantum and Kaluza-Klein theories to understand how leading-edge physics is exploring new models of what we call reality. He is also, as we all know, something of a media star who in the past 20 years has carved out a strong brand as the enthusiastic expert face of advanced physics on TV - a position previously occupied by the late Carl Sagan. His high public profile almost certainly boosts sales of his books and lends greater credibility to their content in the eyes of the reader mainly uninformed on this subject matter.In 334 pages of intelligent and densely written narrative, the long-haired Prof explains with refreshing lucidity how physicists have grappled with mathematical and experimental models to understand the laws of nature, the effort to unite the four known universal forces (electro-magnetism, gravity, the strong and weak nuclear forces) under one symmetry, how the revolutionary breakthrough of superstring theory by postulating the 10- and 26-dimensional universe might (though the theory cannot currently be experimentally verified) finally achieve this; and the resultant implications for the existence of hyperspace, wormholes to other dimensions and time travel - which he demonstrates as theoretically possible despite the paradoxes. The fundamental thesis of the book is to demonstrate to the lay reader how complex and seemingly contradictory phenomena (like quantum and relativity theories) simplify and unify in higher dimensions - a difficult idea to deal with for lesser mortals but Kaku succeeds to an admirable degree. He even discourses on God, the existence of whom has often been debated in high-level physics not as a theological abstract or personal belief, but as a necessary initiator of a universal order otherwise unexplainable - the \\"God of Order\\", not the \\"God of Miracles\\".Kaku has a highly literate and engaging writing style and uses analogy, anecdote, clever drawings and cartoons to get his points across. For example, our brains operate in three-dimensional space so can not easily conceptualise life in four or five dimensions. In order to illustrate the concept he employs the analogy of flatlanders in a two-dimensional world and how a three-dimensional object might appear to them - i.e. they would only be able to perceive a flat cross-section at a time and could have no concept of what the whole thing might look like, as their world-view cannot conceive of \\"up\\" or \\"down.\\" So it is for us, in trying to visualise space containing more than three dimensions.The author gives us brief bios of many mathematicians and physicists who have made major contributions to understanding the universe over the past 200 years or so, knows his geopolitical history and seems to have also read a fair amount of science fiction (the thoughtful kind from authors like Asimov, Heinlein and Clarke). He uses many of these stories to illustrate the advanced concepts he is trying to explain. Discussing quantum theory, Kaku writes: \\"Nobody knows how it can be like that...of all theories proposed in the 20th century, the silliest and most absurd is quantum theory. The only thing quantum theory has going for it is that it is unquestionably correct, and invariably confirmed by experiment.\\" Relating Einstein's objections to quantum theory in a conversation with Niels Bohr, Bohr is alleged to have exclaimed to Einstein in frustration: \\"You are not thinking! You are merely being logical!\\"In later chapters, Kaku discourses on the concept of type one, two and three civilizations. The first step in ensuring long-term survival and graduating to a type one civilization, according to Kaku, is a unitary planetary government without which any civilization will soon (i.e. within a few thousand years) probably perish from inability to effectively manage the risks of potential nuclear self-annihilation, environmental degradation or cosmic cataclysm such as asteroid impact, which are known to have initiated periodic mass species-extinctions in the planet's history. He also extrapolates theories of how the universe will end and if it might be possible to escape to other parallel universes.Kaku's books are targeted at the reader with an average to higher level of formal education in a subject other than mathematics or physics. Despite simplified explanations, a reader with high-school-level education completely unfamiliar with any concepts of advanced physics might struggle: there is a lot of information to absorb, the book is densely written and these ideas can only be simplified so far. At the other end of the scale, a post-graduate student of particle physics or astronomy will probably find little of interest here; the book is not for them. It's pitched to the curious, intelligent but non-specialist middle-ground, the popular centre: as such, it's a notable achievement in that it simultaneously educates, makes you think in new ways, and entertains.\\"Hyperspace\\" was written in the mid-1990s and the debate in physics has moved on in recent years.

As a lover of knowledge with a humanities/classics background (and therefore lacking an advanced mathematics and physics academic foundation) this book was paradigm shifting for me and the portal to ongoing explorations in the magical world of quantum physics and string theory. I absolutely loved this book. Its delivery - witty, engaging and easy to follow - and most of all its content. Understanding the concept of a multidimensional universe, and of matter as energy vibrating at high frequency opened my mind to an understanding of our world that I had been seeking out for a long time.Stefania LucchettiAuthor of \\"The Principle of Relevance\\"The Principle of Relevance"},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"This book is an attempt to put some really complicated physics into layman's terms. The book covers the history of scientific thought and discovery as it relates to the four dimensions we live in (three spatial, one temporal) as well as the other six that some physicists believe complete our universe. What was amazing to me was that although the title sounds like the stuff of sci-fi, the topic actually encapsulates all physical sciences, from chemistry to astronomy. This is because the theory of ten dimensions is a result of the quest to find one theory that explains all forces in the known universe (other theories, such as Einstein's theory of relativity, explain certain forces but break down for others). Although I felt in over my head at a couple points, the author does a good job of simplifying everything and explaining the math without using much math. The book is full of helpful and entertaining diagrams (my favorite is the one of Einstein staring wide-eyed through a wormhole at a Tyrannosaurus Rex). And although the book wanders off topic from time to time (like the tangent on how the universe will end and how the human race might carry on after our sun burns out), even these digressions are fascinating, if not completely relevant.

One gets such wholesale returns of conjecture out of such a trifling investment of fact. Mark Twain--Life on the MississippiThis is a lovely book full of fascinating info on the evolution of physics and cosmology. Its main theme is how the idea of higher dimensional geometry created by Riemann, recently extended to 24 dimensions by string theory, has revolutionized our understanding of the universe.Everyone knows that Riemann created multidimensional geometry in 1854 but it is amazing to learn that he also was a physicist who believed that it held the key to explaining the fundamental laws of physics. Maxwell's equations did not exist then and Riemann's untimely death at age 39 prevented his pursuit of these ideas. Both heand his British translator Clifford believed that magnetic and electric fields resulted from the bending of space in the 4th dimension--more than 50 years beforeEinstein! The fourth dimension became a standard subject in the popular media for the next 50 years with several stories by HG Wells using it and even Lenin wrote about it. The American mathematician Hinton had widely publicized his idea that light is a vibration in the 4th spatial dimension.Amazingly, physicists and most mathematicians forgot about it and when Einstein was looking for the math needed to encompass general relativity 60 years later, he had never heard of Riemannian geometry. He spent 3 years trying to find the equations for general relativity and only after a math friend told him about Riemann was he able to complete his work. Riemann's equations with four dimensional metric tensors describing every point in space were incorporated almost unchanged into relativity.String theory can be said to date from 1919 when an obscure mathematician named Kaluza added the ten components of Einstein\`s gravitational field with the 4 components of Maxwell's electromagnetic fields and time to get the 15 components of a 5 dimensional field. He even produced the idea that the 5th spatial dimension is a sphere smaller than an atom (ie, too small to be measured)--which remains a fundamental idea in string theory's 10 dimensions.In 1936 the mathematician Oscar Klein postulated that the 5th dimension has the Planck length(10 to minus 33cm) which is indeed far too small to measure by any forseeable means(it requires an accelerator of 10 to 19th BEV) and this, with the arrival in 1925 of quantum theory and the uncertainty principle pushed the geometry based Kaluza-Klein and, to some extent, even relativity theory into the background for nearly 60 years.In quantum theory, the different forces are created by the exchange of different quanta and no geometry is used. This led to the Yang-Mills field, QED, QCD and the Standard Model of particle physics which is: all matter is quarks and leptons which interact by the exchange of different types of quanta as described by the Maxwell and Yang-Mills equations.Veneziano and Suzuki discovered the basis for string theory in 1968 when they used Euler's beta functions to describe the strong interactions of subatomic particles. In 1970 two Japanese scientists used the idea of vibrating strings to exapand on it. It is now halfway through the book andKaku describes how he invented the first field theory of strings. Then it was shown that string theory is self consistent only in 10 and 26 dimensions and research nearly stopped for 10 years.Then in 1984 Green and Schwarz showed that super string theory was the only self consistent theory of quantum gravity. Edward Witten became interested in the higher dimension geometric equations in physics in 1982 when he realized that gravity was impossible in quantum field theory but inevitable in the 5th dimension. In 1985 he used the highly advanced math of cohomology theory to derive a field theory of strings. This led eventually to the use of some of the most advanced(and previously unrelated) fields of math known to describe the 26 dimensional space of counterclockwise vibrations of heterotic string theory and in some sense, the explanation of everything.Then things stalled again because millions of potential solutions to the equations are known, but which one describes only our universe; ie, which one gives the correct field theory of strings(FTS) defined in our 4 dimensions? Nobody knows how to solve the equation using nonperturbative methods and it is often stated that we need more advanced math, ie, math that does not yet exist. Almost everything known in particle physics has used perturbative methods.One of the major problems is that nobody knows why string theory works--ie, what is the underlying geometric or physical principle that makes it relevant and allows all of physics to be incorporated into the 10(when condensed) dimensions of string theory? It is the only quantum theory that requires a fixed number of dimensions. Another bizarre result is that it has to use the modular functions invented some 60 years before by the self taught Indian math prodigy Ramanujan, who as a teenager reinvented much of modern math in his head. One of his bizarre modular functions contains a term raised to the 24th power and this is exactly the number of vibrational modes needed(24 plus 2 for spacetime or generalized in the FTS it's 8 plus 2 or 10). The symmetries of the subatomic realm(ie, particles) become the result of the curling up of the higher dimensional spaces.Meanwhile, the standard model of physics was evolving but it has even more arbitrary assumptions than the inflationary theory of the big bang(Kaku says little about inflation but see my review of Guth's book The Inflationary Universe). So GUTs(Grand Unified Theories) appeared and faded to be supplanted by supersymmetry(based on bizarre supernumbers) which integrated fermions and bosons with their spins. This led(1976) to the lovely gauge theory of supergravity in which all particles have superpartners(sparticles).Using an 11 dimensional version of the Klein-Kaluza theory to describe the 11 dimensional supergravity field allows the incorporation of matter(ie, quarks and leptons). But sparticles were never found and supergravity turned out to be nonrenormalizable(ie, it led to infinities) so SG died.Then came hypersurfaces described by complex numbers, on which the wave functions of the particles vibrate, thus acquiring the symmetries of the hyperspheres. So if you then apply the Kaluza-Klein theory for 4 plus N dimensions and split up its metric tensor you get everything--the Einstein equations for gravity, the Yang-Mills equations for strong and weak forces, and the Maxwell equations for the electromagnetic fields.Amazingly, it turns out that not only had Klein described the Yang-Mills field in 1938(25 years before Yang and Mills--and they got the Nobel Prize for it!) but Y-M is now based on quantum theory which had killed interest inKaluza-Klein for almost 60 years!!!This brings us back to Edward Witten(whom some regard as the successor to Einstein) and superstring theory, in which matter is now the harmony of extremely small vibrating strings which can fuse and break up. It accounts foralmost everything and is the first quantum theory of gravity with finite quantumcorrections. In spite of its highly abstract nature, lack of any experimentally verifiable predictions, lack of a unique solution for our universe-it has millions of solutions(orbifolds), many(all?) of which could have properties that might make our universe impossible- and any rational explanation for why it works(ie no conceptual framework uniting gravity and quantum theory), it has a compelling, almost religious appeal for many physicists because, starting only from geometry and the condition that strings move self consistently in spacetime we get magnetism, electricity, spacetime, general relativity, Klein-Kaluza, supergravity, the standard model and the Grand Unified Theory--it binds matter, energy and spacetime. String theory does not however, predict or explain the properties of particles nor the paradoxes of quantum mechanics, uncertainty and entanglement(Bell's theorem).Though I don't think Kaku says this anywhere, it is so general and so powerful that one gets the feeling that it could explain anything in any possible universe and in that case it does not really explain anything at all--it becomes the mathematical equivalent of \`God made it that way\`. So, it may eventually begin to lose its appeal as a final explanation(as it has for many physicists).So, we still can ask the same question as Kaluza in 1919--where is the 5th dimension?--and still pursue the same answer given by Klein in 1926.Quantum theory and quantum tunneling explain the apparent violation of the conservation of energy shown by radioactive decay. It might explain the sudden appearance of a 4 and a 6 D universe from a 10D one. Because the false vacuum of a 10D universe was unstable we assume, but cannot prove, that it quantum tunneled to a lower energy state, breaking symmetry and creating a true vacuum in 4D space. But if it is not the true vacuum then one day a small bubble may appear and enlarge at the speed of light until it destroys our universe. Our 4D universe can curl up in 4 ways but a 10D one can curl up in millions of ways. So, to find the right one, we need to solve the field theory of strings using the theory of phase transitions--the most difficult problem in quantum theory.In 1994 the heterotic string theory of David Gross(one of the four Princeton physicists known as the Princeton string quartet)showed that the quantum unit of gravity emerges as the smallest vibration of a closed string.Since the laws of physics break down at the very small distances and large energies of the big bang, we need a string theory with 10 dimensions that breaks into 6 plus 4 to create twin universes of which the 6 is an orbifold too small to observe. Kaku says that only 10D superstring theory can explain what happens before the big bang but of course Valenkin and Hawking and others have alternatives. (see my review of Guth).Even in the string theory of the big bang, a small piece of the universe must inflate by a factor of 10 to the 50th, so apparently all of inflation is included. It has been frequently theorized that black holes may be tunnels in spacetime to other universes. But it appears we don't know if black holes really pinch off hyperspheres of spacetime in which light is trapped.Along with its untestability and lack of any conceptual foundation, a further problem is that the math is so generalthat it has millions of solutions(orbifolds) which include all of physics(General relativity, Grand Unified Theories etc) and there is no way to decide which one of them describes our universe. Some(or all?) of the solutions have properties that might make life, or even our universe, impossible.One cannot simply put a computer to work to decide which solution is right for our universe for the same reasons one cannot solve quantum tunneling etc.--infinite time is required.Though neither Kaku nor anyone else I have read has said so, it seems that the math of 26 D geometry is so powerful that it could describe any possible universe. In this case it is understandable why it lacks a conceptual foundation as it has no special relation to our universe. Anything expressible as an algorithm or number can be derived from anything else by writing the appropriate algorithm or codec, so the rules of chess, Avogadro's number, the dimensions of the great pyramid and the dynamics of ant colonies are deriveable too.One of the things that makes many think math is out there in the universe rather than in here in our minds. Naively, one could say that the structure of the universe makes our mind so is it a surprise that our thoughts(eg, mathematics) mirror the universe? The debate continues today.The compelling way in which pure math yields physical results is illustrated by the discovery of a mathematician who was just looking for another solution to the equations of general relativity. By assuming a black hole rotates, Roy Kern in 1963 found a solution and thus an exact representation of black holes. They will collapse into a ring so that objects approaching from the top or bottom will experience a finite curvature(gravity) so it might be able to get to the mirror universe which exists on the &ograve;ther side\`of spacetime. But, at this density of mass-energy, general relativity breaks down and quantum effects probably dominate so maybe we can find an answer with string theory. Likewise with time travel.By making various assumptions about the universe one can come up with many different solutions to relativity. In 1949 Godel(he of Incompleteness Theorem fame) showed that if one assumes the universe rotates, time can bend in a circle or CTC(Closed Timelike Circle). It turns out that van Stockum had derived a CTC solution in 1936(pointed out by cosmologist Frank Tipler who recently became infamous for his book proving the existence of God from physics) and many have done so since Godel, usually using black holes or an expanding universe. It is now realized that there are an infinite number of such \`pathological\` solutions to the equations of general relativity. It appears that all CTC will violate causality.As one of the principal founders of quantum cosmology, Hawking proposed that wormholes could be used to enter other universes. Ever daring, he used quantum theory to treat the entire universe as a quantum particle represented by a wave function which will be large for our universe but small for others.Assuming they are connected by wormholes, Sidney Coleman summed the contributions of an infinite series of universes, to show that if the cosmological constant(CC) is zero then the wave functionis large(ie, high probability). If the CC is not zero, then that universe has zero probability(ie,the effect of an infinite number of parallel universes is tokeep CC zero in ours), which means the CC cancels to one part in 10 tothe100th!Acting on a request from Carl Sagan, Thorne et al(1985) discovered \`transversible wormholes\` --the first ones thatwere actually feasible in the sense that a human might actuallysurvive using them.It seems theoretically possible to create one using the negative energy(ie, less than in a vacuum) of the Casimir effect(a quantumeffect thought to occur everywhere all the time) in which particle-antiparticle pairs appear and self annihilate at very high rates.Godel showed that math is incomplete and physicists have shown that quantum theory is also incomplete(eg, Schrodinger'scat is dead and alive at the same time,) but the string theory of quantum gravity has an equation(wavefunction)for the entire universe and there is no longer an observer and an observed because it is a 10 dimensional theory and so renormalizable.However the cosmicwave function is a composite of all possible universes so indeterminacy remains. The smallest quantum unit is the space of all possibleuniverses, insome of which the cat is dead and some alive. Quantum theory and string theory seem very reductionistic but one equationfor the universe seems as holistic as it's possible to get!Superstring theory(SST) has stretched math to its limits and needs more advanced math to evolve. Physics needs the self consistent structures of math so it combines topology and the Reimannian geometry of generalrelativity (ie, groups of quantum field theories) toeliminate the infinities (ie, renormalize) of the quantum theory of gravity.It seems to me that the most complex products of the brain-SST and topology, are recursive to quantum field theory and the behavior of particles and the entire universe. though Kaku does not discuss incompleteness, we know that math is proven(Godel, Chaitin, etc.) to be forever necessarily incomplete --ie, infinitely many well formed theorems in any mathematical system can never be proven to be true or false. Then, since math and physics are now fusedat the highest level(Superstring theory), one wonders if there is a nontrivial sense in which physics and the whole universe and the mind are incomplete as well.What is the significance if many laws of physics in somepossible universes(or ours) and/or many thoughts in our brain are never to be consistent with or derivable from the others?String theory unites physics with many of the most advanced and formerly separate areas of math--SuperLie and Kac-Moody algebras, modular functions, finite groups, algebraic topology, Riemannian geometry and cohomology theory. It remains without a conceptual basis so we are left to wonder if there is anything other than powerful math that unites quantum theory and gravitation.Kaku does not dwell on the problem of emergence, but physical scientists can rarely resist reductionism. However, the quantum field equations are so difficult that they cannot be solved for one atom and not even for a vacuum.They require an infinite time to compute. One only finds out the emergent properties of things that result from combining smaller things by seeing what they are like after the fact-whether they are quarks making a proton, molecules making cells, or stars making a universe. One also has uncertainty and chaos. We have no way to determine in what way and when a pile of sand will collapse. Physics has to wait for the results at the micro(subatomic particles) and macro(cosmological observations) scales before advancing and it is full of uncertainty and bizarre phenomena. Also, there seems to be no way we can ever test SST(the theories change constantly but the bottom line is that we will never be able to do experiments at the requisite energy(10 to 19th BEV) --ie, the Planck length(10 to -33cm)) So, physics and even math(incompleteness, etc,) seem to be just as empirical and unsolvable as biology(consciousness, free will) and we must accept the uncertainty of our most advanced concepts as we do that of our everyday life."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"I have read two of his books and am convinced he has no writing skills and his popular science books are just science fiction.

Kaku manages to cover a wide variety of related material --I had to write down a list of all the items that piqued my interest, so that I could research them later: Reimann's Metric Tensor, symmetry breaking, CP violation, Edward Witten, Ramanujan theorems, Veneziano-Suzuki theory, the Yang-Mills field--so many subjects that it took hours of searching through the WWW--but it was ALL fascinating, and I have Michio Kaku to thank for it! I am no math whiz, so my research into these subjects has a limit (at least for the moment), but he presents the math gently and his style is not intimidating at all-- you can tell he very much wants to share this wondrous knowledge so everyone can taste the pleasure of understanding--HIGHLY recommended!"},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"As it is with most science/physics oriented books, anything past the 100th page begins to become not understandable, the reader simply gets bogged down in the sheer language of the novel; and terminology.This book was good in that it was intriguing and interesting. I read it for the first time in high school after a calss I had taken delved into some of these topics. The coverage of these topics were done very well in this book, but the reader has to remember that this book is only the writers opinion and not factual scientific writing.This book was interesting and engaging, I woudl suggest reading it if you have a moderate background in nuclear and atomic physics, and if you would like to open your mind to less conventional ideas about the universe and it's inner workings."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"Though I never knew thigs like this were real, I found this book to be a revalation.

This book was written to explain to the general public in a comprehensible way superstring theory, and higher dimensions. And it does an AMAZING job. I had long been interested in science and higher dimensional theories and topography, but had never really been able to conceptualize these concepts until I read this book. It allowed me to both learn to &quot;see&quot; these concepts and understand where they are coming from, and it also showed me how this stuff might be more than just intellectually stimulating. The author does refer to himself in the book, but that only gives you a greater respect for his base of knowledge on the subject. Of course, if you have a graduate level understanding of these concepts, the book could be very trite. But if you don't, I reccomend you read it, even if the concepts aren't up to 1999 date. And it doesn't hurt to read other books like it either."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"A very good book with a history of physics along with personal experiences that make it more understandable.

It's more or less hard to comprehend, really, because many people think that at the egde of the universe, when molecules and time stop, there must be black. Well, there isn't. There isn't anything. What is out at those far reaches will never be known, because it isn't there. As far as travel through parelell universes go, you would have to figure out some way to move through this nothingness.

Overall:EXCELLENT"},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"Hyperspace is a book strongly focused on higher-dimensional space-time theories such as superstring and Kaluza-Klein-type. The 10 dimensional theory promises to vastly simplify the laws of nature and end our view of a three dimension universe. Kaku manages to compile lots of information in a very readable and fascinating book. You will understand how 10-D theories are basically simple and geometric, despite their mathematical complexity (which actually opened up new areas of mathematics).Higher dimension theories allow us to reduce enormous amounts of information into a concise, elegant fashion that unites the two greatest theories of the 20th century: Quantum Theory and General Relativity.Michio covers the basics of the theory, and its future implications for the future of physics and science, and even writes a few pages on the debate between the reductionism and holism in nature, and the aesthetic relation among physics, mathematics, religion and philosophy. The book flows very smoothly, never burying the reader under too many technical facts. It introduces higher dimension concepts, its relationship with currently accepted theories and the unification of all forces in ten dimensions.Part 3 of the book starts getting heavier on astrophysics, covers Wormholes and potential gateways to other universes, black holes, parallel universes, time travel and colliding universes. Never Hollywood material, but the typical Stargate fan will probably still love this part. :-) Part 4 ends the book with thoughts on how mankind would can rule the universe if Hyperspace can be mastered, discussing the fate of the universe and its civilizations. Subjects like Entropy death, escape thru hyperspace and universal colonization are covered. Interesting, but lots of early speculation.It is true that superstring theories currently appear impossible to test experimentally and may end up in the trash bin, but I don't think that limits this title's interest or renders it worthless. Michio's book is very well written and organized, making extremely difficult higher physics sound almost easy. Beware however, that this isn't really a good title for a complete beginner, and far from complex enough to leave some other readers satisfied. If you have some knowledge of the basics, you will be left with the impression that the ideas covered are simple, but it will only be an illusion; Very few people in the world fully master all the subjects covered. If having to understand the Riemann Metric Tensor is enough to make you run, you better keep away from this title. No knowledge in math is necessary, but of course, if you know your college math, you'll know what's happening, in some parts instead of having to just believe Kaku's word. :) Just being able to grasp the general beauty of hyperspace science is still well worth the time.In parallel, you will hear some stories about mathematicians, events, and many curious episodes that have influenced modern science; Kaku sometimes diverges a bit from the main subject, and ends up telling stories, some about his childhood, and many about famous scientists (For instance, when dealing with Hilton's cubes, Kaku spends a few paragraphs telling us about Hilton's habits and the fact that he was a bigamist, the scandals, etc). This isn't really a problem, as the stories are usually interesting and directly or indirectly related to the subjects.Kaku did manage to write a great laymen's (well, almost) book about higher dimensional physics and cosmology. Not many do it as well. Everybody remembers Hawkin's &quot;A Brief History of Time&quot; and also the now classic \\"The Elegant Universe\\". Hyperspace has its place next to these.The discussion about God grasped my interest, but that didn't last long. I would have dropped the subject, as Michio is definitely not qualified to get into it, and I did not get the book to read a version of Kant's arguments that have been refuted to exhaustion. Note that I'm not questioning Michio's conclusions, just saying that there are far better titles on these matters and that the author should have focused on what's he's good at.But, that little stain is no major problem, In general, very enjoyable title, also complete in notes, references, suggested readings and has a good index.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"Everyone of us were born to comprehend the 3-dimensional world that we live in, and most of us would view time as the forth. In &quot;Hyperspace&quot;, Kaku introduces the concept of dimensions beyond the third, and what these dimensions mean to us. Apart from talking about the possibilities of deriving a unified theory of all physical laws in higher dimensions, wormholes were also described in details as to how they could be used for travelling between different dimensions and universes, and more interestingly, how they could be used to travel through time. Most of the concepts were backed by examples and stories (including those of Kaku's childhood memories) which, not only allows the readers to easily grasp them, but also makes them more interesting to follow. However, one may start to wonder how on earth could Kaku's parents allow (and assist) their child to perform such horrific experiments!This book was written primarily for the general public. Having said this, some moderate background and interests in physics are necessary, but then again you probably wouldn't be reading this review to start with if you weren't interested in &quot;Hyperspace&quot;, right?To sum up, I would definitely recommend this book for anyone who wants to find out more about the higher dimensions. Although there were occasions when I felt that Kaku has gone into too much details on the stories he quoted, which themselves could have been another interesting read if I wasn't told of the endings..."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"This is book definitely written for the layperson, but the author does no condescension when explaining complex details to the reader. No deep mathematics, no proofs, just a good book for the average person to enjoy and understand. The best book on the market for understanding the complications of the limitations of the space-time continuum of the world we live in.Don't confuse &quot;hyperspace&quot; with &quot;hypercube&quot;. &quot;Hypercube&quot; is a study in mathematics regarding four dimensions without time, while this book discusses as much in detail about &quot;hyperspace&quot;, a study of dimensions up to ten. The book is actually on the higher study of physics, not mathematics, but of course, mathematics is a part of the book, if only on a limited basis.Very interesting on the string theory, where dimensions of 10 and/or 26 are required. Also, all the competing theories are discussed, including the fact that Einstein himself was uncomfortable with studies beyond the fourth dimension. This is all discussed, very aptly, with a view to have the reader himself put on the physicist's shoes, so to speak, and comprehend creating some of theses theories, along with the rest of the academia bunch.Diagrams and pictures are included to help the reader visualize some of this, even if it is in a limited way. Very helpful.Einstein claimed that imagination was more than 90 percent of true scientific inquiry. I wouldn't agree with him entirely, especially in fields such as biology, but for physics study and a good review of the all the theories concerning higher dimensions, I would agree more with Einstein than not. I would even recommend this book to one comtemplating a future serious study in physics or math. I wouldn't be without it."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"High dimensional theories are really hard to comprehend given that you can't see them but just visualize them mathematically. I think the author has done a great job exposing a non physicist to the world of higher dimensional physics.Kaku starts the Hyperspace theory (also called Superstring or Supergravity theory) in a chronological fashion. Obviously he talks about Einstein's general relativity and then moves on to the pioneer's in the high dimentional geometry with a broad and very lucid description of Kaluza theory (later to become Kaluza-Klein) and Riemann matrices.According to Kaku , hyperspace theory tells us before the Big Bang, our cosmos was actually a perfect ten-dimensional universe, a world where interdimensional travel was possible. However, this ten-dimensional universe &quot;cracked&quot; in two, creating two separate universes: a four-and a six- dimensional universe. The universe in which we live was born in that cosmic cataclysm. Our four-dimensional universe expanded explosively, while our twin six-dimensional universe contracted violently, until it shrank to almost infinitesimal size. This would explain the origin of the Big Bang. If correct, this theory demonstrates that the rapid expansion of the universe was just a rather minor aftershock of a much greater cataclysmic event, the cracking of space and time itself. The energy that drives the observed expansion of the universe is then found in the collapse of ten-dimensional space and time. According to this theory, the distant stars and galaxies are receding from us at astronomical speeds because of the original collapse of ten-dimensional space and time.This is by far the best description of the theory I've read so far in a book. The subject matter does require concentration. Even though personally it is hard for me to come to terms with many aspects of the theory, it is definately a mind opener."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"I guess I would have liked this book a lot more if I had read it before Brian Greene's excellent book, _The Elegant Universe_.Michio Kaku has a rare talent for being able to explain very complex and abstract systems and situations in terms that people who have not had a graduate level college course in the subject can understand. He thus moves quite deftly from subject to subject, taking the time to explain things in terms that any reader should be able to understand.However, for a book on Science, Kaku gets caught up in discussions about things that did not contribute much to the text (although a discussion of God does not necessarily _detract_ from the book, it isnt what I was looking for).Kaku has written another book, _Visions_, which covers many of the subjects elaborated on in this book. I would suggest readers get the Visions book, and also pick up a copy of the much more modern and somewhat higher-brow book by Brian Greene, _The Elegant Universe_.Four stars because it is a good book, five if it were contemporary."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"This is an odyssey into the history of development of the concept of hyperspace that includes fourth and higher spatial dimensions to account for the riddles and unsolved problems of unified field theory. Since the postulation of special theory of relativity, Einstein and subsequent physicists until now have struggled to explain the four natural forces; the electromagnetic force (explained by Maxwell's field equations for electricity &amp; magnetism); the strong and weak nuclear forces (explained by Yang - Mills field equations for subatomic forces); and the gravitational force (explained by Einstein's field equations of gravitation and relativity) by one unified field theory (theory of everything: String Theory). In other words, unifying the forces of the big, the cosmos, and the laws of the small, the microcosm (subatomic forces) by one single theory. The first part of the book describes how laws of nature become so simple to understand if higher dimensions are invoked; the author gives us a good historical background to build his case for hyperspace concept. The second part of the book describes the evolution of quantum mechanics and String theory. An introduction to wormholes, black holes and the use of these cosmic bodies for interstellar travel is given in the third part. The fourth part rambles through the future of the universe with irrelevant and some times out of focus narrative. The book is entirely free of physics and mathematics; from the point of understanding the basic concepts this approach is welcome. This book also gives an insight into the poignant story of Riemann (p.42) and Ramanujan (p.174) who sustained enormous personal and family hardships to contribute significantly in the field of mathematics. We also get a glimpse of academic rat race that involves professional rivalry, name &amp; work recognition, and personal ego that is prevalent in academics. This is illustrated when Einstein delays Kaluza's paper for publication for 2 years (p.102). Bohr calling Pauli's lecture crazy (p.137); Sheldon Glashow ridiculing t'Hooft's work (p.121); a superior discouraging Mahahiko Suzuki's publication about Euler's Beta function (p.161); and Pauli being furious about Eisenberg's claim, Einstein - Bohr argument, and Schrodinger frustrated with Bohr's interpretation (p.261).The author rambles about symmetry in arts; what is that got to do with hyperspace? The reader can find this discussion in any art book. Time travel has been described in layman's language in many books in depth; this discussion is unnecessary for this book. Throughout the book, the author refers to standard model and the equations of quantum mechanics as ugly; Equations are not ugly, they are complex or non-symmetrical.The author could have devoted one chapter to describing the field equations in layman's terms; it would have helped a more enthusiastic reader to build a bridge to physics and tensor calculus. The reader should not be discouraged about mathematics in understanding relativity; many physicists themselves are heading to the library to learn about mathematics in String theory (Part 2). More appropriate title of the book could be hyperspace - a historical development of String theory. Despite the minor concerns, this book has strong points as observed above. I encourage the reader to buy this book; if you are not happy with this book, it is less than two-lunch money (page numbers from 1994 edition)."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"Though it is impossible to visualize higher dimensions and difficult for most of us to understand the equations involved in this technical field, Michio Kaku, who has become the &quot;Carl Sagan&quot; of our time, does an excellent job of helping lay readers comprehend hyperspace. The concept of higher dimensions, which was formerly introduced in 1854 by Geog Riemann, was not taken seriously because it was an untestable theory and lost credibility upon the introduction of quantum theory in the early twentieth century. Reinman believed that the forces of nature such as electricity, magnetism, and gravity were just effects caused by the crumpling or warping of hyperspace, an idea that Albert Eisntein revived in his theory of general relativity. In this comprehensive and often humouous work, Kaku takes the reader from the fictional characters of Charles Hinton to Relativity and String theories; both of which have revived interest in higher dimensional reality. If you thought, like me, that you could never come close to understanding the concepts of hyperspace, this book will surely bring you within reach of this understanding, while providing a sound background in the history and development of higher dimensions."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"This is certainly a most interesting presentation of the hyperspace theory (also known as the theory of everything)not only in view of its cosmological implications but also because of the new horizons it opens for mankind. Basically, the theory states that several dimensions exist beyond the commonly accepted four of space and time. In fact, it predicts the precise number of dimensions as being ten (the usual 3 for space, one of time, and six more spatial dimensions). Theoretically, it unites all known physical phenomena (electromagnetic, strong and weak nuclear force, and gravitational force) in a simple framework, simplifies the laws of nature, and may provide a means to tunnel through space and time.Michio Kaku rightly says that \\"we are like carps swimming contentedly in the pond, confident that our universe consists of only those things we can see or touch, of the familiar and the visible, refusing to admit that parallel universes or dimensions can exist next to ours, just beyond our grasp.\\" We are limited by a three-dimensional brain, and the inability to \\"see\\" the fourth dimension is like that of a blind man attempting to conceive the concept of color. Mathematically we can probe into N dimensions, and although the bending of our universe is an \\"unseen\\" dimension it has been experimentally measured.The further on we move the more theoretical physics resembles a science fiction tale: wormholes, parallel universe, time travel... Another problem is how are we going to scientifically test those hypothesis: the higher dimensions are too small to be experimentally seen and we need new-sophisticated technologies to test them. If the theory is proved correct, then when will we be able to harness the power of the hyperspace theory? We are reminded of what physicist V. Weisskopf once said: \\"It's like the peasant who asks the engineer how the steam engine works. The engineer explains exactly where the steam goes and how it moves through the engine and so on. And then the peasant says: \\"Yes, I understand all that, but where is the horse?\\"The author has an almost mythical interpretation of hyperspace theory, addressing the issue as a theory of Creation, whereby only at the instant of the Big Bang do we see the full power of the theory coming into play; our cosmos was a perfect ten-dimensional universe but it eventually \\"cracked\\" in two, creating a four and a six-dimensional universe. Then he hums an apocalyptic tune: the uranium barrier, ecological collapse, new ice age, astronomical close encounters, nemesis extinction factor, death of the sun and death of the galaxy. But there is salvation! \\"Man is doomed... but there is one possible escape. If all of space-time is collapsing into a fiery cataclysm, then the only way to escape the Big Crunch is to leave space and time -- escape via hyperspace!For those well versed in physics and mathematics, this book might be viewed as another good \\"pop\\" science. But why should priests chant incantations in Latin, that hardly anyone understands, and physicists chant equations that even fewer understand? Michio Kaku does an excellent job in bringing theoretical physics closer to the layman, his analysis is clear and comprehensive, and he makes use of excellent analogies."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"I say great airplane book because I fly internationally a lot and this book is ALWAYS in my carry-on.

I found the historical connections to scientific discovery fascinating (for one of those genius kind of guys, Michio writes an intersting tale of facts and conjecture).While I was concerned that it may contain mathematics beyond all I have forgotten, I discovered that this was unfounded, as Michio takes the time to decribe everything in terms non-mathematical (yea I know, hard to believe).In summery, this is not only a good read, it will blow you away.

His brilliance in academia lies in the fact that he's not only able to dissect the most complicated notions in such a way that lay people can understand it, but he's apt to make it fun as well. Thus, I bought this book with high expectations and, although I was not disappointed, I did feel that the author's theories tend to defy common sense in a non-scientific sort of way.Although the book masterfully covered the areas of astronomy and quantum physics, alas, the so-called superstring theory went too far. Like another reviewer who wanted the numbers behind the theories, I wanted the logic behind the theories because despite scientists' tendency to break down the walls of common sense, all science needs logic in order to function--otherwise experiments could never! be replicated.

His description of higher dimensions recapitulates all of the mind games played in Rucker's book, &quot;The Fourth Dimension.&quot; He goes over the structure of scientific revolutions and explores Einstein's hagiography. Einstein's famous equations are explained. Not only are they explained in their natural elegant context but it is explained how they are &quot;marble.&quot; It was Einstein's dream to grasp the universe by the pure thought of mathematics, to turn the entire cosmos into &quot;marble&quot; with seemless equations. Thus, 'God does not play dice.' The world of the quantum is far from &quot;marble&quot; however with its &quot;wood&quot; of uncertainty and nonrenormalizable models. The puzzle confronting scientists is how to mesh the wood in to the marble. He explains how the wood and marble are very explanatory paradigms against the four forces governing the cosmos. Gravity is beautifully accounted for by Einstein's relativity--which does nothing for the story of subatomic particles. However, quantum theory's Standard Model takes over here and describes the nuclear forces and electromagnetism. It is here that hyperspace, or supergravity, is revealed in its subsuming aspects. With the ten dimensional universe, all of our familiar forces are unified. I think one of the most awesome things I read was the &quot;Parable of the Gemstone.&quot; He does not leave it off here, but moves on to other cosmology like wave functions, many worlds, and baby universes--then civilization and technology.

It is hard to beleive that &quot;space itself can curl due to gravity&quot;. But it was even hard to beleive that earth was not flat.You can appreciate Einstein's work in this context.

It is a book written to fascinate, and as such it does well, but in my opinion it does not delve deeply enough for the discerning reader. For instance, we don't even get a glance of the maths behind Kaku's ideas. What is really needed in this area is a book called something like 'Elementary String Theory', or 'Strings for the Mediocre Physicist'.

Beginning with Einstein, the giants of physics have tried and failed to find such a unified mathematical model. However, the answer that eluded Einstein for the last 30 years of his life may lie in the hyperspace theory. In short, Einstein has three major ideas. The first one is the special relativity, which time can covert into space and vice versa. The second one is the general relativity, which matter (energy) can bent space (time). In other words, forces do not exist; force is a consequence of geometry due to curved space. The third one is the unified field theory. The goal is to describe matter by geometry. But the quantum theory dominates theoretical physics in the next 60 years until 1980s.Quantum theory is the opposite of Einstein's theory. Einstein's general relativity is a theory of the cosmos (stars and galaxies). Quantum theory is a theory of the microcosm (subatomic particles).In essence, the key differences between Einstein's geometric theory and quantum theory are: (1) Forces are created by the exchange of discrete packets of energy, called quanta. (2) Different forces are caused by the exchange of different quanta. (3) We can never know simultaneously the velocity and positions of a subatomic particle. (4) There is a finite probability that particles may \\"tunnel\\" through or make a quantum leap through impenetrable barriers.After 50 years of research, we have the following picture of subatomic matter: All matter consists of quarks and leptons, which interact by exchanging different types of quanta, described by the Maxwell and Yang-Mills field. The Yang-Mills field makes the theory of matter--the Standard Model--possible. The Standard Model is based on symmetry. Symmetry is the preservation of the shape of an object even after we deform or rotate it. The first type of symmetry is rotations and reflections. The second type of symmetry is reshuffling a series of objects. The Standard Model unifies the three fundamental forces by one large symmetry: SU(3) (strong force, shuffle of three colored quarks) x SU(2) (weak force, interchange of electron and neutrino) x U(1) (electromagnetic force, rotates the components of the Maxwell field into itself), which is just the product of the symmetries of the individual forces. SU stands for special unitary matrix. The determinant of the matrix is one. The Standard Model is incomplete, because it does not describe gravity. Second, it is ugly (complicated), because there are 36 quarks, 8 Yang-Mills fields to describe the gluons, 4 Yang-Mills fields to describe the weak and electromagnetic forces, 6 types of leptons, a large number of Higgs particles, and at least 19 arbitrary constants.In 1980s, the Einstein type theory (higher dimensional space theory) returns to the mainstream of research in the name of string theory. Superstring theory is probably the most advanced higher dimensional space theory. It postulates that all the matter consists of tiny vibrating strings. The theory predicts the dimensions for space and time is ten. The corresponding mathematics for the dimensions is called Ramanujan function, a modular function. The matter in the universe and the four forces may be different vibrations of hyperspace. The required mathematics to understand superstring theory reached the deepest level ever. Any unified field theory must first absorb the Riemannian geometry from Einstein's theories and the Lie groups from quantum field theory. Then a new branch of mathematics--topology--merges them together. In fact, Gauss, Riemann, and Poincare all considered physics to be the most important source of new mathematics, because mathematics is the language of physics.A ten-dimensional matrix (space) has enough room to accommodate all four fundamental forces. Furthermore, the ten-dimensional matrix has room to explain the subatomic particles produced by atomic smashers. Thus the matrix, a mathematical object, consists of both forces (consequence of bent space-time) and matter (energy).The hyperspace theory reopens the question of whether the extra dimensions can be used for traveling. The shortest path between two points in higher dimensional space is not a straight line but a wormhole. The Poincare Conjecture could be used to determine whether a hyper-surface consist a wormhole or not. Our world is simply connected because a lasso of rope can always be shrunk to a point. If the lasso is placed around the entrance of the wormhole, then it cannot be shrunk to a point. Such spaces are called multiple connected. Although the bending of our universe has been experimentally measured, it is still a controversy on whether warmhole exists or whether our universe is multiply connected.A field is a collection of numbers at every point in space. The numbers describes a force at that point. Field theory allows us to calculate the required energy to form wormhole in space-time. The required energy to form a wormhole is centuries ahead of our current technology. Hence, time travel is not testable.Michio Kaku's \\"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension\\" is a must have for whom would like to understand the latest and the greatest of theoretical physics."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"Wow.This book is just plain amazing. After seeing Professor Kaku on a television show call \\"Parallel Worlds\\" two years ago, I was immediately intrigued. But now that I have read Professor Kaku's book, I'm hooked!The concepts and sheer amount of material in this book is mind boggling. But what is still so amazing to me is how Professor Kaku brings some of hte wildest ideas in Physics down to earth so a lay-person like me can understand it with no problem. Of course, it is good to have some basic knowledge about physics before you go diving into this book, but only the extremely basic stuff.Wormholes, Time travel, Multi-dimesional spaces, it's all here, and best of all, it's all crytal clear! Professor Kaku takes the almost mind boggling idea that all matter in the universe is made from vibrating strings that are 10^-32 mm long. He also discuses the possibility of traveling through a black hole and going beack in time to \\"fulfill\\" an event (as physics shows one cannot change the events of the past, only eleborate on them). Another brilliant trait of this book is Professor Kaku's ability to make every key idea into an easily understandible anicdote. What Professor Kaku does in this book is explain the ideas first in a scientific sense, then \\"laymanizes\\" the same ideas through a story or real-world example.Besides that this book is purely science, it is just plain facinating. Professor Kaku \\"shows\\" what it would be like to enter the 4th demension as a 3-D being. He also discusses the idea of other deminsions in our universe, and what strange happenings would occur there. One instance is what would happen if we were to enter a 5th dimensional Hyper-donut, how we would persive ourselves in line w/ several other people, and when we attemted to put our hand on their shoulder, we would feel a hand on our shoulder ( in otherwords, we have reached around the donut and grabbed our own shoulder. The other people in front of us are actually us! We're seeing our backside in front of us!).And this isn't all, thsi book is purely amazing. Everyone should read this book.

The middle is taken up by much complicated physics that is difficult to follow. However, once Kaku begins to describe ways in which we might begin to probe the 10th dimension and civilizations that may have done so alredy, it becomes engrossing. It is certainly too much for the casual reader, but for lovers of science fiction or science in general, it is a fascinating book."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"Good overview of space in the solutions of science. Though the book suggests upper dimensions as simplifications to lower dimensional enigmas, it generally provides little to grasp in the ascent of these upper realms. Good introductory book, with a first half summarizing relativity and early 20th century physics, and a second half dominated by speculation. Sorry, I was unfortunate to have read other more recent books on the current scientific scenary, and found this one to be far too lacking on substance. Would be a good book to begin a venture into current trends, but if you've kept up your reading, this might add little to your game plan but vocabulary."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"With the previous title, Georg Bernhard Riemann gave one of the most important lectures of the history of physics on June 10, 1854. That day, the long-cherished Euclidean geometry tumbled down. As everyone knows, the Euclidean geometry is based on flat space, namely, a space with no curvature at all. Riemann, introduced with his lecture a new kind of geometry that could easy manipulates, in a pure mathematical way, any type of curved space and with more than just three dimensions. All this geometry was based on the use of the famous \\"Riemann Metric Tensor\\" which describes the bending of any region of the space by the means of a limited number of components that depend on the number of dimensions considered. Riemann was guided by the principle that the laws of nature simplify in higher dimensions, acquiring an elegant form that has never seen before. This was the birth of the theory of hyperspace. The book featured by the author, explores profoundly the development of this theory since its very beginning. Splitting the text into four parts, Dr. Kaku covers all the stages of the theory including \\"Kaluza-Klein Theory\\", \\"Supergravity Theory\\" and the latest version: \\"Superstring Theory\\", which states that the world we live in has ten dimensions, but only four of them (space-time) are perceptible to us. In the first and second part of the book, the authors explain us, very carefully, the way in which the theory was conceived in its earlier stages and the problems that it has had to overcome in order to survive the generalized skepticism through decades of researching. Many theoretical physics, even today, refuse to embrace the theory because it probably will never be proved to be correct due to the astronomical amounts of energy needed to restore the broken symmetries of the forces found at the Big Bang instant. In the final parts, third and fourth, Dr. Kaku take us in a exciting journey through black holes, parallel universes, wormholes and, finally, a scientific and very realistic study about the possibilities of mastering the hyperspace within a reasonable period of time. I recommend this book to every laypeople interested in learning a great deal of relativistic and quantum physic because the text was written in a clear, funny, informative and straightforward fashion that anybody with meager knowledge of mathematics and physics can read and delight. I personally think that this text is one of the best popular books ever written in the theme of Superstring Theory, and of course, about its role as an unifying theory of the four forces of nature: electromagnetism, gravity and the strong and weak nuclear interactions, into a Superforce responsible of the creation itself."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"Despite the fact that I am a grad student in biology, not physics, I bought this book because I am interested in all the sciences and hoped that this would be, as promised, accessible to the lay reader. It was not. Like most incredibly gifted scientists, Kaku seems to have forgotten what it is like to approach a subject with no prior experience, hoping for an introduction to it: he will often use terminology and only introduce it several pages later; he uses analogies that are ugly and bear no resemblance to their subjects; and, worst of all, writes in a disjointed style that allows the reader glimpses into strange and beautiful theories but quickly snatches them away from that vantage and pulls them back into confusion and jargon. The lay reader may come away from this book thinking they are too stupid to comprehend the subject when in fact it is just the explanation that is unclear. A truly ingenious writer (like a Sagan) would be able to explain these ideas with lucidity. Dr. Kaku is an obvious genius in his field.

Except for some off-topic ramblings in the middle about the relationship of art to modern science, and some of the author's conceptual aids to help explain or express complex physical theories, I was thoroughly engrossed and mentally stimulated. Kaku has a respectable command of his subject and prose, even if, at times, there was some repetition. (In this type of book, repetition is a given.)The book is virtually free of mathematics. Consequently, there are places the reader has to take Kaku's explanations and descriptions at face value. Having no math to back up theory isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it leaves even the expert word smith (and I consider Kaku to be one) at a disadvantage. On more than a few occasions I was unable to rap my brain around literal or diagrammatical attempts to explain principles and theories of math and physics. Of course, this might be my failing as a reader instead of Kaku's. It's possible I just didn't get it for the simple reason I didn't want to take the extra time for conceptualizing. (I was more anxious to get to his discussion of multi-dimensional space.)As opposed to some of the other reviewers, I found the last two sections most enjoyable and enlightening. In the final two sections 'Wormholes' and 'Masters of Hyperspace', Kaku skillfully addresses multi-versus, traveling through time, the death of the cosmos; he encompasses divergent opinions and arguments from various perspectives (math, physics, cosmology, religion), comments on the difference between a God of Order and a God of Miracles, and concludes with a reasoned and hopeful statement about man's ability to solve the mysteries of nature.I plan on reading more from this author.-seabgb"},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"Kaku attacks some very difficult subjects in Hyperspace.

Kaku not only adeptly conveys these supremely difficult subjects in a way that the average reader can understand, but also takes the reader on a well organized and engaging journey through the theory of everything. If you have ever wondered if time travel will ever be possible, if other dimensions exist, or if humans will ever live on other planets in other galaxies then this book is for you. It will give you the theoretical physicist's point of view on these mysterious subjects. This book is supremely informative and wonderfully entertaining. I gave it 4 1/2 stars instead of five, because of the last Chapter which was contrived and superfluous."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"I loved this book and continue to go back and read a section or two.

Not only does Michio Kaku bring the most puzzling aspects of modern physics down to the laymans erms, he describes them in a revolutionary way that anyone can understand and grasp thoroughly.

Warning: This book willl blow your mind."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"Michio Kaku is a new author for me. I'm glad to have had a chance to preview 30 pages of this book. From what I've read, I'm definitely hooked and can't wait to get the book. Kaku's taken a complex subject matter like parallel universes, dimensionality and the forces of nature and has woven it into a context that is easily understood, exquisitely expressed and mind bending. His work helps to provide a foundation for those of us interested in taking that journey beyond 3-D but don't have a background in theoretical physics."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"Though it is impossible to visualize higher dimensions and difficult for most of us to understand the equations involved in this technical field, Michio Kaku, who has become the &quot;Carl Sagan&quot; of our time, does an excellent job of helping lay readers comprehend hyperspace. The concept of higher dimensions, which was formerly introduced in 1854 by Geog Riemann, was not taken seriously because it was an untestable theory and lost credibility upon the introduction of quantum theory in the early twentieth century. Reinman believed that the forces of nature such as electricity, magnetism, and gravity were just effects caused by the crumpling or warping of hyperspace, an idea that Albert Eisntein revived in his theory of general relativity. In this comprehensive and often humouous work, Kaku takes the reader from the fictional characters of Charles Hinton to Relativity and String theories; both of which have revived interest in higher dimensional reality. If you thought, like me, that you could never come close to understanding the concepts of hyperspace, this book will surely bring you within reach of this understanding, while providing a sound background in the history and development of higher dimensions."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"Although I have had an interest in physics, and science in general, I highly reccommend that everyone should read this book.

After reading certain parts of the book, I would get frustrated because I am unable to think in higher spatial dimensions, simply because of the fact that I do not exist in them. I get so excited reading about this stuff that I find myself reading chapters over and over again just to enjoy the concepts that physicists, mathmeticians, cosmologists, astronomers, etc., have been able to come up with.

It's a book that has condensed so much knowledge into so little space that you can read it again and again and still get something new out of it. I read this book first in 8th grade, but read it again in several years with more science knowledge behind me. The first time was lovely, but I appreciated the book alot more the second time I read it. Michio Kaku, in addition, is a wonderful writer. His procession of thoughts is very logical, and the wording is precise. Many other physics/math books I've read have been dissociated and difficult to read because the authors lack writing skill.

We keep adding dimensions! Newton started with three and we were in awe, but we understood. Einstein added a fourth and we were thunderstruck. We had to fight to overcome our intuition, but with determination we still understood. Then Kaluza and Klein added a fifth dimension and we scratched our heads. Intuition was less helpful and we started to lose the thread of understanding. Superstring theorists seem to have alighted on a final figure (I hope) of ten. This is way beyond the capacity of our brains to understand. So what do we do now?If you're the kind of person who lies awake at night wondering how it all works, this is a frustrating trend. You are never going to learn the advanced math, so you must search for books to help you understand. Some are better than others. This book is among the better ones, for a few reasons.First, Kaku is quick to point out that physicists who understand this stuff, understand the MATH, but are no better then we are at visualizing how the math is reflected in reality. I have come across a few writers in the genre who make this clear, and I always find it to be a relief. There is not some great truth that you are unable to grasp. The human brain is just not capable of perceiving hyper-dimensions. Don't worry.Second, this book focuses more on a colloquial explanation of the math than merely on its implications for reality. For me, this is an important link in understanding hyper-dimensional physics. Think of it this way. Phase I is &quot;Do the math&quot;. Phase II is &quot;Explain the math&quot;. Phase III is &quot;Explain what the math implies in the way reality is structured.&quot; Phase I is opaque to most of us, so writers of these kinds of books rightly discard it. However, most writers jump right into Phase III. I don't know about you, but when someone asks me to visualize a hypercube unfolding in four-dimensional space, my eyes start to water. Kaku is the first writer I have encountered that first seeks to explain how the mathematics developed and why they imply multi-dimensional space. Only then does he begin to explain the nature of a tesseract (a three-dimensional representation of a four-dimensional cube). I won't tell you I was suddenly able to visualize hyperspace, but I did have that &quot;a-ha&quot; experience of understanding why the concept matters to us.Finally, Kaku puts the mind-bending nature of modern physics in an important historical context, one that helps explain WHY it is so counter-intuitive. For years, experimental physics led the way. Theory developed through the explanation of actual observed phenomena. (For example, Einstein stumbled on special relativity by seeking to explain the photo-electric effect.) But Kaku points out that this trend has now reversed for two reasons. First, we stumbled on string theory much earlier than expected. It is a theory well ahead of it's time. Second, the amount of energy that must be generated to verify the theory experimentally is well beyond our technology. Therefore, we are entering an age when theory will have to lead experimentation by the nose, thus challenging a human intuition that does not yet have the experience to fit it all into the big jigsaw puzzle. Buckle up. It's going to be a bumpy ride.If you need to build the context to understand physics, this book is an excellent choice."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"Mr.Michio Kaku does an excellent job of explaining the string theory, quantum mechanics, and all sorts of nerdy sounding consepts, making it exciting and readable for those beginning to explore physics, as well as for those who know it well."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"Reading this after 'Visions', I'm most pleased. Hyperspace is a non-stop intellectual adventure through the fantastic ideas of Wormholes, Time Travel, Parallel universes, and Higher Dimensions, with lots of educational sidetracks along the way. Not just your everyday physics book though, Kaku doesn't simply preach ideas and formulas but adds interesting side notes, analogies to movies and literature, and how these ideas could affect the future in the most amazing ways, if you like science, science fiction, or thinking what the future may be like, I'd recommend this book for you."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"A littler out of date with newer theoretical developments in string theory, but still an interesting and fascinating read.

Stripped down to the essentials for easy understanding, the book gives the lay reader a decent overview of theoretical physics, the main figures and the historical struggles that have presented themselves to physicists over the years.The book follows the line that the laws of nature simplify in higher dimensional thought, and most of it is aimed at this theme of a unified theory. For the most part, the book is very easily understood, with some very helpful diagrams to aid you along the way. Particularly helpful are Kaku's analogies with everyday objects, such as beach balls. These really bring the ideas to life in a form that is accessible and visualisable.One point that I found personally daunting is the idea of metric tensors, which I still really struggle with. I honestly don't understand them, despite Kaku's explanations and further use of them.As far as introductions go, \\"Hyperspace\\" ranks as one of the easiest to start with, having only a very minimal amount of mathematics for you to wade through. Even when it is there, the mathematics is fairly easily grasped and requires little to no mental effort.Will you be able to calculate the quanta of a neutrino impacting with an electron after this book? Simple answer: no. The book will give enough detail to interest you, and give you enough to decide if you want to read more and in more detail. If you have ever been curious about theoretical physics, but frightened of it at the same time, (like me), then \\"Hyperspace\\" may be just the book you are looking for. I really enjoyed it and learned heaps."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"3D graphics and animation is impressive, creative....high art at its finest. But above 3D there is 4D (although isn't time more of a control on 3D shape and behavior) and astoundingly still higher dimensions of invisible, vibrating string-like matter/quantum fluctuations/whatever-the-heck-this-stuff-is. Michio Kaku, in my estimation the finest intellect gracing planet Earth, unfolds page-by-page a deeper, more abstract, altogether more comely universe. A universe that wants to make sense out of itself, but seems to take a liking to infinite possibility, random chance; not to mention utterly wild and counterintuitive physical phenomena.Kaku, who in this tome on free thought (odds are he's nearly right on, if not the first to crack some higher orchestrated code well past opinion) paves grudgingly complex, unexpectedly connected paths through the realms of what makes the ultimate realm, the known universe - and he takes it to the beyond - tick and tock.In the cruel world of a child growing up, a shallow place of misguided human emotion and greed and desirous mistake, the drastically strange and different world painted by Kaku has a resoundingly nastalgic, nearly tragic, edifice propping it up. As I've read others state: Why can't science be taught this way in primary school? Kaku should serve as the integral player to anyone whom rethinks their existence, whom asks what it is that trully matters most, and whom finally reaches that crisis in conscience of simply not accepting everything and anything thrown at them, the lessons and beliefs which have hereby proved themselves false. While I myself am semi-crazed with the dynamics, precision, and seemily impossible complexity surrounding three dimensional forms, those newly discovered/invented geometrical objects - and I'm not avidly sticking to the elementary models (spheres, pyramids, cylinders) which when combined or extended can in themselves produce a stunning array of 3D realization - which determine our world's touch and feel.As Newton contemplated the aprochryphal concept of a strictly mechanical universe, so does Kaku firmly investigate and eventually reject the classical, the primarily calculus-based, vision of reality so starkly upheld and trusted (I still love the vastness and truth in calculus based fields). Kaku shatters misconceptions, maybe upsetting some who've devoted an entire lifetime to related pursuits. Meanwhile, it is a safe bet to assume even these folks are fascinated by what Kaku has to tell. While there is not solid or evidenciary grounding in much of what is laid bare, there is plenty of analogy and thought-experiments to make one want to cling to what Kaku teaches. If Michio Kaku is wrong, then the universe is indeed a sorry place, for without the more reasonable, yet somehow more exciting viewpoints which he shares based on computational evidence (suppose he does have scientific support) pointing towards a universe of amazing construct, well, then we are left primitive, competitive, and spiteful to the bitter end.In a \\"Big Thinkers\\" episode made for Michio Kaku to elaborate all about his ideas, theories, and often times objections to the set-in-stone so-called necessary norms, he puts forth a performance unmatched by not only any scientist I've seen, but also any other person on camera. Kaku, for the first time in my life, spelled out a physical realtiy which I've suspected in some ways. Kaku discussed how the \\"right hand and the left hand\\" - representative of the theory of the very big (relativity) and the very small (quantum mechanics) \\"don't go together.\\" But not getting ahead of himself, he portrays vividly several commonplace scenarios: ducktaping a plattypuss and some other life form together and calling it natures finest creation; how a monkey cannot carry out mathematical analysis due to genetic incapability or an unevolved brain; how the topsy turvy world of city streets and the stressful souls trapped therein even contains some degree of inherent beauty or at least explainability....all the while Kaku inches near clueing you to his finer interpretation of life. However, he reaches into dark corners (perhaps there being no divine being or supreme mind behind the curtain afterall, the repressive lives of the lowly fish stuck in their peripheral 2D ponds, etc.), leaving one with their remaining emotional imbalances....enough to make you that much more convinced of his credibilty and genuine genius.If there are but two choices of whose computer game, with its own separate rules, to enter (meaning that increasingly becoming commercialzed media mess of a maze called The American Experience), one being the game crafted by the self-righteous bussiness guru or self-delusional conspiracy nut, the other being the carefully plotted fairly structured resultant manifestation of the mind of a peaceful visionary, I'll pick the latter on every single occasion with vigor.If anything, Michio Kaku is refreshing, deserving of respect in addition to adulation, and an imperative physicist for the age we're in.

You don't need to be graduated in physics to understand its contents because the book is written for lay readers on the subject. Hyperspace describe the ultimate world of physics, a highly advanced subject that we commonly see only in science fiction movies such as Star Wars and Star Trek.

This is a most epic and enthusiastic account of higher dimensions, how they could exist, what the implications are, how string theory fits in and exactly what it could mean for the future of the world. The reality of science definately has become more bizzare than fiction. Kaku takes the reader through a journey starting with Riemann, Ramanajun, Einstein and how the current forerunners in quantum physics has expanded on their work. Kaku, in my opinion, ranks with the immortal modern day writers such as Isaac Asimov. It is very easily noticeable when a writer understands practically everything of what he/her is explaining and those who are regurgitating other text books. Kaku is definately in the category of the former. Way to go Michio ! An excellent piece of work!PS : Incase you're wondering what the best scientific book is that I've read, its &quot;Asimov's new guide to science&quot; - by Isaac Asimov."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"In this superbly written book, Michio Kaku explains it all and \\"solves\\" it all by the theory of hyperspace. Basically, it explains the futility of unifying the basic forces of nature in the present concept of 4-D space-time. In fact Albert Einstein had to add the fourth temporal dimension of time to explain the field theory of gravity. Later Theodr Kaluza, while expressing Einstein's field equations in five dimensions came to startling result in which Maxwell's field equations of electro-magnetism was included along with field equations of gravity. So, just by addition of one dimension, two fundamental forces of nature were getting unified. Much later the 11-dimensional supergravity theory encompassed all the forces as well as matter in its expression giving hope of the ultimate theory in offing. It was eventually abandoned because the equations were nonrenormalizable (nonsensical results). Of course, the latest offering is the 10-dimensional superstring theory and its successor the 11-dimensional M-theory. These theories are very promising, seeming to unify quantum theory and general relativity and steering clear of the troubles which beset previous higher dimensional theories. In fact, according to Kaku, at the instant of creation our universe was a 10-dimensional supersymmetric universe with all forces and matter/energy unified into one entity!This book also delves into the origin and history of higher dimensional concepts, explained lucidly and brilliantly by Mr. Kaku. He explains that higher dimensional objects couldn't be visualized by us(3-D beings) and thus has to be viewed as projections or shadows on our 3-D space or even unravel them in our space(like a \\"tesseract\\", which is an unraveled hypercube). Kaku often drives home his point by explaining in terms of 2-D \\"flatlanders\\" existing in our 3-D world, which no doubt is a very easy way of understanding these kinds of concepts. This book will also explain theories regarding parallel universes, black holes, worm holes, time travel and death of our universe.I definitely recommend this book to those who want to have a glimpse of the future and understand and enjoy the various physical concepts which are being brought from the realm of science fiction to our present day reality."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"By the time that I read this book, it was already five years in print. Nevertheless, I did not find it to be outdated or repetitive of more recent books that I have read. In fact, the book laid a better foundation for many concepts that are handled only summarily in other books. The author traces the progression of thought that led to superstring theory, covering many difficult subjects, such as field theory, the standard model and supergravity, in an understandable way. But mostly I appreciated his attempts, through visual aids and analogies, to convey an understanding of dimensions that are beyond our immediate physical experience. The author is obviously an accomplished physicist and mathematician, but is able to communicate in an interesting and simple style. This ability to convey the essence of difficult subjects is what I consider to be genuine brilliance."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"Maybe you're not a brilliant theoretical physicist.Maybe you can't concieve of the microcosms and macrocosms that define the world we live in.Maybe you have trouble understanding more than 4 dimensions, and gluons and quarks.Maybe you have trouble even tying your shoe...

Einstein was looking for the Theory of Everything that would make quantum theory jive with his theories of the macro universe. A ten dimensional universe makes the mathematical formulas work. In Hyperspace, the laws of gravity and light merge. Light can be explained as vibrations (or strings) in the fifth dimension. Kaku uses graphics to illustrate the \\"logic\\" of a ten dimensional universe. In a two dimensional universe, or flatland as Kaku calls it, a figure is in jail. Escape is impossible. However, a three dimensional person can reach down and whisk the flatlander out of there into the third dimension. To a hypothetical jailer the flatlander appears to have disappeared. Kaku's string theory maintains that following the Big Bang the dimensions split off into the four we know of and the other six that are too small to see.So then, what are the implications of a ten dimensional universe? According to Kaku, space can be stretched until it rips or tears, providing a tunnel through space and time. And, voila, we have time travel and access to parallel universes. Think this is foolish speculation? Not if the physicists at the California Institute of Technology have any credibility. They've considered building a time machine, consisting of a wormhole that connects the past with the future. Of course this would require an energy source far beyond our limitations, but all we have to do is look at the past two hundred years for a model. Isaac Newton gave us the laws governing machines, leading to the Industrial Revolution. James Clark Maxwell gave us the fundamental laws of the electromagnetic force, ushering in radio, the telephone, the computer, lasers. In the 1940s when the nuclear forces were tamed we were confronted with the atomic and hydrogen bombs. Any civilization that masters hyperspace theory will become lord of the universe.Not only does Kaku simplify complicated science for the layman, but he also makes you feel optimistic about the future. Try Michio Kaku's new book VISIONS, in which he talks about conquering aging in the twenty-first century, DNA computers, and fusion engines that may take us to the stars.

That might be due to the fact that the subject matter is still in the theoretical stage. But, still, much of the book is anecdotal and many of the analogies used to explain the main theories are repetitive and off-subject. Plus, the book (and the information inside) is pretty out of date. Kaku often refers to things that might happen by the year 2000.

It's a very difficult idea for us 3 dimensional beings to wrap our heads around, but he manages to give a thorough and convincing explaination.

What good is a theory if it cannot be tested for hundreds of years? We'll just have to wait, Kaku says, leaving the intrigue of time travel, free energy, and alternate worlds in the same never-never land orthodoxy has always relegated them to. But several other researchers have already provided convincing evidence of higher dimensions, complete with testable models. Interested readers may refer to the work of MIT's Eugene Mallove, former NASA astronaut Brian O'Leary, Richard Hoagland and Thomas Bearden for starters.

It does a much better job on string theory and it is more current with the latest scoop on the second superstring revolution.The second half of Hyperspace is light on content. There is a lot of filler. After reading it, I thought that it was because there was not much else in the way of superstring theory advances. Hyperspace is truly outdated because of its '94 print date. The second superstring revolution began in 1995 which means you are missing out on a number of recent advances. Greene's book gives you the full history of string theory plus the most recent work which was much more fufilling."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"VERY GOOD book written by the extremely smart and well-rounded scientist.

What I found were paragraphs making analogies between wood and seeing things as made of particles and marble and seeing things as made of geometry. He then proceeds to say wood or marble, assuming that the lay person will \\"get it\\" better than saying \\"seeing things as made of particles\\" or \\"seeing things as made of geometry\\" without ever really attempting to explore the implications of each, in plain English or incomprehensible English. You'd think a mathematician would realize that a mere substitution of one term for a series of terms doesn't explain things better.Now, I did get a few mild ah-ha's out of this book, but nothing like I got, as a teen, from George Gamow's great book \\"1,2,3 Infinity\\", which went to much greater lengths to try to actually EXPLAIN things. There are a few points at which he does help illuminate something, but not mostly, in my opinion. He mentions things and the people who came up with them. Mentions the conflicting opinions and those who have them. He does not, however, spend significant time trying to make analogies that help non-mathematicians \\"get it\\".After purchasing this book and \\"Visions\\", I was left with a desire to sell both books (I never *sell* books) and a need to look further to get the explanations I continue to hope for."},{"Title":"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension","review":"This book covers a wide area of modern physics as it title suggests, and does so in an acceptably thorough manner, but the author often repeats himself and often ends up beating a dead horse (or two-dimensial worm in this case) with his tiring examples and writings.

Unique and superbly readable, this series deserves a place on the shelf of every mystery fan. One small note: This new version seems to have omitted the chinese-style illustrations found in the original printing - probably due to the (very low-key) nudity that the publisher found offensive."},{"Title":"Chinese Nail Murders","review":"I have read all of Van Gulik's murder mysteries and this is has to be my favorite. The characters are intriguing and some sinister. The end is satisfying and bittersweet, challenging integrity vs justice. I would, however, recommend you read the others first (chronological is good, Chinese Gold Murders is first) to get to know the main characters although this book can stand on on its own."},{"Title":"Chinese Nail Murders","review":"Although this is possibly the best of the Judge Dee series and it will stand on its own, one will appreciate how different it is and how much it stands out by reading the other \\"magistrate at work\\" books such as THE CHINESE GOLD MURDERS (recommended to read first as it covers Dee's first posting) and THE CHINESE LAKE MURDERS or THE CHINESE BELL MURDERS.The other books will show Judge Dee as the rational crime solver, administering his district sternly but always for the good of his people. In this book, Dee risks his career to pursue an evil woman. He feels sure she has murdered her husband and also her lover, but she has covered her tracks with great cunning.This story shows Dee's human side. He is greatly attracted to a woman who is not his wife. Mrs. Kuo is the beautiful wife of the local pharmacist, a hunchback. Dee is struck by how devoted the couple is to one another and how kind they are. The man serves as coroner to the local tribunal but it is the wife who gives the judge the greatest assistance in this, the most baffling of Judge Dee's cases.A sweet but sharp melancholy pervades the atmosphere of this riveting mystery. As always, a \\"cast list\\" is provided to help a reader with the Chinese names and the author's illustrations and historical notes can convince readers that they are enjoying an authentic Chinese mystery tale!

The explanations assume the student has mastered both of these first courses (but, let's be honest, students only remember a small fraction of what they were required to learn). The student is left to do extensive reviewing to prepare to understand these topics. A little review in each section would be helpful.Although the book is \\"very applied\\", it is also rather mathematically rigorous in it's explanations. This might be unnecessary for someone who isn't majoring in math. On the other side, a math major using this book might have difficulty with the physics.These problems are mostly easily resolvable with some work on the part of the student. However, the typos in this book can be irritating and confusing. Also, some of the exercises have obviously never been attempted by the author, because they do not have solutions, lead to dead ends, or have extremely complicated solutions requiring many pages or several advanced techniques not brought up in the book.Perhaps this book would be more appropriate at the graduate level."},{"Title":"A Very Applied First Course in Partial Differential Equations","review":"I had taught college physics for 15 years and did some laser research.

The autor not only devlopes all of the classica problems (heat, wave etc.,) and the necessary matehamtical tools ( seperation, Foruier series / transforms, & even 1st order characteristcs) better than most. But, he also incudes some really neat real world probelms (as projects) for example when covering Shcrodinger, on page 385, he considers the problem of transporting some plutonium on a cargo ship and devlopes a PDE to intepret what is the minum \\"critical size\\" of the box so that it is safe. So refreshing to see some real world probelms :)I would strongly recomend teaching from this book, and would consider it a modern age version of some of the older books that truly balance theory & applications ( such as Sneddon's \\"Fourier transfroms\\" )."},{"Title":"Power at Play: Sports and the Problem of Masculinity (Men and Masculinity)","review":"It's a kind of tedious read, but the central idea (at least what I came away as the central idea) is great: masculinity, and athletics aren't two bad notions in and of themselves. But when you put the two together, and not properly supervised, you can come up with some horrible stuff. He goes about proving this by interviewing some ex-jocks and comes up with some great material. It's basically a sociological sutdy, but works out nicely."},{"Title":"Double Passage: The Lives of Caribbean Migrants Abroad and Back Home","review":"Like all of Gmelch's books, this is well written in a non-academic accessible style. The book presents well-rounded and humane portraits of the complex lives of migrants, relating the Caribbean experience of movement to the sense of 'home' more effectively than most abstract discussions of transnationality. This would be an excellent choice for any introductory class on Caribbean culture."},{"Title":"The Making of McPaper: The Inside Story of USA Today","review":"I came across this book in a Bethesda library in the early 90s and still think of the story. It is a fascinating tale that shows how vision, ego, and ambition come together to develop a product unlike any before it. It is a story about the man behind the product and how he perservered. I enjoyed this book in the same way that I enjoyed The New New Thing about Jim Clark. I've recently bought my first house and have decided to go back and purchase books for my library that stand out in my mind as influential in the way I've looked at business and decisions I've made.

Neuharth is remembered for his approach to journalism but perhaps his real talent was in keeping everyone focused and somehow energized, in unison.

Go read everything Jane rule has written....Not everybody will like her style of writing, but it definitely is simple yet powerful at the sametime."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage","review":"I too read Gutcheon's novel More Than You Know and felt it was a wonderfully evocative story of downeast Maine, as well as a love story and ghost story. I cared about the characters, the various threads of plot intertwined in provocative ways, and I was left wanting to read more by this author.Very early on, Leeway Cottage was very a book that seemed almost pointless, with characters barely developed beyond their simplest histories. The characters run about, doing this and that, but seldom experience any understanding, unless the author tells us exactly what they understood. Characters are not revealed; they are described. The whole book reads like the To-Do lists of each character.There are inconsistencies. For instance, why, when the central character Sidney is starting out and is clearly trying to create a more humane and sensitive life for herself, does she become the nasty, self-centered person who shuns her husband's sister Nina because of her distant behavior? Nina was imprisoned in a concentration camp and endured horrors that wouldn't bear the telling; yet Sydney writes her off as snooty and her husband seems content to let it happen. Sydney's greatest sacrifice during WW II was difficulty getting good servants for her summer house. Sydney's indulgent arrogance is not consistent with her earlier struggle to become a more authentic person. We completely stop caring about her. Her life becomes a mere recitation of her shopping lists. Why attach poor Nina's story at the end? Why not as part of the narrative? Who cares about rich, dissatisfied people like Sydney? You will find nothing that enriches your life in the telling of Sydney's.Even the children's stories are oddly stunted. Sydney's son Jimmy is a delinquent and ne'er-do-well. One moment he is a miserable teenaged twerp who is given a tough last-chance job working as a sternman on a lobster boat but the next time we seen him, he has a wife, children, and a successful online gaming company. How exactly did he arrive at this point in his life? We are to guess at the intervening 10 years. You could have subtracted his character completely and it wouldn't have made any difference to the story. We learn nothing about him other than his mother spoils him and his sisters are jealous of that. Nothing more. I kept waiting for some character development other than descriptions of their days sailing on the coast of Maine and their inevitable aging. I was still waiting at the end of the book.Gutcheon has a gift for writing a good narrative and good descriptions. Because I know that part of Maine, I enjoyed at least that part of the book but that was all. Everything that made More Than You Know a good read was absent in this novel, except for her narrative skills. But if you are looking for anything approaching character development, conflict and resolution - all the things that make for good literature - forget it. It's not here."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage","review":"My wife recommended it to me; I read it and bought a copy for my sister. What strikes me, in brief, is that it is pitch perfect, depicts a range of very, very believable personal relationships, and also moves out from its local focus (a summer community on the coast of Maine) to take in circumstances of much greater scale and broad significance. In the end, a wrenchingly moving story."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage","review":"While I found the storie to be overall enjoyable it took a bit of time to get the feel of the authors intent. Would recommend the book but remember it takes a few pages to get into the heart of it."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage","review":"I'm still amazed that Beth Gutcheon's editor would allow this book to be released. There are two completely different stories here that do not work together, despite the fact that the main characters are touched by both. On the one hand, this is a novel of a twentieth century marriage, with its ups and downs. (And, as part of that story, there is the impact of a indifferent mother on her daughter's own ability to be a loving mother when it is her turn to raise a family.) And then there is the very moving story of Danish Jews during World War II. There is a recurring theme that Sidney, of the \\"first story\\" doesn't have any understanding for Nina's harrowing experiences during the war in the \\"second story.\\" The author cannot even find a way to reveal Nina's experiences and so throws it in at the end of the book, perhaps to make the reader feel that the book had more of an impact that it actually had. Very disappointing."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage","review":"Leeway Cottage tells a family saga through many years. The story involves social changes as well as involvement in, and results of, WWII. It is easy to read, and the characters are interesting, if somewhat inconsistent. Some of the segments describing the war did not seem particularly integral to the story as a whole, but the author does make the point that wartime tragedy remains a specter that affects individuals and families forever."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage","review":"I enjoyed Leeway Cottage and will look for more novels by Beth Gutcheon. I especially enjoyed her character development of Sydney. I started out feeling a bit sorry for her and then came to find her very spoiled and annoying and certainly out of touch with the realities of the war and what Nina must have gone thru (revealed rather oddly at the end of the book). I can appreciate the complexities of putting such a story together, but I too felt like I would have liked to know more about certain issues that were just brushed by. I do agree that the last part of the book was rather rushed towards the ending (beginning?) of Sydney and Laurus's deaths and their children's reactions. This was a book that could have been another 100 pages or so longer. It was very interesting and enjoyable reading though and I do enjoy this author. I also learned a lot about Denmark's handling of the Nazi invasion. They were very brave souls!"},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage","review":"I really loved this book. I was captivated by the story of the Danish Resistance and how the whole country worked together to save the Jews. I have already started reading websites and searching for other books to learn more about this subject. I thought the author described the Danish characters and stories just beautifully. The other story line (Sidney and her mother) was a bit weaker, but still enjoyable. I was pulled into the world the author created in Maine, but I just didn't like Sidney very much. I suppose we weren't really supposed to, as over time she seemed to become more and more like her domineering mother. Overall, a really special book that I just couldn't stop reading."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage","review":"First, this is two books in one. One skims over the surface of Sydney's life and family in Maine and the other deals with the plight of Jews in Denmark during WWII. Of the two parts, the Denmark section is by far the more compelling. However, the linkage between the two stories is very weak--beyond the obvious marriage/family connections. As I read the book, I kept thinking \\"And what...?\\" and \\"So...?\\" The interview with the author in my copy didn't help much: \\"America and Europe.\\" OK. Sure. Whatever. I assume that there was a reason this novel was called \\"Leeway Cottage\\" and not \\"The Resistance in Denmark\\" but I am not sure what it is.Sydney and her family are boring people. We learn next to nothing about them beyond what is on the surface. They have money and a house in Maine and go there and have a wonderful time sailing and socializing. OK. She changes her name from Annabelle to Sydney. OK. She has a selfish, egocentric, not-very-nice mother, who tries unsuccessfully to be controlling, but who is nonetheless far from a life-spoiling \\"monster mother.\\" OK. She has a spoiled brat of a son who seems to have turned out more-or-less well in the end after much minor trouble. OK. She has a long marriage that works and doesn't work in equal parts, but this is never really explained or explored. OK. She has a sister-in-law with whom she initially wants a warm relationship but can't establish one because their life experiences are too different and then resents her. (Are we supposed to understand this novel as a contrast between Sydney and Nina and their experience of life? Between America and Europe? If so, what nonsense!) She has an affair of some sort with a longtime friend and neighbor. OK. She doesn't understand other people at all and doesn't care. OK. As a old lady, she is bitchy to the hairdresser. OK. It goes on and on.The book often seems like no more than a list of biographical facts as the characters march through time. It is flat and one dimensional mostly.But just what does the author think that all this means? Who are these people? What do their experiences tell us about the human condition? What can we learn from them? Not much, I think. In the best novels, the characters live on the page and teach us about what it means to live. In the best novels, we are educated as well as diverted and entertained, often without realizing teaching is going on. In the best novels, we see the world in new ways and our experience is expanded. We come to understand the characters, their successes and failures, their essential humanness.To my mind, this novel does not do any of this. To my mind, this novel is a failure. I think the author would have done much better writing a thriller about the Danish resistance. Why is it that a theme that is removed in time and place--the subject of \\"research\\"--is more vivid and real than the theme that is \\"closer to home.\\" It does seem to turn the advice to write what you know on its head. It does make one wonder what the point of it all is."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage","review":"i ordered this book long before it was released in eager anticipation of another beth gutcheon book to add to my cherished collection. each of her novels is unique in setting, scope, and subject matter, and this one is no exception. i'm savoring leeway cottage slowly, like a hot cup of tea on a cold, rainy afternoon, and recommending it to anyone who love a well-written story with memorable characters and an entralling plot."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage","review":"I loved this book.

I've sent copies to friends who might enjoy it, as well."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage","review":"The characters in this book were so believable, not especially loveable, but certainly believable. The story ranges from Sydney's childhood to her death and the road from being an emotionally scarred child to a an emotionally scarring mother and grandmother. Unfortunately, so often we become the very people we have despised earlier. The plot involving the Danish resistance during WWII was very interesting and one that I have not run across in any other historical fiction. The writing was readable, precise, and compelling.The only reason I gave this a four star rather than five was the rushed feeling I got during approximately the last fourth of the book. It almost felt as we were fast-forwarding just to get to the end. And, although the chapter of Nina's horrific experiences in a German concentration camp helped explain her personality, it almost seemed a bit gratuitous, but it did provide a sharp contrast to the selfish and shallow yet sad Sydney.I would recommend this to any lover of historical fiction especially during WWII and after."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage","review":"Leeway Cottage by Beth Gutcheon is a wonderfully written story that is a blend of her vivid storytelling and obvious research. She paints such a clear picture of life in summer village in Maine, as well as the contrast between the summer residents and the lives of those upstairs and downstairs. The other portion the novel reveals a part of history that is unknown by many of the readers--wartime Denmark. I was familiar with the version of history where Denmark handed over the nation the Nazis but was certainly not aware of the nation's struggle to protect and preserve its Jewish population, and that it was done with such a massive success.Through the course of these two landscapes, Gutcheon details the life of a marriage and how that changes and evolves between two people, especially between two people from such different worlds. Her characters will have you switching allegiances throughout the book, an impressive feat.I finished reading this book with a feeling of love for Leeway Cottage as deep as that of the characters who spent their lives there. It is certainly a book that I will continue to recommend. It was purchased by my mother, who purchased a copy for me, and I then purchased a copy for my father-in-law."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage","review":"This book depicts the plight of Danish Jews as they went through the Holocaust experience. This book describes the horrible conditions in the concentration camps. You will learn what happened to the Jews and the people that helped save their lives.

The book also describes the toxic relationship of a daughter and a mother. You will discover whether the daughter transfers her miserable experiences with her mother or becomes a wonderful wife and mother. It also talks about five seperate and different marriages and the children born of these unions There is a very surprising ending that will shock you.You will become familiar with the characters lives before, during and after the war years. You will love some of the characters and despise others.I couldn't wait to turn the pages of this book as I lived the experiences that were so well described in this book.

The loose ends really bother me. Early on we learn that Sydney's father's first wife died from complications of childbirth. Later we are told she committed suicide and then nothing more. Very frustrating! It is hinted that Sydney may have been in love with a woman while Laurus is in Europe. We never learn more. Is this just a crumb to titillate or to indicate a change in Sydney? If so it is too inconclusive and leaves the reader feeling of dissatisfied. Jimmy, Sydney's son, drops out and does drugs for ten years. Other than Laurus getting him a job on a lobster boat early on to straighten him out--nobody seems to care. Wouldn't there be some parental hair pulling over this? So while it is a readable book I was left with a feeling of dissatisfaction."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage","review":"This is an amazing book! Starting with a light-hearted description of life among the privileged Maine summer people circa 1920s, one is plunged into the wartime years on both sides of the Atlantic. The two stories--one of fun and games at the Maine cottages, the other of desparate efforts to save Denmark's Jews from extinction--play against each other like the masks of comedy and tragedy. Beth Gutcheon has written a masterful novel based on what must have been personal familiarity with the Maine scene and careful research into the history of Denmark during World War II. I learned a great deal about both locales in a format that is well-paced, beautifully written, and a joy to read. This book shows Gutcheon at her absolute best and should be a real contender for national literary prizes. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage","review":"Few subjects are as dramatic as love and war. Beth Gutcheon, author of More than You Know, weaves them both in this enthralling story of a marriage set in the plush haven of Dundee, Maine, and against the horrific backdrop of World War II.Broadway and television actress Elizabeth Marvel gives a superb reading, especially when she inhabits the voice of Sydney Brant, a wealthy young woman who spent her days sailing the coast and her evenings at deb parties until she met the man to whom she would make a lifelong commitment.Upon the death of her father Sydney is left to grieve with a mother who is much more interested in social status and control. So, the young woman, who harbors hopes of becoming a singer, moves to New York City where she meets and marries Laurus Moss, a Danish pianist.With the outbreak of the War, Laurus feels compelled to go to London and become a part of a Danish Resistance group while Sydney remains behind. It is then, in 1941, that the first of their three children is born.Laurus's activities are a blueprint of what many endured in order to save more than 7,000 Jews, yet this danger is far removed from Sydney whose task is now mothering.One might imagine that the pair would not have much in common or would be disinterested once they're reunited. That's not the case at all as is revealed in this evocative story of marriage amidst war and separation.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage","review":"I am going to disagree with the other two reviews here about Leeway Cottage. The story was very good at the start and then seriously slowed down when we got to the war. It was hard to follow at times, and I certainly did not read anything that was laugh out loud funny. This was a serious story about family dysfunction and the effects of war.I honestly found myself skimming the book towards the middle and end just to be let down in the last two chapters. Talk about a quick ending.If you want to read a good book by this author, try More Than You Know."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage","review":"The only other book I've read by Ms. Gutcheon was 'More Than You Know', and I loved it. This book however was not nearly as entertaining or interesting.I'm not going to summarize this book, as many here have already done...but my opinion is that the characters were all one-dimensional. Sidney started out OK, with the father she loved passing away too soon, and left with her awful mother. She really wanted to be someone different then what she grew up with, but as she ages, she just turns into another run-of-the-mill demanding rich woman who summers in Maine.I gave this three stars because the idea of the story was interesting, I just don't think it was executed as well as it could have been. The two stories just didn't fit together, and the ending was confusing. What's with that last chapter?In the end...I'll still read Ms. Gutcheon's future novels, but I've learned not to expect as much as I did with this book, because I was definitely disappointed."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage","review":"i hate spending hours getting to know characters..then not knowing the rest of their story. the entire book held on to me until the ending. i kept waiting for closure that i never got. i LOVED More Than You Know by Beth Gutcheon and had high standards, and don't get me wrong, I loved parts of this book too, but the loose ends are DRIVING ME INSANE!!"},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage","review":"I thought I would like this book as the subject manner and descriptions sounded interesting. But the author would start a train of thought and then abort the idea and move on to another - I seemed like I was listening to an crudely abridged version! I will NOT read another of hers if this is the way she writes. I was very disappointed...this book could have been great!!!! The characters I felt were shallow and so much more could have been done to deepen their personalities, thoughts and feelings."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage","review":"Rebeccasreads recommends LEEWAY COTTAGE as a study of a mid-twentieth century marriage as seen through the eyes of a spoiled, self-indulgent young woman who is searching for someone to love her, while being incapable of loving her own self due to an affection-deprived childhood. Set as WII starts, Sidney is in New York to be a singer. There she meets & falls in love with Laurus Moss, a Danish pianist. After they marry & she becomes pregnant, Laurus realizes he has to go back & help his family in Denmark to escape. He makes it to London & joins the Resistance there, keeping in contact with his brother & sister at home, trying to get his parents out to Sweden.LEEWWAY COTTAGE is worth the read, about a remarkable saga of family life on both sides of the Atlantic during & after WWII, especially the research into the Nazi invasion of Denmark, the Resistance movement, & its survivors."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage","review":"Loved the story of the family drama.Gutcheon writes clearly, while painting a strong visual image.Similar style to Barbara Taylor Bradford-Women of Substance."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage","review":"If you are a book club member or better yet, a book club facilitator, this is the book for you. There is something for everyone in this novel. It is both a family saga and an historial novel recounting the Danish Resistance Movement in World War II. The author does an artful job of weaving the two elements together. Often in a book of this scope, the author reaches a point where he has to tie up the loose ends and the finale disappoints. Not so here. Gutcheon finishes on a strong note. The book is well-researched, well-written, poignant, insightful and laugh-out-loud funny. It doesn't get any better than this."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage","review":"I rarely if ever read other Amazon reviews before writing my own, but this morning in preparation for writing a review of Leeway Cottage by Beth Gutcheon, I did peek at one or two and am afraid I wasn't quite as taken with this book as I thought I would be. A long time reader of Beth Gutcheon's since her first book, Still Missing to her latest one More than You Know, I have always found her novels to be refreshing even taking on different themes and almost different writing styles each time. But after finishing Leeway Cottage, I wondered if Ms. Gutcheon took on more than she should have in one book. And now looking back on this title, I do wonder what point the author was trying to make since there were two very distinct storylines and they never seemed to mesh that well to me.The story begins with the well to do background of one of the main characters, Sydney, and how her ancestors built and lived in a cottage in a summer community. When Sydney is a young woman, good friends of her family live in Leeway Cottage which will be her home one day. Life is good for Sydney or so it appears. A Kennedy type life Sydney sails during the day and parties at night with her crowd of friends. Sydney is destined to come out at a debutante ball, attend college for a year or two, marry a wealthy man, bear children and hopefully live a happy life. But when her father abruptly dies and Sydney is left in her mother's demanding and at times abusive hands Sydney's home life changes considerably. And than a chance encounter with a Danish pianist, Laurus, and meeting him again in New York City when Sydney leaves home at 18, sets in motion two very different worlds which will soon collide.The first part of the book describes to readers Sydney's dilettante lifestyle. And while her life with just her mother is considerably difficult, Sydney also inherits a great deal of money from her father which when she's 18 allows her to leave her mother's home. This money also allows her to buy Leeway Cottage when it goes on the market. And shortly after the birth of their first child and war breaks out, Sydney retreats to Leeway Cottage renewing her old friendships but this time on her own terms as a wealthy woman in her own right. But Laurus does not return to Leeway Cottage with Sydney. As a Dane and a Jew, Laurus feels compelled to return to Europe and serve in the underground jeopardizing his life and marriage. And now we have a shift in the book as Sydney is at home o once again living the high life among society despite the war while Laurus is hard at work not only trying to save members of his own family from Hitler, but the lives of other Danish Jews as well.While I was familiar with some of the stories surrounding the Danish Resistance during WW II, I did learn more about this and enjoyed reading the historical information provided in this book. But then I began to wonder why I never felt the two distinct parts of the book never fully came together to tell one large story. While there were parts that were very well written I was left disappointed by the efforts of a writer who has done much better in the past. And just as I was about to finish the book I was further confounded by the last chapter and wondered if it was misplaced in the publishing process. After we learn about an illicit love affair which seemed to be written for shock value and the end of Sydney and Laurus' lives, Ms. Gutcheon returns to the war and describes Laurus' sister's life and release from a concentration camp. I still wonder why the author chose to end the book with these events since they seemed to come from left field.I really wanted to enjoy this book and recommend it to others as I have done in the past with other books by this author. I do think that Ms. Gutcheon was trying to chronicle a marriage between two people from different worlds and not necessarily suite for a happy life together. Or perhaps she tried to show the different lifestyles of two characters and how their desires ultimately affected their lives together. In the end, though, I thought that the author might have done better to write two books rather than the one she did. That way we would have had a much larger story of the Danish Resistance and the life of a socialite.If after reading this review you are still interested in reading worthwhile Beth Gutcheon books, I suggest you read her first book Still Missing or her wonderful paralleling story set over a period of 100 years, More than You Know."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage","review":"\\"Leeway Cottage\\" is so good that I tried to SLOW DOWN so I wouldn't finish it too fast...but I couldn't! All the characters are so vivid and interesting and Gutcheon does a fabulous job showing us their growth and change. There was a wonderful wealth of historical information about the Danish experience in WWII that I had never read about before in such rich, if disturbing, detail.To call this novel \\"great beach reading\\" is to trivialize its impact and depth...but it certainly is the book to select if you want to be transported this summer."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage","review":"I get the feeling that Beth Gutcheon knew a bit about the Danish resistance during WWII and created a story to fit around it. After doing extensive research of the role of the Danes in saving their Jewish population, she wrote the book. Unfortunately, the stories just don't mesh.I found Sydney to be an interesting and complicated character. I didn't care for her for most of the book, but I understood how she became the woman she was. All she's looking for is acceptance and strives her whole life for her mom's approval, even while taking joy in irritating her. The fact that Sydney herself alienates her daughters as her mother alienated her makes perfect sense. After all, her mother's behavior toward her guarantees that Sydney will never feel loved enough. In her mind she's under-appreciated and for once wants to be the center of attention. She achieves that with her frequent angry outbursts and by being difficult with everyone. She finally gets a measure of acceptance from her troublesome son, Jimmy, but only as long as she lets him do whatever he wants and defends him, no matter what the charges are and how guilty he is. Yes, Sydney drinks too much, is self-absorbed and spoiled and has no concept of the enormity of what happened to Jews in Europe during WWII, but she herself mentions how small her world is. Her experiences are simply too narrow. How many of us would have been the same way if we lived during that time?I was disappointed with the lack of info on Berthe's suicide after Sydney found out about it. What happened? And what about Sydney being found in the embrace of an obviously gay woman? What happened? After Candace and whats-his-face die, what happened to The Plywoods?The portion of the book spent in Europe was absolutely compelling. I would like to read an entire book on that alone. It was well written and inspiring. I put myself in Nina and Per's position and wondered if I would've risen to the challenge. The last chapter, which I presume to be part of Laurus's life movie, was brutal and I'm glad there wasn't more of that in the book, to be honest. But in the other parts of the book, Nina is no more a major character than her parents, Gladdy, etc. So, how strange that the only portion of the movie we see is about her, and not all of Laurus's life, like why he stayed with Sydney.One more thing - I reread the first chapter of the book, as I frequently do when a book starts in the present and then goes back in time. I'd forgotten about the big deal the kids made about The Dress they found in an upstairs closet. I had to really think about it and then realized it was the dress that Sydney wore at her Coming Out, when her mother came down in the exact same dress. I don't know. While it was a turning point in that it pushed Sydney out of the house, it just didn't seem memorable enough to warrant the treatment it got in the first chapter as if we were supposed to expect some big scene with the dress.Aaaanyway, I know I had some other issues with the book and would love to sit in a room with the rest of the people who wrote reviews, esp. the 5-star reviews, but I'll have to be content with reading further reviews to see if anyone can give me the insight I missed.One more thing, I read More Than You Know recently and didn't find it to be the Tour de Force that everyone seems to think it is. I obviously missed something!"},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage","review":"I came to Amazon after finishing the book hoping to find discussion of its many puzzles.As I read the book, I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop: was Annabee/Sydney the daughter of Berthe Hanenberger Brant, or of Candace? How did Berthe really die, in childbirth or suicide? How did James meet Candace, and why did he marry her?After going back through the book, I see that Berthe was supposed to have died in 1910, and Sydney was born in 1919. So that shoots that theory, but when Sydney began studying music after leaving home I thought for sure she was Berthe's daughter.I loved the Moss family story. I think I understand why Nina's camp horror chapter comes at the end: Laurus has died, and he is seeing the \\"movie in heaven\\" that shows \\"the scenes you missed and the parts you never understood.\\"The reader gets to understand some things, too: during Nina's visit to Leeward Cottage in 1947, she refuses to go pick up the crying baby, much to Sydney's irritation, and now we know why.I was hoping for more, after Nina's chapter. I wanted the missing parts of Candace's and Berthe's lives.After some brilliant childhood descriptions, the daughters' later lives were not well drawn in my opinion. I couldn't tell them apart, and lost track of who they, and Jimmie, married.One mystery, the affair between Sydney and Neville, was well dealt with. Another, the brief embrace between Sydney and another woman in 1943, remains completely veiled.Sydney was a puzzle all right.This would make a great book club discussion book, with collaborative minds to comb through all the little hints scattered throughout the narrative that are so easy to overlook."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage","review":"What a shambles this book is! There are three parts, basically. The first part is somewhat interesting as a family relationship builds, though it is weak overall. The center part about the Danish involvement in World War II is utterly fascinating and written to entice. The last part is a completely boring pedestrian mess! It's as if the writer just gave up after the WWII section and was forced to just keep writing about family members, basically listing a bunch of things that happened without any interest in the characters themselves. Then the last three chapters, which are completely out of sync with the storyline, are just thrown at us...attempting to explain a few bland statements made throughout the book.As an avid reader of about 20 books a year, I normally pass books on to others to read when I'm done, but I would NEVER torture anyone I care about by handing them this book to read. So I threw it out when I finished. What a waste of time and paper! And the sad thing is, if you got rid of the first part and the last part of the book, you'd have a thoroughly fascinating novel about the Danish involvement in WWII. THAT by itself would be the only thing worth reading. How sad that THAT intriguing story got bogged down surrounded by a bunch of rubbish!"},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage","review":"I have mixed feelings about this book. I enjoyed the beginning, reading about Sydney's unhappy childhood. She desperately wanted to be loved and approved of, especially by her stepmother Candace. She finally had enough and was strong enough to take her chances and pursue her dreams in New York. I also enjoyed the middle of the book about what it was like in Denmark during WWII. I don't know much about Danish history during the war. The stories of the Allies and Danish attempts to transport the Danish Jews and Resistant forces was inspiring. Reading what Nina went through in the camps was so heartbreaking.What I did not enjoy was the last half of the book after the end of the war. The book jumped around too much about Sydney & Laurus's complex relationship and the lives of their children and Laurus's family. I was disappointed that Sydney, who once seemed strong and independent enough to leave her home and seek New York, who took up carpentry and painting their new home, ended up turning into this neurotic person. I felt the author did not explain this change enough in the book. Laurus remained devoted to Sydney but I was left wondering why? Guilt perhaps? The children were one dimensional and the book jumped from their childhood to their marriage, and then their own children too quickly."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage","review":"When I first started reading this book, I thought it was going to be a family saga about debutantes with a summer house in Maine. Fortunately, that was not the case. The book actually revolves around WWII, especially the Danes' feat of protecting the lives of almost all of their 7000 Jews. Sydney, an aspiring teenage singer in the U.S., leaves her jealous mother, takes her trust fund, and moves to New York. There she meets Laurus, a half-Jewish Dane who becomes her accompanist. Shortly after they're married, he goes to Europe to assist in the war effort. The harrowing experiences of Jews in Denmark, including Laurus's parents, attempting to escape to Sweden, is the most gripping section of the book. The situation in Europe is sharply contrasted with Sydney's life, where she is remodeling Leeway Cottage, the summer home she has purchased in Maine, and giving birth to her first child. This book is largely about Laurus's and Sydney's marriage and their relationships with their children. Sydney begins to harbor animosity toward her daughters, just as her mother did toward her, and dotes on her son Jimmy, who can't stay out of trouble. The marriage itself is a big question mark. Laurus believes that in heaven you'll see a movie of your life in which everything is explained, and the author reveals the essence of the marriage in the finale."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage","review":"I liked this book on audio better that the written story.This is perfect car ride story that will gift you some historical mind candy about the Danish in WW2, we see how a young girl grows up to more like her mother that she would like to admit, get a mere peek into the like of a wealthy family and the rules that surround it, how a family just sprouts up, and how our parents seem to be more that we could have imagined. I loved that we never really got the idea smashed into our face that each character is in some way a hero in their own right. Each character has a journey that we could call a heroes tale. But I agree with the other reviewers: Yes there are unfinished storylines that keep us wondering and THAT is the point- all questions will be answered in the end when we meet our own \\"movie\\" in the sky. The author DID offer on a platter what was the unfinished story line of one character that was in the concentration camp and why she never married. It was not what we expected and that was gift."},{"Title":"Leeway Cottage","review":"This book needs an editor to either pull the two distinct stories together -- or, even better, delete the beginning and end and build the book around the middle. The middle is absolutely fascinating. I have read many books about WWII and the Holocaust, and this is the first time I've read about the Danish resistance and efforts to save the Jews. If the book was built around that, it would have been fascinating.Unfortunately, the beginning and end focus on an uninteresting family saga, with too many characters, and far too few compelling events. The connection between these two sections and the middle is virtually nonexistent. Even the style of writing is different, with some chapters starting with years and others not; some written in past tense, some written in present tense. There is no logic to any of it.And the end is a nightmare, going from the family, flashing back to experiences in a concentration camp, and then back to a love affair. None of it is clearly explained. I was planning to lend the book to a friend simply because the middle was so good. Now that I've finished it, I know I can't inflict it on anyone else because the end is so bad."},{"Title":"Chocolate for Breakfast and Tea: B&B; Innkeepers Share Their Finest Recipes","review":"Whomever said chocolate wasn't for breakfast is wrong!

We needed a medical dictionary for the words she was not familiar with. We found the Merriam-Webster's Medical Audio Dictionary. However, we opted for the Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary with CD-ROM. We are very pleased with this medical dictionary, primarily because it is bundled with the CD-ROM.The CD version of the dictionary includes a search engine. So, when doing transcription, the search engine can be used on the dictionary without having to pull out a book and sift through 57,000 definitions. This is a great bonus. The CD also includes abbreviations for the medical terms. They even included a feature allowing you to hear the word pronounced correctly. I only found one drawback to the search engine. When looking at the list of terms you have to click on a term to see the definition. Sometimes two words are spelled similarly and sound nearly the same. If the word you clicked on is not the word you need, you have to clear the search and start over - there is no way to return to the list of words from your original query. At least, we have not found a way to do so.The dictionary itself contains 57,000 medical terms with understandable definitions. The definitions are more limited than in Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary. For example, the MW definition of sclerosis includes reference to one other disease (multiple sclerosis). Dorland's definition of sclerosis includes references to about 40 varieties of sclerosis (including brief explanations of each). Therefore, the MW medical dictionary is not the most exhaustive on the market. It certainly would not do for a Doctor, but it is quite sufficient for a home dictionary. The MW medical dictionary is not illustrated, nor does it include abbreviations for the terms defined.Overall, the Merriam-Webster's Medical Audio Dictionary has met our needs. Since the hardback bundled with the CD was only about $10 more, we got both. The CD is great, but we still like real books too.

Edward Abbey's months of living alone in the vast, uninhabited lands of southern Utah, which most of us will never do, provides a unique perspective on the beauty of the Canyonlands and the outdoors in general. His rafting trip down the Colorado River before it was dammed gives an excellent taste of an adventure that is, unfortunately, no longer possible. And his descriptions of the Maze and its remoteness seemed almost like a fantasy - to amazing to be true. Though reading about the beauty and uniqueness of this area of the country is nothing compared to visiting it, his comments on tourism and the sprawl of American society are particularly relevant today. Coming from a man who is integral in defining the modern conservation movement, this book is a must-read for any outdoor enthusiast."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"no other author relates the spirit of the southwest like abbey. his undying love and acute perceptions make this book a must read for anyone traveling into the desert. hey even if you aren't going anywhere near sand you should read this just to see what you're missing."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"The summary above is a direct quote from Edward Abbey's introduction to Desert Solitaire, written in 1967. Utah's Canyon country, Moab, and Arches National Park must have been a remote, wonderful, wild, and inspirational place when Abbey was a seasonal park ranger there. The industrial tourism in US national parks, to which he so strongly objected, has indeed come to pass. This book is an eloquent and passionate plea for the preservation of wild places. It is a must read for anyone who has ever visited southern Utah or plans to do so. Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I read this book primarily because it is known as a \\"classic\\" piece of environmental literature. In my opinion, it does not deserve to be considered as such primarily because it is shallow. The basic message that there is value in wilderness for its own sake is obvious. Maybe it was not apparent in the fifties but is obvious now. In terms of preservation, Abbey does not offer any insights other than: stop building roads, stop population growth, keep things as they were in good old times when there was nobody around and i could build fires anywhere i wanted, throw tires in the Grand Canyon, and cut down trees if i felt like it. Not much of an insight."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"In 1968 Edward Abbey wrote a memoir, Desert Solitaire, A Season In The Wilderness, that would instantly be hailed as a nature classic, as well as his bestselling work. While familiar with EA's name the only work of his I'd read up to this point was a woeful collection of the man's \`poetry'. Believe me, when I say there's a definite reason for the quotes around the word poetry. Apparently the work is considered somewhat of a nature hymn, along the lines of Henry David Thoreau's Walden. This is a perfect example of poor criticism propagating myths down through the years. This is not to say that there is not some fine writing in DS, but neither its consistency nor tone are akin to Walden's....Although these events happened over 3 seasons, the book condenses them down into 1, for dramatic effect. It's a technique that can see such startling contradictions in the same book as this reluctant admission-\`As I type these words, several years after the little episode of the gray jeep and the thirsty engineers, all that was foretold has come to pass. Arches National Monument has been developed. The Master Plan has been fulfilled. Where once a few adventurous people came on weekends to camp for a night or two and enjoy a taste of the primitive and remote, you will now find serpentine streams of baroque automobiles pouring in and out, all through the spring and summer, in numbers that would have seemed fantastic when I worked there: from 3,000 to 30,000 to 300,000 per year, the \`visitation,' as they call it, mounts ever upward....Down at the beginning of the new road, at park headquarters, is the new entrance station and visitor center, where admission fees are collected and where the rangers are going quietly nuts answering the same three basic questions five hundred times a day: (1) Where's the john? (2) How long's it take to see this place? (3) Where's the Coke machine?'-& this contrapuntal admission that he basically understands why the previous lament was written:\`Standing there, gaping at this monstrous and inhuman spectacle of rock and cloud and sky and space, I feel a ridiculous greed and possessiveness come over me. I want to know it all, possess it all, embrace the entire scene intimately, deeply, totally, as a man desires a beautiful woman. An insane wish? Perhaps not--at least there's nothing else, no one human, to dispute possession with me.'While the book is not going to make the reader drop the book & take a breath, like the best of Loren Eiseley, Edward Abbey's Desert Solitaire is a book worth reading, not nearly so much because it is a paean to nature, although it occasionally is, but because it is an excellent portrayal of a man's state of being- a man who could be hypocritical, childish, write poorly, then surmount these flaws. If the same were true of most of EA's readers this last sentence would not be as cogent."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Well-beloved and much-reviled prophet of the wilderness and of the wild places, Abbey, like his uvre, covers a lot of ground. Desert Solitaire is probably his best work -- a statement Cactus Ed would spiritedly deny (right before busting my head with a rock).Conceived mainly while Abbey worked as a ranger in Arches National Monument (now National Park), the book is, in turns, a poetic evocation of the desert, a clownish middle finger upthrust into the face of the cosmos, a tirade against middle-America, and, above all else, an uncompromising voice bawling itself hoarse on behalf of nature.Do not misunderstand me; Abbey was no environmental activist, nor was he above decorating the Eisenhower Highways with his empty beer cans. Abbey howled for freedom; freedom from the tyranny of roads and universal access, freedom from development, freedom from the encroachment of the city and its ungainly cousin the suburb, freedom from any form of regulation or oversight... up to and including laws against littering.None of this has ever prevented the old iconoclast from becoming a patron saint of the environmental movement. Nor should it have done. Perhaps he littered the roads, but I love the cranky old bastard all the same. But for Abbey, how would I -- or any other member of my generation -- know what was lost when they flooded Lake Powell? Resist much, obey little.Check this one out, then drink a toast to Cactus Ed. Out of a can."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"One of the greatest books written about the environment - still I do not understand why we would kill trees to print this and not have a kindle version available..."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I bought this book seeking some insight into my own desire to escape to the Southern Utah region several times a year. Instead of a wise and intelligent 'father' of modern envirolmentalism... I found Abbey to be a hypocrit. He throws trash into the desert, thinks himself above the law, and disturbs fragile ecosystems as much or more than the people he rants on and on and on and on about. Disappointing."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"There's a hard to find video about Edward Abbey, that I bought at Ken Sanders Rare Books in Salt Lake City, UT. Check out their website if you're interested in seeing the video. It's a collection of interviews of friends and family of Edward Abbey, and the best story told in this video was the following.A daughter relates a story of her mother bumping into Edward Abbey at a party. After getting acquainted her mother confessed that she had never read any of his books, and she asked Abbey, that that if she were to read just one, which book should she read?Edward Abbey then took her into a separate room, and made a suggestion to her, the suggestion unknown to the rest of the guests. The daughter smiles, and says, she could never get her mother to tell her what book it was he suggested, because she was sworn to secrecy.However, one day she found in her room, a copy of Desert Solitaire.Desert Solitaire is the novel, along with The Monkey Wrench Gang, that Edward Abbey is best known for. Abbey claimed to never understand why the book became so popular because it took the least effort for him to write. I think that's what makes this book so powerful. It's told straight from the heart, mind and journal of Abbey's experience as a park ranger at Moab, Arches National Park.The novel very much is a stream of consciousness novel; a series of essays, with no effort to make a segue to the next. Yet the themes that stay constant throughout - passion about the wilderness, its protection and nostalgaic reverence - make it unnecessary.Some of his ideas were considered revolutionary and inflammatory then, but now we can read it and call them the voice of reason. Take in point, present government plans to create a parking lot outside of Zion National Park (which Abbey jokingly refers to as Zion National Parking Lot), so tourists riding bulky campers among other things will have to take a shuttle into the park during peak season.At times his stories are very political, then the next chapter can become very raw and personal. His story of getting trapped in a narrow canyon tributary of Grand Canyon is riveting, honest and really offers a surprising contrast to his &quot;tough and rough&quot; demeanor he takes on in many of his essays in other novels.Overall, the images and emotions he expresses are a gift to many outdoor enthusiasts. I know no one else who has put the desert experience better into words than Edward Abbey. And if I meet someone who knows and loves this book, I know that person has experienced the desert (whether or not they actually have set foot in one) much like I have.Edward Abbey tried throughout his life to write the Great American Novel. Though he never admitted it in press or writing (as far as I know...the only reference was when he gave Desert Solitaire a B+ I believe, in one of his introductions), I think he knew Desert Solitaire was his best novel. It was his most personal (this along with Black Sun), and thus, I think the reason he never embraced it publicly."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"As someone born and raised in Moab, Utah 5 miles from Arches and Canyonlands National Parks this book has been a foundational read for my life. The emotional attachment one experiences when surrounded by the desert and red rocks are captured in Abbey's beautiful writing. He saw in 1970 what was going to happen as \\"we discovered\\" the desert and we began to love it to a point of exploitation.This book is a masterpiece in environmental writing and a call to awareness that the earth deserves better than we humans often deliver. It also is the foundation for great writers like Terry Tempest Williams and builds on the legacy of Wallace Stegner.If you haven't read it, read it. If you have read it, read it again."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Stumbled onto this in my late teens in the early 80s and never looked back. Abbey's extreme love of nature and his well-defended loathing of what we've done to our natural world add up to a real eye-opener for those, like me at 18, who haven't thought much about how great this place must have been before we got here.Abbey's love of solitude and comfort in being in the middle of \\"nowhere\\" inspired me to seek out remote places and my life has been all the better for it. His irascible attitude towards government also strikes a strong chord, but the main joys here lie in Ed's awe and wonder at the magnificence of the canyons and mesas he happily lives with before the bulldozers and mindless tourists inevitably arrive. The bits about people driving in for a few minutes and then leaving after taking pictures are truly classic; Ed can be one of the most hilariously dry nature writers when the mood is upon him.I've since read most all of Abbey but still think DS is his masterpiece.This book should be in EVERY high school English curriculum."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I think this is far and away Abbey's best book. The prose is careful, precise, thoughtful. In my first year teaching, I would read a short section of this book every morning before climbing into the trenches, to remind myself what beautiful prose could be--regardless of the subject matter. (As an animal lover and vegetarian, I still have a hard time with his description of beaning the rabbit.) The book, I think, is definitely a \\"guy\\" book--but that's how my taste in reading goes, so I loved it back then, still love it today."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Somehow this book has gotten the reputation of being an extreme environmental rant. In fact, Abbey's recommendation for traffic control has been implemented in Zion to excellent effect.The book on the whole is very well written and is a poetic description of the desert southwest when it was still quite wild: before Arches became accessible and before the Glen Canyon dam created Lake Powell.My only complaint is that the cover of my edition shows a photo of Monument Valley, which is only briefly mentioned, instead of Arches, which is the whole book."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This book is the author's memoir of the time he was a park ranger at Arches National Monument in Utah. Edward Abbey was a true believer in maintaining the pristine, natural beauty of the desert area under his guardianship. Abbey was extraordinarily hostile to what he called &quot;Industrial Tourism&quot;: the construction of a system of roads through this desert wonderland which would brings thousands of tourists, their automobiles, and eventual ruination to the environment. He mentions the many pressure groups who threaten to turn Arches National Monument, and other national parks, into picnic grounds. Abbey admits that he would be happy if no tourists ever visited his park.Abbey describes desert scenery of great natural beauty and wonder. He often hiked in the desert area on unmarked trails, carrying with him the barest provisions, often risking his life on the possibility he may never get back. Abbey concerned himself with getting to his destination first, then worry about getting back afterwards. Tourists would never even consider taking such journeys. _Desert Solitaire_ is written in a style nearing poetry--blank verse--and was a total joy to read."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I recently visited Arches National Park. It is a place of beautiful contrasts -- stone eroded into unusual formations, standing red against a bright blue sky. Unfortunately, the park was experiencing difficulties associated with a skyrocketing number of visitors: destruction of trails, traffic congestion, parking shortages.Edward Abbey was a ranger at Arches Park during the 1960s, before a single paved road traversed the park, when it was an entirely different place. &quot;Desert Solitaire&quot; details his season spent in the wilderness, when he grew increasingly familiar with the power, beauty, and intensity of the Utah desert. His writing, much like the landscape, possesses a captivating depth and clarity.Sadly, Abbey foretold that his book would be an elegy to a place that would cease to exist. The Arches Park that he wrote about with such passion has disappeared, replaced by the colassal traffic jam he prophesized. Abbey's book stands as a warning to those who would pave over and develop even more of the natural world. It is already too late for Arches."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This book is a must read for lovers of the desert. Abbey's writing conjures up such vivid images that you feel as if you are with him on his rafting excursion or sitting with him behind the trailer that he lived in as a park ranger. He pulls no punches in his opinion of how we have abused our national parks. Abbey tells of his experience as a ranger in Arches National Park and if you have been there, his stories make you long to go back. My favorite story is one that he shares about a horse that fled its owners and lived in one of the side canyons. Abbey makes it a point to visit the horse. I won't say anymore lest I spoil it. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This is at once a hilarious and disturbing book - hilarious in that Abbey's flippant attitude and \\"I value nature more than mankind\\" take on life is refreshing and leads to a lot of awkward encounters; disturbing in that it highlights just how much environmental degradation North America has undergone. If Abbey was railing this angrily decades ago, one can only imagine what he'd say about today's state of affairs.Many people who've written negative reviews here have taken digs at Abbey's less-than-perfect character and belief system, but let's start with the book itself.Abbey undeniably has the gift of clarity. The genuine tenderness and reverence with which he evokes a lizard ducking behind a rock or storm clouds dumping a distant flash flood on the mesas rolling through the skies - it's really beautiful and evocative. You're THERE. The book consists of a great many loosely-connected chapters purportedly recounting \\"a season in the wilderness\\", when Abbey worked as park ranger at Arches National Monument in Utah. He explains that actually it was a couple of seasons, and various other anecdotes and trivia are thrown in throughout.Abbey cooks lonely meals, watches the dust and clouds blow by, helps ranchers rack up their stray cows for extra cash, gets lost in the mesas, and generally treats naive and arrogant tourists with a good deal of spite. Along the way, we're treated to his views on our decaying civilization, which he feels is relentlessly smothering the few remaining 'wild' places on the continent - which is essentially undeniable. His greatest qualm seems to be with the 'automobilizing' of the National Park system - adding paved roads throughout many of the parks so that one can simply drive through and 'see it all' from the comfort of one's vehicle. I couldn't agree more with his tirades on this topic, and I think the 'criticisms' of it here are worthless. These places should be explore by the power of one's own two feet - or barring that, by horse or donkey, or even mountain bike; but not by station wagon, for God's sake!!! As Abbey himself so succinctly puts it, the ones who are too young and small to handle it - they'll have their chance soon! And those too old and infirm, well, they already had their chance! One reviewer on here self-righteously declared (to paraphrase): \\"Well, I would NEVER be so selfish as to deny handicapped people the pleasure of visiting the National Parks by removing the roads!\\" But this strikes me as absurd viewpoint: to cut roads into so many wonderful places, to pollute them and so drastically upset the ecological balance within, for the insanely small number of actually totally handicapped people who would thus benefit... it is just not a fair deal for nature. Besides, if the billions of dollars spent paving over natural areas and forcing nature not to reclaim these roads by maintaining were, say, dedicated to research on better prostheses, cures for motor-impairment diseases, and improved BCI's (brain-computer interfaces, which promise to eventually allow even paraplegic or 'locked-in' individuals to manipulate various means of robotic conveyance merely using their thoughts), this problem would probably have been solved by now.Actually, considering how little actually happens in the book, it is a thrilling and addictive read. Abbey's solitary walk in the desert is enthralling, the way he writes it.Some people have pegged Abbey as a cynical old hypocrite, and in some ways this can't be denied. HE wants to enjoy the spaces, but OTHER people are just 'the masses', they just get in the way of his peace and quiet. He wants to remove all the roads from wilderness areas, but then takes off on the weekend and drives right into just such a place to relax on his time off. Etc. But I feel that if we're honest with ourselves, deep down everyone feels that way about nature, or travel, or what have you. Everyone wants to do these things, but they always find it getting spoiled to a greater or lesser degree by all the 'other people' in the parks, or all the 'tourists' on their foreign adventure - failing to recognize that everyone else, we are those 'other people' and those 'other tourists.' I think everyone is guilty of this.One final note on the infamous rabbit incident: yes, Abbey senselessly kills a small rabbit, but it is an accident. He is imagining what his situation would be if he were truly trapped and lost in the wilderness with nothing but his bare hands: would he be able to eat, to survive? He picks up a rock and tries to bean a rabbit just to experiment and to his great surprise actually nails it and kills it, though he's not lost or hungry. He walks away feeling a strong 'sense of power' but I don't think this is a reference to his blood lust - it is the sense of power and confidence he gained from realizing that even with no tools or equipment to his name he could potentially survive on his own skills and wits. That's how I interpreted this scene, in any case.True, Abbey can be a cantankerous old bast*rd, but I gotta say I like his style. I think he is fundamentally correct that the environment must come first, and human needs (and especially human wants and comforts) come in a distant second. After all, if we keep putting ourselves first, where exactly are we going to be living this 'better life' if we wreck our habitat along the way?"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Dare to be a rebel, try these Abbey recipes for yourself in the Southern Utah Wilderness."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Author just drifted on and on and on about observations that seemed more focused on showing his percieved intellectual superiority than substance. Reminds me of a sermon from church where the speaker sees how many words he can apply to the concept of sin, dragging the message on and on and on to add time but very, very little substance."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I was disappointed with this book. I expected informative and interesting descriptions of the desert southwest, and there is some of this. However, the author gets so carried away with inappropriate political discussion and criticism of almost everyone and everything, it really detracts from the story. I actual skipped through some of these parts. When he does stay with the natural descriptions, the author is knowledgable and actually quite poetic. Some of his descriptions are over-the-top though with tedious classical and cultural references. Would not recommend this book. I'm sure there are much better books with stories and information on the desert that avoid the political extremism."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I agree totally on everything said.If you're too lazy to get your butt out of a car,you shouldn't be there,when all you're doing is lousing up the wonderful town of Moab.Having been there yestarday[the sixth of April,2000]I am even more sympathetic to his views.

The casual cruelty to various animals is bad enough; the condescending racism against the Navajo is more subtle but much worse; the author's self-admitted loathing for the rest of humanity seals it up in a nice neat packageI give this book a \\"5\\" because it actually delivers something quite valuable in today's world of packaged sound bites, and practiced and wholesale misrepresentation: an in-depth and accurate view into the \\"liberal environmentalist\\" soul. Abbey lets it \\"all hang out\\" here, and this book is a \\"must read\\" for those undecided in their moral judgment of the environmentalist mindset."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This is the first Edward Abbey book I've come across. At first enticed by his espoused love of desert beauty, I stopped short in mid-sentence somewhere early on, disappointed, disgusted and disillusioned; I had been led unsuspectingly into witnessing his sudden, heartless, unprovoked murder of a completely harmless small animal. I couldn't agree more with the words of another reviewer; \\"he [the author] picks up a rock and kills a rabbit just for the fun of it, and then talks about how he felt no remorse, only power, as if he had received the \\"spiritual energy of the rabbit\\" after killing it. He was energized afterward, extremely pleased with himself.\\" Abbey sounded alarmingly close to psychotic. For all his lovely use of language, seemingly profound nature-loving insights and proclaimed appreciation of animal and plant life, Edward Abbey is an insensitive jerk. Obviously it will be the LAST Abbey book I ever pick up. If this review saves just one person from spending money for an insensitive slap that can take your breath away, then the time I spent to warn others will have been worth it."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This was just a travel log...almost just a daily journal. I expected a story line; a plot. It became more and more of the same, and less and less interesting. When it ended, I was shocked, and my response was, \\"that's it?\\""},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"You've got to admire a man known as the quintessential evironmentalist who writes so gleefully about trashing nearly everyplace he goes. This book is above all humorous and that by itself would make this book enjoyable. Abbey is also a good story-teller. And Abbey is a good naturalist also.The book chronicles a few seasons Abbey spends as a seasonal ranger in Arches National Monument (now a Park). Abbey describes the environs adequately but in no great depth. What is fascinating is how Abbey relates to the environment and how he interacts with it. Also included are a few other excursions like his float trip down Glen Canyon prior to its flooding by the dam.My favorite parts are the dumb things Abbey does in the environment. Maybe Abbey is saying that is why we need wilderness. We need someplace to lay naked in the sun, burn down, carve initials into trees, or to get away from tourists. My favorite story is when Abbey lights a wildfire in Glen Canyon with his careless bumbling and runs and jumps on his raft just as the flames roar up to the beach. And Abbey seems to enjoy trashing the environment whenever possible doing stunts like rolling old tires into the Grand Canyon (through a mule train) and continually laying naked out in the boondocks somewhere. He also likes carving his initials in various places. His antics with the tourists who seem to bother him in spite of his job being to help them are priceless. There is also a humorous account of being a part of a search for a missing (and dead and bloated) tourist.All in all, an amusing read more for the insight into Abbey than into the places he visited. And let me also throw in a quote from Abbey's intro. \\"The time passed extremely slowly, as time should pass, with the days lingering and long, spacious and free as the summers of childhood. There was time enough for once to do nothing...\\". Anyone who can think and write like that deserves to be read."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This is a totally enjoyable and recommended book. My only problem is that the author as a National Park System ranger does so many dangerous things that cannot be condoned. Please do not follow his example. It is very dangerous to do the following, as he did.1. Hike through the desert without a supply of water. 2. Climb a 13,000 foot peak alone with no one to go for help if needed. 3. Sliding down a 2,000 foot snow slide without proper equipment. 4. Rafting down the Colorado River without a life vest. 5. Descending alone down a canyon for a short cut and getting stuck in a deadly position, with no way to get help. 6. Hiking many places off of established trails all alone. 7. Hiking so far that it requires a more dangerous return in the dark of night. 8. Starting wild fires due to carelessness with pipe smoking. 9. Trying to capture a wild horse all alone and getting run over. This was done while all alone with no possibility of getting help if injured. 10. Drinking water from any available creek, pond or seep. Western water is now dangerous to drink in all western national parks. Treatment is necessary. 11. Eating five eggs and half a pound of bacon for breakfast. Is this the reason he died so young?Many tourists may read this book and follow his bad examples. I wish that he had given more words of caution. Follow the advice of more knowledgeable park rangers. Enjoy this wonderful book but be careful."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Part-polemical essay on conservation, part-journal of his experiences as a park ranger in Arches Monument National Park, Abbey writes with sparse, beautiful descriptions and expounds upon his ideas for conservation of our national parks. His ideas are fascinating, and as more and more of our national parks and monuments are paved to make them user-friendly, Abbey's book becomes more and more important, especially in light of our current administration's (lousy) attitude regarding the environment.

After finishing it, I wish I was introduced to Abbey sooner. The book clearly defines the boundaries that exist between the desert and civilization. Abbey's focus is on the enjoyment that people can have by leaving their inhibitions and mechanical inclinations behind before they venture into the desert. The most interesting aspect of the book is Abbey's belief of anthromorphism(behavior that is similiar to animals). At times, his writing can appear crude and sexist; however, the book is a great read for anybody who is interested in nature."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I had to read this for my American Literature class.

The author's prose is poetic in its description of the desert, but doesn't leave the reader to wonder his meaning. Mr. Abbey is not a pretentious writer. He is an outdoorsman expressing himself in a folksy manner.For anyone who has visited the desert, e.g. Grand Canyon, Zion, the Eastern Sierra, you will soon visualize Edward Abbey's words and feelings. He describes the desert and its inhabitants (animal and plant life) in such a way that the reader will soon find himself walking along with him. You will also realize the time of year you are exploring the desert and canyons, watching the cloud formations, feeling the touch of the rain or snow, and experiencing the bitter cold or extreme heat.Mr. Abbey can also get crusty at times, especially when he expresses his philosophy about the protection of the wilderness. He is especially negative about the presence of an abundance of automobiles invading the National Parks and other wilderness areas. Justifiably so!My only regret is that I purchased this book as an e-book to be read on my Kindle. I have only myself to blame! This is the kind of book that should be shared with others, which is difficult to do with a Kindle. I would also like to go back and re-read certain sections of the book or locate certain quotes, which is not impossible, but again difficult. Gosh, I miss a Table of Contents.

Love it!"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Ed Abbey was right, correct, spot-on.Visit Arches National park, try to backpack there and you'll discover that many areas are off limits. Why? The living crust of the soil is damaged by foot steps. Now a handful of people stepping on the soil won't creat irrevocable harm but thousands of boots, shoes, sneakers and sandals each week have a way of doing just that. How is it that so many feet trample this fragile ground? The damned roads the park service built to ferry auto tourists in to nearly every notable geographic feature is why and Ed Abbey predicted it decades ago in Desert Solitaire. Hell I've seen an incredible amount of change occur there since my first visit in '84 or '85 and its not the good kind of change.So if you are of the mind to walk to these places with a pack on your back and enjoy the healthful beauty of it all, you are S.O.L. you'll just have to drive, pumping more green house gases into the atmosphere going up and down the hills.Desert solitaire is a great book, written by an actual human being with faults and worthy ideals that he might not have always lived up to but which are nonetheless valid. Its almost a guidebook to the area and I'm glad I picked it up 30+ years ago."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I really enjoyed this book overall, and think you will too if you like reading about the American Southwest---before speculators, land developers, and other capitalists came with intentions to \\"develop the land\\" and make money off it. Abbey loves the southwest, and loves being alone in it, to revel in the mystery and beauty of the desert canyon country. How refreshing to read about Arches National Monument--which had a dirt road entry instead of a paved highway. Abbey gives you a glimpse of how this vast canyon region, and Glen Canyon was before WE came. There is an incredible chapter about his float down the now under water and dammed Glen Canyon.This book is a compilation of adventures, musings and rants from his time in the desert country of Utah. Some parts better than others. I can't say I agree with everything Abbey says, or put him on some pedestal where he is beyond reproach--which he certainly isn't. For example he comments on Jazz music saying \\"Jazz is indoor music...from melancholy nightclubs and sad nighttime rooms...a joyless sound, for all its nervous energy\\". Being a Jazz lover I couldn't disagree more, and I think here Abbey reveals his own narrow (dare I say ignorant?), misguided opinion of Jazz music as a genre. To describe Jazz as \\"joyless\\" is laughably wrong.In any event, this is not a book about Jazz--but a great tome waxing about the beautiful desert country of the American Southwest! I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Awesome book, very informative, no Complaints at all!!

Abbey's descriptions of the canyon lands are heart felt. You can just picture hundreds of tourists, driving a loop road through Any National Park, USA, and feel his frustrations. But more importantly, he describes wilderness to hundreds of people who might never experience it."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I originally read the book in the early 1980's and continually reread it to refresh my memories of the most compelling, stark, unforgiving, beautiful, lonely, introspective, sensative, sensational and sensual landscape in the world. The author and his book are monuments, and unfortunately perhaps lone sentinels, to the passion that the red rock desert of the American Southwest inspires in the people who love it."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Desert Solitaire is one of Ed Abbey's best known books and exemplifies his unique talent for turning the medium of the essay into something both highly artistic and down to earth. Though apparently proud of his rough exterior and offensive, controversial opinions, Abbey demonstrates in his non-fiction the heart of a poet. This book is worth reading for the amazing sentences alone. If you know the West, this book will bring it home to you. If you do not, it will infuse some fierce love into your soul that, I believe, will eventually draw you to it"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This book is awsome. It is hard to believe that 30 years later some of the same problems exist for the NPS. Abbey definitely was a visionary. This book is the best account of real life in a fabulous place. It takes you back to those National Park visits when life was simple and people didn't mind getting out of their car and walking. Today everyone thinks they can &quot;experience&quot; a park from their car, Abbey understood this was coming and didn't mind giving his idea's on the subject. The descriptions of wildlife, flora and fauna are fantastic. You can almost smell the wild flowers. If you really want to experience the canyonlands of Utah, read this book!"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This book does a wonderful job at describing and invoking how it feels to be in the outdoor West--in the hot sun, on the barren mesas, wandering lost and happy through the deepest canyons.Edward Abbey was a strange yet understandable contradiction of a man--a man who wrote that it would be worse to kill a man than a snake yet who once killed a rabbit with a rock just to see if he could do it. A man who passionately opposed the destruction of the West, yet who admitted to anarchistically throwing beer cans out his truck window as he drove.Edward Abbey wrote about the West as if it was a place where not everything was ruined yet, as if there was still a sort of bright, outdoor innocence about things, as if it was a place where a person could soak in sunlight reflected off orange canyon walls, splash in a muddy desert stream, or drive a dusty road with the windows down.And it was.And it is.This book is a protective love of the West in a nutshell. It's a series of orange canyon walls distilled into english. It's hawks and vultures and rising heat transmuted into letters and punctuation. It deserves its reputation.I buy almost every used copy I can find of this book, and I give them away just as fast, to my friends from the East who come west, and to all my friends who love the desert.Read it, buy it, and see what he's writing about for yourself. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Mr. Abbey has filled this book with many thoughtful observations of the desert, and life in general. This book should be mandatory reading for any present day backpacker or outdoorsman."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Abbey receives a sympathy vote from me for several reasons: This is one of his first works, and it's also the first one of his that I read. But my review here is based upon re-reading the work almost 20 years later.Edward Abbey is a man at home with himself. One gets the impression reading Desert Solitaire that he is always by himself, even though he was married, and had several children. I've no doubt he was a loner, and the ideal world he portrays is one where Abbey travels the world alone with nature - talking to snakes, chasing wild horses and cows, and observing nature's interplay, far from the meddling influences of humanity. As a ranger in utah, he views the intruding, artificial world of we termite-people with disdain. As a writer, he builds on this and other themes in a matter-of-fact, yet deeply challenging way. This is the style of writing he came to be known so well for in his later works.Environmentalists like to claim Abbey as their spokesman, and Abbey definitely gave the appearance of a nature-lover. But I'm more inclined to think of him as a &quot;human-hater&quot;. I think he knew deep-down that humans are nature's spawn, and nature has always been powerless to be pro-active in perserving its various features. Nothing is sacred, including the wonderful architecture of the Colorado Plateau. Abbey was deeply in love with the alone-ness that the area represented to him, and was every bit as deeply angered by the ever-increasing ranks of people intent on despoiling it. If that's an environmentalist, then so be it. But in Desert Solitaire, there is never any pretense that man and desert could ever be compatible. Indeed, if there is any point to be made, it is exactly the opposite.You'll find it tough being the bad guy. Nevertheless, it'll be every bit as hard to put this book down. Read it and weep."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Edward Abbey's collection of essays about his work at the then Arches National Monument(which he calls National Moneymint to mock the villains who wish to pave over everything). Abbey does have some good points, like we should stop trying to pave over things to make it more convineat to see nature. The whole Glen Canyon tragedy is told, foreshadowing the novel &quot;Monkey Wrench Gang&quot;. I did like his wide knowledge of philosophy and the desert fauna and flora, and I relate to his love of the desert, but his prose is a bit(forgive the pun) too arid, and I had to slog through parts of the book. On the whole, I recommend it."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Great read for anyone looking to escape the city. This author is incredibly insightful and makes this book not just a liberal nature walk. Worth the read even if you are not as much of a conservationist of nature as he is."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This is all over the map. It's a hermit's reflections on a world that moves too slowly for the rest of us to see. It's a naturalist's insight into the behavior of animals and people. It's a political extremist's commentary on unchecked development and resource depletion. Best of all, it's a delicious anthem of love that sings from the pages, affirming the connection some humans have with the natural world of sun, snow, snakes, and stone. You can't read this and remain untouched by its sincerity, even if (or perhaps because of) Abbey's attitude: a cactus bloom, all fiery beauty encased by sharp needles. Like a masterpiece painting, it really doesn't matter what it's \\"about\\" (some dude who becomes a park ranger for a year); it's really just a vehicle for communicating the deepest realizations of an honest questing soul."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"We read it for book club, and while some members liked it and some thought he was anti-animal, it really did not leave much to be discussed. It is well written description, but it moves at a Brady Bunch speed."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I first read this book as a geography major in college (20 years ago). I feel in love with the Basin and Range country through reading this book. The detailed descriptions of the desert by Abbey left a permanent picture of the life and beauty of America's hottest environment. Abbey's passion led me to appreciate what I have termed God's Country. The imagery kindled my excitement still to this day!"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Published in 1968, Desert Solitaire narrates in journal-style Edward Abbey's trio of summers in the desert surrounding Moab in southeastern Utah. Although he was there during the mid-twentieth-century, before the Department of the Interior had commercialized and touristized Arches National Park's 33,000 acres quite to its current condition, Abbey is close to prophetically critical about rape of the land by government and industry in order to accommodate outsiders and garner profits, actions that began to ruin it as habitat for native species. In other ways, the author chronicles with no apparent sense of shame his own complicity in ruining the land by littering, in violating animal creatures who depend upon it for sanctuary.I truly enjoyed how his clear, elaborate descriptions of the desert scape and its flora transported me back to countless times I've visited and loved Utah's (Arizona's and New Mexico's) desert spaces, though half as many words would have conveyed the flavor just as well without getting as plain boring as it sometimes did.Apparently Desert Solitaire became somewhat of an undergrad / hippie cult essential (note the publication date). Although I'm happy to place it on my list of famous books I've read, and I found its reputation way overhyped, indeed it is \\"good in parts.\\" The desert has been one of my own best healing places; it must be because \\"Love flowers best in openness and freedom.\\""},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"We share Abbey's love of the desert southwest. We enjoyed his descriptions of the native flora and fauna. We also admired his willingness to explore the back country with a minimum of the comforts of home. Abbey is highly literate and his prose is excellent.He does have the arrogance that we see in so many state and national park employees. Namely, the parks are so sacred that really only a special few should be allowed in them. Preferably just us (the employees). He is able to say anything he pleases about the park patrons because he is a public employee whose check will be there at the end of the week, pretty much no matter what he does or says.In the end, we can forgive him though. We will not judge him as he has judged those of us that enjoy national parks. He does drink, smoke, and eat too much fat (sorry, I judge). The national parks of southern Utah are spectacular. I have toured most of them on my motorcycle (sorry Edward, but it does get very good mileage and it has a quiet muffler). Arches and Canyonlands are must sees.The book is a worthwhile read, ok, I read it twice."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"An interesting book dealing with much more than the desert. The author combines facts, sub stories and opinion to create a very thought provoking book. I have recommended it to one of my sons who lives in Albuquerque."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"As someone who has spent numerous summers as a wilderness ranger for the National Forest Service in the mountains in Wyoming, I was able to relate to many aspects of this book that others may not without seeing the \\"inside\\" workings of the NPS/NFS. However, any experienced naturalist would be able to relate to the authors observations. I liked his method of presentation, using notes from his journals yet performing a narrative. He has had the experience and time to observe and think and I appreciated his views on the subject matter. A good read for anyone interested in the day to day of living with natural surroundings and the superimposed element of humans fingerprints. This is NOT a National Geographic Special...but a very REAL presentation of the subject and the authors obviously educated opinions of it. I am glad I bought it, and at an exceptional price."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Probably one of Edward Abbey's greatest works. Have read it many times (including once while I was camping at the Arches...best way to enjoy a book...read it at the place that it takes place). The depth of his understanding of people and places is awesome. When I was an undergraduate in Colorado, his works were required reading in some classes. They opened our minds to the world and challenged us to take a active part in trying to make things better.geogbob@hotmail.com"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Ed Abbey was way ahead of his time. Just as the Beat Writers of the late 1940's and mid 1950's were decades before the socially conscious Hippie Movement of the late 1960's. It's ironic that so many years after, \\"Desert Solitare\\" was published in 1968, in a modern world obsessed with pressing toward progress and pushing the envelope with entertainment, it is still a polarizing piece of literature. Abbey's observations about society at the time were right in step with his observations of the natural world around him at Arches, the Canyonlands, the undammed mighty Colorado, and even the dead man at Grandview Point. Abbey writes things down in print that cross all of our minds at one time or another, that is - if you lived in the American Southwest. He was brave enough to publicly attach his name to his innermost thoughts. Abbey's collage of stories chronicalling his years as a volunteer Park Service Ranger are well thought out, and equally well communicated to the above-layman reader. The book is a collection of stories from years gone by. Even as Abbey claims in the introduction, these places (the ones that the specific stories describe) no longer exist. That's true in the context that society had moved forward. This context in which Abbey viewed his surroundings no longer existed. The actual natural sights will outlast humans. That simple late fifties, early sixties world is what is gone. It was through those eyes and that heart Cactus Ed penned his greatest novel. If you ever spent anytime in the American Southwest, this is a must read. If you've never traveled West of the Rockies, you owe it to yourself to read this book. Some of the ideas and prose may seem alien to you at first. That's OK. The novel conveys the mindset of living in a remote area of the Earth where yes, there are no other humans around for prolonged periods of time. Your perception of yourself changes as a result. You become more important in your eyes, because all you have to ponder on is yourself. That's the point many negative reviewing readers miss when reading, \\"Desert Solitare\\". Yes, Abbey is consumed with himself at times. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE AROUND! No people, no new \\"news\\", no radio, no TV, just a man and his thoughts. A wonderful tale of a bygone era!!!"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Wonderful and classic work by Abbey.

Less engaging are his diatribes against the forces bringing in \\"progress\\" to the wilderness."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This book was formative for me and my appreciation for nature.His bigger contribution though is that of philosopher and poet.The new forward is a gem.

After spending many, many hours hiking through the desert around Tucson, I realized Abbey's attraction to it, as well as his warnings about it.

Tucson doesn't deserve its beautiful surroundings."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Excellent. A must read for all with a concern for the American West."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"When this book first came out, it started a nationwide cult, primarily of college-aged students, who suddenly became entranced with nature and began to rally against the forces trying to contain it. Although he had written three prior books, this was Abbey's first major success as he relates stories from his two summers as a Park Ranger in the Arches National Monument in southeast Utah. There is no straight narrative here, just bits and pieces from his experiences in this desert land. He also finds time to boat down the Colorado River through the Glen Canyon before it is forever flooded by another massive dam. Although I stuck with this book to the end, I found it more sleep inducing than inspiring. Although written well, Abbey seems to find it necessary to include the names, both English and Latin, of every single plant and bush that grows in this desert. He even endlessly names the rocks. Then he goes on to the stars! And that trip down the river was mostly repetitive glimpses down side canyons. However, this is a forerunner to one of my favorite books, Abbey's \\"The Monkey Wrench Gang,\\" as he gives us glimpses into the beginnings of eco-terrorism with the pulling up of surveyors' stakes and the destruction of billboards. I have read the \\"Gang\\" many times, \\"Solitaire\\" will just be once."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"It must be difficult when you are right, you know you are right, and the rest of the world is wrong. For Edward Abbey you release your frustrations in the form of an endless rant. While the few places he writes about the desert and Arches National Monument (now a National Park), make for a good read, the rants are both endless and idiotic.He rants and rants about letting tourists drive their cars into Arches. He proposes, \\"No more cars in national parks. . . . [K]eep the automobiles and the motorcycles and their motorized relatives out.\\" Of course he drove into Arches to the house trailer he would be living in while in the park. You can bet the house trailer was towed in by a motorized vehicle. He got a delivery of 500 gallons of water via a tank truck on his first day. He also got a Park Service truck delivered to him to drive. He also got permission to drive the truck to town once a week for supplies. He continues to rant on and on about allowing vehicles into any Nation Parks. He does show his softness by allowing the aged and infirm to be transmitted by shuttle buses. For children too small to be carried in or to ride a bicycle in, he would not permit entering. What a guy! The word hypocrite seems to fit here.He launches into the problems of the Navajo. He provides a simplistic monologue of how they could better them selves. One of his amazing quotes is, \\"He (referring to the Navajo people) lacks the drive to get ahead of his fellows or to figure out a way and means of profiting from other people's labor.\\" He goes on to suggest solving the problems of the Navajo, \\"[W]e may soon have to make birth control compulsory.\\" I won't even comment on his solution of the Navajo \\"problem.\\"Then he suggests that wilderness is necessary. Here is his quote, \\"We may need it someday not only as a refuge from excessive industrialism but also as a refuge from authoritarian government, from political oppression. Grand Canyon, Big Bend, Yellowstone and the High Sierras may be required to function as bases for guerilla warfare against tyranny.\\"The ONLY reason to read this book is to discover what a complete idiot the author is. He describes himself as a desert rat. Perhaps he spent too much time in the desert sun without wearing a hat."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I picked up this book because I thought it was written by a nature lover. I was misinformed. The only good thing I can say about this book, written by a ranger at Arches National Park, is the fact that the author died at the relatively young age of 62. Why is this good? Because in his book he mocks and then jokes about the accidental death of a visitor to his park, a 60 year old gentleman who got lost and died of exposure. Abbey thought this was a good death--the man found a perfect place to die. Great view! Besides, at this man's age it was time to go-- old people need to make room for the young (him). The \\"old man\\" certainly did not die a good death, unless you consider exposure and dehydration a pleasant experience. Try reading \\"Touching the Void\\" by Joe Simpson to discover what such an experience might be like.To be certain, Edward Abby is not a nature loving man. In one chapter, he picks up a rock and kills a rabbit just for the fun of it, and then talks about how he felt no remorse, only power, as if he had received the \\"spiritual energy of the rabbit\\" after killing it. He was energized afterward, extremely pleased with himself. No, he didn't kill the rabbit for food like any self respecting hunter would do, he did it because he wanted to, because he could. He shows an admirable respect for snakes, but that isn't enough to make up for the absolutely disgusting, cruel way he treated the cows he and two other sadistic individuals were paid to round up. He beats them mercilessly with wet ropes, comments on how ugly they are, is indifferent to the many calf's crying, the animals' heat and exhaustion and laughs when another \\"cowboy\\" kicks an exhausted cow to death. Cows don't matter to him at all, and Abbey thinks they deserve the meat hook at the end of their journey.He repeats a tall tale people swear to him is true, about how a corporate miner swindled a gullible potential miner out of his money, seduces the man's wife, and then shoots him in the woods. No big deal, he's just retelling a story he's heard, right? But then he goes into great excruciating detail about the likely last days of the murdered man's ten year old son and how much agony and pain he endures after days and days of trying to survive in the canyon all by himself. You realize pretty quickly there is no way anyone could know these things--what the boy felt as he starved and ate the psychedelic plants, whether or not he floated in and out of consciousness while the sun burned third degree burns on his back. The boy is supposedly found alive, still clutched to the back of a tree after floating naked down a river, but dies without ever regaining consciousness... and it's not surprising at this point because you knew he was making up the story as you are reading, but you have to wonder for a moment why anyone would take so much pleasure describing such a horrific ordeal. He tells this story with so much relish, you have to wonder at his motivation and sanity.In this book, you will not find interesting insights one might expect from someone having spent so much time alone in nature; instead he reveals a truly cold heart and his rants are not so much inspiring or full of truth as they are self absorbed pontificating by an individual who thinks he's a poet just because he has an imagination. I actually took a match to his book just to watch the edges curl. Too thick to burn, I reluctantly hosed it down and threw it in the trash where it belongs.If you love and respect nature, this is not the book to read."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I just read a Kindle version of this in hopes of giving my first trip to Moab some special meaning. What a disappointment. I had read some Amazon reviews proclaiming this book as some type of masterpiece. In all due respect, those readers must not get out much.

The fact that it was so poorly written could be overlooked if at least Abbey had an interesting story to tell; he did not. Do yourself a favor and skip it."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Sorry, but I didn't care much for this one.

I am a desert rat.\\" - Edward Abbey in DESERT SOLITAIREI'm not sure if I've ever read anything else by Edward Abbey. Perhaps The Monkey Wrench Gang in the rebellious mid-1970s. Memory fails. But in reading DESERT SOLITAIRE, I can see why he was - he died in 1989 - so controversial. A naturalist and rugged individualist, he would be brazenly politically incorrect by today's standards while perhaps not easily categorized as either left or right-wing. I think I'm a huge fan already.Centered around a six-month stint he did as the lone, resident park ranger in Utah's Arches National Monument - now Arches National Park - in 1958, DESERT SOLITAIRE is Edward Abbey's brilliant tribute to the flora, fauna and geology of the desert Southwest in general and southeastern Utah in particular. For the reader with an active mind's eye, Abbey is at his best when he describes the immediate environs around his Arches trailer residence, his boat trip down the Colorado River through Glen Canyon (before the dam was built), his ascent of Mount Tukuhnikavits, and his descent into The Maze area of what is now Canyonlands National Park.Much of the controversy surrounding Abbey most certainly emanated from his scathing opinions of the National Park Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and what he terms \\"Industrial Tourism\\", that insidiously encroaching approach that would have all wilderness areas paved over and built-up to serve hordes of automobile-enclosed tourists whose idea of experiencing the landscape is to drive through in air-conditioned comfort. Indeed, Edward thought the national parks should be accessible only to those who could walk in or ride in on bicycle or mule from huge car lots at the parks' boundaries. Sometimes, his views verge on callous:\\"Children too small to ride bicycles and too heavy to be borne on their parents' backs need only wait a few years ... The aged merit even less sympathy: after all they had the chance to see the country when it was still relatively unspoiled. However, we'll stretch a point for those too old or too sickly to mount a bicycle and let them ride the shuttle buses.\\"(Some that arrive in cars should stay in them. Hiking in the Grand Canyon both last March and last September, my wife and I encountered tourists waltzing down the Bright Angel Trail with Plateau Point - 6.1 miles from the rim - or the Colorado River - 7.7 miles from the rim - as their intended round trip (!) destination without carrying so much as a thimbleful of water. Luckily, there are rangers at key points to turn such fools back. You know, perhaps some selective culling of the species wouldn't hurt; I think Abbey might have agreed.)His outrage concerning the construction of the Glen Canyon Dam knows no bounds:\\"No wonder the Authorities are so anxious to smother the wilderness under asphalt and reservoirs. They know what they're doing; their lives depend on it, and all their rotten institutions. Play safe. Ski only in clockwise direction. Let's all have fun together.\\"And his description of the doomed Glen Canyon environment approaches the reverential:\\"High above our heads the owls hoot under the lost moon. A predawn wind comes sifting and sighing through the cottonwood trees; the sound of their dry, papery leaves is like the murmur of distant water, or like the whispering of ghosts in an ancient, sacrosanct, condemned cathedral.\\"Abbey's critics made much of his rejection of anthropocentrism, which is evident within the pages of DESERT SOLITAIRE:\\"We need coyotes more than we need, let us say, more people, of whom we already have an extravagant surplus, or more domesticated dogs, which in all fairness could and should be ground up into hamburger and used as emergency coyote food, to raise their spirits and perhaps improve the tenor of their predawn howling.\\"Happily, I'm a cat lover.However, most of the book's narrative is descriptive rather than philosophic and, at times, becomes all too real as when he tells of the desert search for a lost hiker and his own near-death experience when apparently stranded halfway down an isolated canyon wall beyond any hope of rescue.DESERT SOLITAIRE is the best book I've read all summer, and perhaps all year. I intend to acquire and read more of the author's stuff."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I loved this book and stayed up nights under the desert stars reading Abbey's writting that brought the desert to life. His appreciation for the wilderness fueled by the reflection of civilization gives the narrative depth. His rants of gapers and the great industry of being civilized are often humerous but sometimes turn mean. This book made me laught, cry, think, and act. A great book to take along for a road trip if you plan to get lost and leave the car at the end of the road to see where your feet take you."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"It's been almost 40 years since Desert Solitaire hit the bookshelves; and perhaps it is more appropriate reading now than it was in 1968; certainly \\"Industrial Tourism\\" has come to pass.This book is not gibberish from some \\"eco-hermit\\", whatever that is. Yes, old Cactus Ed is cranky and contradictory, full of hyperbole at times. This is his stamp as a prose-poet and unsurpassed storyteller; if you don't get this, you may be reading the wrong books.Abbey's iconoclastic philosophy of conservation over human \\"progress\\" has rendered Desert Solitaire as a true environmental classic. This book is most likely sitting on many home bookshelves between The Mountains of California and A Sand Country Almanac.Ed Abbey was well steeped in philosophy and literature; when he muses on the civilization vs. culture subject, you can see the meld of anarchism and german existentialism occuring. His impassioned rants reflect his love of the solitary places - landscapes unscathed by that \\"turbo-monkey\\" known as man. The humor is as dry and sharp as the the landscapes he describes: episodes with his pet gopher snake; the search for a dead tourist; and the idiocies of The National Park Service.Like many authors, Abbey's non-fictional writing outshines his fictional stuff. Hands down, Desert Solitaire is his finest work: Rough, Tough, and Combative. This classic is a must read if you are of the \\"Resist much, Obey little\\" mindset.

I was never aware of the inherent beauty of emptiness, the fullness of the barren landscape, and the passion that can be aroused by areas others reject as hostile and useless. For me, this book was pivotal in that it made me seek other books by Abbey as well as Stegner, Bass, Zwinger, McPhee, Dillard, and others whose senses and intellect are focused on God's creation.When I heard of Abbey's death almost a decade ago, I realized that a light had gone out - but on reflection, I realize he turned on many other lights before he left."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I first read this book years ago when I was in college.

Abbey weaves a wonderful story of his experiences and observations while in the Canyonlands. While he is often irreverant, he really does a magnificient job of conveying a sense of the Canyonlands which includes the wildlife, plants, the geology."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"The first time I went to Moab, UT, I fell in love with the desert. I read this book afterwards and was captivated by every word Abbey wrote. That being said, I have spoken with other people who have never been to the Moab area who just couldn't get into the book. I guess maybe it takes a deep love of the environment and appreciation of the beauty of the desert to really understand this book. Abbey adds in so many interesting stories as well that keep the book flowing. I would defintely recommend this to anyone who loves the desert."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Best to read if you are visiting Arches, the Grand Canyon, or Lake Powell, or if you have been there, or even if you just wish you were there...After reading Abbey's incredible illustration of &quot;his&quot; country, you might as well have been there yourself in spirit, if not in body. Desert Solitaire is part memoir, politics, opinion, beauty, myth, journal, eulogy, ravaging accusation of modern society, and general ramblings on the Southwest. There is very little structure, except that the book opens with Abbey entering Arches in the spring as a ranger, and ends with him leaving in the fall. He touches almost every subject under the desert sun. My favorite chapters were:-&quot;Down the River&quot;: on Glen Canyon before the dam-&quot;Polemic Industrial Tourism and the National Parks&quot;: scathing and sarcastic, belittleing the American automobile tourist-&quot;Rocks&quot;: a disturbing legend of the uranium boom in Utah-&quot;Episodes and Visions&quot;: general desert musings and tangentsThe best way to describe the feel of this book is the blurb on the back: &quot;rough, tough, combative [...] this book may well seem like a ride on a bucking bronco.&quot;"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"If you have been to Moab, Utah and the surrounding red rock country of Southern Utah then this book is an absolute must read.If you have never been to Moab or Arches National Park, read this book and let Ed Abbey take you there. This is one of my favorite books and I come back to it often. Abbey's tranquil descriptionsof the beautiful yet harsh red rock environment of what was then Arches National Monument is the quintessential narrative of this lovely desert landscape. In this volume the history, geology andmood of the red rock country comes alive with Abbey's economic prose. Abbey served as a park ranger during Arches' infancy and his love for the desert and disdain for convention and oppressionserved him well during his brief tenure as Arches' caretaker. My favorite chapter: &quot;The Deadman at Grandview Point&quot;. Gallows humorat its finest. Read this book and love it the way Abbey loved Arches."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Nearly 45 years ago, before Arches was a National Park, before Moab had become a well-known slickrock mountain biking destination, before the &quot;high brow&quot; rush to the wide open spaces of the West, Arches National Monument was a hot, dry and dusty little piece of real estate in the American outback...and Edward Abbey was there as seasonal park ranger. Abbey was cranky loner and prickly rebel, but also passionate poet who wrote a beautiful eligy to the vanishing desert wilderness.&quot;The wind will not stop. Gusts of sand swirl before me, stinging my face. But there is still too much to see and marvel at, the world very much alive in the bright light and wind, exultant with the fever of spring, the delight of morning. Strolling on, it seems to me that the strangeness and wonder of existence are emphasized here, in the desert, by the comparative sparsity of the flora and fauna: life not crowded upon life as in other places, but scattered abroad in spareness and simplicity, with a generous gift of space for each herb and bush and tree, each stem of grass, so that the living organism stands out bold and brave and vivid against the lifeless sand and barren rock. The extreme clarity of the desert light is equaled by the extreme individuation of desert life-forms. Love flowers best in openness and freedom.&quot;For both those who remember and lament the West as it once was and those who yet love it as it is, this is a must read."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I began this piece with high expectations being a fan of desert exploration. My review for this product would be quite mixed. When Abbey is dealing with the environment itself, the book's a winner. When he is giving his very strong views on all other aspects of life it is very tedious...and I agree with his points. I just felt I was being bludgeoned with them. I'd recommend the book only with this caveat."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Edward Abbey's DESERT SOLITAIRE belongs on the shortest of several short lists of 20th century classics, whether we are talking of classic literature of the American West, nature writing, or environmentalism.Why is this such a brilliant book? It isn't the originality of ideas. Other writers-Aldo Leopold, Wallace Stegner, Bernard DeVoto, Mary Austin-had already articulated many of Abbey's central ideas either about nature or about Western policy. Bernard DeVoto was an innovator; Abbey is not. Nor is Abbey's anger and fury at exploiters and defilers unique: DeVoto was just as irate and just as incapable of pulling his punches. Nor is it Abbey's overall vision that makes his book so compelling. Again, both DeVoto and Stegner-and especially DeVoto-evidenced a broader and more systematic understanding of the broader issues confronting the West. None of this is accidental. DeVoto exerted a major influence on Stegner, and Stegner taught Abbey in the Stanford University Creative Writing Program.What makes DESERT SOLITAIRE so marvelous is the almost tactile love and passion Abbey displays for the Desert Southwest. Over and over Abbey summons up specific places, particular mountains, individual landscapes. Although he can write about the desert in general, he more frequently writes about particular spots in Arches National Park and the surrounding environs that help explain his attachment to the West. He is the literary equivalent, in his more somber, reflective moments, of Eliot Porter and Ansel Adams. As a result, what one recalls upon remembering DESERT SOLITAIRE is not words so much as a collection of images.Structurally, the book only resembles a memoir of his time working as a park ranger in the Arches National Park. The book makes it seems as if he worked there only one year, when in fact he worked there two. Furthermore, even what appears as a single year fails to account for all the content of the book. He uses, rather, the fiction of a single season as a framework upon which to hang tales, reflections, and rants. This intermixing of narrative with asides gives the book a richness of texture it might not otherwise possess. The narrative of his time as a ranger gives the book much of it structure, but the rants and sidetracking provides it with much of its content.I hate to write something as trite as this being an absolutely essential book for anyone remotely interested in the subjects it touches upon, but such is the case. Abbey wrote many other nonfiction works and novels. All are interesting, several of them quite good, but DESERT SOLITAIRE is easily his greatest. It truly is a classic."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"&quot;I would rather kill a man than a snake,&quot; wrote Edward Abbey, and I suspect he even meant it. That sentence summed up, for me, this book: it is filled with Abbey's love of the wild desert and its inhabitants and his contempt for modernity and its inhabitants. I think Abbey was one of the early voices in modern environmentalism, and this is a classic book in that field. I appreciate his desert and his writing; even if you are not an environmentalist nor a lover of the desert, you may see why people are if you read this. At any rate, his deep naturalist reflections deserve consideration in our fast-food, internet, climate-controlled, sanitized and artificial age."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Edward Abbey didn't like to be known as a nature writer (he was far too proud of his fiction), but after reading this book I would have to say he is among the best. Before I read this book, I had never even considered traveling to the Southwest, this book changed that, and the way I look at nature forever. Abbey has rightfully been called the Thoreau of the American West, this book more than any other shows us why. In Desert Solitaire Abbey is at his best, doing for the Southwest what Thoreau did for Concord and Walden.One of the great strenghts of this book is the way Abbey weaves together such a wide array of subject matter, which illustrates the seemingly endless variety of experience, in what is thought by many to be an inhospitable wasteland. In a collection of breif chapters Abbey touches on everthing from the incredible beauty of forgotton canyons, the Southwest's past inhabitants, a feral horse, the Colorado river, the perils of industrial tourism, and the story of a man who may have came to die at the edge of a cliff.In this book you get a great sampling of everything Abbey has to offer, from his stinging wit and dark humor, rage and sadness concerning the destruction of nature, and finally to hope. Edward Abbey has accomplished on the printed page, what Ansel Adams' photography has done for the Southwest. And yes, both immortalize a time and a place that are being destroyed forever, little by little, day by day, but leaving for us a sad and yet wonderful record of what used to be, and why what is left is worth saving. Desert Solitaire is both a celebration and a lamentation for the disappearing landscapes, and hidden canyons that Abbey chose as his own paradise, and if you read this book it may become yours too. Like Abbey's says get out of your cars and crawl in the sand, and EXPERIENCE what nature has to offer, you might just be surprised at what you find."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Edward Abbey is a contradiction. A poet when describing the wonders of the desert and the joys of solitude; then he becomes a strident critic of his fellow man if they have the audacity to disagree with him. There is a definite will and intelligence driving the prose, but it is partially spoiled by the rants that Abbey goes on. The book has a split personality; celebrating the wilderness, but using a voice that often becomes so disagreeable that you might want to take asphalt to the park yourself. Finally though the poet wins out and you go along for the ride. I try to think of this book as rafting down the river, enjoying the wonders and trying to avoid the jagged rocks. A little white water is fine; just don't hold me underwater for hours at a time."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"While in the main I loved this book, Abbey's hypocritical nature had me fuming at times. He makes fun of tourists for scratching their names in sandstone (rightfully), but then goes ahead and carves his name in trees. He makes fun of tourists for littering (rightfully), and a few chapters later describes rolling a tire into the Grand Canyon (nearly missing a mule train!). The book is riddled with other such examples. The thing is: I'm not sure he even recognized these glaring contridictions. But aside from not really liking HIM, I loved the BOOK... the last chapter left me weeping..."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"To begin, I loved parts of _Desert Solataire_. Abbey seemed to be warbling between humility, confusion, and utter, unabashed egotism. This is charming, because it is honest, and one can't fault someone for being honest. Also, the man actually did something about his frustration, which is more than can be said for the lot of us.Moreover, there were sections of the book that shocked me with their incredible, heartbreaking beauty and insight. For example, the chapter \\"The Moon-Eyed Horse\\": the writing in that chapter is utterly original and amazing in the complexity it demonstrates regarding both the narrator and the nature of the horse's character - and what it reveals and changes about Abbey.Abbey is at his best when he gets out of the way and describes how he sees nature, rather than his own mind. Abbey says at one point that when a person goes into the wilderness he or she is at risk of either seeing merely his or her self in it, or just the opposite, seeing nothing but an opposite image of oneself.This made me wonder about Abbey's exact philosophical position on his own place in nature; furthermore, the passage - in the chapter entitled \\"Episodes and Visions\\" - in which Abbey attempts to wax philosophical about civilization and culture was completely lost on me. Maybe it's because I've read too much Heidegger to think that Abbey really understands Heidegger, or maybe it's because I am confused.I am confused because it seems as if Abbey upholds civilization as superior to culture, and yet does he not admire the American Indian tribal culture that he encounters in the park? How does he even define \\"culture\\"? If the U.K. and the United States are merely examples of cultures, then is civilization merely the mark of individuals that Abbey likes? I don't think I'm suffering from a lapse in intelligence; apparently, not a few people have agreed with my bafflement, including the \\"New York literary establishment,\\" according to Susan Zakin in _Coyotes and Town Dogs_.But - and it's a big but - there were certainly moments in which I felt his writing shone. And _Desert Solitaire_ was certainly the book that earned him well-deserved accolades. It made me want to drive to Utah and camp out under the stars, with nothing but the ground beneath me and the night around me, as Abbey would say. I felt a place in my bones when Abbey wrote about what he loved. The thing I can't take is diatribe and clich&eacute; - or, as writers politely put it, \\"received text.\\"Received text unfortunately found its way into _Desert Solitaire_ when Abbey decided to wax egotistical about industrial tourism and his facetious suggestions for a blazing, light bulb ridden sign over the entrance to the park. In those places, the writing's not just irritating, it's not original. Anyone can go off about how stupid mass culture is and how people should change their couch potato, gas guzzling ways, but if you're going to include it in a book, it should fit seamlessly into the design. And those parts, for me, stuck out like a sore thumb.In spite of all his shortcomings as a \\"literary\\" writer, Abbey is endearingly human, and that seems to have been a crucial and necessary part of his character. In the end, I remain torn, and I feel sympathy for those who want to change the world and put themselves at risk for what they believe in. But I also firmly believe that, unless we respect and try to communicate with the person sitting across from us who we are opposed to, nothing will ever get done."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I just ordered Desert Solitaire for my dear friend Joel Stone after having a great conversation with him about his trip to Utah to visit his wife's family. It has been over twenty years since I read the book, back when I was living in Utah, teaching at East High School in Salt Lake City and going to the desert every chance I had. Abbey brings the desert to life like no other author I have read. In fact, he is the one writer who portrayed the desert as a real living scene. When I go back and read passages from Solitaire, it is like I am back in the desert trudging through the sand between some fins or gazing across the vistas watching the waves of heat undulate. Abbey's accomplishment in this book is his focus on the minute details of the desert and how it feels to be there. His description of how the whole world comes to a stop in the middle of the day when the heat hits hard is right on target. My wife and I and our oldest daughter Margo were camped in the Arches in July and had to seek refuge from the heat by climbing up between two fins and simply sit there on the slightly damp sand and spend the afternoon reading and playing games. There was a cool, damp breeze coming down between the fins less than a foot thick off the ground. This is the kind of experience that Abbey can bring to you with his writing and which gets you to the point where you want to go out and strap on the roof rack and head for the desert just to feel the heat and watch the eagles and vultures circle overheat. His treatment of the local human culture of Moab in his early desert days is outstanding. The characters are bigger than life, although essentially none of them were famous people. You can smell their sweat and hear their curses and feel the bumps as you ride around with them in their old pickups and jeeps. And you can hear the curses from Abbey himself as he eloquently and graphically described that which was happening to the desert, its ecology and its way of life decades ago. He seems quiet and sensitive but lashes out with anger or hatred at the endangerment he sees. This guy is not nice, accepting and philosophical. He is not like an environmentalist, but more like a mean old rattlesnake lying under a bush waiting for somebody to mess with his desert. Abbey's vision of that which might happen to the desert has, to a great extent, come to pass. Yet, he might be happy if he could know that vast tracts of land have been set aside and are less threatened, spoiled and polluted than back when he was there and mining and ranching were in their heyday. Whenever you read this book, it will still help you form a relationship with the desert in your time and your place and give you an awareness of its fragility and beauty and what must be done from here on. The scene has changed a lot, the decades have gone by, the Westerner Grill has closed, but the desert and Abbey's insightful perceptions of it remain the constant in whole equation. Reading this book takes you to a new, exciting, billion-year-old place. Even decades later."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Edward Abbey's Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness, is an autobiographical account of Abbey's stint working as a park ranger at Arches National Monument in Utah. At once this book is philosophical and poetic, yet at the same time, sardonic and polemical. Although the author would probably scowl at such pigeonholing, this book is also a significant environmental statement, as well as being a great piece of literature. In Desert Solitaire, Abbey identifies and adeptly defines a common frustration shared by many writers; the annoyance of not being able to adequately express one's self through the medium of words. He states, \\"You cannot get the desert into a book any more than a fisherman can haul up the sea with his nets. Not imitation but evocation has been the goal.\\" However, even through his self-styled \\"evocation\\", he successfully and intimately enfolds his readers within his unique experience. A reluctant naturalist, Abbey blames the human inability to discern the true meaning of nature, on a tendency to always project our own expectations on the natural world. These are tendencies that exasperate him, and yet when he does achieve a near-true communion, as he describes in his experiences in isolation in Havasu Creek, he finds the encounter more disturbing than ecstatic. He describes losing the power to distinguish between himself and the natural world, creating in him a fear that his sense of self was \\"ebbing away.\\" In addition, throughout his career as a writer, Abbey refused the label \\"environmentalist.\\" Nevertheless, his books are useful instruments with which to measure our progress, or lack of progress as the case may be, in our relationship to our natural environment. In this book's chapter entitled, \\"Industrial Tourism and the National Parks\\", he lays out his philosophy that \\"growth for growth's sake is the ideology of the cancer cell.\\" Looking today at the corruption of the wilderness areas that he warned readers about three and four decades ago, it is plain to see how correct he was in his estimation and condemnation of policies pertaining to our National Parks. Whether he admitted it or not, Abbey set a tone of uncompromising environmental advocacy. In looking at Edward Abbey, the reader is also confronted by contradiction. He passionately argues for the importance of untamed wilderness and against the danger of industrial tourism. He declares he would rather kill a human than a snake, and then casually bops a rabbit on the head with a rock, just to see what his own reaction will be. He beguiles us with his description of Arches, and then chides us for wanting to go there. These passionate paradoxes are the tools he uses most effectively to lure us away from our complacency. Most importantly, Abbey's work his work serves as an inspiration to new generations of Western writers and historians, making us realize that wilderness really is a necessary ingredient of civilization."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I've lived in the desert southwest for almost 30 years and have read many books about the area. Surprisingly, I never read one of Abbey's books until now. I guess something else always appealed to me more on the bookstore shelves.As many reviewers have pointed out, Abbey captures the true feeling that one gets when surrounded by the beauty of the desert. It's true that there are other books out there that have also achieved this. What made this book special for me were the author's writing skills. He is truly a gifted writer and knows how to use language. This book is a real pleasure to read.As I read the book I tried to glean a little about the man - Edward Abbey. As a resident of the Sonoran Desert, his name comes up frequently when environmental champions are listed. He is a man that truly believes that the deserts, and all wilderness areas for that matter, are sacred. They are areas to be preserved and enjoyed -- untouched, whenever possible, by the hand of man. What surprised me about this book is that Abbey describes how he engaged in some activities that seem to contradict this philosophy. A few that come to mind: Smashing a rabbit's head in with a rock, not for food, but just to see if he can. Killing a rattlesnake with a shovel just because it lives around his trailer and he is afraid that someday it \\"might\\" bite him. Recalling a large brush fire that he accidentally set in a wilderness area, not with remorse, but with humor. Rolling an old tire off the rim of a pristine part of the Grand Canyon just so he could watch it bounce of off the canyon walls (and leaving it there as trash on the canyon floor). He does not seem ashamed of any of these actions. However, I'm sure that if he saw one of the \\"automobile tourists\\" that he seems to loathe do any of these things that he would go on an irate tirade. However, although I found these types of things to be a little hypocritical, I respect Abbey candidness - other authors would have just left these transgressions out.This is a wonderful book and should be on the bookshelf of anyone that enjoys nature. If you live in the desert - read this book - you will love it. Even if you a thousand miles away from a desert - read this book - you will love it. Abbey takes you on a journey to a special place that you will enjoy immensely."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Edward Abbey was an outspoken wilderness advocate, and his nonfiction writing falls somewhere between Thoreau and Hunter Thompson. &quot;Desert Solitaire&quot; is classic Abbey, written in the latter 1960s, when he was about 30, and it recounts a handful of summers spent ten years earlier in and around Arches National Monument in southeastern Utah. Here he was a park ranger, when the park was still mostly undeveloped. Living in a small trailer, keeping an eye on the campers and tourists, he mostly relishes the quiet, beauty, and indifference of the desert under its hot sun.The book begins with his arrival in April and concludes with his departure at season's end in September. In between are chapters devoted to descriptions of his rambles across the terrain, helping a local cattleman round up cows in the side canyons, trying to capture a one-eyed feral horse, camping on a 13,000-foot local mountain, hiking with a friend into an uncharted wilderness call the Maze, and retrieving the body of a dead tourist. There's also a dark story concerning the unfortunate fate of some uranium prospectors. The longest chapter is a rapturous account of a week spent rafting down the Colorado River, he and a friend among the last to see the canyons about to be inundated by the Glen Canyon Dam and the creation of Lake Powell.Along the way, there are ruminations on the meaning of it all and diatribes against urbanization, intrusive government, the tourist industry, and the destruction of wilderness. The word &quot;solitaire&quot; in the title is an apt choice, as much of the time Abbey is alone, thinking his thoughts and observing this desert world, its plants and wild life, geological formations, and the big sky with its turns of weather. Even when paired up with a companion, he is often off alone, on a walkabout of his own, like as not shedding his clothes.His thoughts, meanwhile, are informed by wide reading in philosophy, history, natural sciences, and literature. As a writer, he's frequently quotable: &quot;Where there is no joy there can be no courage; and without courage all other virtues are useless.&quot; &quot;It's a great country: you can say whatever you like so long as it is strictly true -- nobody will ever take you seriously.&quot;The vistas he describes so eloquently are not hard to picture in the imagination, but I recommend an accompanying volume of photography, such as Eliot Porter's &quot;The Place No One Knew: Glen Canyon on the Colorado.&quot; Unless you're familiar with borage, paintbrush, globemallow, and dozens of other desert species, a picture guidebook to the flora of the region would also be helpful. I thoroughly enjoyed Abbey's book, shared the excitement of his adventures, found his cranky, ornery, sometimes self-indulgent perspective refreshing, and felt saddened by the end-of-season farewell with which it closes. In any list of nonfiction books about the West, it should be near the top."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"What makes this a highly readable book is the author's revelations about his own feelings and shortcomings. It made me feel like I was there in the desert with him."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This is one of only four or five books that I can say truly impacted my life. Many years ago my boss saw me reading \\"The Monkey Wrench Gang\\" (which did not significantly impress me). He suggested \\"Desert Solitaire\\" as a much better example of Edward Abbey's work. I took his recommendation seriously, and have been thankful to him ever since.Having grown up in Idaho I had done a fair amount of backpacking in the mountains and forests, and I was somewhat of an outdoor enthusiast at the time. But the thought of recreating in the desert never held much allure to me--until I read this book. Now I make at least a couple of backpacking/camping trips per year into the desert. I still love the mountains, lakes, rivers, and forests, but I now know that the deserts are also full of wonder.My favorite chapter told about Abbey's trip to Havasu Creek and Falls. While reading about it I remember saying to myself, \\"There can't possibly really be a place like this\\". I determined that I would find out if such a place actually existed and if it was as wonderful as Abbey described it. A few years ago I made the trip to Havasu Falls, and I found that the author's description of the place was perfect.Not only did this book help me to appreciate the desert for what it is, it taught me to appreciate non-fiction writing in general and nature writing in particular--things I thought I did not care for previously. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has an appreciation for the outdoors."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I first read this book while spending a solitary winter in the Sawtooth Mountains of Idaho. I cannot imagine a better companion.Abbey had a spiritual connection to landscape that is both intoxicating and addictive, and his plainspoken narrative connects the reader to the depth of his desert experience in an uncommon way. But perhaps the most moving aspect of Desert Solitaire (indeed, all of Abbey's writing) is that the reader, by associating himself with the book, is called to action. This is not a book, nor is this an author, for the passive observer. Someone who wants a nice tale of living in the desert ought to look elsewhere. For anyone who's restless and ready to confront his or her spirit in a purposeful way, inspiration awaits!"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This book is the one that got me started going out West over a quarter century ago. I've never regretted it and read the book about every other year along with \\"Slickrock\\", (another Abbey masterpiece), for old times' sake.Ed Abbey always maintained he wrote to eat. He would have scoffed at allegations that his first book was a brilliant, evocative, militant, sentimental, enormously literate, invitation to help preserve what was left, (even though it is). Lake Foul, behind Glen Canyon Damn, broke his heart, but he remained a vibrant influence for free thinking until his death. This book, though it was his first, is still his best memorial. If you don't read it, it is your loss.There may be people who won't like it because it presents a viewpoint too easily eschewed in today's Enron-ethic climate. They are the ones who should read it most."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Written by Abbey when he was a park ranger at Arches Monument before it became a National Park, &quot;Dessert Solitaire&quot; is extraordinary. Only a handful of wilderness writers can create multiple visions of natural beauty without becoming maudlin or repetitive. Muir and Leopold come to mine as two who succeed but Abbey speaks in a more familiar voice. His task of bringing life and wonder to a dessert is even more challenging but the book strikes a chord not easily ignored. &quot;A weird, lovely, fantastic object out of nature like Delicate Arch has the curious ability to remind us - like rock and sunlight and wind and wilderness - that out there is a different world, older and greater and deeper by far than ours... For a little while we are again able to see, as the children see, a world of marvels. For a few moments we discover that nothing can be taken for granted, for if this ring of stone is marvelous then all which shaped it is marvelous, and our journey here on earth, able to see and touch and hear in the midst of tangible and mysterious things-in-themselves, is the most strange and daring of all adventures.&quot; Reading that, I had to see it for myself. The stone and sand of Arches is as wondrous, as ancient and as powerful as Abbey promised."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This book should be required reading for everyone. By far, this is one of my favorite books. There's alot to learn from this book. Abbey's insights into Industrial Tourism are great. His descriptions of locales stir the imagination. His radical propositon of new park rules make perfect sense. This is a book the folks in charge of our National Parks should be forced to read."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"When reading DESERT SOLITAIRE, it's easy (and judging from many of the reviews on this page, rather common) to wander off into the side canyon of one's personal perception of Ed Abbey's personality, and before long, find yourself keeled over from the heat. Not a very pretty way to go, especially if it means you've ultimately missed the point and real beauty of this eloquant love letter to Utah's Canyonlands.Abbey captures the true splendor of the desert here, while at the same time speaking with both frankness and conviction of what he saw as the coming flash flood of the land's misuse. His chapter 'Down the River' illustrates this dual purpose of the book perhaps better than any other. Not only does it disarmingly woo the reader, bringing out one's deepest, most romantic feelings of wanderlust, but at the same time slaps the reader awake with the fact that the story's perfect setting is now lost to all men for all times.I was lucky enough to have (sort of) know Ed Abbey nearly 20 years ago. He taught a class in short-story writing I took at the University of Arizona. And while I didn't see eye to eye with him on all his political views or agree with him on his assesment of my papers, I can tell you the man got a lot of pleasure from just living his life and a big chuckle from getting at people's goat. Judging from the varied opinions below, DESERT SOLITAIRE seems to have pulled them both off."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"If you ever wanted to know why some of us love the desert, you may get an impression if you can step into this book.

This is a lot more than just an argument that we should protect our wilderness, although it is easily that. Rather, I found it to be a profound guide on how to think and act in general, about pretty much everything, everywhere.This is one of the greatest books of the American twentieth century, a true classic, and everyone pondering how to think about and evaluate everything these days could surely benefit by reading it carefully."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"An early environmentalist even before the term came into use.

Great from start to finish."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Ed Abbey was easily one of the best authors to write about the American Southwest. His humor and wit contrast nicely with his love of the desert. DESERT SOLITAIRE allows the reader to drift into a much simpler, slower life for a short time. Mr.Abbey's polemic about the National Parks is quite entertaining, as I am sure it will just be a matter of time before we have rubber rocks in Yosemite!"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"There's little I can add to the so many outstanding reviews of DESERT SOLITAIRE that have already appeared. I read the book years ago, but only recently visited Arches and the remnants of Glen Canyon. Seeing in person the places described by Abbey made both book and message more poignant for me.

I loved his description of the desert and how it used to be. Being from Utah, I have visited the sites many times and it's cool to compare the differences. I think that his rude demeanor and aggressiveness are due to the fact that he was sexually deprived being alone in the desert. However, there were those gopher snakes . . ."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"For anyone who has enjoyed or hopes to enjoy the desert it is a must read. Before and after your visits to the desert. Everytime I read it I want to go back to the desert."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"The first of many great books by Edward Abbey. This one concerns his early trips to the southwestern US to work in National Parks and Monuments. This is a series of essays about his experiences as a young man from New York adapting to the desert southwest. Highly recommended. I bought this hardcover edition for my library after I gave away my paperback to a friend who will be vacationing this summer in some of the parks mentioned in the book."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Edward Abbey has become an icon of the American environmentalist movement. He left the green rolling hills of Western Pennsylvania, graduated from the University of New Mexico, and felt most at home in the American Southwest. Hum! Desert Solitaire, published in 1968, is his most famous work. It is an espousal of an anti-\\"developmental\\" creed; the setting is his one year's employment at Arches National Monument in Utah as a park ranger. He later went on to writeThe Monkey Wrench Gang (P.S.)no doubt this book is one of the main reasons you have to go through a metal detector and have your bags searched if you visit Glen Canyon Dam. The main character in the MWG is George Washington Hayduke, who is modeled on the very real life, Doug Peacock, a long-time friend and associate of Abbey, and if you want Peacock's side of the story, I highly recommend \\"Walking It Off.\\"When Abbey is \\"on\\", he is definitely on, and few could write so evocatively of the desert areas of the Southwest, with the implicit plea to: \\"let's just let things be.\\" Try: \\"The fire. The odor of burning juniper is the sweetest fragrance on the face of the earth, in my honest judgment; I doubt if all the smoking censers of Dante's paradise could equal it. One breath of juniper smoke, like the perfume of sagebrush after rain, evokes in magical catalysis, like certain music, the space and light and clarity and piercing strangeness of the American West. Long may it burn.\\" Abbey is erudite, and has read of the deserts of the world. How many others have read the works of a fellow curmudgeon, C. M. Doughty, Travels in Arabia Deserta? (p 239). How many others would reference the atonal work of Schoenberg?: \\"...although both Schoenberg and Krenek lived part of their lives in the Southwest, their music comes closer than any other I know to representing the apartness, the otherness, the strangeness of the desert\\" (p 255).But it is his social commentary, and yes, conscious, that is the real cornerstone of his fame. Consider: \\"They cannot see that growth for the sake of growth is a cancerous madness, that Phoenix and Albuquerque will not be better cities to live in when their populations are doubled again and again. They would never understand that an economic system which can only expand or expire must be false to all that is human.\\" And he goes to make the harsh prediction that these latter-day seven cities of Cibola will likewise be abandoned and buried, as were their predecessors. Succinct expressions of the fate of the American Indians are tied to the dispossessed and lumen-proletariat of the world: \\"...or the tarpaper villages of Gallup, Flagstaff and Shiprock, it's the same the world over--one big wretched gamily sequestered in sullen desperation, pawed over by social workers, kicked around by the cops and prayed over by the missionaries.\\"Others have compared Abbey, or at least his vision, to Thoreau, Muir, Leopold, and other environmentalist pioneers. I can't. Both Peacock and the solid biography of Abbey by James Bishop,Epitaph For A Desert Anarchist: The Life And Legacy Of Edward Abbey,\\" describe his numerous flaws; a strong strain of misanthropy being one of them. You don't love nature more but heaping abuse on the humans who have, all too many times, abused it in turn. But I didn't have to rely on the opinions of others to reach this conclusion, it is right there in this book: picking up the stone, and killing the rabbit, not for food, but just to see what it is like. Why, oh why? And could one imagine any of the other three at the beginning of this paragraph doing same.It is a fundamental problem for readers, and those who want to consider espousing the ideas of an individual, be that person Jean Paul Sartre, William Faulkner, Graham Greene, Robert Graves or so many others. When the person has \\"feet of clay,\\" and the flaws are even evident in his/her writings, should not a person dock at least one star for the flaws, despite the fame?"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"If you want to read a truly incredible book about the nature of nature, this is the book. Abbey's writing is superb and his observations on our interactions with wilderness are as profound as anything ever written."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I found this book very enjoyable. Mr. Abbey was a master of words, painting word pictures of the beautiful desert, and his experiences in the Utah red land desert both as a park ranger in the Arches monuments park before the area was flooded for a man-made lake...and as a \\"cowboy\\" working rounding up cattle in the Utah canyons. I found Abbey's words and stories reminded me very much of John Graves book \\"Goodbye to a River\\" about the Brazos River in Texas, and somewhat of H.D. Thoreau's work. Abbey looks a both human life, death, and the eternity and stability of the natural world and how insigificant we all are in the big picture. His writing is at times funny, or sad, or thoughtful and melancholy. I highly recommend this book to people who love thoughtful books about the natural world."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I purchased this book because David Quammen referenced it in one of his books, and I really enjoy Quammen's books. It is listed on various websites and in some magazines as a \\"Nature Classic\\".I have visited and hiked the deserts and canyon in Utah and northern Arizona. That allowed me to feel a lot of what Abbey writes about. It is a special place. I wish I could go back and see Arches National Park when Abbey was there. (It was Arches National Monument at the time of his stay there.)While there are some controversial things in this book, and while I don't agree with everything Abbey writes, I have to say that I really hated to come to the end of this book. Besides the stories about nature, Abbey also writes about some of the human activities in this area.I think I understand why people call this a landmark book. The environmental movement was just starting in the sixties. (Does anyone else remember the green Ecology symbol?)"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This is my favorite book. I consider Abbey to be a hippie environmentalist--a sort of modern day Thoreau. The book will suck you in and you'll be wishing you could run off to Moab and have a beer with Abbey."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"In this book Abbey said: \\"... most of what I write about in this book is already gone or going under fast. This is not a travel guide but an elegy. A memorial. You're holding a tombstone in your hands. A bloody rock.\\" Abbey is not demon-possessed to behave so well as Thoreau, he is more opinionated and his opinions can be pretty pungent and prickly (for example, see \\"Polemic: Industrial Tourism and The National Parks\\").However, being opinionated does not make a good book. Abbey's writing is surprisingly polished. The slick rocks, the canyon lands, the sagebrush and cacti all have a authentic texture in them. You can smell the desert dust in this book. Abbey is not called \\"Thoreau of the American West\\" for nothing. I think under Abbey's rough shell, he actually had a sensitive heart; he just enjoyed the natural world more than the human one. It is a good thing that he turned some of his attentions to writing, and we are left with some of the best nature writings since Thoreau.I actually read this book before I read Walden. In fact for me this is the book that started my interest in reading nature and conservation, after I took a trip to Grand Canyon, Bryce, Zion, Canyonlands and, of course, Arches National Park. I have read a few more of Abbey's books since but none have had the impact of this one. I also read in one of those that in his later years he wasn't very satisfied with Desert Solitaire because he was still too \\"well-behaved\\". Yet, for me, this is the book that defines him and it achieves the perfect balance between narratives of nature and discourse of opinions. Now I keep a copy by my bedside and if I ever get strangled on an island, I will carry this book and Walden with me."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Air? Abbey thinks it is so fresh it makes you hungry for breakfast.Night? Abbey likes to walk without a flashlight at night. That way his senses reach out in all directions instead of fixing upon the glow of light in front of him.Mice? Abbey shares his housetrailer with a number of mice. They don't disturb him and are welcome to the crumbs he drops on the floor. His only reservation is that they attract rattlesnakes.Rattlesnakes? One morning Abbey is sitting on his doorstep sipping coffee. Looking down between his feet, he spots a rattler. It's only a couple of inches from his heels. It's not the diamondback known by its Latin name crotalus atrox. Abbey won't blast it with his .45. Arches National Monument is meant to be a haven for animals and he believes in that idea. In a deft move Abbey swings his feet up and inside the doorway of his trailer. The rattler hisses. Abbey decides to get his boots on and drives the snake away from the trailer with a spade. You better stay away, cousin, Abbey warns.A week later the rattler is back. Abbey decides that he needs to trap the mice so that the rattler won't be attracted to them. But just before he does that, he comes upon a gopher snake or bull snake, a snake with a reputation of being an enemy of rattlesnakes. Abbey traps the gopher snake and brings it back to the housetrailer.Abbey and the gopher snake get along well. During the day, the snake stays curled up near the heater. At night, the snake goes out and takes care of business. The snake lets Abbey handle him. The snake wraps himself around Abbey's waist and pokes his head out of Abbey's shirt from time to time... much to the amusement of the tourists.After a time, the snake disappears. Then a month later the snake reappears along with what Abbey thinks is a female snake. The two are involved in a ritualistic dance. Abbey thinks of himself as a shameless voyeur as he watches. Like many voyeurs, Abbey is \\"noticed\\" by the lovers and they leave.All men are brothers, observes Abbey. Is the \\"evolutionary line from protozoan to Spinoza any less certain?\\" All living creatures on the Earth are kindred whether predator or prey.

This book gets better with age and is amazingly relevant for being 30+ years old.

Desert Solitaire should be re-read every 3 years to remind us of what we're doing to our open spaces. His voice needs to be kept alive as one of the great spokesmen for the land. This is an excellent primer for anyone interested in preserving our natural heritage."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I bought this book about 13 years ago from the sale table at a book store. Reading it was a veritable baptism into a new world. Abbey has the ability to draw you into his world, so that as you read you feel like you are walking right beside him. His writing will endear the natural order to you. What a fascinating mind this man has...I have collected all of his nature essay books. They are all spellbinding."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I give this book 5 stars for Abbey's beautiful and vivid depiction of the Southwest landscape, and his ability to evoke a powerful sense of what's already been lost and what's at stake. This should be a must-read for anyone who loves the Southwest and cares about its future. At the same time, I have to say I agree with some of the comments by other reviewers about how he sometimes seems to be much more aware of how others impact the pristine wilderness areas than of how he does so himself. After reading his biting observations in the &quot;Down the River&quot; chapter about campers who left an old shoe in a spring and a dirty sock hanging from a bush, I was a little taken aback when he started the next chapter with the following story: &quot;On the way we stopped off briefly to roll an old tire into the Grand Canyon. While watching the tire bounce over tall pine trees, tear hell out of a mule train and disappear with a final grand leap into the inner gorge...&quot; Then on to the next adventure, with no further mention of the poor mule train or of the tire which will probably be there for hundreds of years longer than will the old shoe and sock. What makes that attitude even harder to understand is his obvious deep love for the natural beauty and wildness of the region. At times his lyrical reflections almost pass into the realm of the mystical and sublime, such as during his journey through the doomed Glen Canyon. Despite the occasional contradictions, this book is a classic, and I would strongly recommend it to anyone with an interest in the Southwest."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"A classic book that I have read over and over and never tire of.

I have gone to most of the places that he Mr. Abbey discusses. He describes the land exactly as it is: The most beautiful place on earth. He is very articulate and descriptive in this book.

Desert Solitaire is a monument to, and a celebration of, both. It is one of the most important books of all time, for in it is the evolution of human conciousness. I'm grateful to Ed Abbey for his book, and for his encompassing, inspiring vision of the American West."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This is the best book I have ever read. This author far exceeds any in explaining the feelings that are felt through the love of nature and the frustration with society today.

If you only read one book in your life then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Edward Abbey IS the voice crying in and for the wilderness.This book makes my whole being ache with emotion. For the wilderness that is being tamed without consent. For the people who saw it. For those who could have seen it. For those who shouldn't have seen it. And most of all for those who will never see it. What am I saying, NOBODY should just see it. They must BE it to understand it. If you've never read the book I sound like a fool. Read it. LIVE it. Ed Abbey is the only one to have even approached the indescribable beauty that is the Canyonlands country.My favorite quote which is a key to understanding this book:&quot;A man on foot...will see more, feel more, enjoy more in one mile than the motorized tourists can in a hundred miles.&quot;"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"In Desert Solitaire, Abbey puts to words my feelings every time I've visited the desert- &quot;the ideal place, the right place, the one true home.&quot; He captures the beauty, but also the grit, the isolation and sparseness, the simplicity-- and the wonder. At moments, Abbey's novel is an expression of humility in the face of perfection, at others, an all-out rage against the raping of these lands for purposes of economic gain and tourism for the masses. If you're looking for a pretty travelogue, don't bother. If you truly love the Desert Southwest, or any of our last remaining fragments of true wilderness, and hurt every time you see the land treated with ignorance and disrespect, you'll love this book. We need more voices like Abbey's."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Abbey spent three summers as a naturalist at Arches National Monument in Utah and recorded his experiences and shared his opinions on tourism, wilderness, government, religion, and Nature. Through Abbey's eyes, readers experience the desert's intricate and delicate web of life. Moreover, Abbey interprets the significance of water and geography in the austere environment and connects these subjects to desert life forms. Abbey condemns our dysfunctional relationship with the environment and our abuse of national parks, but he offers practical and effective solutions.I have a unique perspective on Desert Solitaire having worked for the National Park Service for a decade, including a season in the Utah desert. I read Solitaire on a road trip through the Southwest, and it so inspired me that I applied to parks throughout the region. Five months after reading Solitaire, I accepted a job at Zion National Park in southeast Utah. However, I missed the fine print in Abbey's introduction: \\"Do not . . . rush out to the Canyon country hoping to see some of that which I have attempted to evoke in these pages. . . .most of what I write about in this book is already gone or going under fast. This is not a travel guide but an elegy.\\"Zion, like all the other parks I worked at, had been surrendered to tourism. Abbey uses the term \\"Industrial Tourism\\" to describe the modern method for visiting national parks. It involves completely isolating oneself from the environment in a motorized tin can or house-on-wheels and racing from park to park to park. Tourists linger only momentarily at designated picturesque pullouts for a snapshot or to read a line from an interpretive placard, and they quickly hop back in their infernal rattling death machines and zoom past extraordinary scenery on the way to the next park and its overcrowded, military-compound-style campgrounds or luxurious lodges. Many linger in large visitor center museums searching for soda machines and bathrooms or looking at exhibits and buying post cards when they could be outdoors experiencing at the real thing they (supposedly) came to see!Tourists have lost touch with the true wild. Most don't get out of their cars except to eat, sleep, or to use the bathroom.However, the National Park Service's founding charter, the Organic Act, was written with loftier goals in mind when it stated the NPS's \\"purpose is to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such a manner and by such means that will leave them unimpaired for . . . future generations.\\" Over the past 85 years, park managers have focused on \\"provide for the enjoyment\\" while shunning the command to \\"leave them unimpaired.\\" Their brains dulled by years of paperwork and pointless bureaucratic meetings, they fail to consider the impairments park \\"improvements\\" have created.To impair means to worsen or harm. One can find countless examples of Industrial Tourism impairing national parks. Take for instance the Zion Canyon Scenic Drive. Built in the 1920s, the Virgin River's flash floods invariably destroyed sections of the drive. In order to protect the road, and thereby provide for the enjoyment of Zion Canyon for those too lazy to walk, managers added gabiens and rocked the river banks. Success! The river overflowed its banks less often, and as a result, it became channelized. Jump ahead 80 years: since the river no longer floods, seed beds for cottonwoods are not prepared, and the cottonwoods in the canyon are dying out. To mitigate this problem, managers plant seedlings and install irrigation line. To keep beaver and deer away from succulent saplings, chain-link fences were erected. The solution, however, is remarkably simple: remove the road and allow the river to flood again. But managers insist that the roads are needed.Abbey makes some sensible proposals for the salvation of both parks and people. First, he urges \\"No more cars in national parks. Let the people walk. Or ride horses, bicycles, mules, wild pigs, anything, but keep the automobiles and the motorcycles and all their motorized relatives out.\\" Secondly, he calls for a ban on new road construction in parks and demands the Organic Act be implemented rather than ignored.Abbey discusses the \\"dusty milling confusion of motor vehicles and camping machinery\\" at Yosemite and the Grand Canyon. A serious problem in the 1960s, auto overcrowding has reached a crisis state. Motorists, finding parking lots full, park along the road or in open fields which heavily impairs plant and animal life and scars the landscape. Their vehicles emit noxious toxins and pollute the air with noise. There is no pandemonium worse than an incessant car alarm in a national park.Some parks have only recently taken Abbey's 40-year-old advice. In 2000, Zion instituted a mandatory propane-powered shuttle in the Canyon from April to October. Before the shuttle, visiting the Canyon was an oredeal; there was no place to park and bicycling was extremely dangerous. The Canyon reeked of exhaust fumes and the drone of traffic carried up the canyon walls as motorists circled for a half hour looking for parking. Sans cars, the Canyon changed drastically as Abbey predicted. I could bike and be the only person on the road. Picnic areas reverberated with natural sounds. Abbey accurately described the scene: \\"Fortunately the parks, by the mere elimination of motor traffic will come to seem far bigger than they are now; there will be more room for more persons, an astonishing expansion of space.\\"A few people complained about the shuttle system. One old geezer called it \\"part of Al Gore's socialist scheme to lock up the parks.\\" (The shuttle system was proposed in the late 1970s, and Al Gore had nothing to do with it.) When another senior citizen complained about the hardship of riding the shuttle, I explained that it would have been far more difficult to enter the canyon 100 years ago on foot. He took offense and said the shuttle was unfair to seniors. Perhaps they should have visited when they were younger, I suggested. Outraged, he clamored that seniors did not have money when they were younger, and I replied that I did not let money stop me. Just before leaving, he quipped that he hoped I would feel the same when I was old. I replied that I also hoped to feel the same way when older.As Abbey states, \\"The aged merit even less sympathy: after all they had the opportunity to see the country when it was still relatively unspoiled.\\" He also talked about providing shuttle buses for those \\"too old or too sickly\\" to walk. However, some will always complain about leaving their cars behind.Unfortunately, attitudes change slowly and managers do too little. People seeking to escape the drudgery of city life bring cell phones, pagers, R.V.s with satellite television and hike in high heels while quarreling with each other amongst the most magnificent scenery the country has to offer. Many visitors never get more than a few hundred yards from their cars and never leave trails. They are destination-oriented. They are unaware.Wilderness and national parks were sacrificed long ago to Industrial Tourism. For decades, we ignored the sacredness of the land, but Abbey believes that \\"we are learning finally that the forests and mountains and desert canyons are holier than our churches.\\" But our holy lands have been whored out to the tourism, auto, and oil industries. Sadly, we treasure and protect what we know and love, and we no longer know or love the wild."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I picked up this book on accident--I had maybe $6 left on my gift certificate and browsed through random books. It sounded interesting, so I bought it.I was so moved the first time I read it. Everything written was so eloquent and Abbey expressed himself amazingly. It kept me drawn to read on and devour the entire text.A year later, I volunteered for the National Park Service completely forgetting about Abbey's book, but I just so happened to bring it along with me on the plane 1700 miles from home. It was the first book I read while in Washington. Aside from the $10 stipend a day and government housing deals striking so close to home, it really made me realize what an amazing place I was in (Mount Rainier National Park). It makes you look at all the details of life and appreciate it all.You tend to get a little critical of tourists though. Especially the ignorant ones...\\"Are there any dangerous animals around here?\\" -visitor\\"Only the tourists.\\" -Abbey"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I have read only about half of the book -- and that's a mark on me, not on the book. It's really complicated and deep, and I needed to take a break from it. If you don't have a good background in biology or geology, long passages must be read and re-read in order to try to lock in the meaning and the imagery that Abbey projects. It's worth it, but you have to concentrate very hard, or else the words just slip by in meaninglessness, like the names in a Russian novel.What I've taken from the book so far is the feeling of beauty and loneness (note that I didn't say loneliness) that Abbey experienced in Arches National Monument. Most of us can't handle that amount of solitude, even if we are aware that it's only temporary. We have lost the ability to wander through terrain and finding one fascination after another, or to watch the stars for hours on end.Abbey takes us with him as he had this experience, which is almost impossible to get in modern America. My sensibility is richer for his experience. And I look forward to tackling the book again."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I'm lucky enough to have a first edition copy of Desert Solitaire by Edward Abbey. I brought my old dog eared copy out and re-read it last night. My quest was to examine Abbey's walks within this classic.Edward Abbey wrote his own introduction. This is something he did for many of his books...he often quipped that nobody could write a review of his books better than he could. I guess the same applied to introductions. An introduction should concisely condense the themes of the book, without taking away the need to read it. Abbey did that, and he quickly introduces us to how he feels about walking. He writes:\\"Do not jump into your automobile next June and rush out to the canyon country hoping to see some of that which I have attempted to evoke in these pages. In the first place you can't see anything from a car; you've got to get out of the goddamned contraption and walk, better yet crawl, on hands and knees, over the sandstone and through the thornbush and cactus. When traces of blood begin to mark your trail you'll see something, maybe. Probably not.\\"Amen.His first walk happens on page 12. \\"I take my walking stick and go for a stroll down the road into the thickening darkness. I have a flashlight with me but will not use it...\\"He goes on to say: \\"There's another disadvantage to the use of the flashlight: like many other mechanical gadgets it tends to separate a man from the world around him. If I switch it on my eyes adapt to it and I can see only the small pool of light which it makes in front of me; I am isolated\\".Imagine what Abbey would say about an Ipod!Walking with a flashlight starts Abbey off on a theme. A beautiful description follows of writing a letter with the generator on. I can relate; I use a generator at times. Abbey subtly introduces us to his Ludditian theme that machines isolate us from the real world. True.Walk Number Two for Abbey takes up a whole chapter. \\"I take my cherrywood and go for a walk before breakfast\\". 15 pages of beautiful description of the Arches National Park flora and fauna follow. Simply marvelous descriptions with vintage Abbey antics and philosophy i.e. killing a rabbit by throwing a rock. Primal.Walk Number Three for Abbey happens on page 59. A survey crew arrives making plans for a new road into the park. Abbey waits for them to leave and then for five miles retraces the route of the survey crew \\"I pulled up each wooden stake and threw it away\\". This is the end of his chapter on what he calls \\"Industrial Tourism and the National Parks\\". A crusade against the automobile, which was ahead of its time. I've visited two National Parks where cars are curtailed or not allowed. Abbey had the idea first in 1968.In all, I counted around sixteen walks described in Desert Solitaire. Abbey walked his talk."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I realize 'Life-changing' may seem a bit of hyperbole when talking about a book, but this book really did that for me. Or, rather, it was the straw that broke the camel's back; the camel in this instance being my rather mundane, workaday life of working for Boise Parks and Rec in the summers and a ski resort in the winters. Edward Abbey can't claim to be the perfect environmentalist, that's for sure (he drove cars, wrote many books that were published on tons of paper), but who can? I liked this book because I identified with many of the author's feelings towards people, especially their interaction(s) with the outside world, and his own feelings that most Americans saw nothing wrong with paved roads running through wild places. Mostly I was just fed up with a couple of dead-end jobs and this book, along with Peter Fromm'sIndian Creek Chronicles: A Winter Alone in the Wilderness, propelled me to quit my jobs, move out of my apartment and hit the road. That road led me, ironically, to the largest roadless area in the lower 48 (a vast region in the dead center of Idaho) and then to Tokyo, but that's my own story, not Edward Abbey's. Desert Solitaire is filled with just the kind of characters I met in the mountain west, with their wry wit and a more grizzled approach to activism and environmentalism than just canvassing for the Sierra Club and making sure the recycling is put out every week. I could fully identify with Abbey's experience of being alone in a wild part of our country, and with his feelings of condescension when he met others ('tourists') who dared approach his newly discovered sanctuary. All that was nearly 20 years ago and I've come to learn a lot since then; mostly that the people I used to vilify are just regular Americans, same as me. I believe Abbey wrote Desert Solitaire while he was in his 20s, the same age I was when I read it, so perhaps his feelings also changed over the years. Regardless, this is a great book. It's written well enough that I felt I was living right alongside the author, feeling the bitter cold mornings as he waited for his coffee to heat up as well as the smoky darkness of his nightly fire."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"The sixties are often labeled \`tumultuous' which is as accurate as any label ever gets. For the first time since the Great Depression, a large number of rational and often intelligent Americans openly questioned the right of the duopoly (Democrat/Republican establishment) to govern and the real value of the military industrial complex to national security. The Civil Rights and anti-War Movements served as the catalyst for these Americans, but their questioning of established authority went beyond social injustice and a lunatic war. Unfortunately there was no unity of purpose, but many splinter movements looking for different rainbows. One of these splinter movements was driven by environmentalism and within this rubric was the drive to preserve U.S. wilderness areas in pristine condition as refuges from the gasoline civilization that the U.S. had become in the fifties.All of which brings us to this remarkably good and ageless 1968 book about one man's experiences as a part time ranger at the Arches National Monument in South Eastern Utah. Abbey is a marvelous nature writer, who reflects the sixties view of preservation perfectly. His argument is really quite simple: there were many places in the U.S. that really ought not to be developed into suburban enclaves or massive parking lots. He takes the U.S. Park Service to particular task because under the guise of increased accessibility it was ruining wilderness areas with an excess of paved roads, commercialism, and general suburbanization. Like many thinkers of the sixties, Abbey argues against the homogenization of American Society, the mindless construction of dams (and canals), and, of course, the commercialization of everything.Well he and his fellow \`activists' from the sixties were absolutely right and, even before Global Warming became the political football it is today, they saw humans as stewards an increasingly fragile earth. It is too bad they lost all the arguments they put forward and the establishment won. Drill baby Drill!"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"There's not a whole lot I can add to all of the reviews posted thus far, so I'll keep this brief. Abbey was ahead of his time in foreseeing the problems that would overtake not only the canyonlands area, but the nation and the world. He wasn't afraid to speak honestly, even if it meant exposing the sometimes contradictory nature that was inherent in Abbey (and that is present in all of us). While some of Abbey's other books were perhaps not up to par, Desert Solitaire is truly a great book. Some have said that it has the power to change lives. I can attest to this personally, because it changed mine."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"When he wrote this book, Cactus Ed did such a great job in describing the canyon country of southern Utah that you can recommend it to everyone who likes widerness. Not the pseudo-one we have today, no, the real one, where you can truly be in touch with the universe. I live overseas and, each time I miss the colourful landscapes of Utah, I read this book and the desert appears before my eyes. But there's not only descriptions, Abbey also try to find solutions to preserve this unique region from all the dam and road builders only looking for profit, and that's not the least interesting part ! Well, if you prefer action, read &quot;The Monkeywrench Gang&quot;. Oh yes, Ed's sometime contradictory, but who's not ? And that's also why Desert Solitaire is so powerful : Abbey didn't try to hide the good nor the bad aspects of his life there. It's a book live from the desert !"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Edward Abbey tells of his adventures as a ranger in the Arches National Park with humor, eloquence and a passion for the vanishing wilderness unmatched by any contemporary author in my experience.You'll laugh at his adventures and misadventures all the way through the book - and then be left with a lingering sadness that the area he describes with such affection is already changed.Buy it or borrow it, but read it if wish to touch a unique part of our wilderness heritage."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I've been there, the vast, silent desert. I thought no book could transport me back there, such an unworldly experience as it was. But I underestimated the power of Abbey's language. His muscular style, vivid descriptions, left me with pictures in my head, smells under my nose, sounds ringing in my ears. While some books make you feel like you're tackling a mountain, or headed towards a destination, Desert Solitaire successfully echoes the meditative, yet ruthless quality of the desert. His views about the protection of natural beauty are passionate and infectious. It can make you think twice or thrice about the fruitlessness of our petty, material lives. I plan to enjoy this one over and over, as I would a favorite song"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"First of all, Edward Abbey proves here that he is a good writer, not just another naturalist looking to snag a sympathetic ear. This is a book written with clarity and confidence, unlike other similar works. The passages are obviously painstakingly distilled from larger compositions by a master editor -- in this case, Abbey himself, who gives the reader only the best observations he first formulated during his summer as a Ranger in the Arches National Park several decades ago. Nothing is hesitant here, there are no arms or legs that do not belong. Above all, it's just a good story, an entertaining read. A soul spending a season mostly alone in one of the more remote places in the United States, and the triumphs and trials he encounters therein.Most of the descriptions are in form somewhat like the desert Abbey is attempting to accurately portray: precise, sparse, even dry. Nothing is there which should not be, no statement jars the poetic ear, each sentence is precisely placed, and no passage is needlessly embellished to create what would otherwise be your typical humdrum travelogue.And even the problems I find in the book are not so much faults that exist in the writing itself as differences in opinion between Abbey's conception of humanity and my own. Basically, his patronizing attitude towards people who are not as naturally-inclined as himself made for a less entertaining read, at least in my case. In other words, I could have done without all the bitter sarcasm and thinly-veiled insults hurled at the natural wonders I consider no less significant than any sunlit desert arch: human beings.I don't think the great wonders or mysteries of the world should be accessible only to some self-appointed few, for example, who have (temporarily, anyway) the good fortune, youth, and strength to be able to get out there and grasp their totality, while I do think that any great city is just as marvellous as any great desert, and that a single man is worth more than any mountain in the world.Basically, I didn't enjoy the background noise to the stories, but I liked the stories themselves.Purely personal review, but what else can a review be, right?"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Actually, I really liked that he was so passionate about experiencing nature, and unwilling to bow to the demands of industrial tourism. The cedars, primrose and LGB's (little gray birds) need an advocate, and Abbey was a stirring, uncompromising voice for life and wildness."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"As with so much in life, what you think of this book will depend on the circumstances of your encounter. I was fortunate to find it in the \\"old\\" Jerome Hotel in Aspen in the early 1970s and read it out loud with my girl friend of that summer as we traveled the West. There is no greater READING experience than to sit on a rock above the Goosenecks of the San Jaun River and, reading aloud at sunset, discover Abbey's fierce voice and love of the very place you are.A wonderful read it was, but I wonder how that voice would sound today. I'll not jeopardize my memory and reread it, but if you haven't, get it and see for yourself. You won't forget it."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"In this fascinating ecological memoir/rant, Abbey takes us along during his time as a park ranger in the heart of Utah's harsh red rock landscape to expose its beauty and contradictions. While some things have changed since the book's publication in 1968, the majority of Abbey's thoughts and experiences remain timeless. A true classic of environmental nonfiction."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"A story about giving it all up and living in the wild. It is about a year spent living out in wild country in Utah, and all the happenings that go along with it. Really just a classic book that should be read by everyone. I read it every year, and it just makes me want to quit my job and move out into the desert, which I probably will do one of these days.Bob Rodgers"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I can't rave about this book enough, It was required reading for a literature of the outdoors class I took in college a decade ago and I've probably read it 20+ times since then. My copy is tattered, highlighted and written all over. Growing up in rural Utah I feel Abbey's pain towards the paving and developing of these beautiful areas. I crave the solitude that he writes about, understand the attachment towards random small creatures and can't help but laugh and nod my head in agreement at his rants. Anyone who spends time in pristine wilderness, redrock desert or not, will appreciate this read."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"While Ed Abbey preferred to be remembered for his novels - and they are worth remembering - it is Desert Solitaire that is his magnum opus. It is a brilliant and astonishing book, that is much more than a memoir. It is at once a plea for preservation of the last vestiges of the wild American West, a harangue against the department of transportation and the automobile idolatry, and a philosophical-political treatise on society and solidarity and surfaces. As metaphysics, Desert Solitaire challenges the dichotomy of appearance and reality, of surface play and essence. Abbey writes in the intro: \\"Here I must confess that I know nothing whatever about true underlying reality, having never met any...For my own part I am pleased enough with surfaces -- in fact they alone seem to me to be of much importance.\\" As a political treatise, the book argues for a limited government, that leaves some things untouched, and for the individual need to have some place to go and escape from the regulations and routines that define normalcy. He appeals to the lover of nature, that the wild no longer remains wild when it is universally accessible; the job of a good park service should be to limit easy access in order to promote real contact. The book is full of surprising and wonderful descriptions of red rocks and cliffs and snakes and jack rabbits and ruggedly wild plants; it is brimming with outrageous suggestions that start out sounding funny until you wonder that he may mean them seriously and further begin to wonder whether he may be right to really mean them. Perhaps most touching and powerful are his reflections on the way down the Colorado river on a raft, as the clock was ticking for the end of it all with the coming of the Glen Canyon dam and the artificial Lake Powell. A masterpiece of American literature, on par withWalden."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"A look at Arches National Park and the environment surrounding Moab, Utah before paved roads and development, when the area was still pristine and human traffic was sparse. A case for increased vigilance of our protected lands - sprinkled with socio-cultural critique, the kind only Abbey can deliver."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This is \\"classic Abbey\\" and his best work. What else can be said? This book should be on everyone's reading list whether you agree with Abbey on everything or not. I loved it. You will especially enjoy it if you have an affinity for deserts, the southwest, or Moab country."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This book is a moment in time. A meditation on what was in the face of what was to come. It despaired a bit in the imagined future of the Arches, but, ultimately, reveled in the moment.But the moment is the only real thing. The future is what it might be, and the past is something only dreamed upon. And this moment in time is one worth spending with Ranger Abbey. This is a moment spent in a little tin trailer with the most perceptive man available. This is a moment spent that you know is real.There is a poetry of solitude that few can capture. A longing for the universal, but a need to stand alone. A bit of a dichotomy, but one that you might be able to wrap your head around...Suffice it to say that the howl of pain and ultimate aloneness in a bowl of water where you might possibly die alone is a powerful moment. An embarassing excursion that puts your life on the line. By uncareful accident.But you really haven't lived your life until that has happened to you, now, has it? Welcome to Abbey's road. Read this and find your own way..."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This is the cover and version of the book I purchased at the UC Santa Barbara book store in January 1977. Edward Abbey, a true curmudgeon, writes beautifully and with passion about his American Southwest, with his narrow and sometimes brusque dismissal of \\"technology\\" being excused by his obvious love for the desert and the rocks and the snakes et al. His writing glows with that energy, and provided me a springboard from which to raise my own environmental sensibility. A life changer, and a damn fun read, still, thirty plus years on."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This is where the cranky hardcore desert conservationism of Edward Abbey truly took wing, and the book is a well-deserved classic in environmentalist circles. In the late 60s, Abbey wrote about his season as a ranger in Utah's then-little developed Arches National Monument (now a heavily \\"improved\\" National Park), plus his explorations of the nearby mountains, canyons, and deserts. Of special importance here is the story of Abbey's rafting trip down Glen Canyon, one of the last such journeys before the horrendous dam was built, plus an extremely rare exploration of \\"The Maze\\" area near Canyonlands National Park. Abbey surely found his lifelong love of the desert during this time, and the book's philosophy runs toward what would now be called \\"hard ecology,\\" in which humans are given no place of importance in the natural world &#8211; except for those humans who can \\"really\\" appreciate it. Of course, Abbey and his cohorts qualify.Abbey's philosophy at this point was rather unfocused and contradictory, as he doesn't mind bragging about carving his name in a tree, or rolling an old tire into the Grand Canyon, while complaining about tourists who don&#8217;t have the proper level of respect for nature. His writing is undeniably cranky, irreligious, anarchistic, antisocial, and even anti-human at times, such as the infamous line in which he says he'd rather kill a man than a snake, plus frequent musings on wrecking the monuments of human civilization. However, Abbey's worldview extends far beyond these problematic details, in that he defined the philosophy of communing with nature, which has become incredibly influential to outdoor lovers and serious conservationists. This book is the ultimate resource in learning about how living without the conveniences of civilization can really shape a person's appreciation for the Earth. [~doomsdayer520~]"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"If you have ever gone to a National Park, and been angered by roads that lead to every attraction, and tourists who don't leave their cars, Edward Abbey agrees with you. He agrees very strongly with you. Here he tells stories from his time in the deserts of Utah and Arizona. His description of Glen Canyon, before it was flooded to create Lake Powell, is the best I have ever read of a place. This is a great, almost poetic description of a place, the desert, that Abbey held a special love for. It is hard to read this book and not bring away your own love of the canyons and mesas, arches and dunes, of the southwestern desert."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Edward Abbey reflects and reports on a summer he spent as a ranger at Arches National Park in Utah. At that time, Arches was in a pre \\"industrialized park\\" state. Desert Solitaire is his tale of adventures and his book of memories. Below is a sprinkling of quotes to give you a taste, a flavor, of what you can expect.\\"Every man, every woman, carries in heart and mind the image of the ideal place, the right place, the one true home, known or unknown, actual or visionary\\" (p. 1).\\"... I have personal convictions to uphold. Ideals, you might say. I prefer not to kill animals. I'm a humanist; I'd rather kill a man than a snake\\" (p. 20).\\"Don't actually care for ants. Neurotic little pismires\\" (p. 30).\\"We need more predators. The sheepmen complain, it is true, that the coyotes eat some of their lambs. This is true but do they eat enough? I mean, enough lambs to keep the coyotes sleek, healthy, and well fed. That is my concern\\" (p. 35).\\"We are kindred all of us, killer and victim, predator and prey, me and the sly coyote, the soaring buzzard, the elegant gopher snake, the trembling cottontail, the foul worms that feed on our entrails, all of them, all of us. Long live diversity, long live the earth!\\" (p. 38-39).\\"An increasingly pagan and hedonistic people (thank God!), we are learning finally that the forests and mountains and desert canyons are holier than our churches. Therefore let us behave accordingly\\" (p. 60).\\"A man could be a lover and defender of the wilderness without ever in his lifetime leaving the boundaries of asphalt, powerlines, and right-angled surfaces. We need wilderness whether or not we ever set foot in it\\" (p. 148).\\"'Ralph Newcomb', I say, 'do you believe in God?''Who?' he says.'Who?''Who.''You said it,' I say\\" (p. 180).\\"'Newcomb, for godsake where do we come from?''Who knows?''Where are we going?''Who cares?''Who?''Who'\\" (p. 185).\\"But the love of wilderness is more than a hunger for what is always beyond reach; it is also an expression of loyalty to the earth, the earth which bore us and sustains us, the only home we shall ever know, the only paradise we ever need - if only we had the eyes to see. Original sin, the true original sin, is the blind destruction for the sake of greed of this natural paradise which lies all around us - if only we were worthy of it\\" (p. 190).\\"What does [the desert] mean? It means nothing. It is as it is and has no need for meaning. The desert lies beneath and soars beyond any possible human qualification. Therefore, sublime\\" (p. 219).\\"I am almost prepared to believe that this sweet virginal primitive land will be grateful for my departure and the absence of the tourists, will breath metaphorically a collective sigh of relief - like a whisper of wind - when we are all and finally gone and the place and its creations can return to their ancient procedures unobserved and undisturbed by the busy, anxious, brooding consciousness of man\\" (p. 300).Enjoy. Abbey is a writer first, a naturalist second. He takes liberties as necessary to tell his story, so this only seems like an autobiography. Obviously, he was less concerned then about \\"political correctness.\\" I suspect he would be as irreverent today."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"If only we could travel back in time to a world less paved... Abbey's adventures in Utah and Arizona are adventures many crave and find it harder and harder to find in today's small world. This book is special, provocative, a tad crazy, and above all, a wonderful experience. A must have for any lover of the wild."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This is a collection of romance stories. Romance between a man and the land. Edward Abbey writes lovingly about the stark beauty of Arches National Park -- a hard edged place of immense and awe inspiring beauty.Weaving impressions of a summer spent as a park ranger living in a trailer with minimal comforts, Mr. Abbey exhibits his virtuosity in taking us out where the stars touch the desert. The place has a completely unique personality of its own and Abbery describes it lovingly and raw.After World War II Moab, Utah became a boomtown for uranium mining. The wide disparity between nature's splendor and man's desire to build weapons of destruction set the stage for one unforgettable chapter, &quot;Rocks&quot; that I've read at least a half a dozen times.After reading Desert Solitaire you'll want to go this magnificent part of Utah. If you've been to that part of the country and want to go back, read it. The sweep of the country and Abbey's wry wit is a thoroughly satisfying reading experience."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Desert Solitaire is definently worth reading. Edward Abbey is humorous and informative. His writing is very thoughtful and his plan to get rid of cars and roads in national parks (which has not been very successful) is a great idea. Too many people don't get away from the business of every day life and spend time alone with their thoughts. The book can be dry at times when he writes about twenty different kinds of flowers and their scientific names, but he is a great story-teller when he tells of his adventures."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Abbey's &quot;Desert Solitaire&quot; is a classic, and I can hardly add to the adoring comments others have already made.However, I can point out the irony the book itself represents. The people who hold the book up as an icon of the wilderness movement are often the very people Abbey would have deplored. For example, the mountain bikers who treat the Arches National Mounument as their own personal playground--who throw beer bottles around, play loud music, and leave bycicle skid marks on the slick rock--love Abbey's book and think of him as a &quot;righteous dude,&quot; but their cavalier treatment of this natural wonder represents the very thing that Abbey condemns in &quot;Desert Solitaire.&quot;I shed a tear everytime I reread &quot;Desert Solitaire,&quot; for Arches has become worse than Abbey's greatest fears."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Reading this book is, I feel, an unspoken duty of all people with any interest in what allows them to live. Unlike some readers, I interpret Abbey's vision of the best lifestyle as a balance between roots (nature) and future (society). He is not a Luddite, nor is he an anarchist. This book offends many due to its strong views (name one person that made a difference about something they were ambivalent over). The key to understanding Desert Solitaire is; (yes here comes the platitude); keeping an open mind. There is no better way to phrase it."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Abbey perceives the west and wild places in a way people overlook, by getting the word accross (In a crude Abbey humor way) that there Isn't a need for paved roads and parking lots in beautiful secluded places. He also tells about his adventures in serene senic places before Industrialism or &quot;Industrial tourism&quot; arrived. This book put me in a different place, a place I cannot put into words, from a view other than the car window. Read it."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I have always wanted to visit the desert southwest. Last year, after 33 years I finally got the chance. Abbey, in a very small book, encapsulates in a big way the essence of what I saw and experienced in my two week stay in Northern Arizona, Utah, and Nevada. Slow, uncrowded, earthy natural beauty. His prose is witty and sometimes self loathing or loathing of people in general. The kind of personality that would be right at home in the surroundings that he writes about. In another life Abbey and I probably would have been twins (or the same person). Heck, I'm even from the same area of Pennsylvania that he was from. His love for the desert and aloneness I found to be in kindred spirit. A sole voice crying from the wilderness."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Edward Abbey was recommended to me 3 years ago when I was backpacking through the Utah Wilderness.

You can only imagine what National Parks and wilderness areas of Eastern Utah and the United States were like before commercial interests got a hold of them. He was a man ahead of his time."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"If you love the desert, you should already have read this book if not bought a copy or two.

This book contains the personal and critical view and the experience of an outdoor man in an industrial world. It tells stories about dangerous adventures full of action an humor. If you have ever been in the canyon country this book is a must."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This slim volume describes Edward Abbey's experiences in and around Arches National Park, mostly before it was developed. The book is a collection of related essays rather thanone single narrative. It includes some very entertaining anecdotes, beautiful descriptions of nature, and Abbey's observations on the commercialization of the remaining American wilderness areas. As it was written in the 1960s, it is somewhat dated but gives a good idea of what Arches was like before the National Parks Service \`improved' it. One of the main points it makes is that it is not possible to make wilderness areas easily accessible and still maintain the feeling of being in the wilderness.This book should be especially appreciated by those who are presently between trips to the Southwest; although it is unfortunately only a rather poor substitute for the real thing."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This book stinks of Neitzsche. Mr. Abbey was as much a loaner as Fredreiche ever was. While staying at the Lazy Lizard Hostel in Moab, I read this book for the first time and discovered the greatness of this desert land in my two week stay there. The desert of Utah is uncompromising and incompassionate, not to be taken advantage of. The small area of land known as Moab is not for the faint of heart, its for those who love nature at its extreme. Unfortunately, the street (there is really only one) of Moab is now lined with 4x4 rental places, a Wendy's, a McDonald's, and all the other garbage that comes with civilization. Abbey's premontions were correct, this place has sadly turned into a Mecca for tourits and 4 wheelers who have no respect for this land and those who came before them. If you go here, pay close attention to the rock and how time has played its cruel tricks upon it, clockwise as the Arches deteriorate."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"When Edward Abbey writes about the natural scenery of Utah it is splendid and a joy. When he moves on to his philosophy it is a struggle to stick through to the next page. The level of his hypocrisy is only matched by the level of his misanthropy. I could respect his opinions if he had quit work and moved to the desert, but he took a job for a capitalist government to tend the needs of the tourists, so all his rants about the same ring hollow. His ideas are what you would expect for a first year college student angry with society, not the deep thinker he takes himself to be. The number of glowing reviews really surprises me. I suspect many of them maybe didn't get passed the first couple chapters (which are great, great chapters). It's a wonderful topic but there are probably better sources out there."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This book arrived promptly and is in good condition.

This is an autobiographical account of Abby's time as a ranger in Arches National Park, as well as some of his adventures, such as going down the Colorado River through Glen Canyon before it was made inaccessible by the construction of Powell Dam and Lake Powell. It is a philosophical treatise about man's treatment of the environment, and shows his personal views which are expressed in fiction in \\"The Monkey Wrench Gang.\\" It waxes and wanes, with some parts better than others.

Fun to read before you go."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Desert Solitaire is not a new book. However, it speaks to major issues, namely the proper relationship between human beings and nature. It is true that in general our vision is too anthroprocentric,: We are considering ourselves as much too important. In this process of our exaggerated self-importance, we tend to disturb nature and destroy the planet that is our home. Abbey provides a corrective to that faulty vision and adds much to our appreciation of nature and our ability to see it in terms of its own beauty and not its utility to us. His description of the beauty of the wilderness and the canyonlands is rich. Abbey's tone can be abrasive, but his argument is sound. He is well read in literature and philosophy, and his arguments have a philosophical bent."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Just finished reading Edward Abbey's Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness. I like to think of them as essays by a curmudgeon who truly celebrated the wild and being out in it. Alone but hardly lonely, here was a man who cared deeply for our wildest places and wrote about them as he lived in them: passionately. A true conservationist, we could all learn from him and his desire to keep the natural places as they are. Keep the motorized vehicles to a minimum in National Parks. Keep the paved roads out. Get out of our refrigerated boxes and breathe the fresh air and have a look around! Walk and actually see the beauty that surrounds you!Whether he was writing about rafting down the Colorado River before it changes forever due to the addition of another dam, or his \\"ownership\\" of the arches at the end of his first summer as a park ranger at Arches National Monument, you feel every bit of his fierce desire to protect the land coming through in every word. You feel his kinship with every tree, rock and tumbleweed that he comes across, every snake he brings into his camper to take care of the mouse population.I am grateful for his words, his many pilgrimages, his anger and his willingness to show it. It is the fierce protectors who are the guardians and stewards of this beautiful land.He is one minute cranky environmentalist and the next touching wordsmith. \\"If no one is looking for you write your will in the sand and let the wind carry your words and signature east to the borders of Colorado and south to the pillars of Monument Valley - someday, never fear, your bare elegant bones will be discovered and wondered and marveled at.\\"This is a great collection of essays which I recommend. I look forward to reading more of his work."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness","review":"When Edward Abbey died in 1989 he left behind a body of work--both fiction and essays--tolling his anarchistic, environmentalist social criticism. Yet his 1968 nonfictional \\"Desert Solitaire\\" remains the book for which, appropriately, he is most remembered.Based on his seasonal job as park ranger at Arches National Monument during the 1950s, it is an unforgettable book. It makes the reader want to follow Abbey out into the desert, with a parting raspberry for \\"syphilization,\\" as he calls it.Alone and at times lonely, Abbey lived three summers in a tin trailer 20 miles from Moab, Utah--though sleeping under the stars and avoiding his government-supplied home as much as possible. Occasionally he jawed with a smattering of tourists, at times pursued outdoor adventures with likeminded misfits and cowboys, but generally remained solitaire. Just Abbey, the desert and its array of living things--animal, vegetable, and, for him, mineral. The mountains and sand, the rocks and rivers, became for Abbey a living organism, the desert, that would outlive all others.Taken largely from his desert journals, the book quenches like cool water from an oasis. A first glance, however, would show only scattered essays, polemics, travel adventures, philosophy, science, sarcasm, hearsay, and amateur anthropology (Abbey's ongoing study of \\"rattus urbanus,\\" which summers in the desert). But dig just a bit and you find issuing forth a steady, sustaining and vivifying narrative: The story of a sensual man (admittedly driven somewhat insane by his hermitage) striving, with great verve and courage, to live fully and, with great wit, intelligence, and heart, to comprehend his world.Our protagonist, Abbey, holds these disparate musings and adventures together by the force of his character: his iconoclasm, his thoughtfulness, his raw energy. Like Thoreau he sets out \\"to confront the elemental,\\" non-human world in the desert--a typically American urge, particularly manifest out West, to seek solace in solitude. And like Thoreau what he finds there is himself.An admitted sensualist, he relishes sleeping on hard ground and feeling the fluid motion of his own body as he climbs mountains and swims rivers; he cherishes the hardscrabble life of a cowboy (work he performs on his days off) and the smooth feel of good whiskey or a friendly woman. But most of all he loves freedom. And here in the desert he finds it and wonders how Man can keep it.The question and quest of freedom are never far from his mind, whether waxing poetic or polemical. He muses on the spareness and simplicity of the desert--two qualities he admires in most things--where \\"the living organism [including Abbey] stands out bold and brave and vivid against the lifeless sand and barren rock.\\"But then, typically, he adds to his aesthetic judgment his philosophic: \\"Love flowers best in openness and freedom.\\" This, like most of Abbey's judgments here, has the ring of truth and rightness and leaves the reader nodding in agreement and regret.Despite such occasional philosophic delicacy, Abbey is anything but sweetness and light. His pen pours corrosive acid on modernity, government (namely, the Park Service, dam builders, and Bureau of Indian Affairs), and Industrial Tourism, as he calls it, which works to enrich the auto and hotel industries at nature's expense.Yet his unbridled contempt for contemporary culture, mankind, and mechanistic life is leavened by his wit, as when he refers to himself not as an atheist but an \\"earthiest.\\" And when he cautions an uncomprehending elderly tourist on the dangers of television: a vacuum tube capable of sucking out her brain.Though Abbey rises through these pages rough-edged, misanthropic, vitriolic, or vulgar, we never forget that we are in the company of an intelligent, educated writer, Stanford-trained and invoking Shakespeare, T.S. Eliot, Lawrence (both of them), Balzac, and Hegel. But we enjoy his company nonetheless, for his reverence for nature and wilderness, for his risking his life (which he almost loses on a few occasions) in his worship of it, for his humanity and honesty. And for the lessons he teaches us and the poignant journeys he invites us on--like his raft trip down Glen Canyon, now lost to view thanks to the damming of the Colorado.Along the way he finds God--or some facsimile--in the eternal resiliency of the desert: \\"Let men in their madness blast every city on earth into black rubble and envelope the entire planet in a cloud of lethal gas--the canyons and hills, the springs and rocks will still be here, the sunlight will filter through, water will form and warmth shall be upon the land and after sufficient time, no matter how long, somewhere, living things will emerge and join and stand once again, this time perhaps to take a different and better course.\\"Such is optimism Abbey-style. Yet the reader senses our species' tenacity and combativeness in Abbey's informed fierceness, and leaves his desert reassured and reverent."},{"Title":"The universal constant in living","review":"Mouritz,London, has brought out a new edition of the Universal Constant in Living, F.M. Alexander's last book.Edited and annotated by Jean Fischer, whose editions of 'Man's Supreme Inheritance' and the 'Articles and Lectures' collection have raised the standard for the serious study of Alexander, this promises to be a MUST for teachers and students of the Alexander Technique.The book is a sort of footnote to the earlier books, there is some problem with sprawl. But Alexander never wrote more clearly and succinctly."},{"Title":"The universal constant in living","review":"For those familiar with or having interest in the work of F. M. Alexander, possibly one of the more important and insufficiently recognized thinkers of the 20th century, this book is essential reading. In it he elaborates in greater depth, and I think after the perspective of further years of experience, upon his ideas about how the human race can be helped by the use of conscious work to eliminate harmful habits and reactions. It takes some effort to stay with his train of thought, (his language and writing structure, with some very long, elaborate sentences is not always easy going) but it is well worth the effort."},{"Title":"The Rowley poems","review":"You have to be an enthusiast of the short lived Thomas Chatterton to appreciate this book. I was hoping to find some kind of evidence to support the assertion that Chatterton did not commit suicide but died from over medicating himself with arsenic. I still suspect it was suicide. Age 17 is quite young to call it quits and it's sad really. One cannot help but wonder what was going through his mind at the time, and his poems are his legacy. Such is life."},{"Title":"One More Unfortunate","review":"This book is sometimes listed with the subtitle: \\"The Strange Trial of Arthur Groome\\". It is an appropriate subtitle as the vast majority of the text focuses on the trial of the accused.The crime concerned is the brutal slashing-dismemberment murder of a Soho (London) prostitute. The man accused is a respectable professional with a wife and family: Arthur Groome.The trial proceeds and winds its way through the British courts circa 1947. I found it a real \\"page-turner\\" with the climax being the verdict. The author, Edgar Lustgarten, carefully balances the prosecution and the defense and the final verdict is very much in question until the end. It is an easy read with rich character description: \\"She was fatter than ever, and the bags under her eyes hung like some horrible decaying fruit.\\" An interesting little book if you're interested in crime novels or British courtroom drama."},{"Title":"Woman's life in colonial days (American classics)","review":"Woman's Life in Colonial Days is a very detailed, very informative, book by Carl Holliday, first published in 1922. This makes it a very interesting study, not just on women of the Colonial period but also a study on how women are viewed in the early 20th Century. The book tries to answer the question what was life like for women in the colonies? The book compares their lives to the life of modern women, at least those modern women of the 1920s. Studying letters, diaries and other sources the book gets into marriages, day-to-day life, social issues, religion, education, home life and even touches on romance. Sometimes harsh, always hard, but also full of hope and passion, the book allows us to peek into the lives of such great women as Dolly Madison, Martha Washington, and Eliza Pinckney, along with the thousands of women who lived in Boston, Charleston, Philadelphia, and New York. From Quakers to Puritans, from Mothers to charming hostess, this book allows us to see the many sides of the women of colonial America."},{"Title":"Woman's life in colonial days (American classics)","review":"A Woman's Life in Colonial Days was written by Carl Holliday, and first published in 1922. My quick research did not turn up much on Mr. Holliday except that he seems to have been a literature professor -- at first Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, Professor of English University of Toledo; and later a professor in California. But wherever he resided, his focus was on early American history. And he quotes easily from both primary and secondary sources.His writing style, as might be expected of a Professor of English, is very good. The book, though academic, has an easy style and flow.The subject, of course, is 'women in the colonial period': the various aspects of their lives: religion, education, at home, social life and dress, etc.Here is the TOC:I -- COLONIAL WOMAN AND RELIGIONII -- COLONIAL WOMAN AND EDUCATIONIII -- COLONIAL WOMAN AND THE HOMEIV -- COLONIAL WOMAN AND DRESSV -- COLONIAL WOMAN AND SOCIAL LIFEVI -- COLONIAL WOMAN AND MARRIAGEVII -- COLONIAL WOMAN AND THE INITIATIVEBIBLIOGRAPHYINDEXWhat surprised -- and dare I say delighted me -- about the book, besides Holliday's vast knowledge, was the fact that he was so 'progressive' in most of his outlook. Although there is certainly some parts of his work we can be offended by, for the most part Holliday presents his knowledge supported by the original sources; he neither rants against the harsh ways of the past, neither is he an apologist for them.Instead he smartly leads the reader through some pretty horrendous days in our nation's (USA's) history. And I must say that I will never look upon the Puritans in the same way again. It's not that Prof. Holliday condemns them as much as he lets their own words do the talking.I'm not usually the sort of reader that seeks out the opinions of others for 'what happened'. I tend to like to read what people at the time wrote for themselves. BUT I greatly enjoyed this book. Prof. Holliday gave me the benefit of his superior knowledge, and at the same time used so many original sources that I did not feel deprived.Recommend this to readers who want to learn more about our early history and how our forebearers lived and thought.Pam Tpageinhistory"},{"Title":"Woman's life in colonial days (American classics)","review":"This book is a photocopied volume of an out of print book.

Of those, this is that best that I've read and I recommend it for Christians, agnostics and others. It begins with an introduction about how the New Testament came to be written and collected (and what language it was written in). Then each book of the New Testament is given a separate chapter. The books which seem so disparate are drawn together in the final chapter. Hunter's english is superb and the whole book is eminently readable. Also, his background knowledge is top bracket. Further, his aim is to help the reader to understand all parts of the New Testament (which, let's face it, is a literary mess) and he does this with care and patience. He goes to the trouble of rewriting in paraphrase some of the difficult letters. It is not a book of dogma, and Hunter doesn't attempt to hide the inconsistencies in the New Testament.

It's fun, full of adventure and humor and highly romantic without any sex scenes. I love this series and I love this author. I haven't found a bad book by her.This book introduces the tale of the cyphers. Carriers smuggle the cyphers to one location, where they are decoded. They reveal the location of the Jacobite treasure that was gathered to help fund Prince Charlie's futile bid to take his rightful place on the throne of England. After he failed, his followers are hunted down by British troops, often in brutal fashion. Even people who aren't loyal to Charlie sometimes help out the refugees. The idea is to redistribute the treasure back to the families who donated it as many are in need financially and/or just want their family heirlooms back. Also, having the heirlooms back will protect them should the Brits starting nosing around asking questions about missing necklaces, etc.So the carriers must hide from British troops and treasure hunters and often have many adventures along the way, always with romance involved.Great fun and reminds me of the swashbucklers starring Errol Flynn and Tyrone Power."},{"Title":"Practice to Deceive - The Golden Chronicles #1","review":"This is a great read (as are all the Golden Chronicles), but I particularly found this installment to be exciting.

When I first read this book I checked it out of the library, since then I have checked it out several more times and each time I fall in love with the hero more and more. I guess what I really enjoyed about this story is the heroine's journey to realize how strong she really is despite her circumstances. There are disguises, action and heartache. It has everything.

Mary is a superb writer, and I love the subtle way she has extended the Peter Pan story in this absolute gem.While the original Peter Pan story revolved around Peter's attempt to delay Wendy's transition to womanhood (he took the children on her last night in the nursery), in Second Star we find Peter Pan (the Guardian of the Dead and the Lost Souls) is pivotal to the now aging Wendy's transition to the next life - which as the book suggests, may also be in the Never Land.Mythology and quantum reality theory aside, this is also a beautiful love story, and the way in which Faye's relationship unfolds is just challenging enough to keep you guessing.First class piece of writing.

Faye feels lucky that she managed to rent the house the trio now shares with another American expatriate Dr. Jack Graham and its owner crazy Wendy Forrester. Wendy swears that she is the model used by Barrie in Peter Pan.As Faye becomes fond of her elderly landlady, her two children remain unhappy until Jack begins to enchant them. Jack sees the magic is inside Faye and her children and wants to become part of it. He now believes in love. However, while Faye's heart pleads for happy ever after, her brain says Prince Charming is a male chauvinist hoax.SECOND STAR TO THE RIGHT is a great romantic fantasy that pays homage to Peter Pan. Seeking the references to J.M. Barrie's work adds much delight to an enchanting tale. The lead characters will move readers with their need to believe even when they doubt. The two children and Wendy provide Pan-like touches while the landlady's daughter deserves the hook treatment for tinkering with her mother's affection.

After all, Faye O'Neill had to do something to protect her children from her ex-husband. She did not want them growing up in fear. Of course, one look at Tom, her son, and it was obvious that he was afraid. Tom rarely spoke to anyone except to his mom and to his sister Maddie. Maddie was better at hiding her fear. Even though they were on the other side of the ocean, Faye and her kids still lived in fear that some day they would be found. She had rented the apartment, or &quot;flat&quot; as she was informed, without even seeing it. Faye had been that desperate. An American professor lived in the flat below her. The landlady's mother lived in the flat above her. Faye was extremely curious, as to why they were forbidden to visit the elderly lady. She kept her questions to herself, because she did not want to lose the flat. Faye could not have asked for a better place to stay. Her children warmed to the idea a little better, when they visited the garden and saw the statue of a little boy. Dr. Jack Graham loved challenges. He certainly found one the day he met Faye and her children. He believed every child should have the chance to believe in the magic, be it the magic of Santa Claus, Easter Bunny or even Peter Pan. Clearly, Faye did not believe the same way. She declared all those things were advertising gimmicks. Her children would grow up knowing the truth. Jack's heart went out to the two children. He was ready for the challenge, though. He would win over the children and their mother, or there was no such thing as Peter Pan. I laughed. I cried. I believed. The magic leaps off the pages of SECOND STAR TO THE RIGHT and dares one not to believe. Don't miss this one. The romance between Faye and Jack plays an important part in the plot, but the primary plot is more about healing old wounds and the power of believing. SECOND STAR TO THE RIGHT is Mary Alice Kruesi's debut book under the Kruesi name. She has two books written as Mary Alice Monroe. Her latest book was GIRL IN THE MIRROR.

He was a very impressive speaker, drawing from a seemingly bottomless well of ecological design ideas. His work has taken him far and wide and in the process allowed him to revamp many of his views on environmental design. This book is an extensively updated version of his seminal book on the subject. It has become a bit dated in the 20 years since its release, especially in regard to computer software design. But, most of the material he covers is still relavent to the present, as we have only begun to scratch the surface of sound ecological ideas.Having read the more recent books on ecological design by Sim Van Der Ryn and William McDonough, I was surprised to see that neither mentioned Papanek, who prefigured many of the ideas they present in their current books. Papanek long ago advocated the lease/use principle, which makes much more sense in a rapidly changing technological world than does the buy/own principle that continues to dominate our social thinking. Papanek notes the many cultural and psychological blocks we have created for ourselves when it comes to ecological design, but also illustrates how we can overcome these blocks with methods such as bisociation, first proposed by Arthur Koestler. But, what really makes this book stand out are the great number of illustrations that Papanek uses to demonstrate his ideas. This is one of the most practical books written on environmental design.While Papanek was an industrial designer, his ideas are equally germaine to the field of architecture and biology. He advocated a multi-disciplinary approach, feeling that our universities had become too compartimentalized and were stifling creativity, which needs cross-pollination in order to thrive. The book is as inpiring as his lectures. Papanek challenges the reader to explore new avenues, not continue to follow the status quo, which only results in creative dead-ends."},{"Title":"Design for the Real World: Human Ecology and Social Change","review":"I have just read about V.Papanek's recent death. I can't believe I wrote my past comment just 4 days before his death. I feel very moved, it's a big loss for the design world. I am copying here what the IDSA wrote about him: Victor Papanek Passes Away (1926-1998) Internationally renowned designer, professor and mentor Victor Papanek, IDSA, passed away at age 72 on January 10. His health had been failing him for the past three years. Papanek was widely admired for his advocacy of socially responsible design. He once summed up his chosen field this way: &quot;The only important thing about design is how it relates to people.&quot; In remembering Papanek, Honorary IDSA member Ralph Caplan, remarked that &quot;He was the first industrial designer to really begin to talk critically about design as a force for good and suggesting that, conventionally design wasn't necessarily that.&quot; Papanek was the J.L. Constant Professor of Architecture and Design at the University of Kansas since 1981 and was author of eight books on design. In his revolutionary and best-selling Design for the Real World, first published in 1971, and since translated into 23 languages, Papanek suggested something both startling and prophetic: the necessity for designers to adopt a morally responsible and holistic approach, adapting technology to the individual's real needs and tapping into the wisdom and experience of other societies, particularly those of the Third World. He traveled around the world giving lectures about his ideas on ecologically sound designs to serve the poor, the disabled and the elderly. He was closely connected with folk art and crafts and studied Oriental, Eskimo and American Indian cultures to better understand basic human needs and their relationship to design. &quot;All designed tools and objects are sort of extensions of human abilities, and they do tend to make life richer for us,&quot; Papanek told the Kansas City Star in an interview in 1994. But, he added, &quot;an awful lot of designs, especially in this country, make life a lot more inconvenient. I'm thinking, for instance, of high-fidelity units that have so many switches and toggles and buttons and things that they confuse most people. Papanek was born in Vienna, Austria, and went to public schools in England. He studied design and architecture at the Cooper Union in New York City and did postgraduate studies in design at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He taught at many different institutions including the Ontario College of Art and the Royal Academy of Architecture in Copenhagen, Denmark. Before joining the KU faculty, he headed the design departments at the Kansas City Art Institute and the California Institute of Arts. He received numerous awards and honors, such as a Distinguished Designer Fellowship from the NEA and the UN (UNESCO) Award for Outstanding Design of Developing Nations. He created products for such organizations as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and for the World Health Organization. Papanek is survived by his former wife, Harlanne Herdman, and two daughters, Nicolette Papanek and Jennifer Satu Papanek.

I would have studied under him at the University of Kansas, if not for his untimely and unfortunate passing. This book is one of the best books on the principles and ethics of design. It illustrates both the designer's responsibility and the potential to affect real change in the world through design. This most renowned of works by Papanek focuses on industrial design in two parts: How It Is, and How It Could Be. Papanek encourages radical thinking in design, and most of the topics in the book are easily translated to architecture. To my knowledge, reading this book has never been a required part of the core curriculum at the School of Architecture and Urban Design here at KU, but in my opinion, it should be."},{"Title":"Design for the Real World: Human Ecology and Social Change","review":"I read it first before studying industrial design. Then read bits of it every semester of study. Now, a professional, I was thrilled when I found the new edition. I've always thought the world needs to work more like Papanek proposes, and actually, I think now people are becoming a lot more aware of the issues raised here. Papanek's predictions or ideals are happening: In ecology, social work, and ethics. I admire this author, and it's all because of this book, to start with."},{"Title":"Design for the Real World: Human Ecology and Social Change","review":"I got this book for my senior thesis paper on sustainable design, and I was amazed at the wealth of information I found inside. Be sure to read the preface before you dive into it as it provides a little more context. I'd recommend it to any graphic designer, industrial designer, or architect who wants to apply their skills to the real world."},{"Title":"Design for the Real World: Human Ecology and Social Change","review":"For students of design, or those simply interested in design, this book is full of informative and practical insights into the overall design process."},{"Title":"Design for the Real World: Human Ecology and Social Change","review":"Many citizens think design means fashion, color choices or the latest consumer trends. Papanek clearly shows that real design should be about improving the way our world, and our society should work. This is a must read for any student of design, engineering or technology. In fact, it should be required reading in all engineering and design schools. Parakeet diapers and examining the way maple keys spread seeds...priceless."},{"Title":"Design for the Real World: Human Ecology and Social Change","review":"Way ahead of his time. Design for the Real World contains all of the messages about creativity, design thinking, sustainable design, appropriate technology that are being echoed all around the design community now...but he wrote this THIRTY YEARS AGO. And the amazing thing is that nearly every one of his comments is still just as applicable today. If only everyone had listened the first time.Much more interesting than the IDEO guides and other \\"creativity\\" authors such as Ken Robinson."},{"Title":"Design for the Real World: Human Ecology and Social Change","review":"This is an essential book for anyone, especially designers, who want to open their eyes to a new way of looking at product production, consumption and sustainable design"},{"Title":"Design for the Real World: Human Ecology and Social Change","review":"It has been many years since I read this important book. I hope this book will be made a compulsory read for all design students. If only more designers would adopt Mr Papanek's approach to socially-responsible design, the world will be a much better place to live in."},{"Title":"Design for the Real World: Human Ecology and Social Change","review":"I was introduced to this book in Architecture School and I now wish I had given it more attention. His designs were often simple and easy to make as I remember. We had a young professor who was really into what we would call sustainable today. He had us designing things with shipping containers and other unconventional materials. It's one of the classes I remember most. After 30 years in Architecture I've learned you have to demonstrate the ideas or else they don't go very far."},{"Title":"Design for the Real World: Human Ecology and Social Change","review":"Victor Papanek's book is not only readable, it might just change your life. This should be required reading for students of design everywhere as the ideas presented are as relevant today as they were 30 years ago. Papanek's writing style is accessible and his passion is contagious. Although some of the language is dated, it doesn't interfere with the basic message of the book: design is good and as such, it should be shared with as many people as possible."},{"Title":"Design for the Real World: Human Ecology and Social Change","review":"one of the best books on design ethics till date!"},{"Title":"Design for the Real World: Human Ecology and Social Change","review":"Papanek, like his mentor Fuller, took on a guru like status where rhetoric became more important than the reality. He bends facts and contradicts himself several places in this book.Here are a few that jumped out at meMisrepresentation of the facts -Page 89 - The Hyatt collapse wasn't bad design rather the builder changed the construction and inspectors weren't doing their job.281 - He talks about farm implement companies' negative reaction to his walking tractor proposal. Troy-Bilt Rototiller has around since 1937, was and is building a 10 HP tiller very similar to the one pictured.Contradicts himself -Page 6 he says, \\"Design must be meaningful. And meaningful replaces such semantically loaded expressions as ... \\"ugly\\"... \\"cute\\"...Page 93 - he describes gum as \\"tawdryPage 246 - He asserts that humidifiers are bad because they are \\"costly, ugly, and ... wasteful of water\\"Granted there are a lot of dangerous, overpriced, impractical, and generally unnecessary products on the market, but except for ranting about what he considers to be wrong, he doesn't offer much in terms of direction to others who want to be socially responsible."},{"Title":"Specifications for the Chemical and Process Industries: A Manual for Development and Use","review":"It's a good book. I just started a job running a chem lab. I have a lot of unique qualifications that persuaded this great company to hire me. However, I never ran a chem lab before and am looking for some good sources."},{"Title":"The Barbary Coast: An Informal History of the San Francisco Underworld","review":"\\"And Hell, yawning to receive the putrid mass, is there also\\".Such is the description of San Francisco's Barbary Coast cited from another publication by author Herbert Asbury.THE BARBARY COAST, first published in 1933, is a history of that vicious and squalid section in the heart of the City by the Bay devoted to all forms of crime, vice, lewd conduct and wickedness for the period 1849 to 1917. Asbury's fascinating narrative includes the dance halls, music saloons, dives, brothels, and gambling dens that infested the area, as well as the criminal gangs, hoodlums and cutthroats that preyed on the men lured there. The book's scope also encompasses the rising population of Chinese residents that coalesced into Chinatown, as well as the yellow slavery, tong wars and virulent anti-Chinese sentiments that evolved concurrently. And, since San Francisco is one of the world's greatest natural ports, the author describes the perils to both arriving and departing sailors, who were drawn to the Barbary Coast as insects to Venus Flytraps.The twin pillars of the Barbary Coast were robbery and prostitution. Despite the early successes of vigilantism in ridding the burgeoning metropolis of undesirables, the fact that both thrived for so long can be attributed to the toleration and blatant corruption of the city's law enforcement officials and governing politicos. Of the two, prostitution was the foundation of the area's iniquity since, as the author is careful to point out, the Barbary Coast didn't finally die until the California Legislature passed the Red-light Abatement Act of 1914. Therefore, it's no surprise that much of the volume is dedicated to the Oldest Profession: the cribs, cow-yards, parlor houses, pimps, madames, and debasing working conditions.THE BARBARY COAST comes near to being a book in the \\"couldn't put down\\" category. However, it sorely lacks the illustrations and period photographs that enhanced the Asbury's \\"prequel\\" volume, THE GANGS OF NEW YORK. Nevertheless, once read, you'll not see the modern streets of San Francisco in the same way again."},{"Title":"The Barbary Coast: An Informal History of the San Francisco Underworld","review":"San Francisco is an amazing city. Each time I visit I discover something new along its narrow alleys, panoramic vistas and historical landmarks. North Beach has always been my favorite SF neighborhood. It is amazing to me that such wickedness prevailed on these streets in the not so distant past. When I picked up the Barbary Coast, I was surprised that it was an older novel (first published in the 1930's). Don't let that persuade you from reading it. Asbury's frank and colorful descriptions of the old Barbary Coast will capture your imagination from the first page. Starting with the gold rush, Asbury describes the incredible influx of people onto the peninsula within a few short years and the lawlessness that followed. The stories of the prostitutes, gamblers, thieves, gangs, saloon keepers, brawlers, and corrupt politicians are all richly told in Asbury's colorful language that keeps the reader's attention all the way through. This book is a must for anyone interested in the history of the gold rush and San Francisco's past."},{"Title":"The Barbary Coast: An Informal History of the San Francisco Underworld","review":"I'd seen this book on the shelves at the library, but I had always passed over it because it was too non-linear for my research. Boy, was that a mistake. This is THE best book about San Francisco's Barbary Coast in existance. It came to my attention again because of 'Gangs of New York', and I went ahead and bought it this time. Read this book and find out how tame everyone from San Francisco is these days in comparison."},{"Title":"The Barbary Coast: An Informal History of the San Francisco Underworld","review":"The miners came in Forty-nine,The whores in fifty-one;And when they got togetherThey produced the native son.This irreverend verse in the early part of THE BARBARY COAST sets the tempo of what is to follow: Joaquin Murieta, the Vigilantes, the Tong Wars in Chinatown, Shanghaiing sailors, the red-light district. I read it forty years ago originally and still recommend it, as do I the same author's THE FRENCH QUARTER.This book is an informal history: as such it is sparse with the references, but it's a great read.San Franciscans should be proud of it."},{"Title":"The Barbary Coast: An Informal History of the San Francisco Underworld","review":"When one considers what went on in the San Francisco Bay Area during the Gold Rush and later - modern times can't compete! Absolutely wild and a great read!"},{"Title":"The Barbary Coast: An Informal History of the San Francisco Underworld","review":"Fabulous book about San Francisco from 1849-1900's! Well written easy to follow, and interesting and funny history of the Barbary Coast. I lived there for a good part of my life and can tell you it was fascinating to read how it began...I had no idea!"},{"Title":"The Barbary Coast: An Informal History of the San Francisco Underworld","review":"The history of the city of San Francisco has always intrigued me, and this book gave me insight and glimpses that I might never have been exposed to otherwise. Given the fact that this book was written in the early 1900s, Asbury was able to speak with and interview people that actually lived in SF in the late 1800s, and these first hand accounts are invaluable. Anyone interested in SF history should definitely pick up this book!"},{"Title":"The Barbary Coast: An Informal History of the San Francisco Underworld","review":"The book is one of the best I ever read. It's an absolute page turner - well written, great narrative, interesting (that's an understatement) real-life characters, thoroughly researched. I wonder why nobody yet - dared - to turn it into a movie. Perhaps it would be just too shocking."},{"Title":"The Barbary Coast: An Informal History of the San Francisco Underworld","review":"Maybe this book is out of copyright or something... but this printing is a grossly lazy reproduction of the original printing. It's actually a copy of the pages - not even fit right to the book's size. They didn't bother to transcribe and properly typeset the text using a modern system, so you're basically paying for a very rough, poorly scaled photocopy of the old printing. No wonder it's not available on Kindle."},{"Title":"The Barbary Coast: An Informal History of the San Francisco Underworld","review":"Terrific tales from a wild time in American history, when a pound of gold bought a pound of tacks, people sent their laundry to Hawaii on clipper ships, and a saloon full of men would pour into the street and stand silently just to watch a rare woman pass by. If you like the old west, the Gold Rush, or San Francisco, a colorful, must-read."},{"Title":"The Barbary Coast: An Informal History of the San Francisco Underworld","review":"Whisky and whores! Rollicking journalistic muck-raking, 30's style! Vigilantes, fire-rowdies, circus freaks, taxi-dancers, vice tourists and gold dust! I'm rarely too enthusiastic to think of anything critical to say, but this is a great story by a great writer, and will provide you with amusing anecdotes to share at cocktail parties for years to come."},{"Title":"The Barbary Coast: An Informal History of the San Francisco Underworld","review":"I first read this intense book about ten years ago when I was helping to research a San Francisco walking tour for a colleague. I've revisited the title several times doing further research, and just for the plain old pleasure of reliving the wild glory days of the old-west again.Like his tell-all histories of New York, New Orleans, and Chicago he goes for the rough-and-tumble sensational aspects of the past, and has a good old time of trying to separate the fact and the fiction. The style is a bit on the journalistic dry side of the era it was written, but the eccentric characters and situations more than make up for his style with pure drama.This was one of the books which proved influential in delving even deeper into the legend and lore of old San Francisco, which has resulted after six years of planning, in opening a Victorian Parlor performance venue right on Union Square where so much of the history took place. The San Francisco Magic Parlor has now opened with our very \\"Herbert Asbury\\" sytle show: Eccentrics of San Francisco's Barbary Coast ...a magical escapade!If you love to go deep into the roots of a city, and love the high and low trivia to be found in one of the most fascinating places in the world, you'll really enjoy all his titles, but this one for sure."},{"Title":"The Barbary Coast: An Informal History of the San Francisco Underworld","review":"This book was written in the 1930s. If you're a serious historian, I'd recommend finding some newer scholarship. Very sensationalized. You can down load it for nothing from Project Gutenberg."},{"Title":"Elric: Tales Of The White Wolf (Michael Moorcock's Elric)","review":"I have read every Elric novel. I own 500 kilos of fantasy paperbacks. This book brought me as much joy, inspiration and satisfaction as any book I have ever read. Elric was the first &quot;evil&quot; hero. Every fantasy writer has taken a peice of elric to produce their characters. Drizt Do'urden is a shadow of Elric. Raistlen is almost an exact copy of Elric. Darth vader's sinister life, dependence on technology/sorcery and eventual noble self sacrifice are in mimicry of Elric. In this book so many authors who wanted to write Elric stories, some who had made great fame and fortune copying Moorcock, were given licence to write as they pleased. Every short story in the book is its authors best work because as they write about their own dark heros in their own novels they are thinking about Elric. My highest praise: I want a sequel.. or two... or ten... a series published monthly untill I am old and grey."},{"Title":"Elric: Tales Of The White Wolf (Michael Moorcock's Elric)","review":"Elric, last Prince of Melnibone.

This pale,weak being could be any of us, and yet it\`s his weakness that gives him the strainth to weld such enormus power and to control the uncontrolable. Elric will make you cry, make you feel that you could defeat the Lords of Chaos your self and forever will you bare some of his burden. Your life will never be the same, the way you look at things such as the ocean will change and you\`ll catch yourself try to summon the water element himself. For such a being to exist in your mind alone is enough."},{"Title":"Elric: Tales Of The White Wolf (Michael Moorcock's Elric)","review":"I highly enjoyed this book, the dark and gothic theme created a great anti-hero in my opinion. It took a bit of time to get into the \\"setting\\" of the book, but once I did I was able to immerse myself in the story and thoroughly enjoy it."},{"Title":"Elric: Tales Of The White Wolf (Michael Moorcock's Elric)","review":"Elric of Melnibone' represents a departure from the era of Tarzan and Conan, giving people a dark prince for a protagonist.

A dark prince and king of pain, you will want to read the series again and again."},{"Title":"Elric: Tales Of The White Wolf (Michael Moorcock's Elric)","review":"Elric of Melnibone', Michael Moorcock's doomed antihero, is a seminal character in sword and sorcery fiction. The six original books in the Elric saga were replete with manipulative gods, cosmic jests, dire creatures, intricate spells, genetic alliances, mighty artifacts, and cataclysmic battles. The last inhuman emperor of the island nation of Melnibone', Elric must rely upon his unholy sword Stormbringer to feed his deficient albino veins with the souls of those he kills. He finds himself a pawn of both the blade and his god, Lord Arioch of Chaos, though he is in truth a Champion of the Cosmic Balance. The Gods of Chaos and the Lords of Law constantly war to tip the Balance in their favor and gain supremacy over the multiverse, and Elric inevitably finds himself in one adventure after another as his shifting loyalties and tragic luck toss him upon the seas of fate.The tone of the six books (and novels since) describe a decaying world of malevolent magic and calamitous destiny, and though hope is found in scant, brief flashes, it is invariably overshadowed by evil. In this new anthology, however, Moorcock has allowed 24 other writers to craft stories of Elric and his times, as well as stories that span the realms of Arthurian legend, 15th century Milan, Nazi Germany, and even our modern, contemporary present. Into these tales hope shines with greater intensity, humor, relief and release appear with refreshing peaks. But blackest treacheries are uncovered as well, sorrows which should never have been...The Elric novels had an incredible impact on art, music, comics and fantasy RPGs. Now even the symbols of the Gods of Chaos (created by Moorcock as \\"eight arrows radiating from a circle\\") has infiltrated the punk, crust and metal scenes as the \\"chaos\\" sign. The series is a mandatory read for any fantasy or adventure enthusiast, and this book is a fine addition to the mythos."},{"Title":"Elric: Tales Of The White Wolf (Michael Moorcock's Elric)","review":"I'm not one for anthologies, but this one was an exception. If you bought it just to read the first tale you would have spent your money well. Elric is one of the most fascinating characters out there. Add up all of Shakespeare's tragic characters and you get an idea of what Elric has in store for you. Fantasy readers can not claim to be such if they know not of the Prince of Melnibone."},{"Title":"Elric: Tales Of The White Wolf (Michael Moorcock's Elric)","review":"This is the first of the Elric saga Ive read. I found it most exhilirating. The dark antihero and his struggle for his humanity is almost sorrowful. His sword is legendary amonst who has lived to tell about it. Not many have though. Elric is an outcast among his people.It is one of the best books I have read in a long time."},{"Title":"The Burning Bush : Rudolf Steiner, Anthroposophy and the Holy Scriptures : Terms & Phrases","review":"The Burning Bush is essential reading for anyone interested in a deeper understanding of the Bible. This large volume is filled with amazing insights. It combines the author's own life-long search for the deeper meaning of the Bible with the discoveries of Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925), the founder of Anthroposophy (The Wisdom of Man). The book unveils what people have had to believe only through faith. In a series of penetrating essays the author explains such mysteries and seeming contradictions as the accounts of the Nativity, the nature of the second coming, and the meaning of the Burning Bush."},{"Title":"The Burning Bush : Rudolf Steiner, Anthroposophy and the Holy Scriptures : Terms & Phrases","review":"The Burning Bush is an extraordinary reference work by a skilled theologian and lawyer. He discovered the work of Austrian born Rudolph Steiner and all the &quot;seeming contradictions&quot; in the Bible were resolved for him. This book will become as famous as the dictionary by Webster or Oxford Press. If you ever wanted to read the Bible but found it strange, read this book and the Bible will be unveiled. I hold my breath for further volumes."},{"Title":"The Burning Bush : Rudolf Steiner, Anthroposophy and the Holy Scriptures : Terms & Phrases","review":"When I ran into this book almost five years ago, I had no idea what I was in store for. I opened it up, and saw chart and table after chart and table and they all had this kind of magic power. Based on the pictures alone, I bought the book, excited. And then...I read the book.There is a huge amount of information here, for anyone interested in Steiner or anyone who is not satisfied with what they have learned in regards to Christianity. Here, Smith takes Steiner's Biblical insights, and presents them with both sharpness and depth. For me, certain things that I was taught never added up. After reading this book, I discovered a richness and depth I never knew were present in the Bible, or the world.Five years later, I have read many works by Steiner (all of which are amazing) and, looking back, I must say how truly blessed I am to have had this book appear in my life. Another reviewer noted how this book will one day become a classic in Christianity, and I agree wholeheartedly.All in all, I was blown away at the penetrating lucidity for such complex topic....and then I read David's Question!"},{"Title":"The Burning Bush : Rudolf Steiner, Anthroposophy and the Holy Scriptures : Terms & Phrases","review":"This book is an impressive work by a passionate autodidact. It helpfully organizes many of Rudolf Steiner's insights into the Christian Bible. Since these are widely scattered through Steiner's writings and lectures, it is a great service to have them available in one place. Until the complete works of Steiner are translated into English and available digitally, Smith's commentaries will be a useful resource for any English-speaking reader interested in Steiner's interpretations of the Bible and of Christianity in general. And if Smith's work leads others to read more of Steiner, that seems a tremendous benefit, too.The difficulty with Smith's approach, from my perspective, is that it comes out of an incorrigibly literalistic, fundamentalist approach to scripture and to texts in general. His chapter-and-verse approach to the Bible, using Steiner to finally unveil the line-by-line mysteries of God's inspired word, seems to me discordant and even antithetical to Steiner's own approach. Steiner delivered his insights in the course of lectures and writings meant to transform the members of his audience. He would have been profoundly adverse to assembling discrete bits of data into a nearly cybernetic system to output the hidden meanings of the Bible.I grant that there is a place for Smith's type of systematizing work, but I wish it were more deeply informed by Steiner's own broad-ranging curiousity and profound imaginative insight. Smith's doggedly literalistic approach leaves out so much of Steiner's vitality that his commentary seems to me nearly unrecognizable as anthroposophy, despite its sub-title.I see Smith's commentaries as the personal monument of a indefatigable, self-trained scholar. Smith has done his work in virtual isolation from broader currents of cultural discourse about biblical texts and less broad but still vital interpretations of Rudolf Steiner. I wish Smith had spent less time compiling notecards from every translated Steiner work he could find and more time in intellectual conversation with, for example, recent work on the Dead Sea Scrolls and other early Christian texts. Smith's obsessiveness as a writer extends so far as to citing definitions from English-language dictionaries, as though he refuses to assume a mutual cultural literacy with his readers, much less a shared imaginative or spiritual faculty.I've ended up sounding too harsh. Smith's work is valuable, if often maddening. Perhaps it will inspire someone with broader reading and deeper theological insight to present and interpret Steiner's radical approach to the Bible and Christian religion."},{"Title":"A PERFECT WORLD: (A Perry Richards Novel)","review":"&quot;A Perfect World&quot; is a well-crafted mystery. John D. MacDonald or Dashiel Hammitt could have written it. It's a pleasant read with insights about human nature, and personal and poltical ambitions gone awry.The protagonist is Perry Richards, a handsome, black, public interest attorney. Yet, the dramatic fuel driving this ambitious novel is the ambiguous, angelic force of nature to whom he is married, Felicia Pridemore Richards. She is a well-respected psycho-therapist at a private clinic. Spiritually connected and devoted, they are deeply in love. Life is smooth, but a storm brews. Hell is about to break loose.Perry is about to be promoted into the firm's directorship when Felicia disappears.

The main character, Perry Richards, has a beautiful, loving wife, Felicia; two beautiful children; a house in the surburbs of Los Angeles and the type of job that offers personal fulfillment. Everything in his world is perfect. Or is it? That's the ironic meaning of the title of the book. One of the beauties of this novel is that Perry and Felicia are African American. However, to enjoy the story, their race is not important. The author makes it clear that it's the couple's achievements and life stations that are defining. It is a case of WHO they are: two educated, aticulate and successful Americans enjoying the American dream.Within the confines of this sprawling novel, Bernard Alexander McNealy has written a multi-faceted story about people from all walks of life and different ethnicities whoses lives are entertwined by a family secret.\\"A Perfect World\\" is a mystery, a sexual romp, descriptive mood piece, a layered politcal drama, and an homage to mystery writers of past such as Raymond Chandler.

As a whole, the book is a stirring celebration of the outdoors.The book contains an interesting preface in which Reynolds discusses his approach to photography. The authors whose quotes accompany his photos include Henry David Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Marcus Aurelius, William Blake, Walt Whitman, Kahlil Gibran, and others.In his photography, Reynolds has captured some great natural treasures: Capitol Peak in Palo Duro Canyon State Park, the Brazoria National Wildlife Refuge, Daingerfield State Park, and more. His photos are truly beautiful, and generally feature stunning interplay of light and color. Some of the most memorable images in the book include the surreal glow of light in cottonwood trees along Limpia Creek, a bronze-and-gold hued sunrise at South Padre Island, waters rushing over the rocks at McKinney Falls State Park, and much more.

The sheer magnitude of the research collected, sorted, and weighed here is enough to recommend, but this work offers much more than a survey of leading interpretations. Many a major commentary, ancient and modern, receives a fair hearing for each argument analyzed both in the text and in extensive notes. One only wishes Guthrie were eternal that he might have been able to include all that has and will come in the way of analysis since publication of these texts in the 1960's with the same judicious acumen.On immersing oneself in these many pages, over and again, one is struck by the centrality and the exhaustive nature of the venture. While such a scope of endeavor is bound to be open to controversy on any number of particulars, and Guthrie is not without critics, the distance traversed is staggering, and the work, in its point-by-point detailed coverage, assumes an authority on the achievement of such breadth alone. But it is the analytic depth of Guthrie's treatment of the arguments that for me holds the greater value. For the many treasures on display in these pages shine ever more brightly due to the loving care with which they are presented in view of their developmental contexts.Among the finer features of Guthrie is the headliner on each page, providing focus for the narrative, in the style of the annotated Jowett Plato. Organization of the chapters under topical rubrics contributes to the superior organization of the work itself and, along with the extensive Indexes, makes reference within this dense field blessedly user-friendly.If you love Archaic (Pre-Socratic) Greek Philosophy like I do, I feel that there is no better practice than to regularly inter yourself in the first two volumes of Guthrie. I've been asked which is the best investment for a book on early Greek Philosophy. The best-known one-volume histories all have their virtues. Of these, Barnes is probably most useful, very good on the Eleatics and Xenophanes, not so comprehending of Herakleitos, the Milesians, and others. The writing tends to be nuanced in a very Anglo-analytic, somewhat technical, orientation. Kirk and Raven don't thrill me much either as writers or analysts, and make what a number of commentators feel are erroneous judgments. Not nearly as thorough as Guthrie, their book on balance is - sufficient. The old Burnet is quite good at times, but now has been antiquated on many points by later, more accurate readings (discussed in Guthrie). Nietzsche's study, translated as \\"Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks\\" is definitely worth a read (what did Nietzsche ever write that wasn't?), but was not intended as comprehensive scholarship.

Reviewed by TundraVision"},{"Title":"Sacrificed Lives","review":"Overview:This book was surprisingly well-written for a first novel. While nothing in it is utterly original (but little really is, so that is hardly a fault, but more a reality), it combines multiple elements, such as the themes and emotions that it prompts into a compelling tale that is quite difficult to put down. The plot is simple, the characters develop only to a small extent and almost all of them are racist, but the story does have many interesting and amusing aspects. Unlike most books that I have ever read, the humor only grows toward the climax. Hopefully, the author will write another book someday. I would love to read one.A. PlotThis story is centered in South Carolina, and focuses on a single question: What happened to Yvonne in 1966. The plot is well-developed, passing through a series of points that, while not exactly predictable, aren't revelatory either. The conflicts in the novel are realistic and compelling. The obvious racist tendencies by several of the characters highlights a recent trend to point out unresolved race issues in the United STates, perhaps in part due to President Obama's election. As such, it is a timely commentary, despite the fact that it was published seven years ago, and took place five years before that.The resolution of the climax is somewhat vague, which is disappointing, but understandable for a novice author. It is a bit difficult to know how to bring off a resolution to a conflict that has been built to in this fashion. As such, I don't really penalize her on it.B. CharactersMy biggest issue with the characters in the story is that the racists are uniformly poorly informed, bigoted, and stupid, with one exception. While there is certainly a striking correlation between ignorance and racism, not all racists are morons. In addition, the one exception that I mention is a man who is extremely racist, to the point of race blindness (he comments, amusingly, at one point in the story, \\"If it's white and it moves, I'm gonna shoot it.\\"), is actually a black man mistrustful and hateful of whites. As such, the morality espoused, trite as it was (\\"Racism is bad, and racists are stupid.\\") ended up being hypocritical. This character, named Punch, who actually TRAINS his dogs to hate WHITE people, is eminently more educated and coherent and logical than his white counterparts. He still isn't a college professor, though.In fact, none of the white characters in the story are good people. Nor are any of them particularly intelligent. A slight animal cunning can be attributed to them, but no higher order intelligence. Which is a pity, because it reinforces the stereotypes that people in the South are not particularly smart. The black characters, on the other hand, are typically civil, good, upstanding, and intelligent.C. SettingThe book is set in the South, which is completely appropriate, given the nature of the interpersonal conflicts outlined in the story. It could easily have taken place elsewhere, but it would have seemed a bit stilted and unlikely elsewhere. Other than the South, there were no settings in the story of particular importance, with the exception of a single, poorly detailed home in the mountains.D. ThemeThe overarching themes of the novel are fear, repression, and antagonism toward racial equality. These themes combine with the aesthetic effect to create an environment of claustrophobia, fear, and mistrust. The desire to see these things resolved and for the feeling of goodness to come back, probably was part of the reason that I read the entire book in a single sitting.E. Point of ViewThe point of view used, third person omniscient, was appropriate given the story, but it was hardly inventive. That said, the point of view didn't wildly and unpredictably shift on a regular basis, and, as I said, it is appropriate for the story.F. AestheticsWhile there was little original in the story, the tale was handled very, very well. I am not quite sure what it was about the writing that was so entertaining, but I can certainly say that it was very entertaining, particularly as the climax built and the writing got more amusing and more entertaining.Conclusion:While the book was not incredibly original, it was well-written, and had an intangible factor that made it quite compelling. This was actually the first book that I had read in a single sitting in some time, and it was not really something that I felt that I could avoid. It had that certain flair that made it eminently readable, eminently enjoyable, and great fun to read. If it had a bit more novelty, I could easily have given this book a fifth star.B-Harkius"},{"Title":"Sacrificed Lives","review":"This was overall a great read!

The plot twists were unexpected; everytime I thought I knew what would happen next I found myself sent in another direction. The only disappointments were Brittany and Yvette: Brittany is way too young to be that articulate, and even though she was afraid of Jack she probably would not have been old enough to know to try to hide in the fireplace. It also would have been nice to see what happens to Yvette once her meds were weaned. Overall I loved the book and would definitely read more from this author."},{"Title":"Sacrificed Lives","review":"I stayed up all night to finish this book, read it during the day when other things tried to distract me, and actually turned off my computer and phone so I wouldn't be interrupted. The author has a fine understanding of the attributes mentioned in how-to-write-a-best-seller books -- short chapters, tight writing, almost reportorial, characters with a \\"tag\\" to help the reader remember which is which, a fast pace, no moral ambiguity, no sagging middle, a tonic note at the end, and the \\"right\\" length. A very accomplished first novel. I love the passion for social justice that underlies the story, the air of grief over wrongs that can't be righted, only avenged, and the courage of so many of the characters on the suffering side of the cast of characters.I feel, however, that the ending was more of a stop than an end. There were too many threads left unresolved. I was frustrated at the end.I thought about Strom Thurmond as I read. I thought about To Kill a Mockingbird.I was left with a lot of questions -- where did Jack come from and why was he available to get involved? why did the judge/Grand Dragon want to screw over the father of the 14 year old boy? What use did he make of the power he accrued by triggering those events? What happened to Meemaw and her granddaughter after the book ends? Why wasn't tellng me these things part of the author's story?Almost all of the secondary characters upon whose competence or carelessness the action depended are evil clowns. I think it is their failures that other reviewers are referring to when they talk about the comic elements of the novel, but I'm not entirely sure.Two things that bothered me -- Brittany, as she is portrayed, is too old to be teething. And ergot meds were available by the late 1990s for migraines.Good book. I'll look forward to her next."},{"Title":"Sacrificed Lives","review":"I will NEVER forget this book!!!! WOW just WOW!!!

She makes general claims like all psychics (including Daniel Dunglas Home) was fraudulent and she fails to provide any evidence for this claim while in the same paragraph dismissing experiments that lend evidence to his credibility.Home, which she fails to mention, was investigated by many scientist and other investigators not just William Crookes who she does mention and despite extensive investigation (again by many investigators) was never in his lifetime found to be cheating.This does not dismiss the possibility of him simply being the best magician in the history of mankind, just that in science all claims require evidence of which she presents exactly zero to support her charge.This is a bias account written by a woman who uses straw man arguments (pick the weakest case as the champion example and attack it), incomplete information, and a one sided interpretation.For example she cites Ray Hyman's attack on the Targ & Puthoff findings of Uri Geller. Anyone that has bothered to even scan the surface of this will know that the only person that tested Uri Geller under sloppy conditions was Ray Hyman himself. Targ & Puthoff found Geller performed well at remote viewing (under tightly controlled conditions) and never even tested him for metal bending (again that was Hyman during his visit to SRI where Geller was being tested).This former english teacher does mention some of the better known early figures like Nostradamus, J.B. Rhine, Daniel Home, etc. beyond getting the names of some of the major figures in history and psi research correctly spelled everything else is poorly researched and inappropriately (biased) presented without any evidence to support the authors conclusions.D-"},{"Title":"Copyrights and Copywrongs: The Rise of Intellectual Property and How It Threatens Creativity (Fast Track Books)","review":"... and we never ended up using it.You guys should really include a &#34;can't review&#34; box.The three stars in this case are only to indicate it is neither bad nor good."},{"Title":"Copyrights and Copywrongs: The Rise of Intellectual Property and How It Threatens Creativity (Fast Track Books)","review":"A great presentation on why we should go to copyleft or the creative commons."},{"Title":"Copyrights and Copywrongs: The Rise of Intellectual Property and How It Threatens Creativity (Fast Track Books)","review":"This semester my son and I were determined to purchase as many textbooks through Internet vendors to try and save some money.

From other research on the web on this issue, I keep seeing over and over that without copyright protection, people wouldn't have incentive to create. What a load of muck. Creative people NEED to create. They also need to not starve to death, of course. But creating things in and of itself is rewarding. If money is what motivates someone, they should become stockbrokers or something that more honestly reflects their values. I think that motivation by money, and creativity are almost mutually exclusive; once money becomes the motive, creativity is dead, or at least mortally wounded. I know the thrill of creating. I do art without any compensation at all, because I need to and want to, and have been a computer programmer for years, marvelling that someone was willing to pay me for something that is so much FUN!

Either there is intellectual property or there is not. If there is not, then it is a government granted monopoly, and government granted monopolies can be shown to be less efficient then the market. As such, this means that copyrights would not do a better job at encouraging ingenuity.

The author clearly leans toward the notion that copyright law is too restricting and tries to make that point strongly in all the evidence he sites. The evidence itself is not very compelling because it is presented is a very light manner, with very few quotes from actual court decisions. The author instead relies on trying to convince us by presenting his viewpoint of copyright law and his own commentary. instead of a complete account you get a one-sided presentation.

The public's rights to fair use of material for research, teaching, criticism, etc. are being infringed upon or ignored, and Vaidhyanathan does a fine job of explaining where those rights came from, how they have changed over the past hundred years or so, and the reasons why they are now in danger. Many current ideas about intellectual property do indeed threaten creativity. I enjoyed particularly the section on sampling in rap music, as well as the author's discussion of current efforts by large companies and organizations to exact payment for viewing any and all \\"content\\" (including scientific information, news, and other data that should not fall under copyright). Vaidhyanathan's discussion of the history of copyright law before the twentieth century was not as good as the rest of his analysis; I thought that the English precidents in the eighteenth century and earlier could have been explained a little more fully.

And, even more incredibly, it was written by a non-attorney (Siva is a professor at the U. of Wisconsin, School of Information Studies). \\"Copyrights and Copywrongs\\" covers the history and bastardization of American copyright law. Siva attempts to make relatively simple suggestions for fixing our complex, arcane system of protecting intellectual property rights.Siva begins his \\"story\\" recounting in incredibly understandable terms, the history of the copyright ranging from the framing of the U.S. Constitution, the rights afforded musicians (recently challenged by the likes of ...) and of course, literary and digital works. Siva does not concentrate on the theoretical nature of this quagmire rather, he examines the issues as it relates to current issues and events making the content interesting and readable. He argues, very persuasively, that the current copyright laws in their punitive and restrictive form y hinder creativity and free expression. Further, he compellingly argues that the original intent of the laws were designed for flexible application to maintain cultural balance.The issues framed in this book encompass the very future of creativity vital to industry, commerce, and free expression. A very enjoyable read even given the somewhat difficult nature of the subject matter."},{"Title":"Copyrights and Copywrongs: The Rise of Intellectual Property and How It Threatens Creativity (Fast Track Books)","review":"This timely and wide-ranging book is useful on at least two levels. First, it rehearses some of the major steps and missteps that have brought us to where we are in the realm of copyright and intellectual property. Second, the book demonstrates explicitly some of the perils of the current legal framework.Vaidhyanathan sets out his own objectives thus:\\"This book has three goals. The first is to trace the development of American copyright law though the twentieth century. . . . The second goal is to succinctly and clearly outline the principles of copyright while describing the alarming erosion of the notion that copyright should protect specific expressions but not the ideas that lie beneath the expressions. The third and most important purpose of this book is to argue that American culture and politics would function better under a system that guarantees \`thin' copyright protection -- just enough protection to encourage creativity, yet limited so that emerging artists, scholars, writers, and students can enjoy a right public domain and broad \`fair use' of copyrighted material.\\"I believe that he succeeds on these terms. Even better, the book is very well written as prose, which we'd expect from a creative academic with long experience in print journalism. (The book is also full of fascinating tidbits. Did you know that Samuel Clemens would spend a weekend in Canada to register each of his books there? He did it to fortify his copyright protection throughout the Commonwealth.)The chapters proceed more or less chronologically as Vaidhyanathan moves from early conceptions of copyright; through the careers of Mark Twain and D. W. Griffith as key users and developers of evolving notions of copyright; through the development of the modern recording industry, and its tangles with rap music in the past 25 years; and on into what I might call the copyright-command-and-control battles of the Internet era.Along the way, he shows how we moved away from an older ideal of \\"thin\\" copyrights towards the modern regime of \\"thick\\" ones. In particular, he's strong in making the case that copyrights used to be -- and should be still -- the legal codification of a sort of utilitarian policy bargain. Vaidhyanathan drives home this interpretation time and again:\\"Significantly, the founders, whether enamored of the virtuous potential of copyright as Washington was, enchanted by the machinery of incentive as Madison was, or alarmed by the threat of concentrated power as Jefferson was, did not argue for copyrights or patents as \`property.' Copyright was a matter of policy, of a bargain among the state, its authors, and its citizens.\\" (page 23)\\"The law [the first American copyright statute, enacted in Connecticut in 1783] also required that the author \`furnish the Public with sufficient Editions,' such that an author could not benefit from the protection of the law while restricting access to his work. Such a balance, a tradeoff, between public good and private reward served as the germinal idea of American copyright . . .\\" (page 44)\\"Property rights in America are traditionally a matter of convention and agreement, and not, as the judge in [a case he's just been discussing] asserted, a matter of divine decree or \`natural' law.\\" (page 59)Throughout the book, Vaidhyanathan is an ardent proponent of a system of \\"thin\\" copyrights. He argues such a regime would be more reflective of U.S. legal history (as demonstrated in the quotation above about the Founders); allow a better balance between private commercial interests and broader societal interests; and promotes both protection for the established artist -- for a limited time -- and then the availability of our common cultural heritage to emerging artists.(In making this last argument, he covers some fascinating ground, particularly in contrasting the typically linear nature of European [and European-American] creativity and the typically circular nature of African [and Caribbean, and African-American] creativity. While his absorbing discussions of the creativity embodied in Delta Blues, reggae, and rap music effectively demonstrate the latter point, I would have liked him to give more credit to the great classical-music tradition of one composer offering arrangements of or variations upon the work of another.)Standing against this ideal of thin copyrights is the current corporation-dominated regime of thick copyrights and \\"intellectual property\\". While Vaidhyanathan sometimes shades toward stridency in his dicsussion of this, he's quite apt is assessing its major ills. The system has progressively done away with the \\"bargain\\" discussed above, in favor of making ideas, and not merely their expressions, the \\"property\\" of owners, and especially of owners who have the lawyerly firepower to back up their claims. Such a regime tends to ignore or suppress the broader societal interests served by balanced principles of fair use, in favor of private commercial interests. And in general, the system promotes the haves while it ignores, chills, or actively bars the have-nots.The new property-talk regime of thick copyrights is a relatively recent innovation -- it really picked up steam in the 1970s -- that has been immensely ramified by the growth of computer technology and networked sytems. Copyright holders -- especially large commercial interests -- now have the technology to enforce copyrights much more rigorously. And, as Vaidhyanathan rightly points out, wrongheaded and antidemocratic legislation like the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) puts too much of the police power behind such enforcement into the hands of the copyright holders themselves.Fundamentally, Vaidhyanathan's got it right: ordinary citizens, newcomers, little people, and outsiders are getting the shaft at the expense of major corporations, the media Establishment, big wheels, and insiders. DMCA deserves to be opposed by clear-thinking citizens everywhere, and at some point we have to abandon the ridiculous prospect of extending copyrights ad infinitum. Though this book explicitly addresses the situation in the United States, folks beyond its borders should likewise heed its call to support better, freer, and fairer interpretations of copyright."},{"Title":"Copyrights and Copywrongs: The Rise of Intellectual Property and How It Threatens Creativity (Fast Track Books)","review":"If you live or work or play in cyberspace, you need to read this book.

In about 200 pages Professor Vaidhyananathan presents a very readable history of the copyright in the US and abroad.Originally added to the Constitution to encourage creativity and to improve the democratic process, the copyright has evolved into a series of complex rules that seem to work almost in the opposite direction of the original intent.Have you ever wondered how Mark Twain and Groucho Marx figured into the discussion of copyright issues? If so you can find out in this book - they both had very interesting roles. What about the diversity of legal opinions - from Lawrence Lessig, to the Ninth Circuit, to Mr. Justice Hand - all of who grappled with the rights of the few versus the rights of the many.Added to the history is an intelligent and readable discussion of the policy issues related to the copyright. What kinds of policies will balance the creator's incentives and at the same time improve the level of public discussions? How long should rights survive? What elements should be included in the copyright? What are the reasonable standards for parody? Should there be differing standards for databases, books, movies, music and computer programs? The risk for all of those questions is that they can evolve into hopeless discussions of legal absurdities. In effect, that is what happened with the Digital Millenium Copyright Act.But Vaidhyananathan does not let himself get stuck in all that goo - he deals with each of those issues and more in a concise and interesting fashion. At the same time he has the larger picture of the broader purposes of copyright.You will be challenged and fascinated by this book and the issues it raises."},{"Title":"Copyrights and Copywrongs: The Rise of Intellectual Property and How It Threatens Creativity (Fast Track Books)","review":"I am writing this primarily to defend the style used by Dr. Vaidhyanathan in this book. The person who commented anonymously (as \\"a reader\\") suggested it was written at a second grade reading level. That was not a mistake.I recently found an interview Dr. Vaidhyanathan gave to a magazine concerning this book, and he said that, \\"I went looking for a clearly written book for laypeople to read [about copyright], and I found that there wasn't one. I thought I should probably write one.\\"Copyright law is at best difficult to \\"translate\\", and and this book is an excellent beginner resource. \\"A Reader\\" complains that Dr. Vaidhyanathan is biased toward less restrictive copyright laws, but I can only imagine that \\"A Reader\\" is in fact a representative of a large corporation which holds very many copyrights it wishes to protect. I don't think that the average American who wishes to copy his/her CDs onto his/her iPod without being subject to prosecution would wish for more restrictive copyright laws.Dr. Vaidhyanathan holds copyrights, but does not fight for very restrictive measures regarding his works. Think about what that means about his \\"bias.\\"As far as finding works which quote court decisions about copyright issues, and are written at a very highbrow level, just look for James Boyle's works.

It seemed like a perfect blend of what Noel Carroll calls in his &quot;A Philosophy of Mass Art,&quot; mass art and avant-garde art - it is written in a style that the mass can understand (which defines mass art) yet challenges convential thinking and equips the reader with enough background knowledge early off to understand the rest of the book (avant-garde art usually doesn't even bother to give background knowledge as it is geared towards a certain field, not the masses).Siva Vaidhyanathan did a masterful research in law and the history of law as he uncovers a bright story concerning intellectual property even from the time of the founding fathers of this nation.

Vaidhyanathan outlines the deceptively complicated realm of copyright law from its origins in medieval Europe to current issues with peer-to-peer networks and intellectual property. Through his sometimes creative use of legal precedents and historical trends, Vaidhyanathan reaches a few outstanding insights here, such as debunking the incorrect impression that the term \\"copyright\\" implies a right when it is actually a privilege; while modern crazes like hip-hop sampling and MP3 file sharing are not direct violations of copyright law but instead offer harsh illuminations of the gaps and inconsistencies in that law. Most importantly, the highly varied nuances and applications of copyright law in the past have been ruinously combined in recent years into the poorly defined, but disastrously applied, concept of intellectual property. Thus we have the modern corporatist view of everything as \\"property\\" that can be owned, bought, and sold, including ideas and expression.Vaidhyanathan provides plenty of believable evidence that this troublesome doctrine, while often disingenuously trotted out to supposedly protect original creators, does little more than enrich corporations while also chilling free speech and restricting creativity. The problem with this book is Vaidhyanathan's poorly constructed writing style, with distracting jumps in subject matter and unnecessary academic theoretical investigations into phenomena of doubtful value to the reader. An example is the chapter-long dissertation on Mark Twain's certainly voluminous but questionably influential (or relevant) thoughts on copyright law. Meanwhile, Vaidhyanathan's goal of finding the best answers to these problems is trickled out in passing throughout the book, rather than appearing authoritatively in the book's very rushed conclusion. But otherwise, if you can handle some reader-unfriendly passages, this is an acceptable look at the complex world of copyright law and how it is currently moving in all the wrong directions.

What Franklin has done brilliantly is shown, by the way he has collected the stories, how much they share a developing science fiction sensibility. Franklin also offers introductions to the stories and authors that are well written and intelligent, but here is also the source of my only complaint: I wish the introductions were slightly shorter, leaving room to include a few more stories. Still, this is an excellent anthology, one that will interest both converted science fiction fans and those who restrict themselves to reading that counts as &quot;virtuous.&quot;"},{"Title":"Future Perfect - American Science Fiction of the Nineteenth Century","review":"I found this at a used-book store, and was excited at the notion of reading short-story 19th century visions-- of the fantastic and of the future. The author gives a very interesting commentary/criticism which I feel adds much value to this book, not only as an anthology, but as a critical study (given this book was published so long ago, the criticism itself is an interesting look back. However, I do feel it was odd that attention was given either to a specific author (there was a very long Hawthorne section, for example) or to a sub-genre (e.g., automata)--making the topic of commentary seem at times a bit arbitrary.Overall, I enjoyed this book immensely--it was extremely engaging and entertaining (and the format made it a perfect read on my commute). I thank the author for introducing me to science-fiction by authors I wasn't aware of (or by those who I had not previously considered sci-fi authors--e.g., Melville). The sophistication and logic (and surprisingly accurate projections in many cases) have made for some interesting dinner-table discussion with my husband (who is now reading it). I'm giving this book 5 stars, as I believe it to be a must-read for those interested in the history of the future."},{"Title":"Live Rich","review":"Clear, simple, easy-to-read style.

The book merely raises your awareness of the steps so you're more likely to use them"},{"Title":"A History of Rockingham County Virginia","review":"The condition of the book was new as described (it is a copy of an older edition, and delivery was timely."},{"Title":"The Habit: A History of the Clothing of Catholic Nuns","review":"If you are interested in the historical clothing and traditions of Catholic religious women, this book is certainly worth having, and the author does a better job of getting things right than some reviewers are willing to admit. (One reviewer chides that the woman on the cover is not a nun but a 'sister', but if she had read the forward, she'd know that the author DID discuss the distinctions while explaining that she would, for the purposes of narrative, use the terms 'nun' and 'sister' interchangably...which is perfectly alright to do, btw.)I have two issues with the book which kept me from really enjoying it. The first is that while she discusses those modern and rapidly growing religious orders (such as the Sisters of Life, the Sisters of Mary, Mother of the Eucharist, the Kentucky Dominicans, the cloistered sisters at the Abbey of Regina Laudis, etc) which have retained or re-introduced a more traditional habit to their order, she does not enhance her narrative with visuals. One would appreciate seeing what these new young nuns LOOK like, as doubtless, they're not still in multi-pleated architectural headpieces and heavy woolen skirts. A few images would have made the whole exercise feel more 'up to date'. And it would be good to see a few modern religious in their more casual wear, too.The second quibble I have is that the author - good and devoted as she is - makes some statements that are much too broad and sweeping to be excused, as in \\"all mail was censored, and the nuns would even have to ask permission to use a piece of thread\\".Well, no. While some orders did censor mail - most of them did not, and it would be very interesting to find out which orders did and didn't. I would be willing to bet that those orders that did censor mail have also died out, while orders like Benedictines and Dominicans, which did not censor, did not listen in at private conversations and did not treat their members like idiot children, are still existant and flourishing. And while some very over-controlling or pinch-penny order might have quibbled about a length of thread, most nuns had their own sewing boxes and those personal items such as they needed in order to live life with some dignity! As to the REASON why a sisters and nuns so frequently needed to ask permission to do those things which we modern/civilian women would not think twice of, the system was not so iniquitious as it seems. This communication was what would keep supervisors apprised of the state of the community, of its holdings, its supplies, its mindset, etc. In a community of busy women, each with her own responsibilities, only in such a way could a supervisor such as an abbess, prioress or reverend mother keep good track of her 'flock', still interact with them on a daily and 'usual' basis, and still have a good sense of where they were at and what they each needed. It is, in fact, wiser than it first seems.These are minor quibbles, as I said, but they detracted from my enjoyment of the book. I am hopeful that the author will write a SECOND book of nuns, a compilation of those orders (like those mentioned above and so many more) who are growing rather than dying, who are celebrating their conspicuous consecration rather than shrinking from it and who seem to be vibrant and happy women. The world needs to hear about them, I think."},{"Title":"The Habit: A History of the Clothing of Catholic Nuns","review":"+JXPMs. Kuhns--a convert--wrote this book as an act of love for the Church and our women religious. Her work answers questions that have long lingered in the minds of Catholics and non-Catholics alike: Where did the nun's habit come from? Why did the nuns throw their habits away? Both questions are respectfully answered. I was very happy to see a clothing list included, also.Ms. Kuhns is not a mystic trying to explain the heavenly side of the habit. I cannot understand what else the other reviewers were wanting. However, if she had included more mystical information, and photos with details of the habits, culled from fresh research, then I imagine I would have given the book a five star review. However, out of charity and encouragement, I give her three stars. The book definitely fills a gap, and the information needed in today's world.In this age of air conditioning, why should long habits be discarded? Even some austere Capuchin nuns in the American southwest have air conditioning in their dorm and chapel. I can understand lighter fabrics for the missions, but in this world of hard-molded plastic, some of the starched items could have been replaced with something requiring less maintenance. Many communities have summer and winter habits.As everyone is beginning to learn, religious orders who have retained a modest habit, are faithful to the Holy Father, have community prayer, and areas of cloister in their convents are blessed with the lion's share of the vocations. Traditionalist orders are bursting at the seams. Unfortunately, our &quot;undercover sisters&quot; do not want to wake up and smell the incense. They continue on their path of modern day fashions, which in our opinion, are not modest enough.&quot;The Habit&quot;--well worth the price in hardback--is a wonderful addition to the bookshelf, sitting alongside Elenor Tong Dehey's monumental &quot;Religious Orders of Women in the United States,&quot; and Fr. McCarthy's synoptic &quot;Guide to the Catholic Sisterhoods in the United States,&quot; both of which have been reprinted.Gemma, Lay Passionist"},{"Title":"The Habit: A History of the Clothing of Catholic Nuns","review":"Sad to say, the definitive history of the clothing of religious women has yet to be published in the English language. Kuhns' book purports to tell the history of the nuns' habit - why they wore those odd uncomfortable looking clothes, and what those component parts meant. She has cobbled together a synopsis of costume history from the middle ages onward - which information is available elsewhere in more enlightening format. Unfortunately for the reader, Kuhns' prose is dry as toast, totally lacking in interesting anecdotes, and poorly edited. There are a number of typographical errors throughout the book (couldn't she afford an editor?), and in one case, one of the photos in the appendix is miscaptioned with the name of the wrong religious order. For those of us who have a strong interest in the material, you will not find anything new or compelling presented here. The book is &quot;padded&quot; with several chapters on the history of religious women's foundations, which material is best presented in Joann Kay McNamara's book &quot;Sisters in Arms.&quot; The informed reader may safely skip this section entirely. The book is illustrated with some vintage photographs, many of them courtesy of Fr. Eugene McCarthy, whose own series of books, &quot;Guide to the Catholic Sisterhoods in the United States,&quot; published between 1952 and 1964, are considered the &quot;fashion bibles&quot; of pre-Vatican II nuns' habits. (These photos were originally commissioned by Gonzaga University beginning in the 1940s and later appropriated by said Fr. McCarthy - apparently, the clergy have no compunction about not assigning credit when due.) Serious scholars should pass this work by completely, and opt instead for the hefty, expensive Italian-language tome &quot;La Sostanza dell' Effimero&quot;, published by the Daughters of St. Paul in Rome but obtainable through their bookstores throughout the United States on special order."},{"Title":"The Habit: A History of the Clothing of Catholic Nuns","review":"After a long wait for this book and seeing the price shoot up to over $50 on eBay for advanced copies. I was not impressed when I finally purchased my copy. Its a very nice book for those who are just learning about the history of the Sisters. For someone who has other books on the nuns and are searching for something new and fresh they wont find it in this book, many of the pictures can be found in other books about nuns that I already have. I was sorry there were not more detailed pictures of the pendents and crosses the nuns wore that identified the order they belonged to, and the lack of attention to detail. I was eager to learn about details the clothing and customs, and did not find in this book. It would of been nice to have the Sisters who wore the habit share personal stories about the garb while they are still around to do so."},{"Title":"The Habit: A History of the Clothing of Catholic Nuns","review":"Although the subject matter was interesting, the lack of pictures and overall layout of the book made it tedious to read. I saw so many opportunities for this book to be better. For example, there were many instances where an accompanying picture would have clarified a description or put it into a better context. A specific example of this is where she mentions a nail belt. It would have been illuminating to see a picture of one on that page. The writing style to me seemed dry, almost \\"textbook\\"."},{"Title":"The Habit: A History of the Clothing of Catholic Nuns","review":"Religious communities in America (i.e., Catholic Religious communities) have struggled to find their identity for the last 2 decades; but of course, imitating modern culture in so many other ways, to arrive at such a point of confusion, they first threw out anything old, including wearing religious garb. I only wish that the religious sisters of today (the new, \\"improved\\" nuns) who threw out their habits would read this book. No, the habit itself does not make a sister a sister. No more than black clothes and a white collar make a priest a good priest. But when there's nearly 2,000 years of tradition involved... just maybe they should have \\"looked before they leaped.\\" I thought this was a good book. Well-researched, easy to read, full of interesting points, and a good argument for nuns to put their habits back on (though the author doesn't go out of her way to make this point or beat anybody over the head with it). Regardless of what side of the debate people are on, I think the average Catholic should find this a fascinating, good book."},{"Title":"The Habit: A History of the Clothing of Catholic Nuns","review":"\\"A Reader\\" complains that the cover depicts a \\"sister\\" rather than a nun on the cover, adding: \\"What a blunder!\\" Clearly \\"Reader\\" him- or herself needs to read a little harder. The book's introduction says: \\"I use the terms 'nun,' 'sister,' 'consecrated woman' and 'religious' interchangeably, although there are differences according to Church canonical law.\\" (For the layperson, \\"nuns,\\" strictly speaking, are members of religious orders, usually monastic, whereas \\"sisters\\" are members of religious congregations, generally working among the people.) It would be nice if the authors of such comments would take the trouble to look at the text as well as the cover, before rushing onto the Web to show us all how clever they are."},{"Title":"The Habit: A History of the Clothing of Catholic Nuns","review":"And not only a history of the habit, but a history of women in religious communities through the centuries. There is a great deal of information in the book, even though it seems to be meant as only an introduction. Both sides of the issue regarding the wearing of the habit today are presented. It is interesting to me that those communities that wear some sort of habit are the communities that are most likely to draw interested women. And yet, those women who belong to communities that don't wear a habit of any kind seem so dead-set against the wearing of a habit. Also, the book's illustrations are quite nice. The photos are a history in and of themselves."},{"Title":"The Habit: A History of the Clothing of Catholic Nuns","review":"Without reiterating the commentary from the five previous reviewers (all of whom I happen to agree with), I will only add that The Habit makes a decent primer for those who are new to the subject of women's clerical garb. It's a fast read and fairly interesting, but it really isn't worth the new hardcover price. Look for a used copy."},{"Title":"The Habit: A History of the Clothing of Catholic Nuns","review":"I bought this book because I wanted to learn the history of the Catholic Church's sisters/nuns and their habits.I actually lived in a \\"convent,\\" with the Sisters of St. Joseph of Newark, a teaching order. They ran a women's boarding facility in Seattle in the early 1960's (when I was there) and it eventually had to be torn down to enlarge St. Francis Xavier Cabrini Hospital next door. But as a 21-yr old I lived among the sisters and saw them on a day-to-day basis. At the time they wore the full habit of their order. I am a practical woman, I felt it was a bit ridiculous to try to be a working woman (as they were) and wear those god-awful encumbering clothes. I didn't know then that there were going to be changes in clothing for many religious orders in the near future. I got to know a number of the sisters at \\"St. T's\\" as we affectionately called the residence, and the youngest were my age and many older women. While they did try to convert me, an agnostic, they were really just wonderful women who had a personal mission which I never questioned. When I heard the habits were going to be more comfy and less cumbersome, I was happy. My only real feelings about wearing a habit is that they are more or less contrary to the idea that sisters/nuns don't want to bring attention to themselves, kind of part of their vows of giving rather than receiving (attention). I feel that some of the new sisters were attracted by the \\"outfits\\" they would be wearing. All in all, I didn't look at this book as seriously as some readers, I believed the author had her points to get across, maybe she is not a writer as much as she is a devotee. But you gotta admit the history of the habit and its evolution as it involves the early church is interesting. So, let's just let it be what it is. I gave my copy to our local library (a county-wide system) and they were most appreciative."},{"Title":"The Habit: A History of the Clothing of Catholic Nuns","review":"This is a good book about the use of and thoughts behind the wearing and use of the Habit.

From an average introduction, things went steadily downhill. If there was any original research in this book, it could not be found. Pictures were dated and can be found elsewhere in several other sources. All were all full body shots with little or no detail. Perhaps strangest was the Glossary of Church Terms, few if any were used in the body of the text. What that had to do with the main topic is still a mystery. About the only redeeming feature is it is an example of &quot;pastiche.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Habit: A History of the Clothing of Catholic Nuns","review":"The book, THE HABIT by Elizabeth Kuhns is enormously interesting. It is heavily documented plus has a glossary of terms that unless you knew by living this or that Habit, you wouldn't know what they meant. The role of Bishops and priests in dictating what nuns and Sisters should wear was fascinating.All this being said, I object to the Habit of the Daughter of Charity on the cover and to the limited information about this particular Habit within the book. Abut the Habit on the cover: it is not done right. That collar is poorly starched, almost wrinkly. As one who wore that exact same Habit for six years until we changed it, I know of what I speak. The hatpiece, called cornette, is poorly put on. (We called it 'pulled on'.) It has what we called 'pockets' by the ears. In short, no real Daughter of Charity wore a Habit that way.The limited information on that specific Habit annoys me no end. That Habit didn't begin that way; it grew over 400 years to become that way. In the beginning, Vincent and Louise had a revolutionary idea for girls who were poor themselves, but who wanted to help others, as to how they could do this. The Daughters are not nuns, per se. They are an apostolic association. To put the Daughters' Habit on the cover is totally misdirecting the education of who the Daughters of Charity are."},{"Title":"The Habit: A History of the Clothing of Catholic Nuns","review":"Definitely worth getting.

The book also shows signs of having been spell-checked by computer."},{"Title":"The Habit: A History of the Clothing of Catholic Nuns","review":"This book represents a first. No other popular book has been written about what most defined nuns to most people: their clothing. Although most of the foundresses (most founders were women) deliberately adopted the prevailing clothing of poor women or widows around them, history and the dominant clergy soon mandated that these clothes never change, and in time become not only outmoded but outlandish, dirty and dangerous. Popular accounts written by nuns at a much later date describe the time necessary to maintain these creations, the dirt they accumulated, smells and sweat they caused, and the unnecessary accidents caused by nuns driving in them, as well as their dangerous impracticality and flammability in true emergencies, such as the notorious 1058 parochial school fire in Chicago in 1958.None of this is included in this conventional, rather sweet and pious book. The author claims much research, which doesn't show. The pictures are almost all out of the many editions of &quot;Guide to the Catholic Sisterhoods in the United States&quot;, which is available on CD-ROM.I wish that I could recommend another book, but there isn't one as such; there are many accounts written by nuns and former nuns living in the period of the full habits, which can be found on google.com, amazon.com, or bookfinder.com.

Hopefully this side of the author's legacy after judicious sifting and updating won't be lost. For various reasons, among them the insistence, due to incorrect Darwinian views, on independent cultural evolution, and the speculations of crank theorists, the fairly simple facts of the case are rarely presented.There are very few historians willing to consider the issues here, Cyrus Gordon in Before Columbus, being one. This is one of those areas where establshed scholarship is determined to not get it right, and the careful arguments in the book are classic and pretty well ignored."},{"Title":"Early man and the ocean: A search for the beginnings of navigation and seaborne civilizations","review":"Early Man and the Ocean is another in Thor Heyerdahl's rewriting of the ancient history of the Americas and Polynesia. Published in 1978, it contains a number of chapters on information not covered in his earlier books, including his proposed timeline for the peopling of Polynesia by not one, but two different peoples. Indeed, what makes this book different is that here the author ties together his findings from many different lands, into a logical whole.If you liked Kon-Tiki and Aku-Aku, then this book is for you. My only complaint against this book is that I dearly wish that it would be updated and reissued."},{"Title":"Sketches By Boz","review":"I read the Kindle edition of the book; it's a great sampler of classic Dickens without having to do the full-on 400+ readathon that many of his best works require. The most enjoyable aspect of the stories is the historic, authentic feel they give of London in the early 1800's. Dickens's keen eye for detail and his ability to describe it in a lively manner make this series of short stories a true time slip of a book.The bubbling cauldron of 19th Century English society boils over the edges in these usually funny, always entertaining, often gripping sketches of people and places in London. His nostalgia for places and people being displaced by the economic growth brought on by the industrial revolution is strongest in his sketch \\"Scotland Yard,\\" and the book is filled with a keen respect for the past without making apologies for its brutalities or injustices.As with so many things written by Dickens, courting, drunkenness, elopement, hanky-panky, hypocrisy, true love, and human goodness feature prominently throughout. Stories such as \\"The Election for Beadle\\" presage the fuller parody of British elections that appears in \\"The Pickwick Papers,\\" and his derisiveness in \\"Parliamentary Sketch\\" brings to bear much of his earlier experiences as a political reporter.As in all his writing, however, Dickens's strength and power show strongest when he writes about the cab drivers, curates, hackney drivers, omnibus cads, chimney sweeps, circus performers, theater actors, gin shop waitresses, pawnbrokers, prison inmates, invalids, drunks, prostitutes, spinsters, lonely old men, unhappily married couples, abused wives, pensioners, milliners, and \\"shabby-genteel\\" people who made up the ordinary walks of life.This book is a rare combination of humor, history, and pathos, all rolled into one."},{"Title":"Sketches By Boz","review":"Imagine one of the funniest and saddest collection of short stories by one of the greatest writers in the English language read by an vocally affectless female computer.

I usally like to read 2 books a year on credit repair. I do this so I can check out the advice and knowledge of others in the credit industry. If you're looking for a book to assist you in repairing your credit,LOOK ELSEWHERE! This book gives the reader very basic information, this is information the reader probably already knows or that could be obtained from the federal trades commission or any of the 3 credit reporting agencies for FREE. I really got a good laugh when I saw chapter 5 &quot;The Importance of Good Credit&quot;. I said to myself, &quot;Why waste a chapter on this subject?&quot; Anyone buying this book, or for that matter any book on the subject credit repair, is well aware of the importance of good credit!Let's move to chapter 7 titled &quot;Repairing Your Credit Step-by-Step&quot;. This chapter only has 12 pages.The first 7 pages are how to repair your credit and the next 5 pages are sample dispute letters. I'm sorry but this chapter should be the meat and potatoes of the book not &quot;THE STRING BEAN&quot;. Another disappointment was chapter 9 titled &quot;Lending Scams&quot;. This chapter has 11 pages on this subject: &quot;WHO CARES&quot;! This book is suppose to be about &quot;CREDIT REPAIR&quot;. I think this book had good intentions, but just couldn't put it together. It had alot of usless information scattered throughout the book.I feel anyone looking to repair their credit will not gain the knowledge or confidence to complete their goals with this book. The only positive thing about this book is that it is easy to read. My advice to anyone looking to repair their credit is LOOK ELSEWHERE!I would just like to add, I just completed reading a book by BILL KELLY,JR.&quot;THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO CREDIT REPAIR&quot;. Now this was a great book! I will be writing a review on this great book soon. STAY TUNED!"},{"Title":"Repair Your Own Credit","review":"This book is very good for people that do not work in the fields of credit/accounting/banking, etc. Much of what it had to say I already knew, but I guess I can therefore say I agree with it. It tells you why YOU should repair your own credit and not pay someone else to do it. It tells you WHY you should do it. It gives a good bibliography.... but it does NOT tell you HOW to do it. That's really what I was looking for. I liked it well enough to buy his other book, Life After Debt, which is advertised as a how-to. I'll get back to you."},{"Title":"Repair Your Own Credit","review":"Mr. Hammond's guide has helped me remove several bad entries in my credit reports.

I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Repair Your Own Credit","review":"I read the book and have used some of the principles it presented. For the most part I thought the book brought together a fair amount of information for a novice to use in repairing ones credit.It by all means is not the total repair guide but it really is designed for easy to understand reading and that is just what it presents and does an good job.If I were the professional that was looking for a more comprehensive look into advanced tactics, then this book is not for you.If you want to improve your score or fix some nagging but easier credit issues then this book works.Curthttp://www.101-credit-debt-finance.com/"},{"Title":"Repair Your Own Credit","review":"I'm puzzled about this material and the author. Hammond has written severeal books about how to get bad things off of credit reports and fix credit, often times citing illegal tactics. However, in this book he attempts to educate readers about credit repair scams; some of the scams and illegal practices he was previously an advocate of. Ok about the book. It will give readers and idea of how the credit reporting system works and relates to consumers. There is a lot of talk about Experian and not enough about the other two agencies. Apparently the author was involved in litigation with Experian. The material is often repetitive making it redudant. The chapters are too short and leave the reader wanting more thorough explanations of the topics (for example: credit scoring, identity theft and credit repair) Also, his interpretation of how creditors interpret credit inquiries and other data is incorrect. The book suggest that too many inquiries = bad risk. This isn't true b/c inquiries have the least impact on FICO scores.He also notes that a person's spouse's name appears on his credit report along with his number of dependents and marrital status - All of which are not true. Summary - More emphasis should have been placed on the accuracy of the data outlined in this book but it's a pretty good start for beginners. I'd recommend The Insider's Guide to Credit Repair by K E Varner for the most up-to-date and accurate information about credit repair, id theft, and scoring."},{"Title":"Repair Your Own Credit","review":"Recently my wife discovered negative entries in her credit report.

This book rambles on about how good credit affects you and why it's important to have good credit. The useful information is simply repeating what most people already know - That you can write your credit agency, and for a fee get a copy of your report, and you can write them a letter disputing what's in your report.

As background, I decided to learn some Arabic due to my work occassionally requiring me meet with individuals whose native language is Arabic. Last summer I attended a formal 3 week intensive Arabic college course in Chicago, but found that the grammar taught there was overwhelming and complicated. Further, a native Arabic speaking friend of mine told me that the formal class I took provided such a high degree of grammar usage - it was not practical for everyday communication. In all seriousness, communicating in Arabic using the formal \\"long pronunciation\\" would be analogous to walking into a bar in the South Side of Chicago and attempting to order a draft beer using \\"shakespherian English.\\" As is quoted on page 12, \\"This book uses short pronunciation.\\" Author John Mace gets directly to the point in this book, and the vocabulary is completely popular and practical without unnecessary complicated grammar. Do buy this book if you want to learn Arabic - but, do first obtain a solid grounding in the Arabic script. I learned the script in about 3 days of solid practice and it is not as difficult as I thought. I believe John Mace also has an Arabic Script book as well.Special thanks to this author for his ability to provide practical information and vocabulary fi-l-'arabee. I have pre-ordered his second book due this month! Dave"},{"Title":"Basic Arabic Workbook: For Revision and Practice","review":"As a self-taught student of Arabic, I can't say enough good things about this book. I flip through every new Arabic book I can find at Borders, but most of them are either too easy (ie the Teach Yourself series) or require a teachers (ie Arabic Connectors, Al-Kitaab, etc). John Mace has finally produced a book that allows you to understand the grammar, learn and pronounce relevant vocabulary, and do short but very effective exercises.However, don't use it as your first book! In my case (and I'm a language nut) I used a couple of Jane Wightwrick's books, Let's Read the Arabic Newspapers, 1000 Arabic Media words, and Kalila wa Dimna first. Otherwise, this book would have done me in: a) it is quite dry, with the majority of exercise sentences being something like \\"The conference of experts rejected the report of the Ministry\\". b) it introduces not only the relevant grammar, but also many exceptions / variations in endings / etc at the same time, so that you really need to read carefully in order to get it all. I have gone through most of the chapters 2 or 3 times, including all of the exercises. c) the pace is pretty brisk, as with present tense of all verb types in a single chapter (sound, doubled, initial-waw, 3 variants of hollow, 3 variants of ending-defective, and 6 doubly defective verbs)A minor problem, there are a number of typos in the exercises, usually in transliteration, sometimes in the arabic spelling, or a wrong word used, etc. Most are not too hard to spot but, when I don't understand why my answer is wrong (since I don't have a teacher to ask) I often wonder whether it is my mistake or the book's..."},{"Title":"Basic Arabic Workbook: For Revision and Practice","review":"An unusual but excellent text. The author conducts a point by point review of grammar rules while also introducing a news and media-oriented selection of related vocabulary items in each chapter. The grammar overview is very concise, written in as non-technical a manner as possible and can be described as pithy. John Mace has a wonderful way of distilling rules simply and clearly. He also narrows the grammar down to the most useful subset possible. Although short exercises punctuate the text, the book is more a review than a workbook."},{"Title":"Basic Arabic Workbook: For Revision and Practice","review":"A good instruction to simplify fus-ha/formal grammar without quite crossing the amiyya/colloquail border. For spoken communication purposes it's best to learn the actual amiyya of the region, but for spoken transregional purposes or just for the casual speaker this is great."},{"Title":"Basic Arabic Workbook: For Revision and Practice","review":"This book is a much-needed resource for learners of Standard Arabic. The coverage of grammar is extremely straightforward and the author illustrates it with many examples. Mace has a particular talent for cutting to the chase, even while illuminating difficult grammatical points. A particular plus is that ultimate rarity in books on Standard Arabic in English- a well-chosen vocabulary, well-grouped by topic. Words that are invaluable in Arabic mass media and in business and political life are introduced. This isn't the language of the Qur'an or of classical poetry, (case endings, for instance, are barely mentioned) but for someone trying to get up to speed in the modern language, it is one of the most useful works to have. Another plus is that although the book can certainly be worked through sequentially, it isn't really necessary to do so- one can just as well jump around according to one's particular interest or need. The price is right, too."},{"Title":"Basic Arabic Workbook: For Revision and Practice","review":"I'm quite impressed with this book. The exercises given in each chapter are short, but effectively review each concept. The pace is good--knowledge of both vocabulary and grammar will increase at a reasonable speed. The transliteration of all Arabic words is a good touch to ensure one's pronunciation is correct. Also, no previous knowledge of grammar is needed to grasp the Arabic within this book (although knowing what a subjunctive or jussive tense, etc., certainly helps). I also purchased his \\"Arabic Verbs\\" and plan on buying the next book in this series once I complete this one.My one caveat is that there are a few spelling errors sprinkled throughout, which in my experience is normal with grammars. Also, you won't learn phrases like \\"Hi, what's up?\\" And etc. This will more prepare you to read media Arabic."},{"Title":"Basic Arabic Workbook: For Revision and Practice","review":"I've been studying Arabic from a variety of sources, and this book has clarified much of the grammar I was confused about. I wouldn't recommend it for beginners, but for those who need to clarify Arabic's overwhelming grammar rules and review and organize what you may have learned in your courses, it's tremendously helpful. Its layout is simple and straightforward, and the exercises are helpful too."},{"Title":"Joshua","review":"I have a library of H.A. Ironside books, all are soild resources.

I thought that this book would be just as good, but instead it just...works. Bond combats another terrorist organization with a cool name (through the years there has been Fleming's SPECTRE, this book's BAST and Benson's Union-the last one doesn't really have a good name, I know, but the head guy's name is cool). This one includes a woman as one of its top members, but she isn't really interesting, just confusing. And, oh yeah, the confusion? The people on the different sides become impossible to like or dislike because they are first portayed as one thing, then another thing, then back to the beginning, then &quot;oh, no, I'm sorry: he/she really is good/bad.&quot; I love a good plot twist, but these polt twists demand Tylenol. If you've never read a Bond story before, try this one: you'll enjoy it if your expectations arent high."},{"Title":"Win, Lose or Die","review":"Like the other reviewers here, I don't much care for John Gardner's James Bond novels. Gardner just doesn't seem to be in touch with Ian Fleming's classic character or the special world Fleming created for him. The only reason I am reading Gardner's Bonds is that I want to read those by Raymond Benson...However, although it gets off to a slow start, I would have to say that (so far) \\"Win, Lose or Die\\" is arguably a highlight of the Gardner books. It is also the only one that I feel could actually work as a Bond film. The characters are a bit more respectable than most of Gardner's creations, especially his usual cookie-cutter villains. The book also carries some of the wonderful, sinister, almost supernatural imagery that Fleming was so fond of, portraying Bond and the other characters as players in a strange spiritual plane that seems to stretch beyond Earthly bonds.Now, if only Gardner could have learned to do away with all those...one-liners he has Bond spout after he does something. This is supposed to be Fleming's Bond, not Roger Moore's. Furthermore, the book continues to slip with the horrid scenes in which Bond interacts with M and Bill Tanner. In Fleming's books, M was a man of few words, and when he said something, it was to the point and deadly serious. Unfortunately, Gardner again sinks to the level of having Bond and M trade barbs, if you will. Fleming's Bond would NEVER smart off to his boss the way Gardner's does.However, once you get past the tepid first third of the novel, the narrative really picks up. This book actually has enough high points to outweigh the low points. The section where Bond is used as bait at the Italian villa is almost up to Fleming's speed. And the climax aboard the hijacked carrier is absolutely spellbinding.\\"Win, Lose or Die\\" is one of the few Gardner Bonds that those of us \\"Fleming purists\\" can get through without rolling our eyes darn near every page."},{"Title":"Win, Lose or Die","review":"This novel has screenplay written on it.

This is one 007 thiller you should not miss."},{"Title":"Win, Lose or Die","review":"This could be a good book but Gardner was not really a good writer, well for this book. He could have made the story more interesting but he did not.Some of the parts are not really interesting and very strange. Take for example, the part about two of the organisation members having a talk together, how could they not possibily not know that the British Secret service had been bugging the when the have the ability to start their operation &quot;WIN&quot; and &quot;LOSE&quot;?"},{"Title":"Win, Lose or Die","review":"Why do most of John Gardner's James Bond novels seem like screenplays? I think that is what was always missing from his writings. Because they were similar to screenplays they read like movie scripts, not novels. It just leaves the reader so uninvolved. Detail and flavor for the settings are always noticeably absent from his Bond novels. This one is no exception. I suppose we all lose!"},{"Title":"Saint Patrick, his origins and career,","review":"It is one of the most important books for people interested in Saint Patrick's life and background. It presents a state of research in the 60s, so there are more recent works (e.g. Dumville or de Paor), but it is stil important, as this subject still contains everlasting arguments. All the scholars still refer to Bury, Bieler, Hanson etc., so it is essential to read this book as well. It is very important that it contains tables with excerpts from the sources about Saint Patrick - Hanson compares all the information about the Saint included in different Irish Annals, which is very handy as you do not have to look for these pieces of information yourself (that's if you are just a history student in a hurry). In the end - it is not a book for layman - you have to have basic knowledge of Medieval world, Ireland, Britain and Saint Patrick himself. The book is addressed to serious readers - scholars and history students.

It doesn't tell you much about the scientific motivation for the study or for the team's activities. Based on the stories, the plan seemed to be, \\"Let's put radio collars on grizzly bears and see how much stuff we can learn.\\" They were particularly interested in finding winter dens and trying to monitor temperature of the den and the vitals of the bears.But the Craighead brothers don't seem to be very self-conscious about what they're doing, and why. Their scientific ethics and social attitudes are also very much grounded in the 1950s, for whatever that's worth.There's a lot of information about Yellowstone grizzlies in here, though of course a lot of later scientific progress has been made. Some of the other reviewers mention how valuable this information can be if you're traveling in grizzly country. I'd recommend against reading the book that way. The science is old, and grizzly behavior varies by location. Barren ground grizzlies in the Arctic, salmon-based bears on Kodiak Island, berry- and moth-eating bears in Glacier NP, and pine nut-dependent bears in Yellowstone are bears of a different color (sometimes literally). Read this book as a bit of the history of science.The final chapter and the epilogue cover the controversy with the Park Service over grizzly bear management. This ultimately led to the Park refusing to allow the Craigheads to continue their research. Craighead is understandably bitter and defensive, but also mostly in the right. Because the Park Service refused to listen to the Craigheads, human-bear conflicts were unnecessarily high for a decade, and we lost more than one-third of the grizzly population. We also had at least two human fatalities that took exactly the form that the Craigheads predicted. These accounts of the conflicts with the park service are the most interesting part, and most lastingly relevant, of the book."},{"Title":"Track of the Grizzly","review":"A very well written and entertaining book about the Criaghead's multi year study of the Grizzly Bears of the Yellowstone Eco system. The book while written by a Biologist, is very entertaining and an easy (light) read....not a scientific paper.If you want to understand what Grizzly Bears are REALLY like,and want to understand this interesting animal- this is your book.It's a great book to read if you visit the Yellowstone area and are somewhat &quot;Bear-a-phobic&quot; as a result of the sensational bear attack books. I was reading this book in Yellowstone this summer when I had my 1st bear incident in the 15 years I have been coming to the park. Armed with good information the &quot;incident&quot; became an interesting encounter with another one of YNP's great animals.This is a book worth buying and keeping in your library."},{"Title":"Track of the Grizzly","review":"Are you thinking about backpacking in grizzly country? Well, then you need to learn a bit about the biology and behavior of the bear. While on a trip to Alaska this year, I did some reading and learned that grizzlies are largely nocturnal, feeding mostly at night and denning up during the day. Craighead's book confirms this, and provides a lot of other useful information. He and his brother did research on the Yellowstone grizzly population for around a decade, but park management rejected their expert advice when grizzly management became a hot political issue after two tourists were killed by bears in 1967. This aspect of the book is of course dated, and there is no update on the current state of the Yellowstone grizzlies, but nevertheless this is an excellent book for anyone planning a wilderness trip. \\"Learning to Talk Bear\\" by Roland Cheek is a good companion book to this one."},{"Title":"Track of the Grizzly","review":"A very readable, enjoyable book. It was published in 1979 so I'm sure there's more and newer information on the bears, but this is a great starting place. It's author (and his brother) are famous for their early grizzly studies."},{"Title":"Track of the Grizzly","review":"A shortened and less scientific version of the Craighead's classic study of the Yellowstone grizzlies.

It is a classic work on Albert Schweitzer. The only reason I give it three stars rather than five is the fact that the photos deserved to have been printed on a higher quality paper."},{"Title":"JMX in Action","review":"Finally, a JMX book you'll love! Unlike other JMX books I've read (even those purporting to be based on &quot;Real-world&quot; experience) this book is firmly grounded with examples and explanations as to why JMX is useful and necessary.Starting from the first chapter (which is the best architectural overview of JMX I've read) the authors provide clear, easy-to-understand explanations of both the how and the why of JMX. The code examples are readable and clearly explained (the authors specifically call out the relevant parts of each example) making you want to grab an editor and start coding!They cover all of the major parts of JMX very well, including details on each of the different types of Mbeans. Likewise, their coverage of JMX notification is the best I've seen. And, since the book is based on the Sun JMX Reference Implementation with detailed instructions on building and running the examples, it's easy to try this yourself.There are a few minor snags that don't affect the book much. They don't start using UML early enough (the first large-scale example left me scratching my head) and they build a few marginally useful things (a Jini connector, for instance). Also, a bit more detail on other JMX implementations would have been nice. However, it's still the best of the available JMX books. Buy it if you need to use or build Mbeans!"},{"Title":"JMX in Action","review":"In classic Manning fashion this book is concise and focused, uses graphics sparingly and effectively, and does a great job with code annotation. The problem comes with exposition. What I wanted was a book that not only explained what JMX was, but why I would want to use it. I found that this book had a ton of technical detail, on what is undoubtedly a complex topic, but lacked much in terms of context. More how, less why.That being said, I understand that most readers are looking for the technical side of the argument and the book has that in spades. Particularly nice chapters are chapter one, which does provide a little context for the use of JMX, and provides a very nice, though brief, overview of the JMX architecture. Chapter six, on agent notification is also excellent.Frankly, I would love to see a second version of this book with more emphasis on use cases. For example, chapter 7, on dynamic MBean creation, would do well to cover why you would want to use Model MBeans, and not just assume the reader understands the solution out of context with the need.If you are on a project using JMX or an architect who is already looking at JMX, this book is worth the look. If you are looking for a gentle introduction to the topic, keep looking."},{"Title":"JMX in Action","review":"I have found this book extremely helpful to my development efforts.

Being that the JMX api is actually pretty simple and straight-forward, I didn't find this book much use at all. A much better book in my opinion is \\"Java and JMX: Building Manageable Systems\\" by Kreger, Harold, and Williamson. That book does a much better job of going beyond \\"programming\\" JMX at a single point, and covering what the options and best practices are for building a management system using JMX.Get the \\"In Action\\" book only if you need to know the fundamentals of JMX in order to expose some Mbeans or write a quick client to manage a single application.

This collection includes articles, manuscripts, and lectures that had been previously published in Irish and Italian journals. Most of the writings parallel what he wrote about in Dubliners, Ulysses, and his creative poetry. Barry suggests that the journalistic criticism that James Joyce wrote about Ireland were to be published in one single volume, which was supposed to be geard toward an Italian audience in which he lectured to in Trieste.This book offers readers an insight on Joyce's political and critical meanderings that relate to all gamuts of Irish society. As one reads these writings, one will observe a sense of naivite in Joyce's early writings, but will see his growth and maturation as a writer in later ones. Joyce covers history as well as literature in long and short vignettes. The articles, book reviews, and manuscripts were written over a 40 year period of Joyce's life. They show his growth as a critical writer and author from a teenager to an adult. He relates issues pertaining to Irish society and literature, James Clarence Mangan, Oscar Wilde, and George Meredith as well as the most prominent writers in British literature, Daniel Defoe, William Blake, and Charles Dickens. In particular, several of the writings have both a serious and humorous tone that makes Joyce's writings even more interesting to read.Barry does a fine job at presenting these samples of Joyce's writings. The footnotes and the explanatory notes are extremely helpful in providing background information for the book. Conor Deane deserves praises for translating Joyce's works from Italian to English, and for those who want to see the original transcript of each writing, they are included in Italian and French in the Appendix section of the book.Occasional, Critical, and Political Writing is recommended reading for readers interested in having a better understanding of James Joyce's literary criticism. In addition, the works offer insight to how he approached his early and colossal work, Dubliners and Ulysses. It is, indeed, recommended for the curious literature reader or Joyce aficionado."},{"Title":"Occasional, Critical, and Political Writing (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Joyce is an experimenter, not an essayist.This book is ugly and boring.If you want to read good essays onliterature, art, philosophy or whatever,read Chesterton, Santayana, or Russell.Not a book to smile at."},{"Title":"Occasional, Critical, and Political Writing (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"This volume has value to the JJ scholar, not to the casual reader.

Their first-hand or recent knowledge of their oppression, and their reactions to it, trumped the old media's propaganda! They knew too much first-hand to be hornswoggled by media, only newspapers and pamphlets then. In essence, they KNEW what they would NOT stand for regardless of what the media stated, for they had LIVED it, barely, or parents had!I would submit to you we would NOT have bought the administration's nor biased media's false assertions regarding Saddam had we had war on our soil in recent memory. We would have ALL known what war was first-hand and would NOT have made this \\"decision\\" so readily or cavalierly.2) How many of the colonists could read? Yes, obviously, the founders could, but the average colonist had to depend on the educated founders, or that class of folks, to tell them the news and its ramifications, which were translated through the founders' own biases.Today, folks get their \\"facts\\" from many \\"news\\" sources other than newspapers or the almost extinct pamphlet, i.e. tv, internet, books, etc. The selection of which source is often a result of their ideology, rather than in the past, when they took what was available as far as source.I would submit the lack of recent knowledge of oppression or lack of freedoms, the lack of civic education - heck, ignorance, no knowledge of history, apathy, and trust, albeit, misplaced - contribute, in my opinion, to the increased harm the current biased media does to We, The People and OUR Country!Let's face it, the majority of us are used to Walter Cronkite, NOT Bill O'Reilly, (of course, depending upon one's generation) and their inherent credibility or not. Which of these people is more credible, or stated another way, which of these people has been caught in lies or scandals?So, NO, I do NOT agree with what I think are your false conclusions or dismissal of harm done by current biased media. I believe the harm is immeasurable. I believe it is MORE than unfortunate given it DIRECTLY lead to an invasion based on LIES.ALL these years have passed since our country was founded, and the press, collectively, has NOT improved or evolved in a positive way with any depth, ergo, the ease the current press slipped into bias mode. Rather, the media has digressed into lies and obfuscation. To the degree they have committed these acts, the current media is TOTALLY complicit with the results - a war, which the majority feel we never should have embarked upon, just to mention one glaring example, AD NAUSEAM!I am MORE than DISGUSTED over the media's active participation through their blatant bias in all the negative things which have happened to our country in the last five years! I am just as DISGUSTED with ANY who would apologize for it, minimize it, or dismiss it.ALL WE, THE PEOPLE, EVER WANT or DESERVE in this country is the pure FACTS, untarnished by the prism of bias!"},{"Title":"Infamous Scribblers: The Founding Fathers and the Rowdy Beginnings of American Journalism","review":"The book is a readable account of the beginnings of American newspapers, which were at times more biased and full of lies than today's worst news outlets.

Who started it, who else was involved, and what was the result?"},{"Title":"Infamous Scribblers: The Founding Fathers and the Rowdy Beginnings of American Journalism","review":"To a great degree, the Founding Fathers were the \\"Infamous Scribblers.\\" Only George Washington, writes Eric Burns probably never wrote a line intended for newspaper publication.Washington was hard-used by the Republican press, especially the Aurora, which was secretly managed by Thomas Jefferson, who was in Washington's Cabinet. But John Adams, alsd hard-used by the press when he was president, had been a scribbler himself in early years. Not usually strident, he was, however, hard on King George and his ministers. Alexander Hamilton had his own rag, the ;Gazette of the United States, that he used to run down his colleague in the Cabinet, Jefferson. But he was also the principal author of the Federalist Papers, still the supreme ornament of American newspapering. The other authors of The Federalist were James Madison and John Jay, on opposite sides once the Constitution was ratified.Obviously, both the politics and the journalism of the Revolutionary and early national period were complex and contradictory, and no one -- except possibly Washington -- was in a position to gripe very sincerely about the standards and ethics of the press.It is Eric Burns' theme that the first American papers were scurrilous, unfairly partisan, unconcerned with accuracy. All this is true and has long been a commonplace of histories about the times, yet it was also not true.The first 150 pages of his book, which give a summary history of the development of the colonial periodical press, are practically genteel. Later, yes, the partisan faults came to the fore, but it was never true that editors were indifferent to accuracy.The confusion comes because there were not \\"editorial\\" and \\"news\\" and \\"advertisement\\" sections.Everything was jumbled together, and of course editors cared whether their reports of shipping news and prices current in other colonies were believable.It is true that the language of the opinion pieces was unrestrained, according to 20th century ideas, but it would be difficult to argue that the partisanship was rawer than what appeared in the Chicago Tribune or PM in the \`40s.Furthermore, and this is beyond Burns's time frame, the completely bareknuckled style never went out of fashion in American newspapers. What happened was that commercial dailies (dailies hardly existed in the period covered by Burns) began to appeal, for purely business reasons, to as broad a readership as possible, and so stopped putting opinions in news stories. The old style continued in the frankly partison periodicals, of which there have been tens of thousands, mostly weeklies or monthlies, rather than dailies, and mostly devoid of any attempt to provide general news. A few, like William Lloyd Garrison's Liberator, were influential. Most like various Ku Klux Klan papers such as the Fiery Cross were seldom seen, much less read, by most people.Burns's volume is a flavorful sampling, not a detailed analysis, of the 18th century papers. In many cases, he quotes a line or a paragraph without even saying what paper it was in.Opinionated himself, he declares what the underlying significance of various press ambuscades and battles was, and this is usually plausible. He chooses to call a halt with the death of Hamilton, which in many ways also marked the end of the federalist press, although it was on the way out anyway. The great change in the American press came in the 1790s, which started out with most papers federalist and ended with most republican.The federalist press committed suicide, along with the feferalist faction, by supporting the SeditionAct, a repudiation of American political views that was too much for most people to swallow. The big money was still federalist, but big money has never supported a truly unpopular journalism in America the way it has in Europe. Not for long, anyway.I hesitated a before picking up this book. Burns is the host for Fox News Watch, and although I have never seen his show, what I have seen of Fox is not worth anyone's time, except pathologists. But I did read it, and Burns is free of Foxiness.You have to wonder whether he chose the topic as a kind of expiation for keeping the company he does; and if that is not it, you have to wonder whether conversation stops when Eric Burns walks into the Fox lunchroom."},{"Title":"Infamous Scribblers: The Founding Fathers and the Rowdy Beginnings of American Journalism","review":"Eric Burns provides a brilliant look at the major newspapers of this country, starting with the first in the colonies from the early 18th century, onward through about 1804.

Nevertheless, recommended reading for anyone interested in American history."},{"Title":"Infamous Scribblers: The Founding Fathers and the Rowdy Beginnings of American Journalism","review":"I absolutely loved this book. It is exactly the kind of experience I want when I read history. I learned a lot, and had fun doing it. Eric Burns obviously knows his subject, and his style is relaxed and entertaining. I did a little research on him, and as it turns out, he was named by the \\"Washington Journalism Review\\" as one of the best writers in the history of broadcast journalism.This book is a little over 400 pages, excluding the notes and bibliography. Burns takes the reader from the first American newspaper in 1690, called \\"Publick Occurences Both Foreign and Domestic\\", and shows the evolution of the newspaper through the pre-revolutionary period, the War for Independence, and the post-revolutionary period. In the hands of a less-skilled writer, this subject matter could be dry. In the hands of Burns, it is a page-turner.Like many others, I began this book longing for the good old days of journalism. You know the ones, back when the media was not biased, back when newspapers did not sling mud, and engage in vicious gossip. After reading this book, I realize that things were a whole lot worse than they are now. Today's newspapers are models of balance and fairness compared to U.S. newspapers in the late 18th century.The newspaper was an important tool in the days of the United States infancy. Prior to the revolution, Whig editors used their papers to stir up patriotism, or even hatred of the British. Tory papers aimed to counter, or at least cool, the initial fires of revolution. There did not appear to be any papers that were neutral, and that reaffirms for us the polarizing nature of this debate. One didn't sit on the fence. Once the war was over, the papers were used as political weapons by the Federalists and the Republicans. The sheer nastiness will astound you. Burns' book takes us through these heated policy debates, and gives us a feel for how hot the passions ran.You will also learn about Benjamin Franklin's stint as an editor. One of his grandsons, Benjamin Franklin Bache, would grow up to be an influential and controversial editor. You'll learn about the first sex scandal involving a public figure caught in an adulterous relationship, and see how he used the media to try and repair his damaged reputation. Interestingly, the journalist who broke the nation's first sex scandal also broke the second one.I think that most readers would enjoy this book. Sure, it will help if you are interested in history or in journalism, but that is not necessary. Anyone who likes a good story will like this story.

Now we get pious protestations of \\"fairness\\" from the media, when it's quite plain to discern the leanings, either left or right. Back 200 years or so, the attacks in the press were savage and unyielding, the type we wouldn't read today in newspapers (but perhaps hear on talk radio).

People on the left and right fault contemporary journalism for (a) giving the Bush administration a free ride, or (b) extreme bias against all things Bush and Republican.Charges of media bias and the controversy over good vs. bad journalism are older than the nation, literally. Veteran journalist Eric Burns has written about the notorious founding fathers of journalism in a highly readable, outrageous and frequently hilarious book called \\"Infamous Scribblers: The Founding Fathers and the Rowdy Beginnings of American Journalism.\\"Here, a disclaimer may be warranted. Burns hosts \\"Fox News Watch\\" on Fox News Channel (Saturdays at 6:30 p.m. ET), a program on which I appear as a panelist. Nevertheless, I am writing about his book without his encouragement, without remuneration and without even the promise of more airtime.\\"Infamous Scribblers\\" is a line taken from the pen of George Washington, who responded to the disdain some in the press and politics had for him with disdain of his own. Schoolchildren are taught many things about some of our Founding Fathers, but little about what their journalistic tormentors said about them. Burns' book wonderfully completes the record.The National Gazette was so afraid President George Washington would become a monarch that it took the slightest occasion, including Washington's 61st birthday party, to warn of impending doom to the newly born republic. Its editor, Philip Freneau (a college classmate of James Madison at Princeton), wrote, \\"Who will deny that the celebrating of birth days is not a striking feature of royalty? We hear of no such thing during the republic of Rome ...\\"Another paper of the time likened the birthday observance to a \\"Political Christmas\\" and suggested the event was an attempt to rank \\"Washington with Jesus Christ.\\"In Colonial journalism, prominent men like Alexander Hamilton would use numerous pseudonyms to comment on, criticize and attack political opponents. Editors, such as they were in those days, saw nothing wrong with the practice and, in fact, encouraged it. The most outrageous and inaccurate items were printed in newspapers with no fact-checking and little sense of responsibility for the damage to career and reputation they might cause.Burns writes of the Gazette of the United States (born on April 15, 1789, a month after the Constitution took effect) that its editor, John Fenno, was an ardent supporter of the federalism represented by Washington and Hamilton. Fenno's newspaper served as a counterweight to the republican slant of the National Gazette. Burns sums up Fenno's journalistic philosophy: \\"He would cajole his readers, deceive them when necessary, rile them when advisable; he would praise public officials and other newspaper editors who agreed with his positions and drub those who did not, assailing their intelligence, their character, their patriotism; and he would publish the records of legislative proceedings that advanced the federalist agenda while either ignoring or deriding or sometimes even falsifying documents to the contrary.\\"Such things were to be found on the \\"news\\" pages, not the opinion page. Entire newspapers were opinion pages. To have a page designated \\"opinion\\" would have been redundant.The 1790s were, according to historian John Ferling, \\"one of America's most passionate decades.\\" The nation's journalism, notes Burns, could not help but reflect the heat.One paper, named the Aurora, engaged in what Burns describes as \\"journalistic savagery ... not caring about accuracy or even the illusion of it.\\" In 1795, the Aurora published a series of letters George Washington supposedly wrote while encamped at Valley Forge during the winter of 1777 and 1778. The letters \\"portrayed Washington as a lukewarm patriot at best, a loyal subject of George III at worst, and at least a skeptic concerning independence.\\"It would have been a great story if true, but Washington wrote no such letters. That didn't bother Benjamin Franklin Bache (Ben Franklin's grandson and the owner of the Aurora), who was not about to retract something that served his anti-Washington political ends.They're all in the book - people you studied in school - and so are their many detractors. After reading \\"Infamous Scribblers\\" you will be amazed at how far journalism has progressed (or not) and even more amazed at how our Founders overcame the inaccurate and biased attacks from the \\"newspapers\\" and pamphlets of their day to achieve greatness and a deserved place in our history books and our hearts.Copyright 2006 Tribune Media Services"},{"Title":"Infamous Scribblers: The Founding Fathers and the Rowdy Beginnings of American Journalism","review":"You have had it up to here with newspapers and news broadcasts that are partisan and shrill. You are sick of the media focusing on scandal or even making up scandals. You can't stand the prospect of hearing from another pundit who calls for the death of her political opponents. You wish that newspapers would go back to the good old days of objectivity and impartial promotion of the public interest, perhaps when Freedom of the Press was a new concept and was being flaunted with energy and joy. Don't be too sure. In _Infamous Scribblers: The Founding Fathers and the Rowdy Beginnings of American Journalism_ (PublicAffairs), Eric Burns (who works for Fox News!) has given a funny and thoughtful look at our nation's initial press. The title of the book comes from a phrase George Washington, who had more than his share of problems with the papers, used to describe his newsprint detractors. We may have come a long way in the technologies we use for our media, but the problems here of lies, leaks, and libel will sound familiar to modern readers.One excuse the newspapers had then that they do not have now is that they were new. Neither Europe nor the colonies had a tradition of an impartial press, so the press had to invent itself. The first newspaper was closed because the publisher was obnoxious and refused to get a license. The second was a toadying journal that printed what the authorities wanted. Ben Franklin's elder brother was the first crusading journalist, but took up a malicious crusade against smallpox inoculations. Founding father Sam Adams edited the _Boston Gazette_ and had no interest in printing the truth, unless the truth happened to promote American liberty. If a false story about British troops raping helpless American women incited violent protests against the redcoats, Sam Adams didn't mind. As Burns writes, \\"History has vindicated Adams's political ends; it cannot justify his journalistic means.\\" The exaggeration and outright lying was continued by others during the time of the writing of the Constitution and during the initial decades of the new nation. The Federalists (in favor of strong central government) and the opposing Republicans had their pet journals, and even arranged for the editors to be on the federal payroll when they could.Burns's lively history is a reminder of how venerable is the tradition of parties loving a press that agrees with them and excoriating the press that disagrees. It also goes a long way to making the gigantic marble statues that we think of as our Founding Fathers into human figures motivated at least in part by lust, vanity, and eagerness for power. The vehemence and outright deceitfulness that they could use when deploying the press is remarkable. It is also worth being reminded that for all the good that came from our founding, those involved in it were often unsure about what they were doing, and if sure, were often sure of what proved to be error or misjudgment. Burns commends the nation for coming to admire the strengths of the founders, but not emulating their style of journalism. Perhaps the papers of two hundred years ago were more extreme in their bluster, malevolence, and inattention to fact, but those who look at current cable news, blogging, or even supermarket tabloids will find that the reformation has not been total."},{"Title":"Infamous Scribblers: The Founding Fathers and the Rowdy Beginnings of American Journalism","review":"Infamous Scribblers: The Founding Fathers and the Rowdy Beginnings of American Journalism is the eye-popping true story of how raucous and undisciplined American journalism once was.

But on the whole the left thinks that it is biased in favor of the right. The right is absolutely certain that it is biased in favor of the left. And some like the ones you see at the checkout stand in the supermarket are biased against the truth, any truth.What this book brings to the fore is that this is not new. The media, such as it was, of the time had just about as much fun with politicians dallying in the wrong bedroom as did the media with Bill Clinton. The owners of the media made little effort to hide their bias for or against anyone.Washington, for instance is usually treated almost saintly by the people of today. One article said, 'the American nation has been deceived by Washington.' If you substituted the word 'Clinton' or 'Bush' for the word 'Washington' this could well be a recent or one of today's articles.This is a book that reminds us that there is little new under the sun, at least so far as journalism and politicians go. It's a delightful and amusing read."},{"Title":"Infamous Scribblers: The Founding Fathers and the Rowdy Beginnings of American Journalism","review":"Covering the lies and slanders in US journalism from colonial times through the revolution and Federalist time periods, this book delivers an overview of the major events during these segments of US history. There is little background delivered, just a series of vignettes as Burns chronologically delivers news coverage of the important events of the time.Given the invective inherent in the journalism of the time, I expected a more vibrant work than Mr. Burns provides. For all of our history up to the War of 1812, the US was an untested experiment, and the population split into decidedly rancorous, polar opposite factions, that sometimes violently disagreed with each other. This was when our 2 party system of government was formed and each faction had their own journals, gazettes and newspapers which behaved quite atrociously.Somehow Eric Burns delivers coverage of the events with little or no passion. The result is a remarkably flat read that is quite difficult to get through. This book does sparkle at certain points, particularly with reference to Thomas Jefferson. Burns reveals Jefferson as something of a rogue, a manipulator of people, facts and freedoms. These pages were quite interesting as Burns delivers a Jefferson who is quite human. But the views of the rest of the Founding Fathers are traditional, and, as a result, repetitious of what many, many others have already written.Working as he does, from actual newspaper accounts at the time, replete with the aforementioned published lies and slander, I had hoped he would deliver views of Adams, Morris, Livingston, Washington, Franklin, et al., with more of what he provided for Jefferson: Realism. This was pretty juicy stuff, but no, he simply quotes from 30-40 journals with little or no analysis. The result is a very flat read, one that the author himself does not participate in and one that is repetitious of so many others that it is difficult to stay with."},{"Title":"Infamous Scribblers: The Founding Fathers and the Rowdy Beginnings of American Journalism","review":"Really interesting topic and history, but very dry.

Our friend impressed us with these unusual junxtapositions: scallops in a sauce made from chilis, garlic, lemongrass, and cilantro, corn fritters with creme fraiche, plaintain fritters with olive tampenade, and rich chocolate mousse cake flavored with anise. I had to copy down the recipes and make them for myself straight away to fill the fix I got. When I make people dinner using Sugar Club recipes now, I watch the same thing happen: they are impressed at my skils, shocked by the incredible flavors, and have to have the recipes. The recipes are simple enough that even my kitchen-dyslexic husband can make them on his own, despite some telling you to use charcoals to grill (not easy indoors in the winter) and making your own polenta, etc. But you can easily figure out shortcuts, or in my case, learn to make polenta.

Taken at face value, the recipes are occassionally breathtaking (smoking salmon in tea), but usually just mildly novel. What is good is that new twists are put into well worn dishes(mustard in mashed potato), and it is this that sets the imagination swirling to make your own variant dishes. However, be warned, the ingredients list can be daunting; unless you live in a multi-cultural nirvana you haven't a chance of getting it all (Japanese sauces, chorizo, even kangaroo tail!). On the other hand - you can put the book on a prominent place on your bookshelf and look oh so devastatingly fashionable, sophisticated, and in the know!"},{"Title":"The Sugar Club Cookbook","review":"This is without doubt the best and most inspirational cookbook I have ever had.

Working Kelpies are the work force in Australia's pastoral farming system and should be given their due. By concentrating on the shorter-legged, heavier-coated and basically non-working show dogs, Mr Sloane has doen the forefathers of the Kelpie breed a serious disservice. Having stated all that, the book does contain some fine photographs of show dogs, which , if one likes such dogs, one might find useful."},{"Title":"Australian Kelpie (Rare Breed)","review":"This book offers an excellent technological and pictorial presentation of the Australian Kelpie dog.Unfortunately, there is not much written about the personality, inexhaustiable energy and total devotion to their human masters. This makes it hard for those people who wish to use this book to decide on a kelpie as either a work animal or a family pet. (The Kelpie is brilliant at both.)I think the book is more a manual.

Interesting as far as it goes, but it's pretty much just a cursory overview. There are better books about Wyoming; Larson himself has written some of them."},{"Title":"The Berenstain Bears Accept No Substitutes","review":"If you're like me and you're in your mid-20s, then you probably remember reading Berenstain Bears books when you were a kid. But what some people don't know is that around 1993, Stan and Jan Berenstain decided to add a new division of books in addition to First Time Readers and First Time Books -- Big Chapter Books (in order words, novels). Accept No Substitutes is one of those books, and it is an interesting story about mild-mannered substitute teacher Ms. Barr, who doesn't know that she is going to be the victim of foul play by Too-Tall Grizzly. But soon Brother Bear, Cousin Fred and Barry Bruin get caught up in the \\"fun\\" and wind up playing tricks on Ms. Barr themselves. Things take a turn, however, in the end when the students learn of Ms. Barr's true nature.This is a very good book for kids, but half a star had to be taken off for one character: Barry Bruin. Where exactly did he come from? He is described as being Lizzy Bruin's older brother, but when Lizzy was introduced in The Trouble With Friends, she was an only cub. Now she has a brother all of a sudden? Oh well, this is still a nice book for parents to read to their kids -- or for older kids to read by themselves.Anthony RupertP.S. One more thing that's always bothered me for some reason. Cousin Fred -- whose cousin IS he, anyway? Is that really his name or something? (Refer to The Trouble With Grownups, where a presentation was noted as being performed by Brother Bear, Sister Bear, Cousin Fred and Lizzy Bruin.)"},{"Title":"The Berenstain Bears Accept No Substitutes","review":"When brother bear teams up with too-tall and his gang to try to get rid of their subtitute.

You don't need to have read Autumn to enjoy this as a standalone read, in fact you may even slightly enjoy it more as if you have read Autumn you already know the stages the corpses will go through for the first two thirds of this book. However the downside to reading this without having read Autumn is that two thirds of the way through this book, the surviving main characters from the first novel have a cameo sort of storyline. So you'll know who survives Autumn which would make reading that later a lot less enjoyable. So what I'm trying to say I guess is read the books in order. The City also is a to be continued story, which abruptly stops at a cliff hanger scene telling you to read the next novelAutumn: Purification. It's a good enough series that you'll want to do that, but the to be continued aspect may put off some readers, especially as that fact isn't mentioned anywhere on the cover.In City a few people on their way to, or who have gone in early to work, watch their colleagues and strangers choke to death in front of them. Each is terrified of what has just happened as in their minds they don't know if there is anyone else who has not been affected by this unknown virus, terrorist attack, or whatever has happened. The City revolves around these individuals stories as they eventually decide to go outside where they have sheltered and eventually run into others whose stories you are also reading. Meanwhile some of the corpses in the street are starting to become animated and are stumbling around enhancing the terror of the survivors. Moody never wastes too much time on any one survivor and some we follow for a while and never even revisit (although maybe we do in future novels). There's men, women, office workers, students, a soldier and a lot wider variety of personalities than Moody used in the first novel. The zombies in the Autumn series are a lot more realistic than most others in the genre in that they are pretty harmless, easy to overpower, and fall apart easy, which is a disappointment to some who just want to reread the same flesh/brain eating corpses hunting the living time and time again. I do like this type of undead but I am still puzzled as to why the survivors fear so much something they can easily shoulder charge, or palm off and which even when a survivor's hand is in their mouth don't seem to actually do anything harmful to the humans. They're more like an annoying swarm of flies but I think that's what keeps you wanting to keep reading. With the dead evolving all the time, will they eventually become something the survivors should fear?"},{"Title":"Autumn: The City","review":"In Autumn: The City (follow up to Autumn), a new group of survivors is introduced. With transportation and communication lines down, they're essentially trapped within the city itself. Hiding in offices and other city buildings, they scavenge for food and fight to survive. When a soldier joins their ranks, they finally begin to see a bit of hope on the horizon, but the future of mankind is still uncertain.The human element is such that while we want to believe that hard work and persistence will pay off, no one can deny that stress and limited resources would cause more chaos. The question that comes into play is whether the survivors in Moody's series can get through that and figure out a way to make it through or if they -- and not the dead -- will be their own downfall in the end.The build in this series is interesting. Autumn started in one place with one group of survivors, The City introduces a new set. Without giving anything away, I'm definitely interested to see where the next one will pick up."},{"Title":"Autumn: The City","review":"This was similar to the first book, Autumn, only amped up a few notches. The thing i like most about Mr. Moody's Autumn series is the different take on the zombies. They are Romero-like, slow and frail, but scary and move in large groups, making them extremely dangerous--like swarming piranha, except these undead don't bite, instead they maim, tears, and claw at human flesh. Any horror, zombie, or apocalyptic fan with love these books."},{"Title":"Autumn: The City","review":"I read the first Autumn book while on holiday last year at Centreparcs, a deserted woodland that was just about the perfect place to read it. I enjoyed it, perhaps not as much as I was hoping, but the way that David Moody told a bleak and eerie tale struck a chord with me and I knew that I would have to get around to the sequel when it came out. Well, out it came in January and here I am a few months down the line finally getting around to it! I may not have been in the same surrounding to read Autumn: The City, but not only did I enjoy it more than the first book, I found that it gave me more chills too. Not good while reading it during the early hours of the morning at home, alone...Autumn: The City starts in much the same way as the first book, Autumn, although a short prologue shows that at least some people knew that it was coming as an army unit is ordered to move to a secure bunker, just making it inside in time. From there we follow a handful of people as others around them die suddenly and the world changes in an instant, with very few surviving the event. We see these individuals dealing with life in the aftermath, trying to survive and seek out other survivors, and finally grouping together at the local university. But the cadavers have changed and are no longer simply stumbling around, the new aggression they show can mean nothing good for the survivors. And then there is the army, coming out from its bunker to see what state the world is in, and finding it worse than even they imagined.Unlike the first novel Moody doesn't take his time in exploring the death event and the immediate aftermath, from mass death to the re-animation of the corpses, in too great detail, but instead does all of this in a smoother and quicker fashion. We still get a good look at how these people are trying to cope and survive, but it isn't a day-by-day thing, more of a general look at their lives over a longer period - it works much better as it doesn't bog the story down in mundane and boring events. This has a knock-on effect to the story as Moody has covered the time period of the first novel by the time we reach the half-way point, and then we get into new and more interesting territory, seeing how the behaviour of the dead changes as more time passes. It also allows him to follow up on the fates of Michael and Emma from the first book who make a welcome return to the story, keeping that story thread going.Other than these two returning characters there are quite a few more to follow. With a few dozen holed up at the university Moody is able to select those that we follow, and each brings something different to the story. Moody uses the characters to great effect in Autumn: The City, telling the story through their eyes and their reactions as things start to changed. It works well, but I didn't find that any particular character stood out for me, rather they all had interesting stories and acted in a way I would expect. I was slightly annoyed by the two young men who wanted to find a pub/club and have one final night on the town, but when the end of the world comes I'm sure there will be people like that about.Story-wise there really isn't too much I could tell you that you won't have seen from lots of zombie movies that are out there, but Moody has a talent for making you feel part of events. The descriptions he uses can be chilling and eerie, completely vivid and all too real. The novel does end rather abruptly, and it's one of the main issues I had with it. Autumn was fairly self-contained, but this sequel is clearly written as part of a larger story, one I'm very much looking forward to reading.Autumn: The City is a step up from the first book and a novel I very much enjoyed. While many zombie stories tend to follow a similar path David Moody has shown that just because the idea is old it doesn't mean it can't be re-told, and in this case with great success!"},{"Title":"Autumn: The City","review":"Autumn: The City, was written by David Moody and published by St Martin's Griffin in 2011.As a deadly airborne pathogen tears through the city, few are left unscathed by its harrowing and catastrophic effects.

At first they are useless. Tripping over their own feet, and walking into walls, but they soon begin to regain their basic abilities and eventually only want one thing...You.Autumn: The City is the second book in the four part saga. After reading the first book, Autumn, I was immediately hooked. David Moody has an incredible writing style and knows how to bring the horror and the suspense in full force. He also introduces fascinating characters that you will be rooting for throughout the whole book. As a big fan of Michael and Emma from Autumn I was pleased that they made a return in this book and was curious to see if and how they would mesh with the other survivor's. It is hard to review this book without giving away spoilers. Short and sweet...This book is awesome!I love Zombie books, stories and movies, but David Moody brings it all on a completely different level. He knows how to deliver a haunting scenario and knows how to get the goosebumps to rise. There is a perfect balance between the very well told story, and the captivating characters. Like the first book, the intensity and suspense is almost unbearable. You'll be flying though the pages. I can't wait to get my hands on book 3 and to see how the story unfolds. David Moody has made it onto my favourite author's list and the Autumn Series is definitely on my favourite books list!The Autumn series should not be missed! You don't even need to be a big fan of Zombies, if you enjoy a great, suspenseful story and likable characters, then pick up this series!What I loved: The cover. The writing style. And pretty much, everything else.What I disliked: That it ended, and I now have to wait for the next book :-)"},{"Title":"Autumn: The City","review":"This book was fantastic! Fast-paced, a vivid, rich descriptive style and I can't recall a single dull moment in its pages. I was skeptic at first only because the zombies in David Moody's books do not 'eat' humans (at least not in this book) and I thought that stray from tradition would be too extreme, but I was wrong. David Moody easily pulled it off and kept me 100% invested from start to finish. I admit, I did not realize this was the second book in the series - just picked it up at Barnes & Noble on a whim - but now I'll have to read the first one for sure! I also need to say that I was thoroughly impressed with David Moody's ability to continuously describe 'the dead' (movements, smell, etc.) without ever once overusing a single word or phrase. To some, that might not seem so impressive, but after you've read it you might understand more where I'm coming from."},{"Title":"Autumn: The City","review":"Donna Yorke is reporting for the early shift at her office when her fellow co-worker is overcome by a strange coughing fit. This annoying symptom quickly turns into a bloody, choking convulsion that kills her in minutes. After trying unsuccessfully to help several colleagues who are experiencing the same symptoms, she moves the bodies to a far-off section of the office. Afraid to leave not knowing what she'll face outside, Donna gathers supplies and holds up in her small office with a sleeping bag, some snacks from the vending machine, and a flashlight to ward off the dark.On the other side of the city, Jack Baxter is hiding in his home when he makes the fateful decision to leave his refuge hoping to find other survivors. He does --- a young girl named Clare, who lost her parents to the disease. Together they make their way into the city center. After spending a comfortable night in a department store, they make a gruesome discovery --- the corpses are moving on their own.When Jack and Clare hear a car, they take it as a sign of life. Not only do they find two survivors, they are told there is a group of about 50 people living at the local university. The university has become a beacon for not only survivors but also the dead who surround the place. Drawn to the living, the re-animated corpses flock there. In a few short days, the rather sedate corpses become violent, attacking survivors venturing out and stalking out places where the living are congregating.Soon after, a soldier left behind after a failed mission into the city joins up with the university group. Knowing that the food supplies are running low, a decision is made by the survivors to make their way to the military base in the hope of finding supplies and others who have made it. What they don't count on is how the dead will react to the movement.I wasn't sure if I should refer to this book as apocalyptic or zombie fiction. As far as the survivors are concerned, it's the end of the world they know. Then again, it's also a story full of the walking dead (though I was appreciative that the word \\"zombie\\" is never mentioned). Reminding me of Richard Matheson's I AM LEGEND, it manages to evoke a loneliness that feels surprisingly genuine. Author David Moody doesn't get bogged down in details, which is refreshing. Why should I know what's going on when none of the survivors do? I enjoyed the sense of lawlessness and the unknown Moody created, and he didn't deviate, which can be so tempting in a story like this one. Leaving the reader with restricted knowledge made it interesting to imagine what would have caused the metamorphosis.This isn't a book for everyone. While it's not gross or disgusting, you won't want to read it while you're eating. And it does contain a few scenes that reminded me of a popular zombie movie. But if you're willing to look past this, AUTUMN: THE CITY is a fast and entertaining read.--- Reviewed by Amy Gwiazdowski"},{"Title":"Autumn: The City","review":"this book introduces us to new survivors who are hiding out in a medical school and of course the governement rears its ugly head as well. moody also incorporates the two main characters from autumn into the story in a way that doesnt lull us to sleep. the pregnant woman, finding transport vans, the bar scene and finding safety at the end is some of the best reading i have came across lately. looking forward to thrid book in this series."},{"Title":"Autumn: The City","review":"The morning started just like any other for Donna Yorke.

Donna rushes to the window and watches from the 9th floor as the city erupts in chaos, with people dropping to the ground dead in their tracks.

In \\"Autumn\\", the story follows three survivors as they leave city, trying to find some place safe, where the possibility of running into the walking dead is very slim. \\"Autumn: The City\\" begins with the same events, but sticks with the story of those who remained in the city. Whereas the first had wide open spaces with the walking dead almost hidden from view until the last moment, in this novel, you can't escape from them because they are all around, cluttering and blocking the streets, forming herds that react to any little movement or sound. The psychological effects of seeing such a huge mass with its sole aim to quench its hunger with anything living weigh differently on each of the characters, adding real human qualities with which the reader can connect.I also like that Moody mixes the side story of the characters from the first novel, having them cross paths with this new set of characters makes this apocalyptic world even more believable. It will be interesting to read how the two different sets of characters interact in the next book.Oh, and not once is the word \\"zombie\\" used, but the reader still understands exactly what the survivors are up against.\\"Autumn: The City\\" is a fast-paced, compelling story, another great addition to the zombie genre."},{"Title":"Autumn: The City","review":"As always, David Moody paints the picture of the end of humanity more vividly and clearly than anyone else dares attempt.

This book is hard to put down - when you get to the last 20 pages, you just want it to go on, and on, and on... Shame that David's Autumn series is not able to be purchased at book stores in Australia though, which means you have to pay a LOT OF MONEY for one book - BUT the books are Totally Worth It!!!! I LOVE the Autumn series, and cannot wait to purchase the next books in his Autumn series!"},{"Title":"Autumn: The City","review":"\\"Autmn:The City\\" is the second book in the \\"Autumn\\" series. You really wouldn't have to read the first to enjoy this book. I starts at the same time as the first just with different characters. I would recommend reading the first though. It gets a little more in depth with the day the world died.In my review of the first book I talked about the absence of hard-core Zombie gore. These books are not Splatterpunk. They are character driven stories that focus on the humans coping with the end of the world as they know it. The Zombies are somewhat secondary to the story. I guess that is why I only gave 3 stars. Don't get me wrong the atmosphere of these books is very eerie and tense. The book is very well written, but there isn't enough gore for my tastes. This is just my opinion of course, I am going to read all 5 books.The story follows new charaters from the first book for the most part. The setting is in a more urban area, hence the title \\"The City\\", which means a higher concentration of Zombies. The desperate situation the characters are in keeps the feeling tense throughout the book. there are a moments that make you feel hope and moments that you feel sadness with the characters. I had a more emotional reaction with this book than the first.There are more personalities in this book. Like the everyday world some work together and some clash. The hopelessness of the situation magnifies the tension between the survivors. The appearance of the military also causes mistrust betweeen the survivors and soldiers.I thought this book had more action than the first. I also found some moments in this book somewhat shocking, although mild for my tastes. Remember this is book 2 in a series of 5 so the end is not the end. I am reading the 3rd book now and enjoying it very much."},{"Title":"Autumn: The City","review":"I am a great fan of zombie and post apocalyptic horror and have read many books of the genres. However the Autumn series blows them all away. From the very beginning I was totally engrossed and completely ignored all that was going on around me to find out the fates of the very well written characters. These books are well paced and not hurried, the story telling is powerful and the visions described vivid. These books deserve much more attention and praise then it seems they are getting. I discovered them by chance on Amazon. There is also a website (infected books) with more info.David Moody has written a masterpiece of a series and I would love to congratulate him for it. David, if you read this I think your work is bloody brilliant."},{"Title":"Autumn: The City","review":"Taking into account how much I enjoyed David Moody's Autumn, a post-apocalyptic tale of the walking dead in the UK, I was genuinely concerned about whether its sequel Autumn: The City, would measure up, especially in the knowledge that after this sequel, there are still a number of titles remaining in the Autumn series...Although a sequel, Autumn: The City runs almost concurrently to the timeline of Autumn and introduces us to further characters within the universe that Moody has created as well as some familiar survivors from the first instalment in the series. This is not to say that this work is simply a recap or indeed treading old ground; in fact, I would suggest that Autumn: The City is quite different to its predecessor. This difference is not a bad thing by any stretch of the imagination and to my mind, is akin to the difference between Ridley Scott's Alien and James Cameron's Aliens; the former being a claustrophobic, atmospheric horror and the latter being an action horror of superior calibre. That is not to say that Autumn: The City can simply be pigeon-holed as such.Again, Moody is in no rush to tell his story; and this addition to his Autumn universe sees a larger group and how they are coping with the undead menace baying at their doors...As in Autumn, Moody's undead continue to evolve much to the alarm of his protagonists. Along with their evolution comes the inevitable degradation of their physical state, which the author narrates incredibly effectively with his compelling prose which is quite graphic when describing decaying, diseased flesh. As opposed to Autumn, Moody does not spend as much time in The City dealing with the immediate aftermath of the unspecified pandemic and moves his story along from the time period occupied by Autumn.I always try to be as objective as possible when considering books and an issue that I always try and deal with when tackling a sequel is whether or not the book can stand alone. This is a difficult matter with Autumn: The City, since it occupies the same timeline as its predecessor and so, yes, I would suggest that Autumn: The City, can be read without any knowledge of Autumn. However, I am of the opinion that the reader's experience will only be enhanced by reading the novels in the sequence in which the author intended. I have read books out of turn before and regretted it. Learn from my mistakes!Like its predecessor, Autumn: The City is a short, punchy read at sub 300 pages; is very well-written and it will take you no time at all to consume; and with the knowledge that there are further books in the Autumn series to read, Autumn: The City admirably advances Moody's tale of post-apocalyptica and the walking dead and has an ending left wide-open for the next title in the series."},{"Title":"Autumn: The City","review":"I've read the first two books now and planning to continue.

This book I just couldn't seem to love and my eyes kept wandering from the page, I thought that it was very impersonal as alot of characters were introduced with some having a back story but most were just names and also a few were introduced then never mentioned again so I couldn't get into it. And alot of just pushing the dead away seemed to do the trick of escaping even though the sheer volumes of dead would overwhelm you even if they were weak, everyone just had no trouble getting from A to B and no nail biting, oh my god are they going to escape, moments happened for me. Not a bad book just not as good as the first."},{"Title":"Autumn: The City","review":"The pandemic virus was so contagious, over 99% of mankind died in under twenty-four hours. Civilization was over and the few humans to survive had no time to mourn their losses as a few days later the dead began to ruse. Some fortunate people escaped the city (see Autumn) though unsure where to go.However, not all were able to leave. Those trapped inside the city have little hope as the streets swarm with the walking undead who \\"live\\" to rip human flesh apart. Donna York hid under a desk during the brutal first forty-eight hours. Jack the warehouse worker stayed home after he observed oddness on the bus and saw his elderly neighbor. Clare the student meets Jack when she enters his home seeking shelter. Paul hid in the music store where he worked. They begin to meet other survivors like Michael and Cooper. These few unfortunate knows their only prayer is to run a gauntlet through aggressive killers in order to reach an underground military bunker that Cooper says is their salvation; not knowing whether the military remains in control inside of it.This is an action-packed exciting Z thriller (don't use that Z word with the Autumn tales) as the few remaining humans trapped inside the city struggle through a deadly path to reach their only chance to survive. The story line is fast-paced with the early chapters before everyone converges displaying some of the fears each possesses of the unknown and more so of the known. Although David Moody never digs deeper into the emotional defense mechanisms mentally deployed to control a wide variety of psychological issues such as survivor guilt and seeing friends and family change into mindless killers, fans will enjoy the escapades of those fleeing for their lives with the Undead everywhere ready to pounce.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Autumn: The City","review":"David Moody's take on the old zombie stereotype comes from a very different direction than typical American, Romero style zombie fiction. His story focuses on developing the plot line, and pulling the reader into the characters, not on mindless gore. If you are fan of the genre, or looking for a good horror read - pick this one up. The first story in the series \\"Autumn\\" is always offered as a free e-book on his website. That's all it will take to get you hooked."},{"Title":"Autumn: The City","review":"I bought this book thinking it was an adition to the autumn book line, it says first printing. I guess i need to pay closer attention because it is a reprint of the first book by a new publisher. Ripped off. I will not buy anything by this publisher again."},{"Title":"Autumn: The City","review":"After reading the original Autumn, I couldn't wait for the sequel. You just have to know what happens to the characters. You HAVE to know. It eats away at you until you do!David Moody is a very talented writer, and I recommend anything he has written."},{"Title":"Autumn: The City","review":"If you were like me you read David Moody's first novel Autumn and were excited about the novel to follow: Autumn: The City. The book is bad I don't know where to start. Probably my biggest disappointment is in Moody's zombies. They are NOT a threat. They stumble along in almost as slowly as the pace of the book. And the book is SLLLLLLLOOOOOOWWWWWWW! The zombie threat is only in numbers. But they are NOT aggressive. Perhaps Moody is saving the good stuff for the 3rd book. I can only hope so, as I was stupid and bought books 2 and 3 together.Do yourself a favor and SKIP this one."},{"Title":"Autumn: The City","review":"In David Moody's follow-up to the acclaimed zombie novel, Autumn, we are introduced to several new characters. Donna Yorke is an office worker who went in early on that fateful morning when all the world seemed to collapse into utter desolation. Paul Castle was also at work when everyone around him died horrible deaths. Jack Baxter was coming home from work when the apparent disease hit. After hiding out in his home for several days, he ventured out into the vastly changed city where he meets up with Clare, a young girl who helplessly sat and watched her father die and has endured alone on the street while watching the dead rise again. Meanwhile, Doctor Croft and several others have found some comfort and safety hiding within a university accommodation block.Cooper is a member of the military who has spent weeks in a secret base, hidden from the goings-on of the outside world. When he is ordered to emerge from the base to obtain a status report along with several others, what he finds is more appalling than anyone from that tucked away sanctuary had surmised. When Cooper's military reconnaissance troop leaves him behind, he eventually meets up with the group living within the college dormitories and they all quickly turn to him for some semblance of hope.However, Emma and Michael, from the previous novel, also make an appearance. Since leaving the farmhouse, the two have been on the run in a motor home, seeking safety. When they come across the military vehicles entering and exiting the nearby hidden base, they decide to find a way into the shelter. It should be noted that these two do not show up until almost halfway through the novel.Though still just as intriguing as the previous novel, I found many parts to be rather slow. In addition, it was both interesting and tedious to read about the whole ordeal all over again. I found reading about the death and disease from different viewpoints to be a fascinating way to begin the novel. Yet, it also seemed rather redundant in many respects for those who have read the previous novel to have to re-hash the previous occurrences. That does, however, enable people who have not read the novels predecessor to pick up this book without having missed much at all. Furthermore, Moody's zombies don't seem to have evolved much more in this book than they had in the previous one. Throughout the first novel, the risen dead are in constant flux, becoming more and more attuned to their surroundings and evolving ever-so-slightly with each passing day. In Autumn: The City, there seems to be little progression in this respect. Autumn: The City doesn't take the opportunity to build very much off of the foundation laid by it's predecessor.It should also be noted that this is not a series in which you will find lots of action and gore. The scares and drama found herein are much more subtle. However, that is not to say that these books are any less worthy of a read. They are simply geared less towards the in-your-face splatter horror audience.Though I didn't find this novel as enthralling as the first, I will still go on to read Autumn: Purification. Despite some minor qualms, I still highly recommend this series to anyone who is a fan of zombie fiction."},{"Title":"Autumn: The City","review":"David Moody, Autumn: The City (Infected Books, 2003)David Moody's Autumn Quartet continues on with The City, a book that starts out concurrently to Autumn. Don't expect to see your dysfunctional heroes from that book for a while, unfortunately; you've got a new crop of characters to think about here.This is an ensemble piece, more than the last book was; there can't be said to be any real main character. There's a ragtag band of survivors who start off apart, mostly, but come together piece by piece. There's also a military installation who sally forth now and again to try and assess the situation, two of whose members get left behind during one mission. And, eventually, a few folks from the first novel show up, so we come full circle.The book suffers a bit from middle-novel syndrome (Autumn was, remember, originally envisioned as a trilogy); we have new characters, but the basic situation is the same, and this isn't helped by the fact that we know what's in store for the first half or so of this book, having read the first novel. It picks up once the timeline merges with the end of the first book, and the ending was the strongest section of the book (it got me to pick up Purification immediately to find out what was coming next). So the series flags a bit, but a slow start leads to a strong finish. Don't give up halfway through. ***"},{"Title":"Autumn: The City","review":"I was a fan of the first Autumn book so I quickly bought this and the 3rd book Purification. I figured that the first book was basically a setup, a quiet before the real storm. Perhaps my expecations were too high for blood and gore and gruesome deaths because this series really isn't about all of that. Sure, its descriptive when it comes to the decaying zombies and what the world has become. But if you're looking for some Romero-style attacks, gore, killings, this series comes up a little short.The City introduces us to some new characters since the first book, which is cool as you get to experience the zombie rising all over gain from completely different perspectives. Thankfully, our heroes from the fist book reappear, even if as a subplot.What's good about City is the descriptive outlook of the city and the surrounding areas. Reading various people's reactions is interesting and things move at a solid pace.What's not as good is that Moody loves to bog down the story in generic reactions (How many times can a character react the same, angry way to the situation?) and the story grinds to a halt at times as we wait for the characters who will fight to weed through all the whining and complaining of those who won't. Certainly its necessary to show all the reactions, but we got the point the first 7 times someone said \\"What's the point?\\"If you enjoyed the first book, you're probably going to go for this one as well. And if you go that far, you'll want to find out what happens in Purification (a decent, if not thrilling, conclusion)."},{"Title":"Autumn: The City","review":"The book is the sequel to David Moody's excellent, deliberately slow-paced Autumn novel which set the stage for his trilogy.Moody has us follow the patch of several groups of survivors in modern-day England after the outbreak of a terrifyingly fast virus that killed billions of people in seconds, without anybody knowing its origin or its purpose. The group of \\"countryside\\" survivors that we got to know in Autumn is featured in this sequel again. It gets back to the City it originally fled from and gets to merge with another group of survivors that got trapped in a university somewhere in the City -hence the book's name.Moody is keeps delivering a number of messages to the reader in his book, just as he did in the first, and will be doing in the third (Autumn, Purification).First, the countryside is no ideal place to hide and enhance the chances of survival when faced with a mutating enemy that relies primarily on sound detection, and gets increasingly \\"articulated\\". Out there in the open, while silence may be soothing, it may also become the deadliest betrayer too as any sound will act as magnet to those stench-generating masses.Second, the Army is shown in its full \\"splendor\\", ie a mixture of immature conditioning in the face of unplanned threats, and power -when used and organized to take benefit of its very conditioning. Unlike in many other zombie books, the army is not depicted as a \\"yet-another-enemy-from-within\\" party. It features good as well as hopeless guys too, just like in the outside. The survivors get to benefit from the army without giving them anything in return, as we would have anticipated normally.Third, the most intellectually \\"enlightened\\" characters of the bunch have no clue about what's happened to the world. Reciprocally, the army's might is barely sufficient to inflict any kind of substantial damage to their \\"total enemy\\", the rotting crowd. In other words, neither sheer intelligence nor brute force is a real asset in ensuring self-preservation. What we see clearly in Moody's depiction is the intrinsic value of constant adaptation. Those who can't adapt, don't make it alive.Pretty good messages I thought. Sounds good to you too? Then read on.Another finesse of Moody's work is the way the sick bodies evolve. In the first book, they were dumb, inarticulated, helpless, but moving towards the end to the beginning of a rational thought process translating into coordinated actions (banging on the walls, moving to a specific location. Aggressiveness was also starting to show.In Autumn, the City, aggressiveness becomes the driving factor behind the rotten crowd's actions, making it each day more dangerous and difficult for the survivors to stay alive. This adds another, very effective layer of anxiousness, as the survivors cave in in makeshift shelters for extended periods of times without necessarily being aware of the extent of the dead bodies' mutation outside. That makes for interesting encounters when they finally all meet together again.But still, the author still has not used the name \\"Zombie\\" a single time in this second book, making the pathetic living-deads not so evil after all. And we still don't know what caused this mayhem in the first place, will we ever find out? People we get attached too just die of stupid death (car accidents etc.), so who's going to be the next one? Also, what the hell are the living-deads doing when they get onto living survivors? Do they eat them? Do they just kill them as the result of hate, jealousy, something else? Will we, here again, know at all in the end? All of these very effective narrative and plot techniques are very good at keeping the reader glued to the book, wishing for the end (of the book!) not to come too fast."},{"Title":"Autumn: The City","review":"Not the most technically sound writing in publication but very far from the worst. For zombie fans, there really is no such thing as a bad zombie story, but David Moody's work really is something special. Its not your run of the mill flesh eating frenzy type of story and that's refreshing. The Autumn novel's power resides not in their ability to disgust or in the description of violence, but in the psychological despair and utter hopelessness that would be felt by the survivors of a zombie apocalypse. Very emotional, very disturbing, utterly wonderful."},{"Title":"Autumn: The City","review":"A thrilling end of the world story with promise. It was satisfying and a page turner. Look forward to reading the series."},{"Title":"Autumn: The City","review":"I purchased this book and was glued to it until I finished it. And once I finished it, I was sad. I wish there were more. I also purchased the dvd but didn't enjoy that as much as the books. Stick to the books. If you love zombie books, you will definitely love this book. I recommend to anyone who loves zombies."},{"Title":"Autumn: The City","review":"I found the first book in this series to be strangely compelling, and I found this one for 3 bucks, so I thought I'd give it a shot. I wish I had not.This book was extremely boring. The author went to great lengths to try to make the bodies appear threatening, but I did not buy it. The idea was that, individually the bodies were weak and easily knocked aside, but they were amassing in huge numbers, which made them a threat. The author explained in great detail (over, and over, and over, etc.) why they were amassing in such numbers and why that made them a threat. (Because they are attracted to noise and apparently living humans, simply by being alive, are noisy. They are also attracted to fire, apparently, which you'd think might help cull their numbers a bit, but I digress.)I have this problem where I'm not really all that bad at math. I kept wondering where all the rest of the survivors were. If \\"over 98%\\" of the population was killed, that leaves somewhere between one and two percent of the population alive somewhere. Last time I checked, there were around 60 million people in Great Britain, not counting foreign students, tourists, migrant workers and the like. That means between 600,000 to 1,200,000 people would have survived. If almost a million people were scattered around the island, presumably at least some of the bodies would be attracted to each of them as well, because being alive is noisy.After \\"over 98%\\" of the population dropped dead, \\"about 1/3\\" of them got up again and started shambling. That means there were about 20 million bodies wandering around, give or take. We are told that some of them were trapped in buildings or cars, some of them wandered off cliffs or into rivers or the ocean, some of them undoubtedly would have burned up in some of the numerous building fires. The three survivors ran over some of them with their cars in book one, and many more were run over by military vehicles and cars in this book. Also, many bodies are crushed and mutilated by the press of bodies behind them all trying to squeeze into the same place. Oh yeah, and they tear each other apart occasionally. Not to mention the \\"thousands\\" that were lured into a burning building by Donna, which was the only sensible thing anyone did in the story so far.Presumably the bodies are not capable of reproducing in their quasi-dead state. Survivors do not even turn into roaming bodies if they are bitten (in fact, the bodies do not seem to bite. They simply try to grab you to death.) Also presumably, the other hundreds of thousands of survivors around the island would also be running them over with cars and whatnot. The numbers would have to be constantly dropping.So, getting rid of them would be tedious to be sure, messy absolutely, but not really scary.Obviously, I do not recommend this book. It made my head hurt."},{"Title":"Autumn: The City","review":"This is a top notch series. It is post apocalyptic lit (dare I use that word?), not strictly zombie horror. Don't get me wrong, the zombies are horrifying, but this is less focused on detailing zombie violence than other series. This is more about characters' reactions to the zombie violence, and less about gore. So if all you want is gore and violence you won't like the parts of the story that advance the overall plot of how mankind reacts and how we survive. But if you want to know the answers to these two questions, keep reading !"},{"Title":"Autumn: The City","review":"I was a little unsure before I bought this book...not exactly a book a 65 year old grandma might read. I thought the price is right, why not try it. It actually was good. It's amazing how a group of people worked togetherto survive the \\"zombies\\". Well worth reading....give it a try....also sequels."},{"Title":"Autumn: The City","review":"This book was a worth while read. After I finished the first book I had to read this one. Unfortunitly, it wasn't better than the first one. I didnt like how the book started from the begining again in other peoples point of view, but still a worth while read!"},{"Title":"Autumn: The City","review":"This book was much, much better than \\"Autumn.\\" This story had better character development (Altho, it still could have used more depth to the folks we're supposed to care about. But, still an improvement). And there was much less of folks sitting around talking and talking and talking about what they should be doing instead of doing something. I liked how we revisited the main characters from the first book. And the zombies were scary, except they didn't bite. Still, this was a great improvement and I'd be interested in reading the books that followed. This book had a good ending too. It was satisfying."},{"Title":"Autumn: The City","review":"AUTUMN, THE CITY, takes us back to the City in AUTUMN and introduces us to not only new characters but explains the outbreak from their perspective. Cleverly done by MR MOODY, is the fact that this novel runs parallel to the first.The realism is still there, the believable characters and devoid of gratuitous violence that some novels seem to revel in, the psychological horror is far more realistic. Moody is fast becoming one of the genres rising stars and this novel will not disappoint.Cannot wait to read the third instalment.AutumnAutumn: PurificationDog BloodHater"},{"Title":"Autumn: The City","review":"This novel is a sequel to David Moody's Autumn that I previously review. This novel follows the same premise as the novel Autumn. In minutes about 99.5 percent of the population of a British city is dead. The few survivors that remain watched everyone around them suddenly choke on their own blood and suffocate to death. Millions upon million of people lay dead in the street, in their offices, and homes. This novel however follows more than just a mere three survivors. This novel follows a whole new set of survivors as the disease strikes and what they do to survive until they all meet up together. Emma and Michael, from the first novel also makes an appearance. One of the drawbacks of Autumn was it only followed three survivors. I enjoyed the fact this novel took on more people's perspectives.I am going to finish this review with the exact same things I said about the first book in the series with the title changed. \\"I really enjoyed Autumn: The City but when I call the novel bleak I'm not kidding. It's so depressing you just start to wonder why the survivors don't just go ahead and kill themselves. Autumn: The City is the second in the series so the open-ended ending didn't bother me too much. Although almost the entire population drops dead this is not a blood and guts type of thriller it's more a cerebral thriller that keeps you asking the question \\"what would you do if all your options pretty much sucked?\\""},{"Title":"Autumn: The City","review":"If you like easy read, all plot, no character books about zombies then this is for you. If instead you like a book with characters you care about, empathize with, or can in any way relate to, stay away. With so many great models out there in film, literature, video games, and comics (28 Days Later, I Am Legend (book and film), The Walking Dead (comic and tv series), almost any Resident Evil (the video game, not the movie), The Road, to name a few, it's amazing that someone could create a book so void of any tension, horror, or excitement. Anyone who's read The Stand felt in their bones the terror of escaping a city of corpses. And King's corpses weren't even stumbling back to life. Moody has a city full of corpses and there is nothing terrifying about them. Yes, he paints a fair image of thousands upon thousands of dead acting as a single minded entity, but unless that single minded entity is going to kill someone, it's not so scary. And yes, NOBODY died as a result of reanimated corpse attack. There were two forgettable characters in the end whose death was implied, but that was as far as it went. If you're looking for terror, if you're looking for an exploration of how humanity is transformed / challenged when 99% of the population disappears, if you're looking for some classic survival horror, run far, far away from this shambling mess of a book. It's a decent first draft, but it should have NEVER made it to print in its current state."},{"Title":"Autumn: The City","review":"The writing style here is just terrible. Someone needs to sit this author down and explain to him the meaning of \\"show, don't tell.\\" Also, lots of his sentences are awkwardly worded or packed full of totally irrelevant details. There are also some grammar mistakes and typos. The writing style is simplistic overall, and the same phrases and descriptive words are used over and over.The characters are flat and boring. We don't get much in the way of backstory for any of them, and none of them seem to have any real personality. I didn't care about any of these people.The book also isn't scary and doesn't really provide any tense moments. The walking dead are virtually harmless- they're extremely weak and easily pushed out of the way. The only people who end up being killed by them are two guys who purposefully commit suicide.Let me give you some examples of what I'm talking about:When one character finds his friend and fellow survivor dead, he just says, \\"Well, it's too late for him. The poor f***er's done for.\\" Seriously? Who would ever say this upon finding their friend dead? In the next paragraph, we're TOLD that the character feels \\"sadness,\\" but he sure doesn't act like it, and the death is never even mentioned again by anyone.Also, there are several instances where a member of the walking dead is referred to as \\"obnoxious.\\" Really? I don't think \\"obnoxious\\" is the word I'd use to describe a REANIMATED ROTTING CORPSE. But I guess it sort of fits here, with these totally non-threatening zombies.Overall, the book is just incredibly boring. The characters are boring, the zombies are boring, and the events are boring. To top it all off, the ending is really abrupt and unsatisfying- none of the important questions are answered, and we don't truly find out what will become of the survivors that we've been following throughout the book."},{"Title":"Autumn: The City","review":"Have read both books. Love them. I really respect the way these zombies are different. They re-animate differently and don't seem like a huge pack of rabid dogs from the beginning. The writer gives them a more human quality, and has more to talk about the morality of killing them because of it. This is not just a gash and slash blood fest. It is a zombie book, but it develops the characters very well. Will there be a 3? I hope so."},{"Title":"Autumn: The City","review":"Not a review (hence my average rating), but a question about the pricing of the Kindle version of this title and the one following it.Autumn: $12.48 (paperback $11.19)Autumn: The City: $41.64 (paperback $6)Autumn: Purification: $31.22 (paperback $10.19)If it wasn't for this bizarre pricing structure I would have already purchased the Kindle versions of The City and Purification after enjoying Autumn."},{"Title":"Autumn: The City","review":"I work in a Hastings store in the USA, I was stocking some books one day and as an avid zombie lover, I read the back cover, I decided to come back after work and by the book as I would get a good discount anyway.

As such, the book has a number of problems: it's too short to say much; it's erratic in that some chapters have a nice amount of detail and others are just a page or two long; the writing style varies from pretty good to annoying.Most people seem to be able to write well about their own experiences, whether they are professional authors or not. You can see glimmers of that here, but it's not consistent. These wartime memoirs are best written in the first decade or two after the war. Beyond that the story just doesn't seem fresh, and parts of this book show that symptom.That said, the subject is an interesting and somewhat neglected one; although there are other books out on these small planes and their pilots they're expensive and hard to find.If you're at all curious about this aspect of WW2, you'll enjoy reading through this, but I recommend you check it out of a library or find a used copy cheap. I did not find it to be a \\"keeper\\"."},{"Title":"Grasshopper Pilot: A Memoir","review":"The stories of the air war in Europe and Japan have concentrated on the stories of mighty bombers going off to bomb Germany or Japan and of sleek, fast, agile fighters defending Britain or the bombers. Bill Cummings did it differently. He flew a 'Grasshopper' the military version of the Piper Cub - 65 glorious horsepower (finally expanded to a mighty 100 hp).His story begins with being fascinated with flying as a kid and learning how to fly before WW II started. With 60+ hours of flying time, and an ROTC commission as a second lieutenant he was getting ready to put in for the air corp when a notice came down that all the officers who had sixty hours or more of private flying were to put in for flight training. Suddenly he was a military pilot.His military career took him to North Africa, Sicily, Italy and finally to the Philippines. Most of the time he flew in one plane, 'Maggie the Faithful,' 485 missions. His story is quite a different one from the usual Army 'I was there' book.

It is a great collection for young pianists to learn performing pieces and the music is just so much fun for the whole family to gather around and sing and just listen to. The pieces are mostly early American traditional songs, but some lighter classical pieces are included as well.I think part of what makes this collection so enjoyable is that Maxwell Eckstein did a wonderful job of arranging them simply but still prettily.

It seems a good intro to the Dzogchen view for Westerners since it covers the whole path from the preliminary motivation to the pointing out the nature of mind view that is at the heart of Dzogchen. It is consistently engaging, practical (clearly points out the view and presents a couple of basic meditation exercises related to the tradition, to help us get a direct glimpse) and readable (short, to the point chapters), and Mr. Low (a long time English Buddhist and psychotherapist) has a few funny moments. I especially liked, \\"Buddhism is not a humanistic viewpoint. It doesn't have humans as the center of the universe. It puts awareness at the center of the universe, and those who are not aware are called humans.\\"My main (small) complaint would be that he sometimes uses a lot of words when a few would do (but this is a retreat transcript), and seems a bit self promoting (as he several times mentions classical Tibetan teachings in reference to an earlier collection of translations he published). Yet he is also, as a Western lineage holder, more accessible than many traditional Tibetan teachers.

There is not a single line in these 160 pages that one can omit!I found James Low's talks illuminating, penerating, and enlightening. One gets a crystal clear glimpse of the original naked presence of the true nature of our mind. All the keys to this primordial state are handed over quite casually and effortlessly. From preliminary practices to all the way to \\"experiencing\\" the true nature of mind, the instructions are presented in a manner suitable for the modern audience. The author has studied Tibetan Buddhism for last 30 years and it shows. Quite an amazing feat. Million Thanks Venerable Dr. James Low.In Buddhism, a great emphasis is placed on having the right \\"view\\"--a deep understanding of the way the things really are. Right \\"view\\" in the final reckoning is about having no view at all, obtaining freedom from our mind's habitual tendency of concept-making.For:Existence and non-existence are extremes,Purity and impurity are extremes as well,Thus, having relinquished both extremes,The wise do not dwell even in the middle.~King of Samdhi StraSince:No doer of the deeds is found,No one who ever reaps their fruits;Empty phenomena roll on,Dependent on conditions all.~VisuddhimaggaAfterall,There is neither creation, nor destruction,Neither destiny, nor freewill.Neither path nor achievement--This is the final truth!~Ramana Maharshi, from Nine Stray Verses, Collected Works, p. 138.That being so, what should one do, what is the right way to be?Since everything is but an illusion,Perfect in being what it is,Having nothing to do with good or bad,Acceptance or rejection,One might as well burst out laughing!~The Great Perfection's Self-Liberation in the Nature of Mind, chapter 1Although, these quotes are not from this book, but reading this book \\"evokes\\" such feelings. In the ultimate Dzogchen view, reality is perfect as is--in its stark nakedness; we can't do anything to make it more so. Actually, if we try, it will be like \\"legging the snake.\\" Afterall, how can one make real what is already real. As they say, if you add to truth, you actually subtract from it! A simple recognition of this fact is all that is needed. Simply Be! Even \\"simply\\" seems extra. Be! (as you truly are: anaadi,anannt, akhannda SatChitAnannd)This little gem of a book needs to be thoroughly \\"chewed and inwardly digested\\"--with a tip of the hat to Francis Bacon--by all serious students of Dzogchen. Of all the books on Dzogchen that i have read, this little volume comes closest, imho, in communicating the feeling of the real thing re the practice of Dzogchen.Dear Ven.

They were the natural order of things -- and yet the English executed Charles I and abolished the monarchy and the Valois-Bourbon civil war threatened to overturn the monarchy in France.

This bomb destroyed all human, and most animal life, on the planet. The only reason that Denis Grafton and his friends survived was that they were abducted by the alien Vulcanoids prior to the accidental extermination. They were returned to the Earth to serve as test animals to see if the atmosphere was still capable of supporting life. The Earthmen, and their friends the Virians and Nagani, after establishing themselves on the empty planet then struggle to overthrow their Vulcanoid captors.The style of the book is that of a journal kept by the chief character- somewhat along the lines of Robinson Crusoe. There must something to the tale, for I actually remembered the storyline after over four decades. That's much more than I can say for most the modern stuff that gets published these days...If you enjoy it, then try the sequel- CHILDREN OF THE VOID."},{"Title":"Flights of Fancy: The Great Fantasy Films","review":"Von Gunden's _Flights of Fantasy: The Great Fantasy Films_ highlights fifteen live-action, fantasy films, each reflective of a specific subgenre, produced from the 1930s to the 1980s and includes a number of stills from each production.

It starts with 78-year-old Emma Harte as a rich and powerful woman, who has called a meeting of all her family members, then it reverts to teen-aged Emma until she is finally the woman she was at the book's beginning. This MO made the first section vague and somewhat incomprehensible but everything fell into place eventually.The plot was excellent. The horrors of war were vividly described as was the treatment of Jews and attitudes towards illegitimate children. Emma appeared to be very vindictive - totally bent on revenge but in the end she softened.

This is the best Bradford book.The TV movie did the book a disgrace"},{"Title":"A Woman of Substance","review":"For whatever the reason, A Woman of Substance by Barbara Taylor Bradford, was one of those books which always eluded me. Trying to read it on three separate occasions I never got any further than 200 pages. But this year when my online a book list decided to read this, I was determined to persevere or as Emma Harte, the heroine of the book said at the end, \\"To endure\\" till I finished the last page. And finish it I did and found myself falling in love with not only the characters portrayed in this book but with the areas of England Ms. Bradford describes as well.There are books we all read who give us characters we will never forget. Scarlett O'Hara from Gone With the Wind, Father Ralph and Meggie from The Thorn Birds, Ari Ben Canaan and Kitty from Exodus. And to this list I now add the name Emma Harte.A Woman of Substance is a grand book told over close to six decades and also introduces us to the Yorkshire area of England as well as the cities of Leeds and London. And as if that wasn't enough we come to know dear friends of Emma's like Blackie and the Kallinski family as well as enemies and rivals from the Fairley family. We also come to know Emmas brothers Frank and Winston and her children and grandchildren.Emma, through great business acumen and the will to succeed, rises from a maid in a wealthy home to own a multimillion dollar enterprise. She does this to reap revenge on her former employer and his son, two men who have little understanding of their actions and the consequences. As Emma becomes more and more successful she finds herself marrying several men but only one does she love with all her heart.If you enjoyed books like The Tea Rose by Jennifer Donnelly and As the Crow Flies by Jeffrey Archer, I highly suggest you read this oldie and keeper of a book.

She works her fingers to the bone to achieve her goals, is a formidable woman, and always gets what she sets out to accomplish through her relentless perserverance. A worthwhile read, and VERY HARD to put it down once you get into the story!"},{"Title":"A Woman of Substance","review":"Emma Harte has incredible business acumen, but, for me, very little else. She was an immoral and unlikable character, and it was difficult to read 900 pages about a character whom I lack any compassion for. My first grievance about the novel is the inconsistency spread throughout the plot about basic facts. In the beginning, the author describes Emma as having about a 5 year age difference with her lifelong friend, Blackie. However, toward the end of the novel, they are only 3 years apart. In one chapter, Emma Harte is 29 years old, but about a year later (in the next chapter), she is only 28 years old. Secondly, Bradford creates likeable supporting characters throughout the novel, and then she suddenly turns them into repulsive beings whenever it is convenient for her to build Emma up or to get rid of them. For example, Emma's first husband was just a shy, orphaned landlord who was very generous and loving toward her. However, to build the reader's compassion for Emma, the author suddenly turned him into an inconsiderate dud in the sack, which was completely unnecessary. How can I sympathize with Emma when she married a man devoted to her, but whom she used and didn't love. The author reaches too far to justify Emma's actions by aiming to create an unlikeable character in the husband. Emma's first dalliance was with Edwin, who was at first a very loveable, gentile boy. Then, the author turns him into a sudden coward in order to make Emma appear battered and stronger. (I also found it irritating that the author included at least five men who were madly in love with Emma throughout the book - just a bit too extreme). At further moments, the author paints a picture where Emma is grieved by her relationship with her hateful eldest daughter, but she was, for the most part, an absent and uninvolved parent. Many children would be bitter under the same circumstance, yet the author victimizes Emma for her daughter's lack of love toward her. The author has to turn her second husband into a philandering homosexual to overshadow Emma's own adultery. Basically, the author had to make everyone else look despicable to make Emma look strong, when in opinion, Emma never grasped the importance of friendships and relationships over money. So I find it hard to believe that Emma was a strong, powerful, admirable woman. She thrived on hatred, and used people to accomplish her goals of burying those she hated. Therefore, the book didn't provide for me what its title promised."},{"Title":"A Woman of Substance","review":"I first read this book at least 20 years ago and think it will be a true classic. It is beautifully written by a very gifted author. The use of the English language is as joyful to read as Shakespeare, and the story is enthralling. It is a must for every young woman because it tells of the power of being a woman and the pitfalls. Voices of the Heart, Bradfords second novel I believe, was also extremely well written. Unfortunately as she has progressed through the years her story telling and use of the language have turned to pulp fiction. I wish she would take five years to write another classic!"},{"Title":"A Woman of Substance","review":"A Woman of Substance is a book that I have wanted to read for many years but held off mainly because of the number of pages.

The story starts out in New York in 1968 where the reader is introduced to Emma and her granddaughter Paula. It then progresses to England in the current day (1968) where Emma settles down to do some family business. The book then goes back to Emma's childhood in England in the early 1900's. Emma is a maid at Fairley Hall, a job she hates but must perform to help the family finances. Something then happens that causes Emma to have to leave home and fend for herself. Being a strong person she doesn't dwell in self-pity. Instead she uses her mind and her natural talent at business to start the store that will later turn into a major empire.A Woman of Substance is a well-written book. I must agree with other reviewers that the first part is a bit confusing and doesn't really do much except to set up the scene to take the reader back into Emma's childhood to see her rise to fortune. I honestly didn't think I would like this book during Part 1 but kept reading. Ultimately I was glad I didn't give up on this book as it is extremely entertaining and well worth the time to read. There are a lot of characters in the book to keep straight. Once figured out though the characters all have an important part in the book.I can't say enough about this wonderful book. It is just brilliant. It has everything from poverty to fortune, love to hatred, revenge, friendship, laughter, tears.

I will be checking out some more of her books."},{"Title":"A Woman of Substance","review":"First, let me say, I usually do not read romance novels. But I had a long day of travelling ahead of me, waiting in airports, etc. so I purchased this novel as a way to pass some time. This book so drew me in. Barbara Taylor Bradford's writing is so descriptive it brings every element of this book to life. The language she uses to describe the countryside of England, Leeds and London of days gone by, to the Cities of New York and modern day London draws me in. The arc of the story following the life of Emma Harte from childhood in service to her rise as an international magnate and the catalyst behind it all is riveting. The emotions, the landscape, the characters that Emma encounters throughout her life are so well defined that you cannot help but be drawn in. This book was the first Barbara Taylor Bradford book that I had ever read. It made me an instant fan. I have since collected everything that woman has written. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Woman of Substance","review":"I am delighted with this purchase. I read this book like ten years ago, and loved it. It is one of my favorites. I wanted to read it over again, and I now have it brand new thanks to you and for less than $10. I am enjoying my book again. Thanks again."},{"Title":"A Woman of Substance","review":"\\"A Woman of Substance\\", about Emma Harte's life, from poor kitchen maid to powerful business leader and matriarch, is a good story, but the book could have been shorter. Especially in the first half, it's weighed down by way too detailed desciptions of furniture and clothes that distract from the story, at least for those readers who don't share the author's passion for interior design and fashion. The pace picks up in the second half and the book kept my interest. With tighter plotting this might have been a four star book. 3+"},{"Title":"A Woman of Substance","review":"I have read most of Barbara Taylor Bradford's books. All of them are great but this first one of a series was my \\"all time\\" favorite book. The best of the best!!! Any reader would enjoy the story of Emma Harte from childhood until adulthood."},{"Title":"A Woman of Substance","review":"This is my absolute all time favorite book! If I was stranded on a desert island, this is the book I'd want with me! All of Barbara Taylor Bradford's books are good, but this is the best. You won't be able to put it down!"},{"Title":"A Woman of Substance","review":"I bought this book many years ago...The first time I read this book,I was hooked, not only on Emma Harte but also Barbara Taylor Bradford. When ever I get to a point in my life that I feel I need a boost, I re-read this novel! It makes me feel like I can do anything, just like Emma!"},{"Title":"A Woman of Substance","review":"I read this book in the late 70's and it has remained my favorite book. I remember reading until 4 am in the morning to finish it when I had a College Final the next day (and I am NOT a night person!). It was moving and inspiring! I read it again in the late 80's and enjoyed it just as much. Maybe it's time to read it again... Unfortunately, none of the sequels or any other book of BTB's ever came near to this one."},{"Title":"A Woman of Substance","review":"This is undoubtedly the best book I have ever read. Emma Harte has become my role model. She started with nothing and ended up being wealthy in love and money, by sheer determination, perseverance and hard work. What an amazing author. I have read the next two in the trilogy and although they are also excellent, nothing can compare to this brilliant book."},{"Title":"A Woman of Substance","review":"This is by far one of the best books I have ever read. The characterizations are vivid, the plot lines are rich, and it is a perfect set-up for the two sequels that follow. This book is on the caliber of &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;."},{"Title":"A Woman of Substance","review":"This novel has to be one of the best written books I have read in a long time. The intricate descriptions were very compelling. The reader feels as if they are right there in the room with Emma. The story is so fascinating. You find yourself wondering what Emma will pull out of her hat next and what fate has in store for her. This novel is about love, compassion, greed, revenge, and the power of endurance. I love it!!"},{"Title":"A Woman of Substance","review":"A book I had read years ago and still read today! ' A woman of Substance' - is what every woman aspires to be. Just loved the book and its sequels Hope you come out with winners like this all the time."},{"Title":"A Woman of Substance","review":"This was my first real read at age 14. Today at 39, I am the owner of a very sussessful business. Although a fictional character Emma Hart and her story have been an inspiration to me in my own endeavors. I plan to give a copy to each of my four daughters. When you have true stregnth of charachter anthing is possible."},{"Title":"A Woman of Substance","review":"I gave it a five star, because it was in a great condition. I am satisfied with my purchase. I would most definitely recomend this to my friends. The movie also arrived on time."},{"Title":"A Woman of Substance","review":"This is the first book in a trilogy concerning Emma, her daughter, and her granddaughter.Emma went from &quot;rags to riches&quot; through hard work and perseverence without stepping on anyone elses toes.If you want a fast-moving, honest, down-to-earth success story, this is the one book you should read.Barbara Taylor Bradford has a great way with words and descriptions.Be sure to read the sequels to this book."},{"Title":"A Woman of Substance","review":"This book was amazing, except for one minor detail, it was wayyy too descriptive for my taste. I caught my mind wandering when she went into insane details about the moors and etc. However the basic plot of the book was fantastic. My mother (50) recommended this book to me (19), and i was blown away. While reading this book, i sensed emotions of pride, sadness, anger, happiness, and passion. It portrays the powerful strength in women. I bought the book, regardless of my feelings about the great deal of description. I would recommend it."},{"Title":"A Woman of Substance","review":"I have read nearly all of Barbara's books, but Woman of Substance is the most fascinating of all. Emma proves that anything is attainable if we want something badly enough. Her background gives her the destermination she needs to overcome the odds. I especially like Blakie. He adds humour as well as giving Emma strength to fight. An amazing book, Barbara."},{"Title":"A Woman of Substance","review":"Emma Harte is a larger-than-life heroine into whose story you are immediately swept. From her impoverished childhood on the Yorkshire moors through her rise to the heights of wealth and its inherent possessions, Emma's story is engrossing, entertaining, and enlightening.Emma Harte is not the most likeable of heroines. In fact, I was turned off by her need for vengeance and her vendetta of sixty plus years. Her total absorption with money was also off-putting. Nevertheless, because the roots of her needs were so obvious, her story was believable and enjoyable to follow, if not always admirable.When we first meet her she is an elderly woman who has a huge bombshell to explode at a family gathering. Although we must wait nearly 700 pages to understand the dimensions of this, the wait is worth it. Also worth the 700+ pages are Emma's rise from poverty, the endearing people she meets along the way, and the great story that pairs her with the love of her life---and it's not either of her husbands!From Blackie O'Neill, her lusty life-long friend, to the charming Kallinski family who becomes her lifeline, to the angelic Laura who becomes her dearest friend, this is the story of a young girl, a woman, a mother who achieves much and loses much. However, she endures to reap the rewards and the heartaches of a long life.Through two world wars and across the English landscape, the story develops and enchants. However, one rather large piece of titillating information is left unexplained, and I found this rather disheartening."},{"Title":"A Woman of Substance","review":"I have been wanting to read a Woman of Substance for a long time. It actaully took three tries for me to get past the first couple of chapters. I felt this was another retread of Gone With the Wind, rather than anything new.I will admit that I finished the book and found it an ejoyable read, but had the following quandries about it. The opening scene seems hard to follow and offers little character development. It makes the book more confusing, rather than enhancing it. The story was forgetable. I had to keep remininding myself who the characters were. Finally, Emma, the protagonist is simply not a likable individual. I had little intesrest in her, did not feel her motivation was clear and founs her to be rather cold- not a heroine I enjoyed.If you likes the business aspect try Jeffrey Archer's As the Crow Flies instead. That is a far superior tale of one man's quest to create an ENglish shopping empire."},{"Title":"A Woman of Substance","review":"Perhaps it is a matter of \\"familiarity breeds contempt\\" since I have read this book several times. It has been a number of years so I just read it again. The story is pretty good. Emma is a little unbelievable but it is an entertaining family story. The actual use of the language is pathetic. There are many run-on sentences that could have been simplified (I know it might be a literary device but it also might not be since there are so many) I read it wondering if it was an early book, if she had a bad editor or what? She constantly uses \\"ness\\" as a suffix, practically inventing new words. \\"austereness\\" comes to mind. The really bad mistake was when she referred to a male/female set of twins as identical. That doesn't happen. She did a good job of character development in the beginning then lapsed into telling us the story instead of showing us the story. Years went by with a single paragraph towards the end. Good idea. Pretty good story. Terrible editing. I knocked off a star for editing."},{"Title":"A Woman of Substance","review":"I have read this book several times over the years, but recently read it again, and purchased it for a family member. I never tire of reading it. It brings to life my English heritage and reminds me of my grandmother, who worked as a housemaid in an estate in England before she came to America. A Woman of Substance is filled with graphic detail of life in England, with rich description of the moors of Yorkshire. Ms. Bradford's character of Emma Harte is intelligent, courageous, resourceful, hardworking and unaware that she is breathtakingly beautiful. There are a couple of tiny spots where ideals may be a bit dated, and the detail can be slightly tedious at times, but it is well worth reading. I was never bored, and came to love the main characters and to despise the unpleasant ones, due to the in-depth development given by the author. I do not want to reveal any of the plot, so will suffice to say that I love to read a variety of book types, but this one remains my favorite of all time... if you love novels about strong women characters you will love this one...."},{"Title":"A Woman of Substance","review":"The first time I read A Woman of Substance I was about 13 years old, and I think I've probably read it at least once every second year since (and it seems to get even better each time). I am now 27 years old and I will always enjoy this great book, simply because it tells a unique story of a woman who succeeded against all odds and whose dignity, strength and perseverence should be an example to every woman who is afraid to fail and to be different. This book is truly addictive, the language is brilliant and the storyline completely compelling. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good story full of love, power, success and most of all an incredibly strong woman. Read it when you feel lost, down or weak, or just read it anyway!"},{"Title":"A Woman of Substance","review":"In Barbara Taylor Bradford's novel, &quot;A Woman of Substance&quot;, the theme is that people must work hard for what they want in life is clearly shown. Emma Harte, a very poor little girl goes through many hard times before she ends up being one of the richest and strongest women to live. Bradford develops this moving story through the use of setting, conflict, and characterization to create the powerful theme.&quot; A Woman of Substances&quot; portrays how hard it's for the poor people to have a mellow life. Barbara Taylor B. describes this big problem in life with Emma Harte the main character of the novel.
