The year 1916, for example, brought both Einstein's theory of relativity and the first official birth control clinic. The year 1953 was marked by the discovery of the DNA double-helix structure, the first successful impregnation with frozen sperm, and two men's victory over the 29,000-foot Mount Everest. Chronicling the front-page stories that made social and political headlines, Paul Baldwin also touches on the moments that were not necessarily noted at the time but that went on to influence the future profoundly. From Agatha Christie's invention of Hercule Poirot to the official acknowledgment of AIDS in 1981, the events detailed in this book range from the inspiring to the terrifying to the wonderfully silly. Capturing our collective mistakes and triumphs, The 365 Most Important Events of the Twentieth Century offers a welcome perspective on where we have come from and where we might be headed.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SPJ6GwAACAAJ&dq=The+365+Most+Important+Events+of+the+20th+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Walt Disney's America (The Wonderful Worlds of Walt Disney)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ew8m7mlHvJMC&dq=Walt+Disney%27s+America+(The+Wonderful+Worlds+of+Walt+Disney)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Engineering Problem Solving with C++","description":"This is a clear, concise introduction to problem solving and the C++ programming language.

For this purpose, it makes full use of all the aspects of human life - prana, manas, imagination and intuition. The book has for the first time been translated into English. The translation of each verse is followed by copious expository notes, which contain not only all that is of any value in the Sanskrit commentaries, but also many practical suggestions made by Swami Lakshmana Joo on the basis of his personal experience of these Yogas.

For me, the animal totem of these dreams is the antelope, swift, strong, and elusive. we chase after 'antelope,' and sometimes we catch them. Often we don't. But why do we bother? I think it is because without dream 'antelopes' to chase we become what a lapdog is to a wolf. And we are inherently more like wolves than lapdogs, because the communal chase is part of our biological makeup.\\" In 1981, Bernd Heinrich, a lifelong runner, decided to test his limits at age forty-one and race in the North American 100-Kilometer Championship race in Chicago. To improve his own preparations as a runner, he wondered what he could learn from other animals--what makes us different and how we are the same--and what new perspective these lessons could shed on human evolution. A biologist and award-winning nature writer, he considered the flight endurance of insects and birds, the antelope's running prowess and limitations, the ultraendurance of the camel, and the remarkable sprinting and jumping skills of frogs. Exploring how biological adaptations have granted these creatures \\"superhuman\\" abilities, he looked at how human physiology can or cannot replicate these adaptations. Drawing on his observations and knowledge of animal physiology and behavior, Heinrich ran the race, and the results surprised everyone--himself most of all. In Racing the Antelope, Heinrich applies his characteristic blend of scientific inquiry and philosophical musing to a deft exploration of the human desire--even need--to run. His rich prose reveals what endurance athletes can learn about the body and the spirit from other athletes in the animal kingdom. He then takes you into the heart of his own grueling 100-kilometer ultramarathon, where he puts into practice all that he has discovered about the physical, spiritual--and primal--drive to win. At once lyrical and scientific, Racing the Antelope melds a unique blend of biology, anthropology, psychology, and philosophy with Heinrich's passion for running to discover how and why we run.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=olh2QgAACAAJ&dq=Racing+the+Antelope:+What+Animals+Can+Teach+Us+About+Running+and+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Martian Rock","description":"In this riveting book, acclaimed journalist Kathy Sawyer reveals the deepest mysteries of space and some of the most disturbing truths on Earth. The Rock from Mars is the story of how two planets and the spheres of politics and science all collided at the end of the twentieth century. It began sixteen million years ago. An asteroid crashing into Mars sent fragments flying into space and, eons later, one was pulled by the Earth s gravity onto an icy wilderness near the southern pole. There, in 1984, a geologist named Roberta Score spotted it, launching it on a roundabout path to fame and controversy. In its new home at NASA s Johnson Space Center in Houston, the rock languished on a shelf for nine years, a victim of mistaken identity. Then, in 1993, the geochemist Donald  Duck  Mittlefehldt, unmasked the rock as a Martian meteorite. Before long, specialist Chris Romanek detected signs of once-living organisms on the meteorite. And the obscure rock became a rock star. But how did nine respected investigators come to make such startling claims about the rock that they triggered one of the most venomous scientific battles in modern memory? The narrative traces the steps that led to this risky move and follows the rippling impact on the scientists  lives, the future of space exploration, the search for life on Mars, and the struggle to understand the origins of life on Earth. From the second the story broke in Science magazine in 1996, it spawned waves of excitement, envy, competitive zeal, and calculation. In academia, in government agencies, in laboratories around the world, and even in the Oval Officewhere an inquisitive President Clinton had received the news in secret players of all kinds plotted their next moves. Among them: David McKay, the dynamic geologist associated with the first moon landing, who labored to achieve at long last a second success; Bill Schopf of UCLA, a researcher determined to remain at the top of his field and the first to challenge McKay s claims; Dan Goldin, the boss of NASA; and Dick Morris, the controversial presidential adviser who wanted to use the story for Clinton s reelection and unfortunately made sure it ended up in the diary of a $200-an-hour call girl. Impeccably researched and thrillingly involving, Kathy Sawyer s The Rock from Mars is an exemplary work of modern nonfiction, a vivid account of the all-too-human high-stakes drive to learn our true place in the cosmic scheme.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nQzR6MBmG7AC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"El Padre Que Yo Quiero Ser (Spanish Edition)","description":"In Straight Talk with Your Kids About Sex, Josh and Dottie McDowell draw on their decades-long love and concern for youth.

A deadly epidemic sweeps through the city, but Aschenbach's attraction to the youth compels him to remain, thus sealing his fate. The second work in this volume, \\"A Man and His Dog,\\" concerns Bauschan, a friendly mongrel pointer acquired by the Mann family in 1916. A constant companion during the author's morning walks, the loyal creature also deposited himself regularly under Mann's desk while the author worked -- a gesture not always appreciated by the writer.

These mummies, their ecology, and their preservation are the subject of this compelling book by paleontologist Dale Guthrie. The 1979 find of a frozen, extinct steppe bison in an Alaskan gold mine allowed him to undertake the first scientific excavation of an Ice Age mummy in North America and to test theories about these enigmatic frozen fauna. The 36,000-year-old bison mummy, coated with blue mineral crystals, was dubbed \\"Blue Babe.\\" Guthrie conveys the excitement of its excavation and shows how he made use of evidence from living animals, other Pleistocene mummies, Paleolithic art, and geological data. With photographs and scores of detailed drawings, he takes the reader through the excavation and subsequent detective work, analyzing the animal's carcass and its surroundings, the circumstances of its death, its appearance in life, the landscape it inhabited, and the processes of preservation by freezing. His examination shows that Blue Babe died in early winter, falling prey to lions that inhabited the Arctic during the Pleistocene era. Guthrie uses information gleaned from his study of Blue Babe to provide a broad picture of bison evolutionary history and ecology, including speculations on the interactions of bison and Ice Age peoples. His description of the Mammoth Steppe as a cold, dry, grassy plain is based on an entirely new way of reading the fossil record.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KZnxAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"First Offense","description":"Surviving a murder attempt on her life, probation officer Ann Carlisle wonders if the unknown assailant could be the young drug dealer in her charge, an accused rapist facing trial, or her own husband.

The selections of Handel?s music included here are those best understood and most apt to be mastered by young musicians. One evening, back in 1691, conservative Doctor Handel was shocked and dismayed to find his small son carrying the torch at the head of a band of singers wandering through the little town of Halle. The good doctor never quite understood the all-consuming love of music which drove his son from childhood on and on to the great heights he eventually attained as the beloved Father of the Oratorio, the composer of the magnificent MESSIAH.

By VE-day about 33,100 Yakovlev fighters had been built. Virtually all Soviet fighter regiments flew at least one variety of Yak for a time, including those which gained their fame identified with other aircraft, and consequently many pilots known as Airacobra or Lavochkin aces also scored victories with the Yak.

In addition to being of particular significance in the process of the genesis of our understanding of Europe across the continent, these several decades were crucial for the discursive construction of OC EuropeOCO in Serbian culture: when after the end of the Cold War the debate on Europe became possible again, it was on a discursive level to a large extent determined by the stockpile of images and ideas created between the world wars. The book seeks to answer the following questions: who constructed OC EuropeOCO, and with what authority? For whom were these constructions intended? How was this representation validated? What purposes was it meant to serve? Which issues were raised in comparing OC EuropeOCO with Serbia, and why? Which textual traditions were the elements of this construction borrowed from? How did the construction of the European other define Serbian self-representation?

Not only does it shed new light on the terrifying true saga that influenced Nabokov s masterpiece, it restores the forgotten victim to our consciousness.   David Grann, author of Killers of the Flower Moon Vladimir Nabokov s Lolita is one of the most beloved and notorious novels of all time. And yet, very few of its readers know that the subject of the novel was inspired by a real-life case: the 1948 abduction of eleven-year-old Sally Horner. Weaving together suspenseful crime narrative, cultural and social history, and literary investigation, The Real Lolita tells Sally Horner s full story for the very first time. Drawing upon extensive investigations, legal documents, public records, and interviews with remaining relatives, Sarah Weinman uncovers how much Nabokov knew of the Sally Horner case and the efforts he took to disguise that knowledge during the process of writing and publishing Lolita. Sally Horner s story echoes the stories of countless girls and women who never had the chance to speak for themselves. By diving deeper in the publication history of Lolita and restoring Sally to her rightful place in the lore of the novel s creation, The Real Lolita casts a new light on the dark inspiration for a modern classic.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3ntLDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Terror of the Spanish Main: Sir Henry Morgan and His Buccaneers","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Uncle John's Biggest Ever Bathroom Reader","description":"Sit down and relax with Uncle John's Biggest Ever Bathroom Reader.

In 1990, when thousands of teenage fighters, including young men wearing women's clothing and bizarre objects of decoration, laid siege to the capital, the world took notice. Since then Liberia has been through devastating civil upheaval and the most feared warlord, Charles Taylor, is now president. What began as a civil conflict, has spread to other West African nations. Western correspondents saw in the Liberian war a primeval, savage Africa-a \\"heart of darkness.\\" They focused on sensational \\"primitive\\" aspects of the conflict, such as the prevalence of traditional healers and soothsayers, and shocked the international community with tales of cannibalism, especially the eating of the body parts of defeated opponents, which was widespread. Eschewing popular stereotypes and simple explanations, Stephen Ellis traces the history of the civil war that has blighted Liberia in recent years and looks at its political, ethnic and cultural roots. He focuses on the role religion and ritual have played in shaping and intensifying this brutal war.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5KkUCgAAQBAJ&dq=The+Homosexualities&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Uluru: Kata Tjuta and Watarrka National Parks (National Parks Field Guides)","description":"A land of extremes - Spectacular landscape - Skies above - The land today: plants and plant communities - Abundant animal life - Human epilogue - Itineries and walks - Flora and fauna.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h1ziwAEACAAJ&dq=Uluru:+Kata+Tjuta+and+Watarrka+National+Parks+(National+Parks+Field+Guides)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stop the Presses: The Litigation PR Desk Reference","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kVJQqjwQ948C&dq=Stop+the+Presses:+The+Litigation+PR+Desk+Reference&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Office Skills: The Finishing Touch","description":"In the office of tomorrow, interaction skills will be as critical to success as technological expertise.

In these stories, the reader gets a kind of tour through the lives and minds of people they might never encounter on their own, and even the most troubled characters can hold up a mirror to those aspects of ourselves we might not want to admit are there but which play an important role in shaping who we are, if only by showing us who we don't want to become.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ix9OAAAACAAJ&dq=Medical+Nutrition+from+Marz&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"God Breathes on Blended Families Workbook","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"North and South (North and South Trilogy, 1)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Gun Digest","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"We are not alone","description":"Life on Mars exists but we are too timid to accept the facts Life on Mars exists but are we brave enough to accept the facts?

Miss Marple encounters a compelling murder mystery in the sleepy little village of St. Mary Mead, where under the seemingly peaceful exterior of an English country village lurks intrigue, guilt, deception and death. Colonel Protheroe, local magistrate and overbearing land-owner is the most detested man in the village. Everyone--even in the vicar--wishes he were dead.

I wish I had written it.\\" (Lyle E. Schaller, Parish Consultant) The common experience of large congregations getting larger and small congregations getting smaller has given rise to the belief that growing congregations tend to hit a barrier at the 150-200 attendance mark. The dividing line in American Church attendance is 150 people on an average Sunday. Churches below this seem to have a harder time growing. Above this, churches seem to have an easier time growing. Trying to grow a smaller church can feel like trying to break through what Martin calls the  200 barrier.  Martin explains that there is no barrier; there are just two different ways of being a church the  Pastoral Size  church and the  Program  church. The  Transitional Church  is really a hybrid of these two cultures, and this dual nature produces stress and tension where the idea of a 200 barrier often becomes a self-fulfilling expectation. How does the Pastor Size church culture really work? What are the key elements of the larger American Church? How does this create a large church culture that becomes self-supporting? Martin looks at these elements and shows how the Transitional Church can avoid mistakes in their effort to grow  beyond the barrier,  and why transformation and change is so difficult. Drawing on sociological and anthropological studies about the significance of numbers in human organizations, Martin proposes practical steps that leaders of Transitional Churches will want to take.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8UxY84B1yigC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"John Barry, Father of the Navy","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XcziAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Guv'nor","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Skylark Soars Again: Triumph of a Free Spirit","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Satanstoe, or, The littlepage manuscripts: A tale of the colony","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qQHsNFLIkeYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Watchwords of liberty: A pageant of American quotations","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xpf0zgEACAAJ&dq=Watchwords+of+liberty:+A+pageant+of+American+quotations&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Synthesis of Subsonic Airplane Design: An Introduction to the Preliminary Design of Subsonic General Aviation and Transport Aircraft, with Emphasis on ... Design, Propulsion and Performance","description":"Since the education of aeronautical engineers at Delft University of Technology started in 1940 under tae inspiring leadership of Professor H.J. van der Maas, much emphasis has been placed on the design of aircraft as part of the student's curriculum. Not only is aircraft design an optional subject for thesis work, but every aeronautical student has to carry out a preliminary airplane design in the course of his study. The main purpose of this preliminary design work is to enable the student to synthesize the knowledge ob tained separately in courses on aerodynamics, aircraft performances, stability and con trol, aircraft structures, etc. The student's exercises in preliminary design have been directed through the years by a number of staff members of the Department of Aerospace Engineering in Delft. The author of this book, Mr. E. Torenbeek, has made a large contribution to this part of the study programme for many years. Not only has he acquired vast experience in teaching airplane design at university level, but he has also been deeply involved in design-oriented re search, e.g. developing rational design methods and systematizing design information.

Penny s absorbing, intricately plotted 13th Gamache novel proves she only gets better at pursuing dark truths with compassion and grace.   PEOPLE  Louise Penny wrote the book on escapist mysteries.   The New York Times Book Review  You won't want Louise Penny's latest to end....Any plot summary of Penny s novels inevitably falls short of conveying the dark magic of this series.... It takes nerve and skill   as well as heart   to write mysteries like this.  Glass Houses,  along with many of the other Gamache books, is so compelling that, for the space of reading it, you may well feel that much of what s going on in the world outside the novel is  just noise.    Maureen Corrigan, The Washington Post When a mysterious figure appears in Three Pines one cold November day, Armand Gamache and the rest of the villagers are at first curious. Then wary. Through rain and sleet, the figure stands unmoving, staring ahead. From the moment its shadow falls over the village, Gamache, now Chief Superintendent of the S?ret  du Qu bec, suspects the creature has deep roots and a dark purpose. Yet he does nothing. What can he do? Only watch and wait. And hope his mounting fears are not realized. But when the figure vanishes overnight and a body is discovered, it falls to Gamache to discover if a debt has been paid or levied. Months later, on a steamy July day as the trial for the accused begins in Montr al, Chief Superintendent Gamache continues to struggle with actions he set in motion that bitter November, from which there is no going back. More than the accused is on trial. Gamache s own conscience is standing in judgment. In Glass Houses, her latest utterly gripping book, number-one New York Times bestselling author Louise Penny shatters the conventions of the crime novel to explore what Gandhi called the court of conscience. A court that supersedes all others.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UXARDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Adoption: A Reference Handbook","description":"The ancient practice of adoption has changed significantly through history.

Deepening and extending his earlier work on speed perception and political control, and applying it now to the global 'real time' of the information superhighways, he explores the growing danger of what he calls a \\"generalized accident,\\" provoked by the breakdown of our collective and individual relation to time, space and movement. But this is not merely a lucid and disturbing lament for the loss of real geographical spaces, distance, intimacy or democracy. Open Sky is also a call for revolt against the insidious and accelerating manipulation of perception by the electronic media and repressive political power, against the tyranny of \\"real time,\\" and against the infantilism of cyberhype. Paul Virillo makes a powerful case for a new ethics of perception, and a new ecology, one which will not only strive to protect the natural world from pollution and destruction, but will also combat the devastation of urban communities by proliferating technologies of control and virtuality.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OF_cPrltMmsC&dq=Open+Sky&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pack of Two: The Intricate Bond Between People and Dogs","description":"At the age of 36, Caroline Knapp, author of the acclaimed bestseller Drinking:A Love Story, found herself confronted with a monumental task: redefining her world. She had faced the loss of both her parents, given up a twenty-year relationship with alcohol, and, as she writes, \\"I was wandering around in a haze of uncertainty, blinking up at the biggest questions: Who am I without parents and without alcohol? How to form attachments, and where to find comfort, in the face of such daunting vulnerability?\\" An answer materialized in the most unlikely form: that of a dog. Eighteen months to the day after she quit drinking, Knapp stumbled upon an eight-week-old puppy at a local animal shelter, took her home, and named her Lucille. Now two years old, Lucille has become a central force in Knapp's life: \\"In her,\\" she writes, \\"I have found solace, joy, a bridge to the world.\\" Caroline Knapp has been celebrated as much for her fresh insight into emotional and psychological issues as she has been for her gifts as a writer. In Pack of Two, she brings the same perception and talent to bear on the rich, complicated terrain of human-animal relationships. In addition to mining her own experience with Lucille, Knapp speaks to a wide variety of dog people--from animal behaviorists and psychologists to other owners whose dogs have deeply affected their lives--about this emotionally complex, sometimes daunting, often profoundly healing alliance. Throughout, she explores the shift in canine roles from working partners to intimate companions and looks, too, at how this new kinship, this wordless bond, becomes a template for what we most desire ourselves.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VpvGRcCkFcEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Schaum's Easy Outline Molecular and Cell Biology","description":"Boiled-down essentials of the top-selling Schaum's Outline series, for the student with limited time What could be better than the bestselling Schaum's Outline series?

This extended satiric poem assesses the growing economic, political, and familial constraints of late 18th-century Catholic Ireland under British colonial rule, while subversively playing on the tradition of the aisling (or vision) poem in which a beautiful woman represents Ireland's threatened sovereignty.At the beginning of The Midnight Court, a dreadful female envoy from the fairies appears in a dream to the unmarried poet. She summons him before the court of Queen Aoibheall in order to answer charges of wasting his manhood while women are dying for want of love. He listens to complaints that vary from the celibacy of the clergy to marriages performed between old and young for purely economic reasons. In all their bawdy tales, the female courtiers praise fertility, as well as sexual fulfillment, and condemn the conventions of the day. At last the Queen pronounces judgment on the poet, who awakens as he is being severely chastised by all of the women of the court.While containing many insights into 18th-century social conditions, The Midnight Court is also an exuberant, even jaunty work of the comic imagination. As the translator Ciaran Carson states in his foreword: \\"The protagonists of the 'Court,' including 'Merriman' himself, are ghosts, summoned into being by language; they are figments of the imagination.

Are miracles and deliverance still part of Jesus' disciple making agenda?

God desires to take you on a journey much like that of Jesus' first disciples, who learned to do what Jesus was doing by observing Him in action and obeying what He taught.

In No Bone Unturned, investigative journalist Jeff Benedict not only unveils a compelling portrait of the man behind America's most notorious cases but also gives us a fascinating look inside the world of forensic science as seen through the eyes of a leading specialist. Doug Owsley's extraordinary talent has put his phone number on speed dial for federal agencies, from the FBI to the CIA and the State Department. When the Branch Davidian compound in Waco caught fire, when a terrorist-flown plane crashed into the Pentagon, and when mass graves were uncovered in Croatia, the authorities called Owsley. Through cutting-edge science, instinctive artistry, and dogged tenacity, Owsley painstakingly rebuilds the skeleton, and helps identify it and determine the cause of death. A curator for the Smithsonian's Museum of Natural History, Doug Owsley has handled over ten thousand human skeletons, more than anyone else in America. He has worked with America's historic skeletons, from, colonial Jamestown burials to Plains Indians to Civil War soldiers to skeletons tens of thousands of years old. That includes the Kennewick Man, a 9,600-year-old human skeleton found in shallow water along the banks of Washington State's Columbia River. It was a skeleton that would turn Owsley's life upside down. Days before Owsley was scheduled to begin studying the skeleton, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers seized it and announced they would repatriate Kennewick Man, burying his bones on the land of the Native American tribes who claimed him. Along with seven of America's leading scientists, Owsley sued the U.S. government over custody. At stake was a wide body of knowledge about our past and our history that would be lost forever if the bones were reburied. For six years, Owsley fought a legal and political battle that put everything at risk, jeopardizing his career and his reputation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=F76mQgAACAAJ&dq=No+Bone+Unturned:+The+Adventures+of+a+Top+Smithsonian+Forensic+Scientist+and+the+Legal+Battle+for+America%27s+Oldest+Skeletons&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ERASING RACISM","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Introductory Symbolic Logic","description":"Famous classic has introduced countless readers to symbolic logic with its thorough and precise exposition.

With chart in Rear Pocket.","description":"Steam Tables Thermodynamic Properties of Water Including Vapor, Liquid, and Solid Phases  English Units By Joseph H. Keenan, M.I.T.; Frederick G. Keyes, M.I.T.; Philip G. Hill, Queen s University; and Joan G. Moore, M.I.T. During the past decade a substantial body of experimental data on thermodynamic and transport properties of water has been produced and published by research groups in the USSR, Great Britain, Czechoslovakia, Canada and the United States. This book presents the results of a new and independent correlation of all this new thermodynamic data and all previously existing data. It is a new work to replace the well-known and widely used Keenan and Keyes tables. The tables in this new book are based upon a unique accomplishment. For the first time the whole body of high-quality experimental data on liquid and vapor water has been faithfully represented by a single fundamental equation. From this equation all thermodynamic properties can be calculated for any state. This equation is believed to extrapolate dependably in temperature from the upper limit of precise measurement (about 1500 F) to about 2400 F. Because of the increasing importance to both the practicing engineer and the student of a wide variety of problems that cannot be approximated by steady-flow idealization, internal energies are tabulated for all states: saturated liquid and vapor, compressed liquid, and superheated vapor. A reasonable range of metastable states is covered as extensions of the superheated-vapor and compressed-liquid tables. The Mollier and temperature-entropy charts are extended to substantially higher pressures and temperatures. This book also includes a table for ice-vapor equilibrium, an improved chart of isentropic exponents, charts of Prandtl number, a set of charts of heat capacity of liquid and vapor, and extensive tables of viscosity and thermal conductivity reproduced from the documents of the Sixth International Conference on the Properties of Steam. The book features legible type set by a computer-controlled typesetting machine. This results in accuracy, compactness, and convenience.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hd-1vgEACAAJ&dq=Thermodynamic+Properties+of+Steam:+Including+Data+for+the+Liquid+and+Solid+Phases.+With+chart+in+Rear+Pocket.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Siberian Husky Champions 1952-1980","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Contemporary Indigenous Movements in Latin America (Jaguar Books on Latin America)","description":"The efforts of Indians in Latin America have gained momentum and garnered increasing attention in the last decade as they claim rights to their land and demand full participation in the political process. This issue is of rising importance as ecological concerns and autochtonous movements gain a foothold in Latin America, transforming the political landscape into one in which multiethnic democracies hold sway. In some cases, these movements have led to violent outbursts that severely affected some nations, such as the 1992 and 1994 Indian uprisings in Ecuador. In most cases, however, grassroots efforts have realized success without bloodshed. An Aymara Indian, head of an indigenous-rights political party, became Vice President of Bolivia. Brazilian lands are being set aside for indigenous groups not as traditional reservations where the government attempts to 'civilize' the hunters and gatherers, but where the government serves only to keep loggers, gold miners, and other interlopers out of tribal lands. Contemporary Indigenous Movements in Latin America is a collection of essays compiled by Professor Erick D. Langer that brings together-for the first time-contributions on indigenous movements throughout Latin America from all regions. Focusing on the 1990s, Professor Langer illustrates the range and increasing significance of the Indian movements in Latin America. The volume addresses the ways in which Indians have confronted the political, social, and economic problems they face today, and shows the diversity of the movements, both in lowlands and in highlands, tribal peoples, and peasants. The book presents an analytical overview of these movements, as well as a vision of how and why they have become so important in the late twentieth century. Contemporary Indigenous Movements in Latin America is important for those interested in Latin American studies, including Latin American civilization, Latin American anthropology, contemporary issues in Latin America, and ethnic studies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Mbgmz5aedeUC&dq=Contemporary+Indigenous+Movements+in+Latin+America+(Jaguar+Books+on+Latin+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dirty McNasty","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gl8EAAAACAAJ&dq=Dirty+McNasty&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fund Your Future","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JIH1OzfhbNkC&dq=Fund+Your+Future&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ultimate Questions: A Theological Primer","description":"An introduction to theology that explores secular and religious answers to the primal questions about who we are and what we shall be.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=setvsmOa0l4C&dq=Ultimate+Questions:+A+Theological+Primer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Strong's Concise Concordance And Vine's Concise Dictionary Of The Bible Two Bible Reference Classics In One Handy Volume","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Changes For Addy (American Girl (Quality))","description":"Addy and her parents are together in Philadelphia, but Addy misses her brother and sister and her Auntie Lula and Uncle Solomon and wants desperately for her family to be reunited.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fVWVoAEACAAJ&dq=Changes+For+Addy+(American+Girl+(Quality))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cop Hater","description":"When a sniper begins gunning down cops from the 87th Precinct in cold blood, it's up to Detective Steve Carella to sort out who and why--before he finds himself on the wrong end of the killer's .45. \\"McBain has the ability to make every character believable--which few writers these days can do.\\" -- Associated Press \\"McBain forces us to think twice about every character we meet...even those we thought we already knew.\\" -- New York Times Book Review","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eBhpMgEACAAJ&dq=Cop+Hater&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Have You Been Left Behind?

They're not coming for us.\\" Still, he slips his arm around me and we wait until the sky is clear. Because he doesn't know. Not really. Everything changed on The Day. The day the Icon appeared in Los Angeles. The day the power stopped. The day Dol's family dropped dead. The day Earth lost a war it didn't know it was fighting. Since then, Dol has lived a simple life in the countryside with fellow survivor Ro-safe from the shadow of the Icon and its terrifying power. Hiding from the one truth she can't avoid.

One hundred fifty miles away, in Sitka, Alaska, an H-60 Jayhawk helicopter lifts off from America's most remote Coast Guard base in the hopes of tracking down an anonymous Mayday signal. A fisherman's worst nightmare has become a Coast Guard crew's desperate mission. As the crew of the La Conte begin to die one by one, those sworn to watch over them risk everything to pull off the rescue of the century. Spike Walker's memoir of his years as a deckhand in Alaska, Working on the Edge, was hailed by James A. Michner as \\"masterful . . . will become the definitive account of this perilous trade, an addition to the literature of the sea.\\" In Coming Back Alive, Walker has crafted his most devastating book to date. Meticulously researched through hundreds of hours of taped interviews with the survivors, this is the true account of the La Conte's final voyage and the relationship between Alaskan fishermen and the search and rescue crews who risk their lives to save them.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zLw9gcFRmQMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Outbreak of Darkness","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Atlas of United States History","description":"Using more than five hundred historical maps from collections around the world, this stunning book is the first to tell the story of America's past from a unique geographical perspective. Covering more than half a millennium in U.S. history -- from conception to colonization to Hurricane Katrina -- this atlas documents the discoveries and explorations, the intrigue and negotiations, the technology and the will that led the United States to become what it is today. Richly detailed, visually breathtaking maps are accompanied by extended captions that elucidate the stories and personalities behind their creation. Coasts and mountains, rivers and lakes, and peaks and plains are described by explorers encountering them for the first time. These maps can convey explorers' ideas of what lay over the mountains ahead, their notions about what was discovered, and their explanations of the land's potential for sponsors back home. The maps can also show a promoter's attempt to sell his project to settlers or a general's assessment of a coming battle. They chart the wars that created and molded the country: the French and Indian War and the War for Independence; the Mexican and Civil Wars; the numerous Indian wars; as well as more localized battles of conquest and survival. Readers can follow the progression of map creation and design as more knowledge was gained about the American continent. Distilling an enormous amount of information into one handsome volume, the Historical Atlas of the United States highlights the evolution of geographical knowledge at the same time that it presents a fascinating chronicle of the expansion and development of a nation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Dg76wAEACAAJ&dq=Atlas+of+United+States+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Savage Wars of Peace","description":"The Algerian War lasted from 1954 to 1962. It brought down six French governments, led to the collapse of the Fourth Republic, returned de Gaulle to power, and came close to provoking a civil war on French soil. More than a million Muslim Algerians died in the conflict and as many European settlers were driven into exile. Above all, the war was marked by an unholy marriage of revolutionary terror and repressive torture. Nearly a half century has passed since this savagely fought war ended in Algeria s independence, and yet as Alistair Horne argues in his new preface to his now-classic work of history its repercussions continue to be felt not only in Algeria and France, but throughout the world. Indeed from today s vantage point the Algerian War looks like a full-dress rehearsal for the sort of amorphous struggle that convulsed the Balkans in the 1990s and that now ravages the Middle East, from Beirut to Baghdad struggles in which questions of religion, nationalism, imperialism, and terrorism take on a new and increasingly lethal intensity. A Savage War of Peace is the definitive history of the Algerian War, a book that brings that terrible and complicated struggle to life with intelligence, assurance, and unflagging momentum. It is essential reading for our own violent times as well as a lasting monument to the historian s art.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wuoDDB4Rbz8C&dq=The+Savage+Wars+of+Peace&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The U-boat wars, 1916-1945","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Philosophy of religion","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"VIETNAM A COMPLETE CHRONICLE OF THE WAR","description":"This monumental collection of 2200 images, assembled from Associated Press archives and illuminated with text by Michael Maclear, tells the story of the Vietnam War from 1945 to 1975.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3hT0AAAACAAJ&dq=VIETNAM+A+COMPLETE+CHRONICLE+OF+THE+WAR&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Insiders Guide to Sub Modalities","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Doors of Perception: Icons and Their Spiritual Significance","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"100 Questions & Answers About Your Child's Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (100 Questions & Answers about . . .)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"History from the Heart: Quilt Paths Across Illinois","description":"Surveys Illinois quilts, describes the background of the women who made each quilt, and shares a variety of patterns","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4gjRPAAACAAJ&dq=History+from+the+Heart:+Quilt+Paths+Across+Illinois&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Light","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Elvis Costello Live At The el Mocambo","description":"A guide to the work and life of the British rock musician and composer Elvis Costello.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OT74kH8RJQ0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In Time of Trouble (Growing Up, Taking Hold)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q2WLJa9rY5MC&dq=In+Time+of+Trouble+(Growing+Up,+Taking+Hold)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Catch-22","description":"This fiftieth-anniversary edition commemorates Joseph Heller s masterpiece with a new introduction; critical essays and reviews by Norman Mailer, Alfred Kazin, Anthony Burgess, and others; rare papers and photos; and much more. Nominated as one of America s best-loved novels by PBS s The Great American Read. Soon to be a Hulu limited series starring Christopher Abbott, George Clooney, Kyle Chandler, and Hugh Laurie. Fifty years after its original publication, Catch-22 remains a cornerstone of American literature and one of the funniest and most celebrated books of all time. In recent years it has been named to  best novels  lists by Time, Newsweek, the Modern Library, and the London Observer. Set in Italy during World War II, this is the story of the incomparable, malingering bombardier, Yossarian, a hero who is furious because thousands of people he has never met are trying to kill him. But his real problem is not the enemy it is his own army, which keeps increasing the number of missions the men must fly to complete their service. Yet if Yossarian makes any attempt to excuse himself from the perilous missions he s assigned, he ll be in violation of Catch-22, a hilariously sinister bureaucratic rule: a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes a formal request to be removed from duty, he is proven sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved. This fiftieth-anniversary edition commemorates Joseph Heller s masterpiece with a new introduction by Christopher Buckley; a wealth of critical essays and reviews by Norman Mailer, Alfred Kazin, Anthony Burgess, and others; rare papers and photos from Joseph Heller s personal archive; and much more.

It also furnishes a catalogue of nearly fifteen hundred entries of his reading, compiled from references and allusions in his published writings, journal, correspondence, library charging records, the catalogue of his personal library, and his many unpublished notebooks and commonplace books. This record suggests his literary and intellectual development as a youth primarily interested in classical and early English literature, who matured as a writer investigating contemporary and classical natural science, the history of the European discovery and exploration of North America, and the history of native Americans. The catalogue provides bibliographical data for, and lists all Thoreau's references to, the books and articles that he read. The introductory essay traces the shifts in his literary career marked in the chronology of his reading. The book reveals a Thoreau who was deeply interested in and conversant with the major intellectual questions of his times and whose stance of withdrawal from his age masked a lively involvement with many of its most perplexing questions.

Using data on concealed-carry permit applications from 1998 to 2012, we explore the degree to which individuals respond to crime by applying for permits to legally carry concealed firearms. We find that recent homicide incidents increase concealed-carry applications in areas relatively near to the event. Our main results suggest that an additional homicide in relatively small cities increases applications by 26 percent over the following two months. We also find effects in larger cities when using neighborhood-level data.Our data allow us to explore specific circumstances of crime incidents and the characteristics of responsive applicants. Our results show that gun-related homicides are particularly relevant and that whites and males are most responsive to homicide incidents. We also find evidence that individuals are more responsive to homicide incidents when they share a common characteristic with the victim, particularly for female applicants.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QBsAzwEACAAJ&dq=Concealed+Judgement&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Principles of Intensive Psychotherapy","description":"\\"[This book has] a wealth of clinical and technical detail.

But he was much more than a seemingly impervious shield against Union bullets: a devout Christian, a family man, a gloomy fatalist, an intellectual. Lee s Maverick General makes clear that he was often caught in the crossfire of military politics and ultimately made a scapegoat for the costly, barren victory at Chickamauga. Hal Bridges, drawing on Hill s unpublished papers, offers an outsider s inside views of Lee, Jefferson Davis, Braxton Bragg, James Longstreet, Stonewall Jackson, and others up and down the embattled line.

The author of fifteen New York Times national bestsellers, Ann Rule, a former Seattle policewoman, has researched thousands of homicides and understands every facet of murder investigation. Now, in the most complex and shocking book of her long career, she delves into the motivation that drove a seemingly successful man to kill, and she explores heretofore unknown aspects of a fatal affair between a beautiful young woman who moved confidently in the heady world of the upper echelons of government and a widely admired millionaire attorney who was an immensely popular political figure. On June 27, 1996, thirty-year-old Anne Marie Fahey, who was the scheduling secretary for the governor of Delaware, had dinner with a man she had been having a secret affair with for more than two years. \\"Tommy\\" Capano, forty-seven, was perhaps the most politically powerful man in Wilmington. Son of a wealthy contractor, former state prosecutor, partner in a prestigious law firm, advisor to governors and mayors, Tom Capano had a soft-spoken and considerate manner that endeared him to many. Although recently estranged from his wife, he was a devoted father to his four beautiful young daughters, the trusted son of his widowed mother, and the backbone of his extended family. But sometime after 9:15 that night when Anne Marie and Tom left a Philadelphia restaurant, something terrible happened to Anne Marie. It would be forty-eight hours before her brothers and sisters realized that she had disappeared entirely. Ann Rule brilliantly traces the lives of both Fahey and Capano as she discloses the intimate details of their ill-fated bonding. A vulnerable, trusting woman becomes spellbound by a charming, duplicitous married man, and what begins as a seemingly unremarkable affair is slowly transformed into an obsessive, convoluted, and deadly relationship. Through her impeccable research, Rule peels away layer after layer of deception to reveal a man who lived a secret life for decades, a man so greedy that he would sacrifice anyone to gain what he desired. One of his many mistresses all of whom were unknown to one another was Deborah MacIntyre, an attractive and wealthy member of one of Wilmington's oldest families and an administrator of an elite private school. She, too, would become part of the mystery surrounding Anne Marie's disappearance. As three prominent families are destroyed to satisfy one man's jealous obsessions, this unfathomable tragedy becomes a tale that few would believe if it were presented as fiction. Shockingly, it is all true. Destined to become a classic, And Never Let Her Go is a riveting account of forbidden love and murder among the rich and powerful, and a chilling insight into the evil that sometimes hides behind even the most charming fa?ade.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sSfrBkvh_LQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thinking from Within: A Hands-on Strategy Practice","description":"This text is a tribute to the idea that strategy should be practised in ways that fuel our minds by engaging our bodies.

Fewer of the moments between us feel rehearsed, or forced. And now, just as we had begun to glimpse something like wisdom, glimmering over the horizon, the world smacks the hell out of us. I am strangely grateful, even so, if only for the felt return, in recent days, of the possibility of strong emotion. On the day of the terrorist attacks, a man begins writing down things said by his family and friends. The trauma appears to have marooned diarist David Wyatt in a shell-shocked present tense. But as he experiences all of the emotions of that fall, he is visited by deep memories that transform his daily journal-keeping into an \\"accidental memoir,\\" a narrative that reaches a surprising and moving conclusion on Thanksgiving Day. Juggling the roles of English professor, restaurant owner, husband, father, son, and friend, Wyatt finds sustenance at the core of ordinary American life, resources at once so available and so elusive. Passionate about people, books, food, and landscapes present and lost and absolutely unheroic the voices summoned here counter the sanctimonious and the sentimental. Wyatt s elegantly understated memoir reveals how the events of September 11 affected ordinary people and presents this anthology of thoughts, feelings, and interactions in a frank and immediate voice.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xJ4U0ASBqfIC&dq=And+the+War+Came:+An+Accidental+Memoir&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Conspiracy (Lady Grace Mysteries)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Evil Hours","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Antonov An-2: Annushka, Maid of All Work - Red Star Vol. 15","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Southern Living: Our Best Five-Star Recipes","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Day of a Buddhist Practitioner","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n3R5GwAACAAJ&dq=The+Day+of+a+Buddhist+Practitioner&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life Sketches of Ellen G.

That the artist is constantly working on an elaborate and fantasticated self-portrait, but at the end has drawn, unbeknownst, a picture of the world.\\" -- Clive Barker, \\"Private Legends: An Introduction\\" Clive Barker, award-winning and New York Times bestselling author, playwright, artist, producer, director, screenwriter, and one of the world's master storytellers, writing in the haunting and moving traditions of Poe and Dickens, invites us to join him on a dazzling, wondrous journey through the worlds of his imagination and to experience visions, dreams, love, terror, heaven and hell, and revenge. As we read, we discover and explore the dream-sea Quiddity and the islands of Ephemeris; the five Dominions of the Imajica, of which the Earth is but an imperfect facet; the rapturous world woven into an ancient, threadbare carpet in a derelict house in Liverpool; Hood's Holiday House where each day contains four seasons and children's wishes may come true; the Sky Room of Galilee, where the creation of the universe may be witnessed; and the clubs and bars of San Francisco and New York, in which all manner of sexual adventures lie in wait. In these stories, the real and the miraculous are within a breath of one another, life gives way to death, and death to life; doorways open into other states of existence, and each doorway leads us back to our own dreams and fears. The Essential Clive Barker is an irresistible narrative compendium that superbly represents the impressive quality and range of Barker's fiction, spanning more than twenty years of writing. It contains more than seventy excerpts from novels and plays and four full-length short stories, all personally selected by Barker, and offers a privileged insight into a remarkable writer and his art.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CHapvnVhZEEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oracle PL/SQL Programming: Guide to Oracle8i Features","description":"Introducing the latest PL/SQL features of Oracle8i, this detailed manual discusses autonomous transactions, invoker rights, native dynamic SQL, system-level database triggers, access control, and other valuable topics and provides one hundred files of reusable source code and examples on diskette.

All the light will shine on her husband, and she will wither away in his shadow. But Bethine had been Frank's political partner since their earliest days together and she saw no reason why that would change. And in fact it didn't. In her own winsome words, A Lifelong Affair is the fascinating story of the woman people called \\"The Third Senator from Idaho.\\" Critical chapters of our history, from civil rights battles and the Vietnam War to Senator Church's chairmanship of the Senate Intelligence Committee, come vividly to life here, as does the idealism and love of people that animate Bethine Church's entire career in politics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=m0AhAQAAMAAJ&dq=A+Lifelong+Affair:+My+Passion+for+People+and+Politics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Grand Trunk Railway Photo Album: From Portland, Maine to Island Pond, Vermont","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=osNEGwAACAAJ&dq=Grand+Trunk+Railway+Photo+Album:+From+Portland,+Maine+to+Island+Pond,+Vermont&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dictionary of American Slang","description":"Originally published in 1960, The Dictionary of American Slang is widely regarded as the standard in its field. Expanded and completely updated, this third edition contains more than 19,000 terms of representing the variety and vigor of American slang, from the most widely acceptable to the taboo, and covering all periods of American history -- from the gypsies, soldiers, railroad workers and cowboys of the 19th century to more modern spawning grounds such as the rock 'n' roll world, the corporate sector, African-Americans, gays and lesbians and many more. Intimately connected with the fringes of our culture and responding with vigilance to new developments in technology, slang is the fastest changing part of our language. This new edition considers the subcultures that have emerged in the wake of the past decade's technological and communication advances, including the advent of computer usage at home and in the workplace and the explosion of the Internet and the World Wide Web. With more than 2,000 new terms, the Lexicon of the '90s is recorded here in definitive detail. Like previous editions, this edition features pronunciation guides, word origins, examples of appropriate usage as well as a helpful highlighting system that lets you know which terms should be used with caution, and never in polite company. Both as important archive of the way America is really talking and a lot of fun to read, The Dictionary of American Slang will prove to be an invaluable companion in keeping up with the dauntingly jargon-filled, quickly evolving language of today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Z_BOSAAACAAJ&dq=Dictionary+of+American+Slang&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Daniel Defoe's Moll Flanders: Modern Critical Interpretations.","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Honk If You Love J.

Tolkien s narrative theology, synthesizing his Christian worldview with his creative imagination. She illustrates how, within the framework of a theological aesthetics, transcendental beauty is the unifying principle that integrates all aspects of Tolkien s writing, from pagan despair to Christian joy. J.R.R. Tolkien s Christianity is often held in an unsteady tension with the pagan despair of his mythic world. Some critics portray these as incompatible, while Christian analysis tends to oversimplify the presence of religious symbolism. This polarity of opinion testifies to the need for a unifying interpretive lens. The fact that Tolkien saw his own writing as  religious  and  Catholic,  yet was preoccupied with pagan mythology, nature, language, and evil, suggests that these areas were wholly integrated with his Christian worldview. Tolkien s Theology of Beauty examines six structural elements, demonstrating that the author s Christianity is deeply embedded in the narrative framework of his creative imagination.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zrLIDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Traditional Quilts Today's Techniques","description":"Share the secrets of award-winning quilter Debra Wagner as she shows you how to design and create beautiful quilts of your very own.

Riding on a string of hits like \\"I'm 18\\" and \\"School's Out,\\" they became America's highest-grossing act, producing four platinum albums and hitting number one on the U.S. and U.K. charts with Billion Dollar Babies in 1973. As teenagers in Phoenix, Dennis Dunaway and lead singer Vince Furnier, who would later change his name to Alice Cooper, formed a hard-knuckles band that played prisons, cowboy bars and teen clubs. Their journey took them from Hollywood to the ferocious Detroit music scene. From struggling for recognition to topping the charts, the Alice Cooper group was entertaining, outrageous, and one-of-a-kind. Dennis Dunaway, the bassist and co-songwriter for the band, tells a story just as over-the-top crazy as their (in)famous shows. Snakes! Guillotines! Electric Chairs! is the riveting account of the band's creation in the '60s, strange glory in the '70s, and the legendary characters they met along the way.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=S7oSCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Theodosia (A Pyramid book)","description":"A historical novel about the daughter of Aaron Burr.

The play, written by New England-born, Harvard-educated, Royall Tyler was timely, funny, and extremely popular. When the play appeared in print in 1790, George Washington himself appeared at the head of its list of hundreds of subscribers. Reprinted here with annotated footnotes by historian Cynthia A. Kierner, Tyler s play explores the debate over manners, morals, and cultural authority in the decades following American Revolution. Did the American colonists' rejection of monarchy in 1776 mean they should abolish all European social traditions and hierarchies? What sorts of etiquette, amusements, and fashions were appropriate and beneficial? Most important, to be a nation, did Americans need to distinguish themselves from Europeans and, if so, how? Tyler was not the only American pondering these questions, and Kierner situates the play in its broader historical and cultural contexts. An extensive introduction provides readers with a background on life and politics in the United States in 1787, when Americans were in the midst of nation-building. The book also features a section with selections from contemporary letters, essays, novels, conduct books, and public documents, which debate issues of the era.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=l2y_DAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New Master Course in Hypnotism","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Different Angle: Fly Fishing Stories by Women","description":"Featuring the work of such noted women authors as E.

Yogananda is one of the world's most widely known and universally respected spiritual masters. His Autobiography of a Yogi has helped stimulate a spiritual awakening in the West and a spiritual renaissance in his native land of India. More than half a century ago, in a hilltop ashram in Los Angeles, California, an American disciple sat at the feet of his Master, faithfully recording his words, as his teacher had asked him to do. Paramhansa Yogananda knew this disciple would carry his message to people everywhere. Kriyananda was often present when Yogananda spoke privately with other close disciples; when he received visitors and answered their questions; when he was dictating and discussing his important writings. Yogananda put Kriyananda in charge of the other monks, and gave him advice for their spiritual development. In all these situations, Kriyananda recorded the words and guidance of Yogananda, preserving for the ages wisdom that would otherwise have been lost, and giving us an intimate glimpse of life with Yogananda never before shared by any other student. These Conversations include not only Yogananda's words as he first spoke them, but also the added insight of an intimate disciple who has spent more than 50 years reflecting on and practicing the teachings of Yogananda. Through these Conversations, Yogananda comes alive. Time and space dissolve. We sit at the feet of the Master, listen to his words, receive his wisdom, delight in his humor, and are transformed by his love.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZsAyEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Differential Equations with Boundary Value Problems: A Systems Approach","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=u2xCAAAACAAJ&dq=Differential+Equations+with+Boundary+Value+Problems:+A+Systems+Approach&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Memoirs: Ten Years and Twenty Days","description":"The story of the last world war, as told by Grand Admiral Karl Doenitz himself.

An Intimate Loneliness explores how family members attempt to come to terms with the death of an offspring or brother or sister. Drawing on relevant research and the authors' own experience of working with bereaved parents and siblings, this book examines the importance of social relationships in helping parents and siblings adjust to their bereavement. The chances of making sense of this most distressing loss are influenced by the resilience of the family's surviving relationships, by the availability of wider support networks and by the cultural resources that inform each's perception of death. This book considers the impact of bereavement on self and family identity. In particular, it examines the role of shared remembering in transforming survivors' relationships with the deceased, and in helping rebuild their own identity with a significantly changed family structure. Problems considered include: the failure of intimate relationships, cultural and gender expectations, the invisibility of fathers' and siblings' grief, sudden and 'difficult' deaths, lack of information, and the sense of isolation felt by some family members. This book will be of value to students on courses in counselling, health care, psychology, social policy, pastoral care and education. It will appeal to sociology students with an interest in death, dying and mortality. It is also aimed at professionally qualified counselling, health and social service workers, at informed voluntary group members, the clergy, teachers and others involved with pastoral care.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CQ_oAAAAQBAJ&dq=An+Intimate+Loneliness+(Facing+Death)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crystalline Communion 2000","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"All Souls","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Before the Heart Attacks: A Revolutionary Approach to Detecting, Preventing, and Even Reversing Heart Disease","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Scouts of Stonewall: The Story of the Great Valley Campaign (His Civil War Series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Dream Brother: The Lives and Music of Jeff and Tim Buckley","description":"When Jeff Buckley drowned at the age of thirty in 1997, he not only left behind a legacy of brilliant music -- he brought back haunting memories of his father, '60s troubadour Tim Buckley, a gifted musician who barely knew his son and who himself died at twenty-eight. Both father and son made transcendent music that mixed rock, jazz, and folk; both amassed a cadre of obsessive, adoring fans. This absorbing dual biography -- based on interviews with more than one hundred friends, family members, and business associates as well as access to journals and unreleased recordings -- tells for the first time the intriguing, often heartbreaking story of these two musicians. It offers a new understanding of the Buckleys' parallel lives -- and tragedies -- while exploring the changing music business between the '60s and the '90s. Finally, it tells the story of a father and son, two complex, enigmatic men who died searching for themselves and each other.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vH7giNIEmHkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Puccini;: A critical biography","description":"The life and works of Giacomo Puccini, composer of La Boheme, Madama Butterfly, Tosca, Turnadot, and other universal operatic favorites, are here presented in detail for the first time in any language in a book unlikely ever to be superseded. A full-length recounting of Puccini's fascinating life, rich in previously unused materials, is followed by detailed analyses of each of his operas and other compositions. The author, a Viennese conductor and musicologist, has performed this monumental task with knowledge, grace, and insight. The biography brings to life a curious, somewhat ambiguous man whose greatly successful career was marked alternately by storms, tragedies, and triumphs, a genius who somehow missed the final greatness. His relations with his family, colleagues, librettists, singers, conductors--and his peculiar, convoluted relationship with his wife--have some of the very drama that has made his operas so enduringly popular. Puccini's letters are quoted extensively, many of them in English for the first time. The opera analyses, constantly evaluating the music in terms of drama and libretto, are unique in musical literature and in their completeness and illumination. They are, furthermore, judicious and soundly musical, for instead of accepting ready-made opinions (many of which are quoted), they go directly to the scores themselves.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-wIIAQAAMAAJ&dq=Puccini%3B:+A+critical+biography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Healing with Pressure Point Therapy: Simple, Effective Techniques for Massaging Away More Than 100 Common Ailments","description":"This comprehensive guide shows readers how to treat common health problems using a variety of pressure point therapies: acupressure, shiatsu, reflexology, acu-yoga, and trigger-point therapy.

He brings to life and unifies the many observations, emotions and subtle and not-so-subtle actions that revolve around the person of God the Son as he faces his most tragic and triumphant moment. The author s unique approach intersperses Scripture accounts with the commentary of an incisive narrator who sifts and judges from the span of hundreds of years. He draws from the obvious as well as the obscure, and finds supernatural meaning in the most mundane actions that surround the suffering Christ. In the hands of this writer, the Lord s few words, accompanied by the author s commentary, challenge contemporary believers as much as they did those who first followed in the footsteps of Christ and his apostles. The author was born in 1869 in Lancashire, northern England and educated at the prominent Catholic college, Stonyhurst, which has been the source of many English Catholic politicians, intellectuals and business people. After a degree from the University of London, he was ordained a Jesuit in 1903. He served as archbishop of Bombay from 1919 to 1926 and returned to England to write and serve as a chaplain until his death in 1939.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_UGfDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The whole mystery of art;: Pattern into poetry in the work of W.

With the onset of puberty, Georgia watches the omnipresent feeling of not being normal cast a destructive pall over nearly everything George attempts. After the collapse of his lifelong dream, George begins again with hopes, new dreams and the love they ve both longed for. Georgia finally emerges, but understanding her part in their soul comes slowly and is complicated by a tragedy of profound proportion.

History is simply the interaction of our lives with each other and with nature. It begins with acts of adventure, courage, blind ambition, greed, and folly that are then recorded. Without accurate recording, we wouldn't know that Napoleon used a sandbox to construct his battle plans and transmitted messages to troops using semaphore, and that Christopher Columbus thought he'd landed in India instead of America - thus the name Indians for the local people there. Historical Atlas is a comprehensive history of the world to date. Learn everything from the gruesome detail of Nero's torture of Christians to the methods Kublai Khan used to select his concubines. Who did Marco Polo meet along the Silk Road and how did a lowly carpenter influence so much of the world's religion? The world as we know it is nothing more than the sum of Earth's history. Every event in time is influenced and guided by humankind and we cannot begin to know what might happen until we understand what has already occurred. Beginning with the origins of humankind and the migration of people around the globe, the Historical Atlas details the remarkable historical events that guide our future. Covering all of recorded time, this book moves effortlessly through the eons of our existence, cementing the path of our development, culture, and expectations. Historical Atlas presents hundreds of specially commissioned maps, detailed with symbols and icons that reveal a full and vivid image of the individual events of history. Each time period is divided into areas of the world so that overlapping events are contained within the boundaries of their geographic and chronological eras. The narrative is fresh and modern, revealing our history with zest and vigor. Each period is also illustrated with images that lure us into the era. Divided into chronological order and continents, the book is a cartographic narrative of humankind's time on Earth to the present.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q3B2PgAACAAJ&dq=World+Historical+Atlas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Skousen Book of Mormon World Records: And Other Amazing Firsts, Facts, and Feats","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Recipes: American Cooking (Foods of the World)","description":"Discusses the cuisines of India and presents a great variety of traditional Indian recipes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YQszvwEACAAJ&dq=Recipes:+American+Cooking+(Foods+of+the+World)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hauntings Is There Anybody Out There","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Get Top $$$ (Dollar) in A Job You Love!","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U2ep041UZdwC&dq=Get+Top+%24%24%24+(Dollar)+in+A+Job+You+Love!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Indigenous People's Rights in Australia, Canada and New Zealand","description":"ALAN WARD AND JANINE HAYWARD","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XF-PAAAAMAAJ&dq=Indigenous+People%27s+Rights+in+Australia,+Canada+and+New+Zealand&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Community-Based Corrections","description":"Objective, comprehensive, and up-to-date, the eleventh edition of best-selling COMMUNITY-BASED CORRECTIONS provides an excellent introduction to the theory, procedures, evidence-based practices, and personnel involved in community-based corrections.

Natural disasters. Domestic crackdowns. Economic collapse. Riots. Wars. Disease. Starvation. What can you do when it all hits the fan? You can learn to be self-sufficient and survive without the system. **I've started to look at the world through apocalypse eyes.** So begins Neil Strauss's harrowing new book: his first full-length worksince the international bestseller The Game, and one of the most original-and provocative-narratives of the year. After the last few years of violence and terror, of ethnic and religious hatred, of tsunamis and hurricanesand now of world financial meltdownStrauss, like most of his generation, came to the sobering realization that, even in America, anything can happen. But rather than watch helplessly, he decided to do something about it. And so he spent three years traveling through a country that's lost its sense of safety, equipping himself with the tools necessary to save himself and his loved ones from an uncertain future. With the same quick wit and eye for cultural trends that marked The Game, The Dirt, and How to Make Love Like a Porn Star, Emergency traces Neil's white-knuckled journey through today's heart of darkness, as he sets out to move his life offshore, test his skills in the wild, and remake himself as a gun-toting, plane-flying, government-defying survivor. It's a tale of paranoid fantasies and crippling doubts, of shady lawyers and dangerous cult leaders, of billionaire gun nuts and survivalist superheroes, of weirdos, heroes, and ordinary citizens going off the grid. It's one man's story of a dangerous worldand how to stay alive in it. Before the next disaster strikes, you're going to want to read this book. And you'll want to do everything it suggests. Because tomorrow doesn't come with a guarantee...","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UnjqPCANbFIC&dq=Emergency&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mycology in Sustainable Development: Expanding Concepts, Vanishing Borders","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Introduction to existentialism (Phoenix books)","description":"First published in 1948 under title: Dreadful freedom, a critique of existentialism.

Now, in his newest and most ambitious book, he turns his focus to one of the bloodiest and most tragic events of the twentieth century, the Second World War.

The result is a dramatic and breathtaking single-volume history that provides a remarkably intimate account of the war that, more than any other, still commands attention and an audience. Thrillingly written and brilliantly researched, Beevor's grand and provocative account is destined to become the definitive work on this complex, tragic, and endlessly fascinating period in world history, and confirms once more that he is a military historian of the first rank.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XS8xlDaZVJMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pittsylvania County (Virginia publick claims)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sO0POgAACAAJ&dq=Pittsylvania+County+(Virginia+publick+claims)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"\\"Progress and poverty,\\" a criticism of Mr. Henry George: Being two lectures delivered in St. Andrew's Hall, Newman Street, London","description":"Excerpt from Progress and Poverty: A Criticism of Mr. Henry George, Being Two Lectures Delivered in St. Andrew's Hall, Newman Street, London The book which Mr. George wrote between 1877 and 1879 is, as we all know, a remarkable one. It is full of acute dialectic and splendid declamation full, as I said in my opening remarks, of a real and keen sympathy with the people. Indeed, as he tells us in his book, he might well sympathise with the people, for he had been a work man himself. Nevertheless, remarkable as the book is, original as the book is - not so original as many of us suppose, not so original if we come to look back upon American economic literature - it has yet, in spite Of partial truths, promulgated errors which I believe to be fundamentally dangerous. And I, for one, seeing how much wrong the economists have done in the past by false theories, remembering that the economists for years denounced Trades Unions, and told the unionists thatthey could not raise the rate of wages by combination; remembering that the economists have sometimes in?uenced legislation in the past in a mischievous direction, that they were guilty, for instance, Of the Irish Land Act of 1860, which substi tuted contract for tenure; I am determined that, as far as in me lies, I will be no party to any more illusions. I will do what I can to further the public good, but I will not sacrifice my intellectual conscience by supporting a fair, but delusive panacea.

In The Geometry of Meaning, Peter G?rdenfors proposes a theory of semantics that bridges cognitive science and linguistics and shows how theories of cognitive processes, in particular concept formation, can be exploited in a general semantic model. He argues that our minds organize the information involved in communicative acts in a format that can be modeled in geometric or topological terms in what he terms conceptual spaces, extending the theory he presented in an earlier book by that name. Many semantic theories consider the meanings of words as relatively stable and independent of the communicative context. G?rdenfors focuses instead on how various forms of communication establish a system of meanings that becomes shared between interlocutors. He argues that these  meetings of mind  depend on the underlying geometric structures, and that these structures facilitate language learning. Turning to lexical semantics, G?rdenfors argues that a unified theory of word meaning can be developed by using conceptual spaces. He shows that the meaning of different word classes can be given a cognitive grounding, and offers semantic analyses of nouns, adjectives, verbs, and prepositions. He also presents models of how the meanings of words are composed to form new meanings and of the basic semantic role of sentences. Finally, he considers the future implications of his theory for robot semantics and the Semantic Web.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vL34DwAAQBAJ&dq=Geometry+and+Meaning&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Exploring America's Highways: Wisconsin Trip Trivia (American Midwest)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Timothy goes to school","description":"Timothy starts school happily, but then he meets Claude, the smartest kid and the best at everything, and Timothy is miserable until Violet becomes his friend, in a new edition of a title first published in 1981.

She found people who had sacrificed their lives for their art, who worked in all weathers, perfecting some of the most dramatic and beautiful acts ever seen. She found third-generation show-people who travelled around forgotten parts of Britain to bring their abstract, polished, multi-layered show to ever dwindling audiences. She found herself in an art form that soon, if we are not careful, we will lose. Whilst she has lived and worked among the circus people for several years, she is not one of them: she was not born in the circus. In their words she is a 'josser' a person in the circus from the outside world. This is her story. 'The circus does cast a spell over some people. I felt overwhelmed by it. The circus filled up existence and left room for nothing else.

He lives on Vancouver Island, a place of uncommon beauty, where the climate is mild, the air is soft, and the growing season lasts nearly all year long. Lane has gardened for as long as he can remember, and sees his garden's life as intertwined with his own. And when he gave up drinking, after years of addiction, he found solace and healing in tending to his yard. In this exquisitely written memoir, he relates stories of his hard early life in the context of the landscape he's created. As he observes the seasonal changes, a plant or a bird or the way a tree bends in the wind brings to mind an episode from his storied past. Lane writes evocative descriptions of the animals, birds, insects, and plants that are his garden, and of the relationship he has to them all. Accompany Lane as he wanders his garden, where botanical  madeleines  release in him a flood of memory.

Together, these sources provide a captivating mosaic of Chinese women's experiences in their own words, as they tell of making a home for themselves and their families in San Francisco from the Gold Rush years through World War II. The personal nature of these documents makes for compelling reading. We hear the voices of prostitutes and domestic slavegirls, immigrant wives of merchants, Christians and pagans, homemakers, and social activists alike. We read the stories of daughters who confronted cultural conflicts and racial discrimination; the myriad ways women coped with the Great Depression; and personal contributions to the causes of women's emancipation, Chinese nationalism, workers' rights, and World War II. The symphony of voices presented here lends immediacy and authenticity to our understanding of the Chinese American women's lives. This rich collection of women's stories also serves to demonstrate collective change over time as well as to highlight individual struggles for survival and advancement in both private and public spheres. An educational tool on researching and reclaiming women's history, Unbound Voices offers us a valuable lesson on how one group of women overcame the legacy of bound feet and bound lives in America. The selections are accompanied by photographs, with extensive introductions and annotation by Judy Yung, a noted authority on primary resources relating to the history of Chinese American women.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FIsIp_5xH_gC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Note: A Story of Second Chances","description":"When the unthinkable happens . . .

Clarke explains how Tupperware tapped into potent commercial and social forces, becoming a prevailing symbol of late twentieth-century consumer culture. Invented by Earl Tupper in the 1940s to promote thrift and cleanliness, the pastel plasticwares were touted as essential to a postwar lifestyle that emphasized casual entertaining and celebrated America's material abundance. By the mid-1950s the Tupperware party, which gathered women in a hostess's home for lively product demonstrations and sales, was the foundation of a multimillion-dollar business that proved as innovative as the containers themselves. Clarke shows how the  party plan  direct sales system, by creating a corporate culture based on women's domestic lives, played a greater role than patented seals and streamlined design in the success of Tupperware.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dadqBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Business Week Guide to the Best Business Schools (4th ed)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Lives and legends of flamenco;: A biographical history","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Spectre of Comparisons","description":"A controversial collection from the author of the celebrated Imagined Communities.

Those collected in this new book span a range of subjects: from Aquino's Philippines, where the horses on the haciendas ate better than the stable-hands, to political assassination in contemporary Thailand, where government posts have become so lucrative that to gain them candidates will kill their rivals. In these writing, the subtle imbrication of politics, national imaginings, bureaucracy, modernization and its agents (particularly print culture) is brought out in all its complexity and richness. \\"The spectre of comparisons\\" was a phrase used by the celebrated Filipino nationalist and novelist Jose Rizal (1861-96), whose work and fate in the national imagination are discussed in these pages. In his finely wrought observations on Southeast Asian societies, Anderson raises deep questions concerning this spectre, about how, for instance, Manila is changed when it can no longer be seen through a comparison with European capitals, and how, more broadly, nationalism is produce by the process of increasing global connection. The Spectre of Comparisons is an indispensable resource for those interested in South-East Asia. But it also contains important theoretical and historical considerations about nationalism, national literature and memory, modernization, and the prospects for the Left in what Anderson dubs 'The New World Disorder'.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w8eypkzAcNoC&dq=The+Spectre+of+Comparisons&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crisis of the Old Order (Age of Roosevelt)","description":"The first of three books that interpret the political, economic, social, and intellectual history of the early twentieth century in terms of Franklin D.

The War of 1812 hastened the development of nineteenth-century ideals, and the Civil War uprooted certain growths of those vigorous years. The half century between these dramatic episodes was a period of extravagant vigor, the final outcome being the emergence of a new middle class. Parrington argues that America was becoming a new world with undreamed potential. This new era was no longer content with the ways of a founding generation. The older America of colonial days had been static, rationalistic, inclined to pessimism, and fearful of innovation. During the years between the Peace of Paris (1763) and the end of the War of 1812, older America was dying. The America that emerged, which is the focal point of this volume, was a shifting, restless world, eager to better itself, bent on finding easier roads to wealth than the plodding path of natural increase. The culture of this period also changed. Formal biographies written in this period often gave way to eulogy; it was believed that a writer was under obligation to speak well of the dead. Consequently, scarcely a single commentary of the times can be trusted, and the critic is reduced to patching together his account out of scanty odds and ends. A new introduction by Bruce Brown highlights the life of Vernon Louis Parrington and explains the importance of this second volume in the Pulitzer Prize-winning study.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=d_BbtAEACAAJ&dq=The+Romantic+Revolution+in+America+1800-1860&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Frommer's Gay & Lesbian Europe","description":"Rates and describes the hot spots, attractions, nightlife, accommodations, local customs, nude beaches, and restaurants.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uEIsAQAAMAAJ&dq=Frommer%27s+Gay&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"X-Rays From Laser Plasmas: Generation and Applications","description":"Soft X-rays have great potential for use in a wide variety of applications, including the semiconductor industry and the life sciences.

Ronald Dore went to Shinohata twenty years ago when he was studying the land reform which broke the power of Japan's landlords. He went back many times thereafter to stay with friends. Now he has distilled his memories, field notes, diaries, and some recent forays with a tape recorder into a book which brings to life the village and its people, and vividly portrays the stunning transformation of Japanese village life. Shinohatais a story of extraordinary change from the traditional values and relationships to typically modern pursuits and aspirations that accompanied the post-war prosperity. Ronald Dore's gift for combining a sympathetic, and often humorous, response to unique individuals with the sociologist's ability to discern and analyze patterns make this an unusual and fascinating book.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8d5mXZdyjxAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Logic of Failure: Why Things Go Wrong and What We Can Do to Make Them Right","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Office 97 Answers!

At the same time, the author provides a window into the broader struggle for democracy and justice.Simpson points out that through analyzing city council floor fights, battles at the ballot box, and street demonstrations, one can begin to see certain patterns of conflict emerge. These patterns demonstrate that before the Great Depression, fragmented city councils were dominant. The author also discusses how since the Democrats seized control of Chicago government after the Great Depression, Rubber Stamp City Councils have been predominant, although they have been punctuated by brief eras of council wars and chaos. This book is important for anyone wanting to understand the nature of these battles as a guideline for America's future, and is well suited for courses in urban politics, affairs and history.Rogues, Rebels, and Rubber Stamps received an Honorable Mention for the 2001 Society of Midland Authors Book Award for Adult Non-Fiction.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jQlQDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Black Man's Religion: Can Christianity Be Afrocentric?","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Oxford Guide to the United States Government","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Technique of Film Editing: Basic Principles for TV","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DorETRcSqg8C&dq=The+Technique+of+Film+Editing:+Basic+Principles+for+TV&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Termites and Borers: A Homeowner's Guide","description":"In Termites and Borers you will learn about termite life-cycles, habits and their natural instincts.

In Captain Ahab Had a Wife, Lisa Norling taps a rich vein of sources--including women's and men's letters and diaries, shipowners' records, Quaker meeting minutes and other church records, newspapers and magazines, censuses, and city directories--to reconstruct the lives of the \\"Cape Horn widows\\" left behind onshore. Norling begins with the emergence of colonial whalefishery on the island of Nantucket and then follows the industry to mainland New Bedford in the nineteenth century, tracking the parallel shift from a patriarchal world to a more ambiguous Victorian culture of domesticity. Through the sea-wives' compelling and often poignant stories, Norling exposes the painful discrepancies between gender ideals and the reality of maritime life and documents the power of gender to shape both economic development and individual experience.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hMQ3CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Playboy October 1982 Hot!

Arguing that there was a common foundation beneath the diverse strands of thought of this period, he shows how Enlightenment philosophers drew upon the ideas of the preceding centuries even while radically transforming them to fit the modern world. In Cassirer's view, the Enlightenment liberated philosophy from the realm of pure thought and restored it to its true place as an active and creative force through which knowledge of the world is achieved. In a new foreword, Peter Gay considers The Philosophy of the Enlightenment in the context in which it was written--Germany in 1932, on the precipice of the Nazi seizure of power and one of the greatest assaults on the ideals of the Enlightenment. He also argues that Cassirer's work remains a trenchant defense against enemies of the Enlightenment in the twenty-first century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OPmPDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Philosophy+of+the+Enlightenment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Family Jewels: A gay comedic mystery","description":"The young antiquarian from an old Boston family and his sister had just inherited their aunt's Back Bay town house.

As dusk falls they make passionate love in a meadow. And then she is dead, her body found nestled against blackberry brambles. Even though the evidence is inconclusive, Arbogast is tried for murder, convicted, and sentenced to life imprisonment, all the while protesting his innocence. But Germany during the postwar years has no tolerance for scandal; all appeals are denied. For the next fourteen years he grows to inhabit his cell like a second skin, until finally a journalist, lawyer, and forensic pathologist from East Berlin set out to reexamine the evidence and have the case reopened. Inspired by an actual criminal case that caused a furor at the time, The Arbogast Case elegantly weaves dramatic courtroom scenes with detailed forensic descriptions and authentic details of the grim postwar era. The result is a compelling legal thriller in which erotic love and death are intimately intertwined, by a young German writer whose lyrical style and utter originality have brought him renown throughout Europe and is now being published in English for the first time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4jf0YTzkhcQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Palm Therapy: Program Your Mind Through Your Palms-A Major Breakthrough in Palmistry","description":"Palm Therapy is a new discovery which may forever alter the way we view palmistry - an innovative & efficient therapy. \\"I cannot deny the remarkable results occurring in such a short period of time\\", Daphna Slonim, M.D., Diplomate, American Board of Psychiatry & Neurology.

Beginning in 1951 when black high school students protested unequal facilities and continuing through the return of whites to public schools in the 1970s and 1980s, Bonastia describes the struggle over education during the civil rights era and the human suffering that came with it, as well as the inspiring determination of black residents to see justice served.

A methodology that was developed to solve physics problems, MS has been used to study the relation between microscopic behavior and macroscopic phenomena in systems ranging from those of atomic particles, to cars, animals, and even humans. In finance, MS can help explain, among other things, the effects of various elements of investor behavior on market dynamics and asset pricing. It is these issues in particular, and the value of an MS approach to finance in general, that are the subjects of this book. The authors not only put their work in perspective by surveying traditional economic analyses of investor behavior, but they also briefly examine the use of MS in fields other than finance. Most models in economics and finance assume that investors are rational. However, experimental studies reveal systematic deviations from rational behavior. How can we determine the effect of investors' deviations from rational behavior on asset prices and market dynamics? By using Microscopic Simulation, a methodology originally developed by physicists for the investigation of complex systems, the authors are able to relax classical assumptions about investor behavior and to model it as empirically and experimentally observed. This rounded and judicious introduction to the application of MS in finance and economics reveals that many of the empirically-observed \\"puzzles\\" in finance can be explained by investors' quasi-rationality. Researchers use the book because it models heterogeneous investors, a group that has proven difficult to model. Being able to predict how people will invest and setting asset prices accordingly is inherently appealing, and the combination of computing power and statistical mechanics in this book makes such modeling possible. Because many finance researchers have backgrounds in physics, the material here is accessible.

But his arrest on drugs charges in 1967 sent him into a drink-and-drugs fuelled depression and his life slipped out of control. It was then that he met Anna Wohlin. He pursued her relentlessly, and they fell in love. How could they have guessed that a trivial domestic dispute would result in the most puzzling death in rock 'n' roll history? Anna was a witness on that tragic summer evening. In this book, she breaks her silence to tell the truth about July 3, 1969 the night Brian Jones was killed.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zN5TMwEACAAJ&dq=Murder+of+Brian+Jones&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Used Aircraft Guide (2 volume set)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Ultimate Guide to Weight Training for Basketball (Ultimate Guide to Weight Training for Sports) (Ultimate Guide to Weight Training for Basketball) ...

He attacks White racism and Black self-victimization with equal vehemence. He condemns integration as a disastrous policy, not for just Blacks but for the entire country. And he confronts the Black Talented Tenth, White liberals, conservatives, Democrats, Republicans, demagogues, and racists on all sides for their self-serving lies, their failures, and their lack of vision.

All this has undermined the credibility of lawyers and the authority of the legal system. In the court of public opinion, many lawyers these days are guiltier than the criminals or giant corporations they defend. Is the public right? In this eye-opening, incisive book, Richard Zitrin and Carol Langford, two practicing lawyers and distinguished law professors, shine a penetrating light on the question everyone is asking: Why do lawyers behave the way they do? All across the country, lawyers view certain behavior as \\"ethical\\" while average citizens judge that same conduct \\"immoral.\\" Now, with expert analysis of actual cases ranging from murder to class action suits, Zitrin and Langford investigate lawyers' behavior and its impact on our legal system.

Even so, theoretical and mathematical concepts are introduced and developed sufficiently to make the book a self-contained source of instruction for readers without prior knowledge of the basic principles of the field. The work is the product of the technical staff of The Analytic Sciences Corporation (TASC), an organization whose success has resulted largely from its applications of optimal estimation techniques to a wide variety of real situations involving large-scale systems. Arthur Gelb writes in the Foreword that \\"It is our intent throughout to provide a simple and interesting picture of the central issues underlying modern estimation theory and practice. Heuristic, rather than theoretically elegant, arguments are used extensively, with emphasis on physical insights and key questions of practical importance.\\" Numerous illustrative examples, many based on actual applications, have been interspersed throughout the text to lead the student to a concrete understanding of the theoretical material. The inclusion of problems with \\"built-in\\" answers at the end of each of the nine chapters further enhances the self-study potential of the text. After a brief historical prelude, the book introduces the mathematics underlying random process theory and state-space characterization of linear dynamic systems. The theory and practice of optimal estimation is them presented, including filtering, smoothing, and prediction. Both linear and non-linear systems, and continuous- and discrete-time cases, are covered in considerable detail. New results are described concerning the application of covariance analysis to non-linear systems and the connection between observers and optimal estimators. The final chapters treat such practical and often pivotal issues as suboptimal structure, and computer loading considerations. This book is an outgrowth of a course given by TASC at a number of US Government facilities.

Like their fellow elementals - salamanders (fire), sylphs (air), and gnomes (earth) - undines are united with, and personify, their element. First mentioned in the alchemical works of medieval botanist Paracelsus, undines appear throughout European folklore. Who are these mysterious creatures of lakes, oceans, and waterfalls? Undines takes readers directly into the water spirits' realm through stories, personal encounters, and interviews with such luminaries as Istiphul, the undine queen whose presence embodies the magical essence of the feminine. Whether seen as fact or fairy tale, Undines presents archetypal truths and insights into human nature. The powers and abilities that undines display are latent in us all and crucial to humanity's evolution (or mere survival): harmony with nature, empathy and compassion, a deep capacity to love, and a cooperative rather than combative relationship to the world. Undines will appeal broadly to readers of mythology, fantasy, and fairy tales, particularly to practitioners that work with nature spirits and elemental beings - Druids, Wiccans, pagans, and those interested in magic and mysticism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=u9gYMAEACAAJ&dq=Spirits+of+the+Water+(Spirits+of+the+Elements)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dangerous Games (Nancy Drew & Hardy Boys Super Mysteries #4)","description":"A Nancy Drew/Hardy Boys Super Mystery #4.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nZkgAAAACAAJ&dq=Dangerous+Games+(Nancy+Drew&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Fundamentalist Education: A Memoir of a Divine Girlhood","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Friends in Need: Circle of Friends (The Circle of Friends Series)","description":" [An] irresistible invitation to share the lives of people who believe in enduring values.

The book cannot be said to be a military history in the strictest sense, even the units involved being unidentified, but the events described are, as the author points out in his introduction, as nearly accurate as memory allowed after a lapse of over thirty years.

Her memoir records with lighthearted humor and wisdom not only the difficulties she faced the resistance of her parents, the sacrifices of her training but also the frontier atmosphere of early Hollywood and New York and London during the Depression.  This is the story of an American dancer,  writes de Mille,  a spoiled egocentric wealthy girl, who learned with difficulty to become a worker, to set and meet standards, to brace a Victorian sensibility to contemporary roughhousing, and who, with happy good fortune, participated by the side of great colleagues in a renaissance of the most ancient and magical of all the arts.

Some of the richest poetic descriptions of depression, anxiety, and desperate hope can be found within Sexton s work. The Complete Poems, which includes the eight collections published during her life, two posthumously published books, and other poems collected after her death, brings together her remarkable body of work with all of its range of emotion. With her first collection, the haunting To Bedlam and Part Way Back, Sexton stunned critics with her frank treatment of subjects like masturbation, incest, and abortion, blazing a trail for representations of the body, particularly the female body, in poetry. She documented four years of mental illness in her moving Pulitzer Prizewinning collection Live or Die, and reimagined classic fairy tales as macabre and sardonic poems in Transformations.

The context in which a graduate text on quantum mechanics is studied today has changed a good deal, however. In 1966, most entering physics graduate students had a quite limited exposure to quan tum mechanics in the form of wave mechanics. Today the standard undergraduate curriculum contains a large dose of elementary quantum mechanics, and often intro duces the abstract formalism due to Dirac. Back then, the study of the foundations by theorists and experimenters was close to dormant, and very few courses spent any time whatever on this topic. At that very time, however, John Bell's famous theorem broke the ice, and there has been a great flowering ever since, especially in the laboratory thanks to the development of quantum optics, and more recently because of the interest in quantum computing. And back then, the Feynman path integral was seen by most as a very imaginative but rather useless formulation of quantum mechanics, whereas it now plays a large role in statistical physics and quantum field theory, especially in computational work. For these and other reasons, this book is not just a revision of the 1966 edition. It has been rewritten throughout, is differently organized, and goes into greater depth on many topics that were in the old edition.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=D4vaBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ordeal of Samar 1ST Edition","description":"\\"American acquisition of the Philippines in 1898 became a focal point for debate on American imperialism and the course the country was to take now that the Western frontier had been conquered. U.S. military leaders in Manila, unequipped to understand the aspirations of the native revolutionary movement, failed to respond to Filipino overtures of accommodation and provoked a war with the revolutionary army. Back home, an impressive opposition to the war developed on largely ideological grounds, but in the end it was the interminable and increasingly bloody guerrilla warfare that disillusioned America in its imperialistic venture. This book presents a searching exploration of the history of America's reactions to Asian people, politics, and wars of independence.\\" -- Book Jacket","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Zj6g2ag47TwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Blackwell Companion to Christian Ethics (Blackwell Companions to Religion)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Mr. Putter & Tabby Pour the Tea","description":"Mr. Putter gets an old cat to share his life with him.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=f8ioADcDuQgC&dq=Mr.+Putter&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Miss Renee's Mice Go to an Exhibition","description":"Miss Ren e's mice pester her until she agrees to take them all to a miniatures show at a posh Portland hotel.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fiGqngEACAAJ&dq=Miss+Renee%27s+Mice+Go+to+an+Exhibition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mac OS X v. 10.2 Jaguar Killer Tips","description":"Mac OS X Killer Tips is not another newbie book.

This edited and abridged volume omits the portions of the trilogy that dealt principally with the technical aspects of Freud s work and is designed for the lay reader. Jones portrays Freud s childhood and adolescence; the excitement and trials of his four-year engagement to Martha Bernays; his early experiments with hypnotism and cocaine; the slow rise of his reputation and constant battles against distortion and slander; the painful defections of close associates; the years of international eminence; the onset of cancer and his stoicism in the face of an agonizing death.

Dr. Jones has managed to illuminate some obscure corners of Freud s first years with a thoroughness that would have astonished, and might well have dismayed, the reticent and august Freud.

Collectively, they are portrayed as passive victims of European colonization and government policy, and, even when well intentioned, these depictions are demeaning and do little to truly represent the role Aboriginal peoples have played in Canadian life. Hidden in Plain Sight adds another dimension to the story, showing the extraordinary contributions Aboriginal peoples have made  and continue to make  to the Canadian experience. From treaties to contemporary arts and literatures, Aboriginal peoples have helped to define Canada and have worked to secure a place of their own making in Canadian culture. For this volume, editors David R. Newhouse, Cora J. Voyageur, and Daniel J.K. Beavon have brought together leading scholars and other impassioned voices, and together, they give full treatment to the Aboriginal contribution to Canada's intellectual, political, economic, social, historic, and cultural landscapes. Included are profiles of several leading figures such as actor Chief Dan George, artist Norval Morrisseau, author Tomson Highway, activist Anna Mae Pictou Aquash, and politician Phil Fontaine, among others. Canada simply would not be what it is today without these contributions. The first of two volumes, Hidden in Plain Sight is key to understanding and appreciating Canadian society and will be essential reading for generations to come.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=u_KHdgEr61UC&dq=Hidden+in+Plain+Sight:+Contributions+of+Aboriginal+Peoples+to+Canadian+Identity+and+Culture,+Volume+1&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All-Star - Book 4 (High-Intermediate - Low Advanced) - Student Book (Bk. 4)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"My Cousin, My Gastroenterologist","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Garbo","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MgbbAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Girl+Who+Loved+Garbo&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"JSP and Java: The Complete Guide to Website Development","description":"This book highlights the benefits of web development using Java tools.

Often the adults who read these books say, I wish someone had told me that when I was a kid; it might have helped me so much. Unfortunately, not much has been written for the kids who are coping in the present with difficult or troubled parents. This book is written out of the belief that intelligent kids can use sound ideas to improve their lives, either on their own or with the help of healthy adults. It will offer help in sorting out whether a difficult situation may be a result of a parent s problems. In this new third edition, changes have been made throughout in order to update and refine the author s ideas. Two new chapters have been added, as well. The first new chapter addresses parents who tell lies. Dishonest parents are motivated in several different ways, but all dishonest parents pose special problems for their children. The second chapter discusses the idea that all parents have problems some of the time. In this chapter, the author helps young people look at the challenges posed by recognizing that all parents, even excellent ones, have shortcomings, and it differentiates between the ordinary shortcomings that all parents have and more serious problems in parenting. This book is an excellent resource for therapists, school counselors, group leaders, and others who work with children and teenagers and who want reading materials to recommend to them.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bBeJDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lee's Lieutenants, Vol. III: Gettysburg to Appomattox","description":"Volume one of a three volume set which describes the military personalities and tactics during the American Civil War, presenting the stories and military campaigns of the Army of Northern Virginia under the direction of Robert E.

With a view toward uncovering a basic unity in the theology of the New Testament, Balla maps how the historian may indeed describe the theological content of the New Testament. He asserts that orthodoxy was not a later development but Christianity in its earliest form. He further avers that the canon s formation was not the result of a late decision; rather, it can be traced to moorings in the first century. Sure to be controversial, Challenges to New Testament Theology holds great promise as a textbook in New Testament courses and as a starting point in the scholarly discussion of the topic.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BGDJPQAACAAJ&dq=Challenges+to+New+Testament+Theology:+An+Attempt+to+Justify+the+Enterprise&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Confessing for Money","description":"Want to get published and make money while perfecting your short story writing skills?

With this act of violence--which is loosely based on the notorious 1955 killing of Emmett Till--James Baldwin launches an unsparing and at times agonizing probe of the wounds of race. For where once a white storekeeper could have shot a \\"boy\\" like Richard Henry with impunity, times have changed. And centuries of brutality and fear, patronage and contempt, are about to erupt in a moment of truth as devastating as a shotgun blast. In his award-winning play, Baldwin turns a murder and its aftermath into an inquest in which even the most well-intentioned whites are implicated--and in which even a killer receives his share of compassion.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tcxWAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rights of Our Little Ones: Or, First Principles On Education in Catechetical Form","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=c3jowQEACAAJ&dq=The+Rights+of+Our+Little+Ones:+Or,+First+Principles+On+Education+in+Catechetical+Form&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Consciousness: Creeping up on the Hard Problem","description":"How does consciousness arise out of the functioning of the human brain?

Centered on Genesis 2 and 3, he expresses his awareness of the sacramental character of the created world, and of the potential of everything in the created world to act as a witness and pointer to the creator. God's two witnesses, says Ephrem, are: 'Nature, through man's use of it, [and] Scripture, through his reading it.\\" In his writing, Ephrem posits an inherent link between the material and spiritual worlds. St Ephrem's mode of theological discussion is essentially Biblical and Semitic in character. He uses types and symbols to express connections or relationships to 'reveal' something that is otherwise 'hidden,' particularly expressing meanings between the Old Testament and the New, between this world and the heavenly, between the New Testament and the sacraments, and between the sacraments and the eschaton. His theology is not tied to a particular cultural or philosophical background, but operates by means of imagery and symbolism basic to all human experience.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1nE1mC6vBaYC&dq=St.+Ephrem+the+Syrian:+Hymns+On+Paradise&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Guide to Night Sounds","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Chateau-Mystere / Mystery Castle (First Bilingual Reader Series) (French Edition)","description":"It has been argued for some time that to improve language learning in Britain we need to start earlier, as many other European countries do.

Trips to a faraway town?s store orto an equally faraway church are rare. Letters sent to or from the post office might be monthsreaching their destination.Their food comes almost entirely from animals and poultry raised on the homestead andcrops grown on the acreage. Bathing is done in a washtub, when there?s enough rainwater.The women work just as hard as the men - sometimes inside the houses, sometimesoutside in the fields and the barns. Gossip is pervasive, perhaps an entertaining respite from therigors of daily life. Yet, when trouble looms or help is needed, neighbors rally. Thomas follows the lives of Nate and Melissa York, from the time of their meeting,through their marriage with all its hardships and difficulties, including the death of their first baby,up until the time their home becomes a haven for children previously mistreated in otherenvironments.Nate can?t read or write, but Melissa, 17 years younger, teaches him, and both eventuallycome to share a full understanding of religious faith after a series of tragedies and mishaps teststheir beliefs.But while Nate and Melissa may get top billing, the roster of other people also is large. The author?s narrative peels back the many layers of the various characters? heroics, as well astheir shortcomings and perversities, demonstrating, sometimes graphically, that these ?good olddays? were all too often something far from good.Not all the characters are human. There is Dewey, Nate?s horse, in particular, who is trulylike a brother to the man, whose parents lost their lives in a criminal attack when he was just achild.Overall, it?s an interesting read, not just for those who may have been raised in ruralenvironments, but for anyone who likes to explore character development interwoven with aregional lifestyle, speech patterns and culture","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l9OPAAAACAAJ&dq=Homestead:+An+Epic+Rich+with+Emotion+in+the+Post+Civil+War+South&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Malignant Pied Pipers of Our Time: A Psychological Study of Destructive Cult Leaders from Rev.

The first, Under-grounds in Insurgent, Revolutionary and Resistance Warfare, was a generalized description of the organization and operations of underground movements, with seven illustrative cases. The present study provides more detailed information, with special attention to human motivation and behavior, the relation between the organizational structure of the under-ground and the total insurgent movement, and Communist-dominated insurgencies. Because an understanding of the general nature of undergrounds is necessary to more detailed considerations, some of the information from the earlier study of undergrounds has been included in this report. Wherever possible, material from insurgency situations since World War II has been used. Occasionally, however, it was necessary to use information from studies of World War II underground movements in order to fill gaps about certain operations. In the methodological approach it was assumed that confidence could be placed in the conclusions if data on underground operations and missions and similar data could be found in other insurgencies. An attempt was made to base conclusions on empirical information and actual accounts rather than theoretical discussions, and upon data from two or more insurgencies. An effort was made to find internal consistencies within the information sources. For example, if units were organized and trained to use coercive techniques for recruiting, and defectors described having been recruited in this manner, the conclusion that people were coerced into the movement can be made. Because of this approach there is a good deal of redundancy within and among the various chapters.* While the main emphasis in this report has been on underground organization, many characteristics can be understood only in relation to overt portions of the subversive organization. Therefore, discussions of guerrilla forces, the visible outgrowth of undergrounds, and of Communist structures, which often inspire, instigate, and support subversive under-grounds, have been included. The report is designed to provide the military user with a text to complement existing training materials and manuals in counterinsurgency and unconventional warfare, and to provide helpful background information for the formulation of counterinsurgency policy and doctrine. As such, it should be particularly useful for training courses related to the counterinsurgency mission. The authors wish to express thanks to a number of persons whose expertise and advice assisted substantially in the preparation of this report. Mr. Slavko N. Bjelajac, Director of Special Operations for the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, Department of the Army, on the basis of his personal experiences and special interest in the study of under-ground movements, contributed guidelines and concepts to the study. Four men reviewed the entire report: Dr. George K. Tanham, Special Assistant to the President of the Rand Corporation of Santa Monica, California, made many helpful suggestions based upon his firsthand experiences and study of Communist insurgency; Dr. Jan Karski, Professor of Government at Georgetown University, Washington, D.C., whose personal experience as a former underground worker is combined with a talent for thorough, constructive criticism, also helped the final manuscript; Dr. Ralph Sanders of the staff of the Industrial College of the Armed Forces, Washington, D.C., offered a careful and useful critique of the manuscript and helpful suggestions; Lt. Col. Arthur J. Halligan of the U.S. Army Intelligence School, Fort Holabird, Maryland, provided valuable suggestions based upon his experience in Vietnam.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HNhrygAACAAJ&dq=Human+factors+considerations+of+undergrounds+in+insurgencies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Offerings, Sacrifices and Worship in the Old Testament","description":"Offerings, Sacrifices and Worship in the Old Testament is a comprehensive study of the sacrificial offerings and worship prescribed by God in the Old Testament.

Ogilvie brings together a team of skilled and exceptional communicators to blend sound scholarship with life-related illustrations. The design for the Preacher's Commentary gives the reader an overall outline of each book of the Bible. Following the introduction, which reveals the author's approach and salient background on the book, each chapter of the commentary provides the Scripture to be exposited. The New King James Bible has been chosen for the Preacher's Commentary because it combines with integrity the beauty of language, underlying Hebrew and Greek textual basis, and thought-flow of the 1611 King James Version, while replacing obsolete verb forms and other archaisms with their everyday contemporary counterparts for greater readability. Reverence for God is preserved in the capitalization of all pronouns referring to the Father, Son, or Holy Spirit. Readers who are more comfortable with another translation can readily find the parallel passage by means of the chapter and verse reference at the end of each passage being exposited. The paragraphs of exposition combine fresh insights to the Scripture, application, rich illustrative material, and innovative ways of utilizing the vibrant truth for his or her own life and for the challenge of communicating it with vigor and vitality.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=q8ElBrN8MqQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE MODERN SWORDSMAN - Realistic Training for Serious Self-Defense","description":"Here is a complete training program designed to help the aspiring sword fighter become proficient with his weapon of choice and truly dangerous to an adversary.

Nonetheless, she has been almost excluded from literary memory and importance. This book seeks to understand why. By reconsidering Stoddard s life and work and her current marginal status in the evolving canon of American literary studies, it raises important questions about women s writing in the 19th century and canon formation in the 20th century. Essays in this study locate Stoddard in the context of her contemporaries, such as Dickinson and Hawthorne, while others situate her work in the context of major 19th-century cultural forces and issues, among them the Civil War and Reconstruction, race and ethnicity, anorexia and female invalidism, nationalism and localism, and incest. One essay examines the development of Stoddard's work in the light of her biography, and others probe her stylistic and philosophic originality, the journalistic roots of her voice, and the elliptical themes of her short fiction. Stoddard s lifelong project to articulate the nature and dynamics of woman's subjectivity, her challenging treatment of female appetite and will, and her depiction of the complex and often ambivalent relationships that white middle-class women had to their domestic spaces are also thoughtfully considered. The editors argue that the neglect of Elizabeth Stoddard's contribution to American literature is a compelling example of the contingency of critical values and the instability of literary history. This study asks the question,  Will Stoddard endure?  Will she continue to drift into oblivion or will a new generation of readers and critics secure her tenuous legacy?","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-pM6BAAAQBAJ&dq=American+Culture,+Canons,+and+the+Case+of+Elizabeth+Stoddard&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The End of Christendom","description":"Christendom according to Malcolm Muggeridge, is something quite different from Christianity.

Rabbi Israel ben Eliezer (1700-1760), also known as the Besht, was the legendary founder of the Hasidic movement. He taught that humans must worship and cling to God, not only during the practice of religious observances, but in all aspects of life - business, social contacts, and daily affairs. One must strive for the salvation of one's individual soul in order to bring about the redemption of the world. Little historical information is known about the Baal Shem Tov. He did not put his teachings into writing, and he opposed the attempts of others to publish his teachings. The first known document about the Baal Shem Tov, Shivhei ha-Besht, was published in Hebrew in 1814, just fifty-four years after his death. This work contained 251 tales about the Baal Shem Tov. Originally circulated orally, the stories were written down by Rabbi Dov Ber, known as the Maggid of Mezhirich, who was the son-in-law of Rabbi Alexander the Shohet, the Baal Shem Tov's scribe. It is thus probable that the oral sources of the stories were from among the Baal Shem Tov's closest circle. In fact, Rabbi Dov Ber offers the source of each story wherever possible. This authenticity has made Shivhei ha-Besht the most significant work on the Baal Shem Tov. The book has been in print in many versions - Hebrew, Yiddish, Ladino - almost continuously for 180 years. It became a source for many writers, including Martin Buber, S. Y. Agnon, and Elie Wiesel. In Praise of the Baal Shem Tov: The Earliest Collection of Legends about the Founder of Hasidism is the only complete English translation of this valuable anthology. In addition to serving as a biography of the Baal Shem Tov, the tales also reflect the life of Jews in Eastern Europe during the eighteenth century and the emergence of the Hasidic movement. By bringing these legends of the Baal Shem Tov's life, personality, and mystical abilities to the modern English reader, Professors Dan Ben-Amos and Jerome R. Mintz have made an inestimable contribution to the study of the Hasidic movement and its legendary founder.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YcbXAAAAMAAJ&dq=In+Praise+of+Baal+Shem+Tov+(Shivhei+Ha-Besht:+the+Earliest+Collection+of+Legends+About+the+Founder+of+Hasidism)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ukrainian Easter: Traditions, folk customs, and recipes","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=F-khAAAAMAAJ&dq=Ukrainian+Easter:+Traditions,+folk+customs,+and+recipes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Living Systems","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Ashiwaza: Judo Masterclass Techniques : De-Ashi-Barai, Okuri-Ashi-Barai, Harai-Tsuri-Komi-Ashi, Sasae-Tsuri-Komi-Ashi","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"All I Want for Christmas (Harlequin Intrigue #495)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Visual InterDev 6 in 21 Days","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"God Made Music (babyfaith)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Heartsblood: Hunting, Spirituality, and Wildness in America","description":"In Heartsblood, nationally acclaimed nature writer and veteran outdoorsman David Petersen takes a clear-eyed look at humans and hunting, and reaches conclusions sure to challenge everyone's preconceptions.

For all of these people, the challenge is to adapt to a radically new way of being in the world. There is Lilian, a concert pianist who becomes unable to read music and is eventually unable even to recognize everyday objects, and Sue, a neurobiologist who has never seen in three dimensions, until she suddenly acquires stereoscopic vision in her fifties. There is Pat, who reinvents herself as a loving grandmother and active member of her community, despite the fact that she has aphasia and cannot utter a sentence, and Howard, a prolific novelist who must find a way to continue his life as a writer even after a stroke destroys his ability to read. And there is Dr. Sacks himself, who tells the story of his own eye cancer and the bizarre and disconcerting effects of losing vision to one side. Sacks explores some very strange paradoxes people who can see perfectly well but cannot recognize their own children, and blind people who become hyper-visual or who navigate by  tongue vision.  He also considers more fundamental questions: How do we see? How do we think? How important is internal imagery or vision, for that matter? Why is it that, although writing is only five thousand years old, humans have a universal, seemingly innate, potential for reading? The Mind s Eye is a testament to the complexity of vision and the brain and to the power of creativity and adaptation. And it provides a whole new perspective on the power of language and communication, as we try to imagine what it is to see with another person s eyes, or another person s mind.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ct2UMH0VqikC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What Jesus Meant","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Oracle8 DBA Handbook","description":"Maintain a robust, mission-critical Oracle8i database--the most manageable Web-enabled enterprise database system available.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jej8sy_uB_sC&dq=Oracle8+DBA+Handbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All-Star - Book 4 (High-Intermediate - Low Advanced) - Workbook (Bk. 4)","description":"An encyclopedia designed especially to meet the needs of elementary, junior high, and senior high school students.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vhQ1AAAAMAAJ&dq=All-Star+-+Book+4+(High-Intermediate+-+Low+Advanced)+-+Workbook+(Bk.+4)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Wedding Story","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Clumber Spaniel Champions, 1955-1981","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder at Home and at School","description":"This resource book contains 43 articles to assist in addressing the problems of children with Tourette Syndrome or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

However, they are often constrained by lack of adequate resources, sound policies, and national support. It is clear that change and advancements, both systematic and scientific, are needed in a number of forensic science disciplines to ensure the reliability of work, establish enforceable standards, and promote best practices with consistent application. Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward provides a detailed plan for addressing these needs and suggests the creation of a new government entity, the National Institute of Forensic Science, to establish and enforce standards within the forensic science community. The benefits of improving and regulating the forensic science disciplines are clear: assisting law enforcement officials, enhancing homeland security, and reducing the risk of wrongful conviction and exoneration. Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States gives a full account of what is needed to advance the forensic science disciplines, including upgrading of systems and organizational structures, better training, widespread adoption of uniform and enforceable best practices, and mandatory certification and accreditation programs. While this book provides an essential call-to-action for congress and policy makers, it also serves as a vital tool for law enforcement agencies, criminal prosecutors and attorneys, and forensic science educators.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4VH5FhgTXxoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chameleons: Nature's Hidden Jewels","description":"Written by an experienced chameleon breeder, this text is based on the knowledge acquired during the author's field trips to Africa to study these incredible creatures in their natural environment.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PvREAAAAYAAJ&dq=Chameleons:+Nature%27s+Hidden+Jewels&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Heavenly Christmas in Hometown","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gnRPtwAACAAJ&dq=A+Heavenly+Christmas+in+Hometown&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Building the Wooden Fighting Ship","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tHwsAAAAYAAJ&dq=Building+the+Wooden+Fighting+Ship&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The holiest of all: An exposition of the Epistle to the Hebrews","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jPgOAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The web of victory;: Grant at Vicksburg","description":"The Web of Victory tells of the Union siege of Vicksburg, a campaign that might very well have been the turning point of the Civil War and was without any doubt the turning point in the military career of General Ulysses S.

Instead, he announced that he was going to build a statue of Buddha that would make all existing statues look like midgets. It would be so enormous (the figure was about twice the scale of the Statue of Liberty), that many tons of iron would be needed just for the braces and bolts. Still more was required to erect the accompanying temple, which was to cover a piece of ground something over an eighth of a mile square. All farmers, ji-samurai, and monks were invited to contribute their swords and guns to the cause.

There have been only fourteen perfect games pitched in the modern era of baseball; the great Cy Young fittingly hurled the first, in 1904, and David Cone pitched the most recent, in 1999. In between, some great pitchers -- Sandy Koufax, Catfish Hunter, Jim Bunning, and Don Larsen in the World Series -- performed the feat, as did some mediocre ones, like Len Barker and the little-known Charlie Robertson. Fourteen in 150,000 games: The odds are staggering. When it does happen, however, the whole baseball world marvels at the combination of luck and skill, and the pitcher himself gains a kind of baseball immortality. Five years ago, Michael Coffey witnessed such an event at Yankee Stadium, and the experience prompted this expansive look at the history of these unsurpassable pitching performances. He brings his skills as a popular historian and poet to an appraisal of both the games themselves and of the wider sport of baseball and the lives of the players in it. The careers of each of the fourteen perfect-game pitchers are assessed, not only as to their on-the-field performances but with a regard for their struggles to persevere in an extremely competitive sport in which, more often than not, the men and women who run the game from the owners' boxes are their most formidable adversaries. Along the way, Michael Coffey brings us right into the ballparks with a play-by-play account of how these games unfolded, and relates a host of fascinating stories, such as Sandy Koufax's controversial holdout with Don Drysdale and its chilling effect on baseball's owners, Mike Witt's victimization by the baseball commissioner, and Dennis Martinez's long struggle up from an impoverished Nicaraguan childhood. Combining history, baseball, and a sweeping look at the changing face of labor relations, 27 Men Out is a new benchmark in sports history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OwA6pvM8gOgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Something Fishy","description":"Frustrated because the rules for her class's Pet Day will not let her take her dog to school, Junie B.

It is estimated that one in four married men cheat on their wives. Of those, roughly half claim that they are  very happy  in their marriages. So why risk ruining it all? Is it the sex? The affirmation? The danger? Yes, it s all of that. But it s also so much more. The author of this book has conducted a series of in-depth interviews with men and women of all ages and backgrounds who have cheated in the past or are currently cheating on their spouses. They talked openly and intimately about details of their affairs, and the emotions that they experience before, during, and after. The book breaks down the five major categories of cheaters, defines the typical cheater personality, and looks at how husbands can cheat while also loving their wives. It reveals the tips and tricks spouses use to get away with secret affairs and examines everything from the influence of cheating parents on their children to the possible outcomes once an affair is discovered. This unfiltered window into the hearts and minds of men explores the psychological roots of cheating and proposes a new vision of masculinity that is more emotionally aware and could significantly change relationships for the better.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=quIDEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wondrous Wisdom","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A treatise on God as first principle","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=W0MNAAAAIAAJ&dq=A+treatise+on+God+as+first+principle&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Revelation God Gave","description":"The final book of the Bible, Revelation prophesies the ultimate judgement of mankind in a series of allegorical visions, grisly images and numerological predictions.

Unlike previous studies of community policing this book focuses on the history, experiences, and perspectives of the people whose lives are most affected by today's policing strategies. Blending the voices of project residents with a rich synthesis of historical, sociological, and criminological analysis, Websdale describes the situational, cultural, and economic circumstances of Nashville's poor; examines the policing of social upheaval by detailing events in the 1997 looting and burning of the Dollar General Store; considers African American kinship systems and the special circumstances of battered women; and discusses why the vice trades--prostitution and selling drugs--thrive in public housing projects. Websdale's hard-hitting look at community policing and its negative impact on the urban poor provides a balance to prevailing optimistic views on the effectiveness of this new method of law enforcement.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0mFHAAAAMAAJ&dq=Policing+the+Poor:+From+Slave+Plantation+to+Public+Housing+(Northeastern+Series+on+Gender,+Crime,+and+Law)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Molokai: An Island in Time","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wsMMAQAACAAJ&dq=Molokai:+An+Island+in+Time&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"VW Golf & Jetta, 1993 - 1998 (Haynes Manuals)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=c8CeoAEACAAJ&dq=VW+Golf&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Preacher's Commentary - Vol. 27- John","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Harassed: 100 Women Define Inappropriate Behavior in the Workplace","description":"Sample situations of harassment or discrimination are followed by advice for a harassment-free workplace","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gV9EAAAAMAAJ&dq=Harassed:+100+Women+Define+Inappropriate+Behavior+in+the+Workplace&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introductory Nuclear Physics","description":"INTRODUCTORY NUCLEAR PHYSICS","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BNtVEAAAQBAJ&dq=Introductory+Nuclear+Physics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The greatest thing ever known","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6jNIAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Moby Dick;: Or, The whale,","description":"Moby Dick is a novel by American writer Herman Melville. The work is an epic sea story of Captain Ahab's voyage in pursuit of Moby Dick, a great white whale. A contemporary commercial failure and out of print at the time of the author's death in 1891, its reputation rose during the twentieth century. D.H. Lawrence called it \\"the greatest book of the sea ever written.\\" Jorge Luis Borges praised the style: \\"Unforgettable phrases abound.\\" Today it is considered one of the Great American Novels and a leading work of American Romanticism. The opening line, \\"Call me Ishmael,\\" is one of the most recognizable opening lines in Western literature. Ishmael then narrates the voyage of the whaleship Pequod, commanded by Captain Ahab. Ahab has one purpose: revenge on Moby Dick, a ferocious, enigmatic white whale which on a previous voyage destroyed Ahab's ship and severed his leg at the knee. The detailed and realistic descriptions of whale hunting and the process of extracting whale oil, as well as life aboard ship among a culturally diverse crew, are mixed with exploration of class and social status, good and evil, and the existence of God. Melville uses a wide range of styles and literary devices ranging from lists and catalogs to Shakespearean stage directions, soliloquies, and asides.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9lNoAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Summer of '42-a novel","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Sex and Gender: An Introduction","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Mitsubishi Pick-ups and Montero, 1983-95 (Chilton's Total Car Care Repair Manuals)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Agents for Escape: Inside the French Resistance, 1939-1945","description":"\\"The only merit of this book - and I insist on it - is that it is true, true from beginning to end. And this, you see, is definitely something!\\" So writes Andre Rougeyron in the Preface of his memoir, displaying a hint of the passion that undoubtedly accounted for his heroism in France and Germany during World War II - and displaying too his own modest self-regard. His chronicle of the years spent rescuing downed Allied airmen in France and consequently enduring German labor camps remains focused throughout on others. A myriad of individuals - both named and unnamed - and their sufferings and triumphs small and large suffuse his story. His portrait of Normandy under occupation and his descriptions of life and death in the labor camps add important new information to current understanding of how French resisters and the camps operated. Equally significant and also fascinating is his evocation of people from diverse backgrounds brought together under unbearably trying circumstances.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ENpyQgAACAAJ&dq=Agents+for+Escape:+Inside+the+French+Resistance,+1939-1945&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fireworks: A Gunsite Anthology","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Negotiation","description":"Winner! - CMI Management Book of the Year 2017  Practical Manager category Master the art of negotiation and gain the competitive advantage Now revised and updated, the second edition of The Negotiation Book will teach you about one of the most important skills in business.

Wells of Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, Massachusetts, here challenges evangelicalism with a disturbing analysis of its present condition. He believes that we have allowed ourselves to be shaped by the popular culture whose ethos is alien to God-consciousness, to 'other-worldliness', and to passion for biblical truth. In putting 'success' before theology we have produced a plague of nominal evangelicalism which, unless reversed, leaves us 'headed towards the oblivion of irrelevance before God'. This material was first delivered at a Convention of the National Association of Evangelicals who have kindly assisted in the publication. Much fuller treatment of the same themes will be found in the author's influential books, No Place for Truth and God in the Wasteland. While referring especially to the North American scene, the wider relevance of Dr Wells' message is indicated by the fact that these two titles have joint publishers on both sides of the Atlantic, W.B.

Instead, The Silence of Unknowing fosters personal transcendence at the most meaningful spiritual level, through self-awareness & self-understanding. Mystics of all religions have always known that the key to spiritual life is self-knowledge, & now seekers of Christian & other faith traditions will find a new ally & teacher in Terence Grant. In this engaging & accessible guide for daily living that draws its strength from both Zen & Christian mysticism, Grant illuminates the relevance of spiritual concepts often avoided as to abstract. Examples: Original sin is presented as the desire to be more, better, or different than one is; Repentance is defined as a turning toward God, not a mortifying sense of guilt. Grant presents a wise & insightful blend of biblical exegesis, wry fables, & humorous anecdotes based on his popular meditations that have been enthusiastically received by thousands of listeners in parishes & retreat centers across the nation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0pUUMWH1lvAC&dq=The+Silence+of+Unknowing:+The+Key+to+the+Spiritual+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cobbers: A Personal Record of a Journey From Essex, In England, To Australia, Tasmania and Some of the Reefs and Islands in.....","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_U4EMwEACAAJ&dq=Cobbers:+A+Personal+Record+of+a+Journey+From+Essex,+In+England,+To+Australia,+Tasmania+and+Some+of+the+Reefs+and+Islands+in.....&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Timber framing,","description":"This is a thorough and profusely illustrated guide to building a timber-frame house.

In the land of Dorthar, the Storm Lord reigns as king. According to law, the Storm Lord's youngest son will be the rightful heir. His queen, the cunning and ambitious Val Mara, intends her young son, Amrek, to be that heir. But fate has other ideas. When the Storm Lord abducts a Lowlander priestess, conceives a child with her, and then dies in mysterious circumstances, the unborn baby of that union suddenly becomes the heir to a vast kingdom--a situation that Val Mara is eager to rectify. When his mother also dies, the infant, Raldnor, must be taken far from the Storm Lord's stronghold to escape the queen's murderous wrath, forsaking all knowledge of his royal heritage. Raldnor grows up among the people of the Plains, but he is set apart from his friends and neighbors by the mystery of his past. Meanwhile, Amrek has taken the throne as his mother intended. If Raldnor is to reclaim his destiny and defeat the usurper who has taken his place, he will have to survive trials of strength, political sabotage, and threats against his life, regaining his birthright as the true Storm Lord of Dorthar.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jpZTvgAACAAJ&dq=The+Storm+Lord&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Picture History of the Cunard Line, 1840-1990 (Dover Books on Transportation, Maritime)","description":"Photographs, prints, and text portray Cunard ships, inside and out, from the earliest steamships, through the great liners of the earlier twentieth century, to modern cruise ships","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NNvmenHh7OMC&dq=Picture+History+of+the+Cunard+Line,+1840-1990+(Dover+Books+on+Transportation,+Maritime)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cook's Book","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Exploring God","description":"An intriguing survey of the meaning and concept of God explores humankind's ideas of God, from the Pantheism of many of the ancient civilizations, through the Hebrew scriptures and Jewish traditions, to Christianity and the New Testament, to the Qur'an and Islam, to the Eastern religions.

Not that you would like to encourage this bit of impudence after a look into his devil-may-care eyes; but you might easily imagine something much stronger than brown wrapping paper and not quite so passive as burnt clay. His clothes fit him loosely and yet were graciously devoid of the bagginess which characterises the appearance of extremely young men whose frames are not fully set and whose joints are still parading through the last stages of college development. This fellow, you could tell by looking at him, had been out of college from two to five years; you could also tell, beyond doubt or contradiction, that he had been in college for his full allotted time and had not escaped the usual number of \\"conditions\\" that dismay but do not discourage the happy-go-lucky undergraduate who makes two or three teams with comparative ease, but who has a great deal of difficulty with physics or whatever else he actually is supposed to acquire between the close of the football season and the opening of baseball practice. This tall young man in the panama hat and grey flannels was Truxton King, embryo globe-trotter and searcher after the treasures of Romance. Somewhere up near Central Park, in one of the fashionable cross streets, was the home of his father and his father's father before him: a home which Truxton had not seen in two years or more. It is worthy of passing notice, and that is all, that his father was a manufacturer; more than that, he was something of a power in the financial world. His mother was not strictly a social queen in the great metropolis, but she was what we might safely call one of the first \\"ladies in waiting.\\" Which is quite good enough for the wife of a manufacturer; especially when one records that her husband was a manufacturer of steel. It is also a matter of no little consequence that Truxton's mother was more or less averse to the steel business as a heritage for her son. Be it understood, here and now, that she intended Truxton for the diplomatic service: as far removed from sordid steel as the New York post office is from the Court of St. James.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0BNXDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tom Hopkins Guide to Greatness in Sales: How to Become a Complete Salesperson","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Topsoil and civilization","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nXe4tAEACAAJ&dq=Topsoil+and+civilization&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"DOCTOR DOLITTLE IN THE MOON.","description":"Dr. Dolittle has landed on the Moon!

One comes from Silicon Valley. There's never been a better time to be an artist, it goes. If you've got a laptop, you've got a recording studio. If you've got an iPhone, you've got a movie camera. And if production is cheap, distribution is free: it's called the Internet. Everyone's an artist; just tap your creativity and put your stuff out there. The other comes from artists themselves. Sure, it goes, you can put your stuff out there, but who's going to pay you for it? Everyone is not an artist. Making art takes years of dedication, and that requires a means of support. If things don't change, a lot of art will cease to be sustainable. So which account is true? Since people are still making a living as artists today, how are they managing to do it? William Deresiewicz, a leading critic of the arts and of contemporary culture, set out to answer those questions. Based on interviews with artists of all kinds, The Death of the Artist argues that we are in the midst of an epochal transformation. If artists were artisans in the Renaissance, bohemians in the nineteenth century, and professionals in the twentieth, a new paradigm is emerging in the digital age, one that is changing our fundamental ideas about the nature of art and the role of the artist in society.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xP2qDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life with Father","description":"Day's collection of anecdotes and recollections of Father and Mother, which had appeared in various periodicals.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=58keDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Seven Kisses in a Row (Charlotte Zolotow Books)","description":"How different life is for seven-year-old Emma and her older brother, Zach, when their Aunt Evelyn and Uncle Elliot care for them while their parents are away.

At the same time it is playing a central role in the mathematization of various applied sciences such as statistics, opera tions research, biology, economics and psychology-to name a few to which the prefix \\"mathematical\\" has so far been firmly attached. The coming-of-age of probability has been reflected in the change of contents of textbooks on the subject. In the old days most of these books showed a visible split personality torn between the combinatorial games of chance and the so-called \\"theory of errors\\" centering in the normal distribution. This period ended with the appearance of Feller's classic treatise (see [Feller l]t) in 1950, from the manuscript of which I gave my first substantial course in probability. With the passage of time probability theory and its applications have won a place in the college curriculum as a mathematical discipline essential to many fields of study. The elements of the theory are now given at different levels, sometimes even before calculus. The present textbook is intended for a course at about the sophomore level. It presupposes no prior acquaintance with the subject and the first three chapters can be read largely without the benefit of calculus.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hDnnBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Grandma, Tell Me Your Memories","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WHPBtwAACAAJ&dq=Grandma,+Tell+Me+Your+Memories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Balcony stories,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jR9CAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines","description":"This book provides authoritative information on the theory behind the Macintosh 'look and feel' and the practice of using individual interface components.

But more than a language, Polari is an attitude. From the prisons and music halls of Edwardian England to Kenneth Williams, American GIs in London and the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, Polari has been used to laugh, bitch, gossip and cruise. Like all slang, Polari users coined an ever-changing vocabulary. Derived from words used by criminals, circus artists, beggars and prostitutes, it also employed Italian, Yiddish, French, rhyming slang and backslang.

So begins the famous opening chapter of Moby-Dick; or, The Whale. Young sailor Ishmael is hired as a crew member of a whaler named Pequod, captained by a man named Ahab. In between lengthy chapters on whale biology and descriptions of the crew and the whaling trade, readers are slowly introduced to a captivating tale. Ahab is out for revenge on the great white whale that stole his leg, leaving him with a whale-bone prosthesis and a withering hatred for the beast. Known as Moby Dick, the whale is infamous for his encounters and escapes with whale ships, and Ahab offers a gold coin, nailed to the Pequod's mast, as a reward for whoever sights him first. Beginning on a cold Christmas morning, the crew embarks on a journey to find the whale and make their fortunes. An exciting staple of American literature, Moby-Dick is a must-read for anyone interested in the classics. Herman Melville was inspired to write Moby Dick by the 1821 biographical account Narrative of the Most Extraordinary and Distressing Shipwreck of the Whale-ship Essex (Cosimo Classics, 2015), which in turn inspired the 2000 novel and 2015 movie, In the Heart of the Sea. HERMAN MELVILLE (1819-1891) was an American novelist. Born in New York, Melville lived and worked in the city for many years before moving with his family to Massachusetts, where he enjoyed a short friendship with author Nathaniel Hawthorne. Many of Melville's books are inspired by his own experiences; he sailed on merchant and whaling ships, spent time on the Marquesas Islands with natives, and spent time in England, Egypt, and Palestine. Melville even wrote poetry reflecting on the American Civil War. He eventually retired in New York City, where he was buried in the Bronx, relatively unknown. Melville was the author of 19 books of fiction, nonfiction, and poetry, including *Typee* (1846), Moby-Dick (1851), \\"Bartelby the Scrivener\\" (1853), \\"Benito Cerino\\" (1855), Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War (1866), and Billy Budd, Sailor (1891, unfinished).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RFpSDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MATIGARI (African Writers Series)","description":"A moral fable in which Martigari, a freedom fighter, emerges from the forest in the political dawn of post-independence Kenya.

Karate-do Nyumon is the result of Master Funakoshi's wish to clarify Karate thought and practice for those who know nothing about it. It comprises unpublished writings from the years before his death in 1957, together with simplified kata--sequences of movements--synthesized by Funakoshi from the traditional Okinawa Karate-do kata, for beginners. Master Funakoshi begins by exploding some of the myths of Karate: \\"Karate-do is a noble martial art, and the reader can rest assured that those who take pride in breaking boards or smashing tiles, or who boast of being able to perform outlandish feats like stripping flesh or plucking out ribs, really know nothing about karate. They are playing around in the leaves and branches of a great tree, without the slightest concept of the trunk.\\" In his description of what Karate is, the Master describes the history of Karate--its origins in the ancient methods of unarmed combat in China, and its growth as a fighting method in Okinawa, a country where arms were banned in a succession of decrees from the Japanese mainland. In order to prevent it being subjected to control, or more importantly, to prevent the Japanese overlords from knowing and using the techniques, the practice of Karate was kept a secret. To preserve this secrecy, the habit persisted until very recent times of keeping no records. Master Funakoshi, however, recognized in this book and others the need to formulate the kata precisely, so as to establish a standard of true Okinawan Karate. The kata in this book are not traditional kata, but they serve to establish the correct habits of stance, thought and action, and to facilitate the eventual mastery of the true Karate-do kata. All these special kata are clearly explained and illustrated by photos. Lastly, Master Funakoshi recalls stories of men who were living legends when he was a youth in Okinawa, men whose reputations overcame even the secrecy that clung to Karate until the middle of this century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LZ5NEAAAQBAJ&dq=Karate-Do+Nyumon:+The+Master+Introductory+Text&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Anybody","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U0D3PAAACAAJ&dq=The+Adventures+of+Anybody&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Applications of C++ Programming","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Douglas House","description":"*The Top 10 Bestseller* 'A tender, heart-breaking, page-turning read' Rachel Hore 'The perfect combination of page-turning thriller and deeply emotional family story.

In a claustrophobic, surreal California house, teenager Est e Kraft lives with her domineering father, whose obsession with insect taxonomy bleeds into sadism. As his schemes multiply, Est e s bedridden mother, entranced by the glow of the shopping channel, remains oblivious to the escalating chaos. Est e manages to escape her childhood home only to find new horrors awaiting her in marriage and motherhood. In a climactic twist, her traumas take form in flesh and blood a legacy of the voracious male appetites that have haunted her life.

She's always had clear steps outlining her path to success with no time or inclination for romance. Her burgeoning career in politics means everything to her and she's not willing to compromise it for something as insignificant as love. Fleeting, casual, and discreet worked perfectly fine.

Extracted from a wide range of primary and secondary source material, the author provides significant and interesting information about court politics, espionage and internal security, military and foreign affairs, tax and tribute collection, the operation of imperial monopolies, judiciary review, the layout of the palace complex, the Grand Canal, and much more. The eunuchs are shown to be not just a minor adjunct to a government of civil servants and military officers, but a fully developed third branch of the Ming administration that participated in all of the most essential matters of the dynasty. The veil of condemnation and jealousy imposed on eunuchs by the compilers of official history is pulled away to reveal a richly textured tapestry. Eunuchs are portrayed in a balanced manner that gives due consideration to able and faithful service along with the inept, the lurid, and the iniquitous.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ka6jNJcX_ygC&dq=The+Eunuchs+in+the+Ming+Dynasty+(SUNY+Series+in+Chinese+Local+Studies)+(Suny+Series,+Chinese+Local+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Measurement and Evaluation in psychology and Education","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The riddle of the sands: A record of secret service recently achieved (Bell's Indian and Colonial Library)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Step-by-Step Approach to Using the SAS System for Factor Analysis and Structural Equation Modeling","description":"This easy-to-understand guide makes SEM accessible to all users.

My wilderness name is Black Lion. I am the black lion who helps people discover the wild animal within. I am the black lion who roars for peace and harmony on Great Mother Earth. I am the black lion, alive in the wilderness. Wilderness guide Sicelo Mbatha shares the wisdom he has gained from a lifetime s intimate association with Africa s wildest nature. The story begins with a traumatic childhood experience that should have turned Sicelo against the surrounding wilderness. Instead, he was irresistibly drawn to it. As a volunteer at Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, close encounters with buffalo, lion, elephant and other animals taught him to see with his heart and set him on a lifelong journey of spiritual awakening. Drawing from his Zulu culture and his own yearning to better understand humanity s relationship with itself and with nature, Sicelo has forged a new path, disrupting the conventional approach to nature with an immersive, respectful and transformative way of being in the wilderness. Both memoir and philosophical reflection, Black Lion  co-written with author and environmentalist Bridget Pitt  is a reminder of how much we need the wilderness for our emotional and spiritual survival.  A remarkable story ... poetic and beautifully written. It goes to the heart of the meaning of ecological literacy.

Those times are captured for us in this collection of fifty-two photographs, accompanied by a history of each of the city's lines. The neighbouring region of Dunbartonshire is also covered and was itself unique in that Milngavie was the home of one of the world's first monorail systems. Stations featured in the book - many of them long gone - include Cowlairs, Possilpark, Eglinton Street, Buchanan Street, Dalmuir Riverside, Stobcross, Bellahouston, Summerston, Maryhill Central, St Enoch's, Partick West, Cumberland Street, the Singer Terminal (Clydebank), Rutherglen and Strathbungo.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-Ni3PQAACAAJ&dq=Glasgow+and+Dunbartonshire%27s+Lost+Railways&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SINONIMOS CASTELLANOS","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Field Guide to Your Own Back Yard","description":"A lyrical field guide to the natural world surrounding the eastern U.S.'s residential areas profiles a wide variety of plant, animal, and insect life, in a reference that offers insight into birdfeeder behaviors, woodpile ecology, and more.
