I also thought this book was way to long with 54 pages. I think it could have been put into a 20-page book and still have the same content of a 54-page book. I think that this was also very boring. I mean the best part was when Dr. Lanyon wrote that Mr. Hyde came to his house, mixed up a potion, and he turned into Dr. Jekyll. That has very little excitement to it. When I was going to read this book I thought it was going to be very scary and that I would be on the edge of my seat. Well neither of those things happened.

It reminded me of how many of our neighbors lead double lifes. Closeted homosexuals, drug users, are people who have two sides to themselves but don't show it. The sory mirrors Stevenson's own lifestyle. He had an affair with a married woman and suffered from tubberculosis. He had a reckless side to him but wouldn't show it. He wrote this book with one thing in mind-everyone wants to be able to do as they please, even if the things they want to do are evil, but do some people actualy do them?"},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"The book is an easy read, some of the currency symbols did not translate to Kindle well, but did not detract from the story."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"&quot;The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; is assured a place in the history of horror fiction because it the literary classic that represents the archetype of the werewolf (the human with the hiding inside).

All have in common the fact that they promise to tell a story that might best be left untold, which, of course, is exactly the sort of story we want to hear.Given that Stevenson was writing when the genre of horror fiction was not recognized as such, it is surprising that &quot;The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; is cast in the form of a mystery novel. Stevenson invites his readers to try and get ahead of the story, to put the clues together and come to the conclusion. Today it is nearly impossible to pick up this story and not know the &quot;secret,&quot; but if you think back to the late 19th-century when this story was written you can get a sense for how Stevenson used the biases and limitations of his readers to his advantage in keeping them from what we might consider to be an obvious conclusion.More importantly, Stevenson is writing several decades before the writings of Sigmund Freud revolutionized the whole idea of human psychology. Yet we can certainly find evidence of the conscious and subconscious mind of which Freud would write. Stevenson reinforces this metaphor with the block of buildings that divides this particular part of London, with one side representing the civilized world of a respected physician and the other side the squalor of the world inhabited by an inhuman creature who gives in to his every earthly desire. The novella also speaks to the topic of evolution, with Hyde being described as &quot;ape-like,&quot; reinforcing the idea that our most human attributes remove us ever further from the category of mere animal.Of the three classic horror novels, &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; is the most accessible. Not only because of its shorter length, but also because its evil is more realistic, even in terms of our imagination. We might be unable to reanimate the dead or to become the walking dead, but we can certainly relate to the idea of unleashing the beast buried with us. Even if we could not, we can recognize the &quot;werewolf&quot; in the real world in the form of serial killers who try to show a civilized face to us in public.

The margins are indeed wide and the type very readable. This edition is easily held, the illustrations nicely complement the text and the binding is quite durable. The introduction by Joyce Carol Oates is helpful albeit pedantic. Also, those who've read the Univ of Calif Press edition of Frankenstein will notice some overlap between this introduction and the one that Ms. Oates wrote for that particular edition. Nonetheless, the introduction is valuable.Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is one of those stories, like Frankenstein and Dracula, that seemingly everyone has heard of and believes they understand(\\"mythopoetic \\" in the language of Joyce Carol Oates). Much like the aforementioned works, the actual details of the story may come as a surprise to those who assume they know the story based solely on the popular understanding. For that reason alone I think the book is worth reading.Dr. Jekyll is a respected if somewhat reclusive London doctor who has, through the course of years of experimentation, managed to create a solution which brings to the fore his evil alter-ego. Unlike many gothic literary villains, Hyde is not imbued with superhuman strength or exceptional gifts of any kind. In fact he is of a smaller and less imposing stature than most men. What he does possess however is a complete lack of compunction with regards to others. Hyde for example ruthlessly runs down a small child who gets in his way. As others have pointed out, this book is about, at least in part, moral restraint. Mr. Hyde is a part of Dr. Jekyll. This part was heretofore kept in check by the mores inculcated by society through child rearing practices, education, laws, et al. An elixir that eradicates moral restraint rips at the fabric of society and reverses in one fell swoop what it has taken hundreds of years to create.As is the case with Frankenstein, Dr. Jekyll creates something that he can't control and which eventually destroys its creator.Although not created by a potion, I think we see many sections in this and other societies that are are marked by anomie. The inhumanity that the fictional Hyde displays can, not surprisingly, be seen in the non-fictional world on a daily basis. As such, there is a realism to the story which is missing from many horror stories past and present. The fact that such a short and captivating work exists in an attractively packaged edition makes this one classic that will be a joy to read for all."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Along with &quot;Dracula&quot; and &quot;Frankenstein,&quot; Robert Louis Stevenson's &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; is a part of that great immortal triad of gothic terrors from the 19th century from which a seemingly endless stream of fans, imitators, critics, and dreamers continue to derive unmitigated inspiration. But despite its classic status, and the fact that virtually everyone in the English-speaking world can instantly recognize the story's title, few have ever actually read Stevenson's little nightmare (the Bantam edition runs to no more than 114 pages, including Jerome Charyn's afterword)or even seen one of its many cinematic incarnations. Of the aforementioned trio, &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; certainly appears the most neglected. This, despite the fact that it is certainly the most accessible. It is indeed much shorter than either &quot;Dracula&quot; or &quot;Frankenstein,&quot; and anyone with good eyes can read it in a day. Even the visually challenged amongst us can do so in two. More importantly, this book is certainly the best written of the three (in)famous works, as Stevenson was by far the most proficient and thoroughly accomplished wordsmith of the authors who gave us these benighted classics. Moreover, despite its reputation as a horror story, it is in fact more of a Victorian mystery, and for those who do not much care for horror is surely a more palatable selection than either of its brothers.That last point is perhaps part of the problem. Readers who come to Stevenson's novella expecting to find a giant Hyde rampaging through London like Godzilla in Tokyo, or even doing his best Hannibal Lecter imitation, will be sadly disappointed. &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; is not about blood and thunder, however valuable those elements undeniably are in their proper place. Rather, it is a story of philosophy, soul-searching, sin and redemption. It is a subtle, scholarly tale in which much is implied but little shown, and where the goblins which haunt the London fog are only rarely permitted to stumble out to us. The modern reader, particular one weaned on such drivel as the &quot;Scream&quot; movies or &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer,&quot; will have to unlearn much he may have come to believe about effective fantasy in order to savor Stevenson's masterpiece.Beyond that, the story's classic status and innumerable adaptations and parodies in the cinema and pop culture (particularly in the classic Bugs Bunny episode) have vampirized the tale of much of its major element--mystery. Nobody today opens this book with any doubt as to the true relationship between Henry Jekyll and Edward Hyde. However bowlderized our modern perceptions of this story have become, we nonetheless all know from the outside where Hyde really comes from. So the mystery that must have been so opaque, so innovative and exciting to the original audience that had nothing but Stevenson's own story to go by, is denied us. To some, that makes reading this book little more than a minor chore.And that's a shame, because no matter how familiar this tale of the duality of Man and his eternal struggle between his Dark and Light sides may have become to us, it remains one of the most readable and thoroughly pleasurable books of its era. Stevenson's prose is precise, and with short, sure strokes he paints a tapestry of the human psyche and its unhallowed depths the like of which no modern slasher film has ever approached. Granted, the story may have been better served to give Hyde a bit more time on-stage. Perhaps some of the characters could have used some more fleshing-out. An epilogue might have served to tie the narrative up more securely......may, perhaps, might...ultimately those words do not matter, for whatever &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; might not be is irrelevant compared to what it is: the penultimate masterpiece of gothic mystery, and a classic that will endure long after that very genre has itself otherwise disappeared. Read it for what it is, and enjoy."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"This review is for the edition published by the University of Nebraska Press, and it's based more on the design of the book than on the story itself. This is a perfect example of how to make a work of classic literature more appealing. Honestly, it's no surprise to me that most people avoid classics, seeing what they're given... Publishers' attitudes towards classic literature these days seems to be to produce the cheapest version that they can with no regard to the appeal of the book. They're already ahead in that they don't have to pay the author any royalties, but then most will also use an obscure painting or generic photo for the book cover that usually has very little to do with the contents and makes for an overall boring package. It certainly doesn't help the reader's attitude toward the book in particular. Apparently, the UNP understands this, and they decided to do something about it with many of their books. This particular edition of \\"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" has a cover and illustrations by Barry Moser, woodcut artist extraordinaire. The pictures are very atmospheric, with a heavy reliance on shadow. This makes the dark nature of the story all the more substantial. Even the typeface looks good. Overall, a lot of care was put into the production of this edition. The book is about the same size as a mass market paperback, so it will fit easily on your shelf. That's a sensible thing, as the story is actually quite short, so there's no reason to release it in an oversized format with enlarged type and an increased price.In case you're wondering; yes, I do like the story. In fact, I've enjoyed it ever since I was a child. This edition just makes it all the more special to me. The only negative I can see is that you have to pay ... retail for a fairly small book, but the overall package makes it worth it."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is more than a book of suspense and horror, but it makes you think of things that relate to life.You have to read this book for yourself because it contaplates from &quot;what others have heard about the story&quot;.

The &quot;potion&quot; created by compounding together reactive chemcials makes Dr. Jykell become depended on it, and he has also indulge himself in his evil twisted side.When Jykell quoted, &quot;that man has two sides&quot; (which is good and evil), I think that Stevenson demostrated well within the character that he made a point to what he did and what he had become. That is when he changes from Dr. Jekyll into Mr. Hyde that he was only pulling out what man chooses to be.This shows that man has a choice to be good or evil. But what makes Dr. Henry Jekyll case so unsual is that he creates a formula, a formula that he becomes addicted to, and he can no longer transform back from evil to good.

The book was written by Robert Louis Stevenson in 1886. Some of the language is written in a proper old english style. Some people might read this book because it is short. The truth is that sometimes it takes a while to finish because of the difficult context. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is about a kind and friendly doctor named Henry Jekyll. He concocts some sort of potion which he tests on himself. Something horrible has happened. He is Henry Jekyll by day, of course, but by night he transforms into the malevolent Mr. Hyde. Mr. Hyde is a bent-over, repulsive looking man. He represents Jekyll's evil side which Jekyll cannot control. At night Hyde kills numerous amounts of people and is never caught. Everyone is puzzled as to why Hyde suddenly dissappears without a trace. At the same time Jekyll sits in his labratory all day trying to figure out a way to stop this transformation from occuring. He is always at war with his other self. he is no longer the friendly doctor everyone has come to know and love. He no longer enjoys hiss life and he will not speak with anybody.

The illustrations by Barry Moser, woodcuts that progress chronologically through Dr. Jekyll's life as it is described in hints throughout Robert Louis Stevenson's story, are atmospheric and evocative; a picture of a boy being guided by his father, for example, echoes Dr. Jekyll's comments that he has a \\"fatherly\\" interest in his alter-ego, Hyde, while Hyde has a son's \\"indifference\\" to the father; the cover illustration is a portrait of Dr. Jekyll's father destroyed by Mr. Hyde on a rampage.Joyce Carol Oates's introduction is worthwhile, especially for those readers who know the story, as most English-speaking people do, in its basic framework, but who have not yet actually traveled the dark road with Dr. Jekyll and his friends.It is a pleasure to read a classic book in such a carefully crafted edition.

But lately, his behavior has become strange, reclusive and mysterious. So his friend Utterson tries to find out what he's up to. In the meantime, terrible and strange things are happening by night in the streets of London. As the tale unfolds, we discover Jekyll's dangerous games with his own psyche. He discovers a drug that reveals his evil side, without any moral restraint, and gradually loses control of the drug. The narrative technique of Stevenson in this short masterpiece is simply perfect; its philosophical stand is frightening; its moral implications are relevant; and the construction of the story superb.The onion-layer style serves very well its mission to reveal every event in a semi-slow but tense pace. The environment is insuperable: the dark, wet and gas-lighted streets of London, where Mr. Hyde's steps resonate frighteningly. The ending is horrifying and very well written and, overall, this is a gem of a book. It should be best read in loneliness, in the dark. It is much more than a simple horror novel, because it says something very real and very terrible: without moral restraints, our deeper self can be unbearably evil.

Movies, comics and theater pieces had evolved from it. His tortured dual character is now a well known icon as Stoker's Dracula or Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.Even if you know more or less the story and its ending, reading this very short book is a powerful adventure.A Classic you shouldn't let pass by unheeded!Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"The classic story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde tells of a respectable citizen Dr Jekyll who transforms into a heinous villian by night that trolls the streets of Edinburgh in the 1800s. This dual life of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is traced in a third person account by a friend of the good doctor, who follows the evidence provided by both Jekyll and Hyde. The story itself is easy to understand and enjoyable to follow. The book is appropriate for anyone in high school or higher, and makes for a good movie script.The analysis that has gone into this story is quite extensive, and often goes like this: this story is a commentary on good versus evil, the conflict between these two opposing forces within each individual, and the secret thoughts that lay beneath the polite veneer of everyday life. Legend has it that the author wrote this from recollections of nightmares, and hence this book is a good foreshadowing of modern psychology and the interpretation of dreams espoused by Freud.This reviewer would like to propose an alternate explanation of this book's story; one that is not original to me, but is actually put forth in the book: \\"Cocaine, an unauthorized biography\\" by Dominic Streatfield. If you read the book and examine the behavior of Mr. Hyde and the recollections of it by Dr. Jekyll, it becomes clear that Dr. Jekyll was experimenting with drugs; probably some combination of uppers and hallucinogenics. While under the influence of these drugs, he committed acts that he would never dream of doing while sober. Afterwards, he had only a slight recollection of what happened. This sounds a lot like the lives of many drug addicts. Add that to the fact that in 1800's England, proper society was just becoming exposed to many of the chemicals now found in the drug scene, hence someone addicted back then would have been beyond the help, sympathy or comprehension of society at large. Biographical notes from both R. L. Stevenson and his peers, including his wife, hint that he might have experimented with drugs in the period immediately before he authored this book; and that these led to strong and powerful nightmares. In essence, R. L. Stevenson might have authored this book from a synthesized recollection of his own experiences (real and imagined) and those of others while under the influence of intoxicants.All in all a great book and fun story. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"What would you do if you could drink an elixir that removes all guilt from your mind for a few hours and allows you to partake in things that you normally would never dream of? Robert Louis Stevenson gives us a glimpse of what could happen in \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.\\" It's a wonderful classic originally published in 1886. In it, the well-worn battle between good and evil is played out not in the forms of a hero and a villain, but inside the mind and soul of one man who toys with the idea of acting out his most carnal (at least that's what the reader assumes) longings.This isn't your cookie-cutter Hollywood version of \\"Jekyll and Hyde.\\" It's a much deeper study of the human soul and it's longing to be a bit \\"naughty\\" and suffer none of the consequences. Time and again, Jekyll drinks his \\"liquid courage\\" and unleashes the evil that lies within. As the days, weeks and months pass by, Jekyll finds it harder to control the beast within, and his unholy friend makes more and longer appearances. Eventually, Mr. Hyde goes too far on one of his escapades, and it drives Jekyll to the brink of sanity.Along the way, we are introduced to characters such as Utterson and his friend Enfield. We also meet Poole, Dr. Lanyon, and in a brief appearance, a maid servant who witnesses actions against one Mr. Carew. Although Jekyll and Hyde are the title characters, most of the book's focus is placed on Utterson. Jekyll gets one chapter (the final one) in which to give his account of what happens to him as he undergoes his changes.Most of the films and plays based on this book portray the doctor as a good, wholesome man. However, while reading this book, I found that he was perhaps more evil than Hyde. He is capable of controlling his desires. Hyde is not. Instead of prohibiting himself from taking more of the elixir, Jekyll openly enjoys it. As he begins to lose more and more control of his situation, he attempts to correct his own wrongdoing. When this occurs, we find the one thing that Hyde fears.This particular edition of \\"Jekyll and Hyde\\" features a rather humdrum introductory essay by Vladimir Nabokov. In my opinion, he goes to depths that Stevenson probably never meant to be uncovered in his morality tale. Skip the introduction if you are unfamiliar with the story. It will do nothing more than spoil your read. I do recommend the afterword by Dan Chaon. It's a much more interesting, less in depth look at this brief, wonderful story.I highly recommend the tale. It gets five stars, but the introductory essay drags the story down and makes it almost boring.

It's fast-paced, suitably creepy, and (fortunately) lacking a lot of the melodrama that suffocates similar works of the time. The only real drawback is that Jekyll's chapter at the end can be very hard to read; Stevenson writes this in a lofty, over-cultured style which is not found in the rest of the book, obviously to reflect Jekyll's highly-educated mindset.This book is not only a science-gone-bad yarn or a psychoanalytical study of human personality, but is something of a reflection on hypocrisy. Jekyll is quite bothered at the thought of revealing any trace of indecency about himself, even more so than the typical gentleman of his time, and resorts to using Hyde as a release rather than lose face by submitting to his lustier appetites even just a little bit as Jekyll. Of course, this ultimately leads him to ruin."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Stevenson's classic short novel, first published in 1886, of a physician who believes in the dual nature of man (a good and a bad side) and who discovers a drug that creates a separation of the two personalities. Mr. Hyde has all of Jekyll's evil instincts and, as pointed out in the excellent accompanying essay by Vladimir Nabokov (included in the edition I read), is a part of the greater persona of Jekyll. Hyde is pure evil and Hyde's influence and control grows with time. Soon Jekyll finds that the transformation comes involutarily and the drug begins loosing its power to transform the physician into his normal persona.

In this little known tale, a British trader gets stationed on a small island in the South Pacific, but he immediately has trouble establishing his trade with the natives even though any foreigner, be he white, black, or Asian, holds higher social status than the natives. Such relations between races on an isolated island were normal during imperialism but are still surprising now. For example, the main character has free choice of any native girl to be his wife. Stevenson honestly portrays imperialism's influence on the island while also exploring the beliefs of the natives and how they can be easily manipulated. This was a great page-turner, one of those rare ones that left me thinking about it months later.The Ebb Tide, the last and longest story in this collection, recounts the tale of three white men on an island in the Pacific, all stuck there because they're committed crimes or ruined their reputations in their home countries. With all three broke, they come upon a discovery that will allow them to leave the island and make some money in the process. However, as the darker side of these criminals come out at sea, events take a dark turn. This is another tale that analyzes race relations in the South Pacific during imperialism, but focuses more on the abusive personalities of white criminals who end up stuck there. Still, it has it's merits like Stevenson's good characterizations and is worth reading.All in all, this is an outstanding threesome of Stevenson's best short novels. Although the story of Jekyll and Hyde is easily found, The Beach of Falesa and The Ebb Tide are extrememly difficult to find, making this in invaluable collection. I was thrilled to come across some of Stevenson's rarer stories in this collection and highly recommend checking it out."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"A wonderfully crafted masterpiece, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is one of the must-reads of all time. This beautiful piece of literature appeals to many different senses and emotions. It is inspiring to see a plot so innovative and novel in the way the story presents itself. This story is just absolutely amazing.Written like an investigative report, Robert Louis Stevenson slow guides the reader through the story. The story progresses, not to slow and not to fast, but just enough to get the story moving and not lose the reader's interest. The story tells of how a Dr. Jekyll is able to separate the evil in him into an entirely different form- Mr. Hyde. I love how the reader is always anticipating what happens next as the reader is fed clues throughout the story, but the answer remains dangling and untouched- tempting readers to continue and read. The story is well-constructed in that readers can also see into the view of other characters and not just Mr. Utterson himself.Stevenson's portrayal of the good and bad side of man is wonderful. I have never seen a book where the author portrays the evil in a person by an entirely different character. The different transformations and continual action scenes in the book kept me on my toes. The mood and atmosphere is set by Stevenson's vivid description of the environment. Because Stevenson's style is not complex for his sentences are really direct and straightforward, it was not burdensome to read the book.I guarantee if you read this book, you will not be disappointed. It is a light and easy read, which you can probably finish in no time at all because Stevenson's writing makes you glued to the book- always anticipating the next action. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is an absolute must-read."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Mr. Hyde is a known murderer. Dr Jekyll is an honorable doctor in the scientific community. These people's lives should never cross, but why is Hyde the heir of Jekyll. The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Robert Luis Stevenson is set in Edinburgh, Scotland. The plot focuses on the duality of man and our capability to do both good and evil. The book does not take long to read and can probably be read in under 2 hours depending on your reading speed. This book is not hard to understand, it is written in prose. This book is not a murder fest and is probably better off for that. The book is written as a mystery. It would be better to compare it to a Hitchcock horror film than to Saw. I like it because it was a chance for me to read a classic, but not spend a month reading it. The plot was interesting and raised some interesting questions.

It is a suspenseful story, and what makes it even more enjoyable is how brief it is. I finished this book during a 2 and a 1/2 hour flight. Given the suspense of the book and the brief nature of it, I definitley reccomend that everyone read this book. I do think that it is better if the reader is not familiar with the story, as this would probably allow them to enjoy the book even more.A word about this particular edition of the book.

As the story unfolds, we learn that the respectable Dr. Jekyll and the awful Mr. Hyde are two sides of the same coin, as Dr. Jekyll has created a potion that allows his dark side to take bodily form. Dr. Jekyll secretly drinks his potion at night, allowing Mr. Hyde to roam the streets (doing God-knows-what), but he begins to lose control over his counterpart. Mr. Hyde commits a truly horrendous act, and the transformations start to occur without Dr. Jekyll even drinking the concoction.I rather enjoyed this book. It was short, and, as it turns out, film adaptations and common knowledge of the story are unusually faithful (so there are few surprises). However, Stevenson's superb writing skills expertly turn the wind swept, nighttime streets of London into a spooky gothic setting. Not least of all, Jekyll and Hyde will force you to ask yourself some deep philosophical questions about humanity and morality.You already know the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, but if you like Victorian mysteries, gothic horror tales, or contemplating the nature of good and evil, you will still enjoy reading it."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"This is such a short read that it is something that everyone should read.

To prove his theory, he concocts a potion that transforms him into his evil alter ego, Mr. Edward Hyde. Dr. Jekyll feels younger and powerful as Mr. Hyde, and his evil self commits many crimes. When he takes the potion to transform back into Dr. Jekyll, he attempts to make up for the crimes committed by Hyde.Soon, people begin to notice Dr. Jekyll's close relationship with Mr. Hyde. This disturbs Dr. Jekyll's lawyer, who is also the executor of his will. The lawyer grows suspicious when Mr. Hyde is named the main beneficiary. To make matters worse, Dr. Jekyll no longer needs a potion to transform into Hyde, and his crimes escalate. Can Dr. Jekyll regain control of his soul or is he cursed to be evil forever?This novel was an instant success. The Victorians were fascinated by the allegorical drama illustrated in The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. The book was so popular, it inspired stage plays a year after its publications. Robert Louis Stevenson wrote this novel during a two-year stay on the south coast of England, where he also wrote another famous book, Kidnapped.-- Reviewed by Veronica Hernanadez"},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"I think we've all been told at one point in our lives to read the book before watching the movie. This seems like good advice since books often get translated quite loosely onto the big screen. If, however, you haven't followed this advice with Robert Louis Stevenson's classic, _Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_, you may be in for a surprise. I was.Growing up, I'm sure I saw a couple of cartoon versions of this short story. If memory serves, the cartoons focused directly on the double-life of Dr. Jekyll. But as I read Stevenson's book the other night for the first time, I was struck by how the reader knows nothing directly about Dr. Jekyll until the final chapter of the book. Prior to that, the reader's knowledge is only as good as that of Dr. Jeykll's friends, whose observations and experiences are relayed by way of a narrator.There are many things I enjoy about this story. I like that it is a short story. It can be easily read in the space of an hour or two. I also find Stevenson's writing style very palatable. In describing Mr. Utterson's disposition, for example, he says, \\"His friends were those of his own blood or those whom he had known the longest; his affections, like ivy, were the growth of time; they implied no aptness in the object.\\" Or how about this description of Dr. Lanyon?: \\"The geniality, as was the way of the man, was somewhat theatrical to the eye; but it reposed on genuine feeling.\\" And then there's a nice little statement in Dr. Jekyll's written correspondence to Dr. Lanyon: \\"I want you to postpone all other engagements for to-night - ay, even if you were summoned to the bedside of an emperor\\". Great writing!I like also the mystery and suspense of the story. It builds and progresses right up to the end. I wish only that I knew not a thing about the story when I read it. The initial reaction of discovering that Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are two sides to the same coin, so-to-say, would have been a great reward with which to the finish the book.A final element that commends this short story is the interesting theme: the duality of man's life. I believe it was Blaise Pascal who aptly described man as a monster who passes all understanding. This marked contrast in human nature - the potential for both greatness and evil - is what I take to be Stevenson's theme. As Dr. Jekyll says in the closing pages, \\"...I was driven to reflect deeply and inveterately on that hard law of life, which lies at the root of religion and is one of the most plentiful springs of distress. Though so profound a double-dealer, I was in no sense a hypocrite; both sides of me were in dead earnest; I was no more myself when I laid aside restraint and plunged in shame, than when I laboured, in the eye of day, at the furtherance of knowledge or the relief of sorrow and suffering.\\"_Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_ is a creative and entertaining approach to the profound subject of the duplicity of man."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"If you have watched tv shows doing adaption of this it is wrong.

THe story begins with a scene which is utterly false and impossible to picture: a scene of a man and a young girl running into eachother at a corner by accident, having been travelling perpendicular to one another. So they run into eachother, literally, at the corner. And the man, so the narrative goes, is not so much a man as a human juggernaut. He tramples calmly on the girl, headless of her screams. Now, physical interactions of this kind are chaotic. It would never come about that the girl collides with the man (Mr. Hyde) and then is trampled. If such an unlikely collision were to occur, the girl and the man would interact in a chaotic manner, with each being put off balance and spun around by the impact. The man would not be in a position to \\"calmly trample\\" the young lady. This scene, which is supposed to be a cornerpiece of Hyde's brutality, is completely false and impossible to visualize.

He is a scientist and he makes a concoction that has brought out the evil part. At first the man is able to be somewhat aware of what the other person does, but it gets worse and he looses control. He has few conscious moments and often wakes up not knowing what has happened. His friend learns about the evil side, but has no idea that both of the men are the same. As the friend learns more, he becomes closer and closer to the horrible truth. Then the evil side kills a man and he hides by becoming the good man and hiding in his house. The friend thinks the evil man has killed the good one, but he soon finds out something is very strange about the whole situation. Then the friend receives a letter from the man and he gets the supplies asked in the letter. A man meets the friend and makes a concoction. Then he drinks it and all of a sudden the man turns into his friend that seems to have been revived from the evil side. The whole story is a mystery as the friend finds more clues.The thing I liked was how the story was set up and how the whole thing was a mystery so that it kept you interested in finding out the answer. It got confusing at times and I had to re-read parts to find out the clues and truly understand it. \\"pale and shaken, and half fainting, and groping before him with his hands, like a man restored from death-there stood Henry Jekyll! \\" The good man had only a little power left and he needed the concoction to make himself regular again. The person that his friend saw was a mixture of evil and good with the good barely holding out. After that, the friend was told everything and he listened in shock. This part didn't come until near the end so that it was a twist in the story that is unexpected.The book may have been good for its story line, but parts of the story got to be repetitive and it got to the point where it was boring and it was hard to keep going. The end really disappointed me, because the story was pretty decent and then the end came and it was bad. The end was supposed to be a letter written from the last words of the good man that was losing his power to stay in control. The letter was at least twenty pages and was filled with confusing sentences and the same information being repeated over and over. It got tiring and boring very quickly, so that I struggled to keep reading. I finally made it through and the end of the letter said that the good man was saying he was going to end his miserable life. \\"Here, then, as I lay down the pen, and proceed to seal up my confession, I bring the life of that unhappy Henry Jekyll to an end. That ending would have been good if it wasn't after the most boring part in the book.My favorite part of the book was when the friend and the butler of the good man break into the study to get the materials wanted by the man. It was my favorite part because lots of clues start to come out and it's the point right before finding out the truth of the evil and good man. My least favorite part is the end when the same information is repeated and the words are so confusing that it is very boring. Overall the book has a good way of keeping the reader suspenseful, but it also does the opposite with the repeated parts and the story may seem a little over stretched."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"In the commencement Mr. Utterson and his cousin Mr. Richard Enfield were walking throughout London.

He becomes addicted to his alter ego's bravado and lawlessness. On several occasions Jekyll states with assurrance that he can abandon Hyde at any time. However, like a junkie, he shallows the potion without regard for the consequences and allows his demon to run free. At last the evil of Hyde completely eclipses and overpowers the good doctor.

Indeed, Stevenson starts the story with Hyde mauling a young child. In that context, I was amazed at how closely Mr. Hyde fits the profile of a sex offender. The convoluted mental state of Hyde, his friends denial and shunning, and his own tragic testament to his desires and decline are remarkable. And what truly amazed me upon rereading it is that Stevenson captured the two-faced nature of a pedophile in the character of the seemingly normal and charming Dr. Jekyll and his hidden fiend Mr. Hyde.

A character of unadulterated evil has been turned into (Spoilers!) a representation of blind, unhampered love at any cost. With that love, comes elements of loyalty. Slowly, the antagonist becomes a morally ambiguous, if not outright, protagonist of a character. We grow to 'understand' and sympathize with him.But not so in this book.

I find it very difficult to read"},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Robert Louis Stevenson's The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde has become an indelible part of pop culture, having been adapted into many different forms since its original publication in 1886, from plays to movies to comic books. Despite everyone's familiarity with the story, the readership of the original work has most likely dwindled over the past century, and the question must be asked whether or not it still deserves to be read.Though it contains some of the elements of a science fiction tale, horror story, or psychological thriller, The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is essentially a mystery novel. A lawyer named John Gabriel Utterson attempts to determine the basis of the strange relationship between his friend and client, Dr. Henry Jekyll, and the mysterious Mr. Hyde, an individual of questionable moral character who inspires revulsion in all he meets. Jekyll has recently altered his will, leaving all his belongings to Hyde, which leads Utterson to suspect that Hyde is blackmailing Jekyll. Upon further investigation, Utterson discovers the incredible and tragic truth.Of course, anyone who hasn't been living under a rock for the last century is already privy to the horrible secret which Utterson uncovers. The phrase \\"Jekyll and Hyde\\" has become such a common expression in our language, one can't help but already know the solution to this mystery. It is a testament to Stevenson's excellent writing that the story of Jekyll and Hyde has transcended its original form and evolved to the level of mythology. One can only imagine the shock and awe that Stevenson's contemporaries would have experienced when reading this book for the first time. That's part of the problem for today's reader: one can only imagine it. While the final two chapters of the book are riveting, everything leading up to that point consists of the rather dull Mr. Utterson striving to solve a riddle that the reader already knows the answer to.If you are thinking of reading Jekyll and Hyde because you're looking for the entertainment value one expects from a science fiction or horror story, then you will probably be disappointed. As explained above, the whole book revolves around the big secret, and that cat has already been let out of its bag long ago. If however, you wish to read Jekyll and Hyde because you are a fan of Victorian literature, can appreciate the excellent writing of Stevenson, and wish to gain further insight into the psychological dimensions of his famous dichotomous character, then you may very well enjoy this classic work. It is slow going at first, but one's anticipation is aptly rewarded by the memorable and moving ending."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Point: A secret life can never be kept a secret.Path: Stevenson leads the reader through the strange case of a man who lives a double life. This fast past Victorian \\"thriller\\" explores the question, \\"What would a normally moral man look like if he had no inhibitions?\\"Sources: Written after a dream on a similar theme, Stevenson displayed to the 19th century English public the secret life so common among humanity. In an age whenAgreement: This is an excellent read with an imaginative theme. The author's point is driven home as the \\"moral\\" Dr. Jekyll realizes that he is becoming more and more like what he has experimented with.Disagreement: At first I was disillusioned with the apparent acceptance of a duality of nature in man (man is both good and evil). But arriving at the end, especially the final writings of Dr. Jekyll, I believe that he is showing the hypocrisy of trying to live \\"morally\\" for the wrong reasons. No man is \\"good\\" in himself. Rather, as one indulges his flesh, any possibility of a \\"morality\\" quickly dissipates.Personal App: Someone once said, \\"Watch your thoughts - they become actions.\\"It would be worth another read and I would recommend it."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"With my new Kindle, I loaded up on the (free) classics and I had always meant to read this book.

It's interesting because there's a whole other cast of characters that are never mentioned in the adaptations and what ultimately happens to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is quietly powerful and more suited for the book. I won't give away the ending but, like I said, it's not what you expect. I actually sent this to a number of friends after I read it and they all had the same reaction, which is that the book is more complex than a simple \\"good personality/bad personality\\" story we all think we know."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"A classic novella with an impact much bigger than its size.I was struck by the huge impact that this book's theme has had on the media from Burgess' CLOCKWORK ORANGE, werewolf movies, THE EXORCIST, THE INVINCIBLE HULK to an old Robert Silverberg sci-fi novel THE SECOND TRIP about a man condemned by the state to have his identity erased only to find his synthetic identity being dominated by his old evil nature.The idea of a controlling id nature battling a super-ego (good) personality has a deep influence in our culture. Stevenson's own Calvinism predates the notion that biochemistry controls destiny, yet both create a destiny of doom that Stevenson explores with genius.In Stevenson's short story MARKHEIM, the devil is overcome by faith that defeats evil in a contrasting twist to this little masterpiece.Dr. Jekyll, a kind, socially conscious doctor, carefully constructs a parallel life he creates through a noxious mixture of chemicals only to find that unknown impurities in the chemicals made his transformation to the horrifying Hyde temporary. The pure chemicals make Hyde a dark permanent companion.The last chapter is a existential discussion on how Hyde becomes Dr. Jekyll's desired companion and then his doom. Hyde's murder of an English MP is Cain living in Jekyll's Able. The blood of the murder cries from the ground and, yet paradoxically condemns both natures in one life. Near the sad end of this tragic tale, Dr. Jekyll stares in horror at the permanent image of Hyde in the mirror as he realizes he can never regain his good self, yet shouldn't we be resigned when we confront the evil resident in ourselves as Original Sin?The Victorian English in this translation is bearable which makes it a good short read as we confront the evil of boredom."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Robert Louis Stevenson's &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; is arguably the single most famous metaphor that Western literature has bestowed upon the public conscience, and certainly the most ubiquitous metaphor for duality of personality. But what of the artistic quality of the novella itself? The outer plot -- involving the detection of Henry Jekyll's double identity by his friend and lawyer Gabriel Utterson -- is the least interesting facet of the story; Stevenson's concept, inspired by a nightmare, and the vivid language he uses to convey it, are what impress the most upon the reader.The respected London scientist Henry Jekyll seems normal enough, but he is fascinated by what he considers to be two distinct sides to his (or, he believes, anybody's) personality, which can be described crudely as good and evil. He furthermore believes these sides are physically separable, just as water can be separated into its constituent elements, hydrogen and oxygen, by electrolysis; and so he invents a potion that essentially splits his personality so that only one side will manifest itself while the other becomes latent. In this way, Jekyll reasons, the &quot;good&quot; side may be an agent of good works without being burdened by the disgrace of an inherent evil, and the &quot;evil&quot; side is free to do his damage without the pangs of remorse he would inherit from the conscience of his good twin. In Freudian terms, Jekyll is the ego, Hyde is the id, but unfortunately -- and this is the point that drives the story -- Jekyll has no superego to tell him that the potion is an irresponsibly bad idea in the first place.In society Jekyll retains his high esteem, but his mutation, the sinister, deformed Edward Hyde, whom he names as an heir as a further disguise of his own identity, is cursed to live in ostracism for his hideous appearance, cruel behavior, and disregard for the law. The fact that Hyde is physically smaller than Jekyll could be symbolic of his moral deficiency or merely reflect the notion that he is only a &quot;part&quot; of Jekyll; but the difference in size is convenient as a plot device because it prevents others from suspecting that Hyde and Jekyll are really the same person.One should not approach &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; as if it were just a primitive example of generic horror. Stevenson excels as a prose writer, suffusing his story with the kind of descriptive nuances that successfully evoke Victorian London at its darkest and most ominous contrasted with the civilized society of gentlemen and otherwise benevolent scientists. I was aware that Stevenson was an essayist, but I was unprepared to find that &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; is really an illustrative essay at its base, dressed in monstrous fashion."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Evil lurks inside the man, chomping at the bit for its first chance to escape, but his conscience keeps him from carrying out his cruel and undignified desires. In Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, the reader is presented with an enthralling vision of a failed experiment in which a man attempts to separate his pure, angelic qualities and his dark, wicked inward wishes into two individual beings. A variable is horribly miscalculated, and instead of ending up with two embodiments, he only ends up with his evil side, which comes to be known as Edward Hyde, and his own self, a compound of a wholesome conscience and a hidden-away, satanic instinct which is part of all human beings. Definitely a book that can be viewed in a depressing, \\"can't-ignore-the-truth\\" type of light, this novel may set some readers in a direction that has them recognizing other parts of their own personality.The story is set in London, England, in a 19th-century time period. I choose to view it as an example of a sci-fi horror novel. It's quite different from other chillers because of its lack of a murderer or a dangerous villain per se that everyone's hiding from. Oh, sure, Edward Hyde commits acts of horrific atrocity, but if you look beyond the hard, cold facts, you realize that these criminal acts are not the true object of the plot. The actual villain in this book is meant to be portrayed as the volatile human soul. The novel shows how dangerous some evil desires of even the kindest, most generous people can be. Take for instance Henry Jekyll, the main character of this book. He's as compassionate and gentle a person as you'll ever meet, but through Edward Hyde, he commits unforgivable acts that you would never have thought of Jekyll. It's a twisted version of the relationship between Superman and Clark Kent, his alter ego. In the form of Superman, Kent goes around the planet saving people and taking criminals to jail. In the form of Edward Hyde, Jekyll goes around trampling children and beating kindly old gentleman with canes for no apparent reason, then makes up for the crimes by taking money out of Henry Jekyll's bank account.The characters in this book are quite a diverse crew. Instead of the predictable situation with the mad scientist, the damsel in distress, and the dashing hero, this novel features a troubled, kind scientist, his worried friends the lawyer (Mr. Utterson) and the butler (Poole), and an old acquaintance of the doctor's (Hastie Lanyon) that had a quarrel with Jekyll over some sort of scientific matter, creating a certain thickness between them. Finally, you have the scientist's alter ego, Edward Hyde, a hideous, small young man. Utterson is a lean, serious man that never smiles. \\"I incline to Cain's heresy; I let my brother go to the devil in his own way,\\" says Utterson drearily. This is taken to mean that he only wants to worry about his own business, and nobody else's. Poole is not described in great lengths in this book; he is a friendly, elderly servant of Dr. Jekyll's. Later in the book, Lanyon is implored by Jekyll, trapped in the form of Hyde, possibly for life, to get him the necessary drugs to temporarily change back. Lanyon meets a sad death.This book is excellently written, although its length is quite miniscule (70 pages). Robert Louis Stevenson integrates a sense of mystery into the plot, and although most educated persons know the basic story, you will still find yourself bristling with anticipation. Rarely does that suspense turn into boredom, as it does quite frequently in Bram Stoker's novel Dracula and many older works of horror. The reader is easily able to tell the difference between the voice tones of different characters, e.g. when Henry Jekyll tells his tragic story at the end. His sophisticated language is effortlessly distinguished from that of others who may have entries. Stevenson's dark and detailed descriptions of cold, deserted streets may give you chills as you are sucked into his vivid yet sinister worlds.If I hadn't been forced to read this book by a certain time, I still might have picked it up off the shelf and read it eventually. That's achieving a point of loftiness with me, because I tend to be quite impatient with my books, wanting instant gratification of my needs for action and plot twists. It's very difficult to compare this book to works of other genres. Many other novels don't implement suspense because it's not needed. This book, however, is based on suspense. It's easy to hold the audience's attention here because of the shortness, but that doesn't mean that Stevenson did a cheesy job with the elements of the story. Much is packed into this dwarf of a book, and anybody who needs (or wants, for that matter) suspense in their life should pick it up"},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"We've probably all heard the story of Jekyll and Hyde, but reading the original tale for the first time is an introduction to what a true suspense novel is all about. The horror of this tale comes not from the deed itself, but by its steadily being uncovered by Mr. Utterson, the respectable Victorian lawyer. Utterson's friend, Dr. Henry Jekyll, was also a respected Victorian man of a hard-working and decent nature. He maintained a respectable persona in public while hiding his indecent, baser impulses. Jekyll was troubled by the dual life he was leading, and so when his scientific interest led to mystical studies of the divided nature of man, he hoped to find a solution to his problem. He dreamed of separating the good and evil natures within man and proving that &quot;man is not truly one, but truly two.&quot;What follows is a step-by-step account of how his friend Utterson discovers the relationship between Jekyll and Hyde. The reader is privvy to the torment of Dr. Jekyll, particularly in the final climactic chapter in which Dr. Jekyll in a letter to his friend explains all that has gone before. This is not a horror story, as some movie versions have implied, but a psychological study of man's dual nature and the relationship between civilized man and uncivilized man.Robert Louis Stevenson did a masterful job of building the tension and excitement and laying the groundwork for the final chapter, skillfully recounted in Dr. Jekyll's own words."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Almost everyone knows the basics of the storyline of this literature classic, but due to the frequent trivialization of the book someone may consider Jekyll and Hyde little more than an ancient example of the horror genre. However, like the original Frankenstein, there is much more than that if one is willing to read the original. If Frankenstein really was a precursor of bioethics debates and the role of man vs. God, Jekyll & Hyde can perhaps be seen as the prototypical tale about good vs. evil and men's futile attempts to separate the two through science.Anyway, Stevenson writes beautifully, although his style is obviously very 19th century England. Martin Jarvis does, as usual, a wonderful job as a reader. Indeed his role in this audio book was a primary reason for me to buy it. Mr Jarvis is one of my favorite reader and I highly recommend all of his audio productions (especially his renditions of Dickens' books).Overall, highly recommended. I am sure I will listed to this audio book again."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"This macabre tale--inspired by a dream--starts slowly but with an ever increasing sense of mystery, culminates in a vortex of horror worthy of Poe. What evil could be more impossible to resist or to conquer than Man's inherent flaw of dualtiy? RLS describes it as the innate struggle bewteen angelic and demonic forces which lurk in every soul. Beneath the veneer of Cilivization the two extremes wage eternal war in one breast.Mr. Utterson, a conscientious laywer in Victorian London and longtime friend of both Henry Jekyll and Dr. Lanyon, confides his misgivings about the former's will to his cousin, Mr. Enfield. During the course of the chilling novella, each of the gentlemen contributes to our knowledge of this morbidly fascinating central character, who gradually loses control of his reason or his will.What has caused the respectable Dr. Jekyll to condone such bizarre behavior from his guest/protege/parasitecalled Mr. Hyde? Why does he endure the odious presence of a younger, shorter, vicious person--even to entrusting him with the key to his residence? This Edward Hyde emotes something bestial and unrestrained, which inspires instant fear or disgust in normal men. Quick to flair up in unprovoked anger and shocking brutality, this Hyde creature is proving a menace to society. Naturally the concerned lawyer becomes increasingly alarmed at this unexplained hold over Henry Jekyll, but can a few learned gentlemen protect him from himself or his rash devotion to a human monster? By uniting forces, can they preserve both his property, his reputation and ultimately, his life?When an elderly MP is murdered on the street, even Jekyll seems to realize that things have gone too far, but can the now drug-dependent physician control his urge to throw off the shackles of Society? Is he himself a victim...of the arrogance of medical and scientific knowledge or of attempting to play the god of creation with unknown powers? Hollywood has offered us various excellent, chllling versions, but the Classical Faithful will want to consult the original--which is more subtle and therefore more horrible than simply presenting the tale from the viewpoint of the protagonist. The last chapter consists of Jekyll's gripping confession: how a once learned and noble man realized the only way to destroy his diabolical alter-ego...Can he yet be saved by his loyal friends? Or must he face his destiny completely alone? Beware the beast that lurks within!"},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"\\"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" is assured a place in the history of horror fiction because it the literary classic that represents the archetype of the werewolf (the human with the hiding inside). Along with Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\" (the Thing Without a Name) and Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" (the Vampire) Robert Louis Stevenson's novella is part of the gothic foundation of the modern horror story. All have in common the fact that they promise to tell a story that might best be left untold, which, of course, is exactly the sort of story we want to hear.Given that Stevenson was writing when the genre of horror fiction was not recognized as such, it is surprising that \\"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" is cast in the form of a mystery novel. Stevenson invites his readers to try and get ahead of the story, to put the clues together and come to the conclusion. Today it is nearly impossible to pick up this story and not know the \\"secret,\\" but if you think back to the late 19th-century when this story was written you can get a sense for how Stevenson used the biases and limitations of his readers to his advantage in keeping them from what we might consider to be an obvious conclusion.More importantly, Stevenson is writing several decades before the writings of Sigmund Freud revolutionized the whole idea of human psychology. Yet we can certainly find evidence of the conscious and subconscious mind of which Freud would write. Stevenson reinforces this metaphor with the block of buildings that divides this particular part of London, with one side representing the civilized world of a respected physician and the other side the squalor of the world inhabited by an inhuman creature who gives in to his every earthly desire. The novella also speaks to the topic of evolution, with Hyde being described as \\"ape-like,\\" reinforcing the idea that our most human attributes remove us ever further from the category of mere animal.Of the three classic horror novels, \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" is the most accessible. Not only because of its shorter length, but also because its evil is more realistic, even in terms of our imagination. We might be unable to reanimate the dead or to become the walking dead, but we can certainly relate to the idea of unleashing the beast buried with us. Even if we could not, we can recognize the \\"werewolf\\" in the real world in the form of serial killers who try to show a civilized face to us in public. This is not to say that the novella is simplistic, for Stevenson offers a sophisticated narrative. If this is one of those literary you have never read because you already know the story, then you should take out an evening to sit down and finally get around to reading it.This is the Enriched Classics edition of the novel, prepared by Barry V. Qualls, professor of English at Rutgers University, and Susan J. Wolfson, professor of English at Princeton University. It includes an introduction that will provide readers with appropriate background information, a chronology of Stevenson's life and work, and a timeline that lays out the signficant events that constitute the historical context of hte novel. There is also an outline of key themes and plot points, detailed explanatory notes (including Stevenson's own), and critical analysis that covers both contemporary and modern perspective on the novel. For teachers there are discussion questions for classroom debate and a list of recommended books and films, plus period illustrations and photographs. So if you want more than just the novel, which is really a more of a novella than a literary epic, check out this Enriched Classics and see what you think."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"You can't help but love this twisted tale and it's brevity makes it all the more intense. May be a little tough going for younger readers and possibly not appropriate for anyone under the age of twelve. Richly detailed in the description of nightime London and the scenes of violence are simply astounding. A must read for anyone who understands the English language and who loves a story about the atrocities we all are capable of. Essential reading for the true, dedicated horror fan."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"It is nice to be able to have great access to a classic story like this one. A Great story that shows that we all have some sort of alternate personality burried within us and that sometimes it gets the best of us. It is good to know how the original story pans out in the massive retelling of this story that are out there."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"I have been fascinated by the concept of this classic work of Stevenson for years, but never took time to read it until now. It is a very quick, easy read, more like a short story than an actual novel. Some persons have misunderstood this book as a detective mystery rather than a psychological reflection upon the dual natures residing within every person. Stevenson here strikes a chord within us all by illustrating the potential darkness and evil of even the most exemplary of individuals.The introduction by Vladimir Nabokov, included with this version, is best read after the story itself. Nabokov's analysis is difficult to follow if the reader is not acquainted with the details of the plot. He provides valuable, thought-provoking insights into what Stevenson has accomplished in this timeless tale.I strongly recommend this classic to pastors, psychologists, and other persons who are interested in learning more about the struggle between good and evil within each human being."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Robert Louis Stevenson's \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" is an extremely well-written horror/mystery. While a relatively short novel, the intricately woven plot offers all the right details at different points. And at the end of the book, the characters all seem to make sense, with all of the given clues fitting very well.This story of the nice, mellow Dr. Jekyll and his hidden mad-man persona, Mr. Hyde, is a classic clash of good and evil. The author does a wonderful job of keeping the reader wondering about each one's true identity. From Hyde's first trampling, to his murder, to the bitter end, he is portrayed as the exact opposite of Dr. Jekyll, despite an odd, hidden relationship. Only at the very end is the mystery compltely solved.What makes the novel most unique is the inclusion of numerous other developed characters besides Jekyll and Hyde, such as Utterson, Lanyon, and Enfield. All in all, this is a timeless tale, a true stoy of inner conflict. What this novel lacks in length, it makes up for in well-developed characters, and a superb plot. A must-read."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"This book was very interesting. It had its ups and downs and at time was hard to understand. I like the suspence and the mystery. For example I liked the part when out of no were Mr.Hyde lashed out and killed another man. I also liked the part were the lawyer went to go see Dr.Jekyll and there was a letter that the Doctor gave to the lawyer which was from Mr.Hyde the scary part was that there was no retern address and the door worker said that no one had hand delivered it. That is why i liked the book."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"This is a classic work of immense popularity. It contributes to the collective vocabulary of mankind, a concept, \\"Jekyll and Hyde\\". But I found the work rough going, hard to get into , and very slow reading. The only part I enjoyed a bit was the last letter in which Jekyll confesses that he is also Hyde, and describes how in taking his potion he brought out his inner bad- side, the evil Hyde.There has been much written about the Freudian character of the tale, with the Hyde representing the Unconscious Self which can never be wholly contained , but occasionally bursts forth to do Evil.There is also the basic idea given here of each person containing within himself 'two selves' a Jekyll good- side, and a Hyde- bad side.No doubt one reason for the popularity of the tale is the mysterious, spooky, even threatening atmosphere which pervades the tale.Those who like to be 'spooked' in this way will greatly enjoy this tale. I did not."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"I thought this was a very challenging book, and it was hard to understand. I couldn't understand alot of the words since it is so old. But once you start understanding it, it really is a great story. Even though I already knew before I started reading it that they were the same person, I didn't know the rest of the story, and it was very interesting how Jekyll had written his will to Mr. Hyde. I like how he had the potion to stop and he was doing a good job, but then he finally gave in.

It was very deep and mysterious. It kept me on the edge of my seat for most of the time, forcing me to keep guessing who Mr. Hyde was and why he was so evil. I also like the fact that it was short, and got to the point pretty quickly compared to a lot of other books. The only bad thing about this book is that it is written in 1886 and uses different writing style that most people are not familiar with. At times, it was hard to understand what Robert Louis Stevenson was writing about. I recommend this book for people who like mysteries and can understand and read the writing style. Also, this would be a good book for people planning to go to college. Do not be afraid of this book just because it may be a little difficult to understand at first, try it anyway. You may like it.Have you ever had suspicions of something, but you really could not prove them? I have. I can relate to Mr. Utterson in many ways. He is a caring friend, who wants to protect Dr. Jekyll from harm, and he is a very smart fellow. He can put two and two together, and he can get the correct answer. I can do that too. I am sure you can relate to at least one of the characters, too. There is a curious fellow, an evil man, a smart and inquisitive fellow, and an easily frightened butler. Here is a short preview of the book.Mr. Utterson, a lawyer, hears a story about a despicable man who trampled a little girl for no apparent reason. The man who did this was named Mr. Hyde. The next day, Mr. Utterson looked over his friend's, Dr. Jekyll, will. It states that is anything happened to him that all of his belongings should go to a Mr. Hyde. This, coupled with the fact that Dr. Jekyll is acting wierd, rouses Mr. Utterson's suspicions, and he fears for Dr. Jekyll's life. When Dr. Jekyll goes back to his normal sel, Mr. Utterson's suspicions subside, but it will last for only a short time. First, there is the murder of a Sir Danvers Carew by a man who looks like Mr. Hyde. Then, Dr. Jekyll becomes sick, and he refuses to leave his study at his house. Finally, to confirm his suspicions, there is a letter from a friend, Dr. Lanyon, explaining everything. Who is Mr. Hyde? What does he have to do with Dr. Jekyll?

At first it was very boring but after Stevenson introduced all the characters it began to be more interesting. This book has a lot of confusing events but you just have to stick with it until the end. Everything unravels at the end. I liked the mystery and the who done it kind of effect. I enjoy reading suspense type books such as this one. I beleive that some of the chracters in the book such as Utterson and Lanyon kind of suspect that they are the same person, but they just don't think that it could be possible. I think that they suspect it mainly because when Dr. Jekyll left his will and everything he has ever owned to Mr. Hyde it just didn't seem right. The way the crimes were commited were especially heinous during that period in time. I would recommend anyone who enjoys a suspenseful book to look into this one."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"I read Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in my senior literature class.

It was a little cumbersome (a lot of run-on sentences, long paragraphs, intense visualizations) at times, but it's a classic for a reason! It took about 2 days to read and although not terribly suspenseful, it was exciting to see Jekyll and Hyde fight to the death.I am reviewing the Kindle Edition of \\"The Strange Case...\\" which was well-formatted and easy to read. There were no typos or mistakes in the print.Excellent!"},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, by Robert Louis StevensonDr. Jekyll is a chemist who is well respected by the community. Mr. Hyde is a known criminal who is wanted for murder. So why has Dr. Jekyll named him as his beneficiary if anything were ever to happen to him? That is the question of Mr. Utterson who is the protagonist of this story.The lawyer (Utterson) who is in charge of Dr. Jekyll's will starts to wonder if Hyde is blackmailing Jekyll over some incident in Jekyll's youth--it is not uncommon for young men to do foolish things! He becomes more suspicious after he finds out about Mr. Hyde's character and confronts Jekyll; Jekyll tells him not to mention the name in his presence, but to leave the will intact. A crux is reached when a witness sees Hyde murder a member of Parliament; Jekyll takes the will back from Utterson and claims that Hyde will never be heard from again.Unfortunately, Dr. Jekyll's butler starts hearing suspicious sounds coming from his master's rooms: an unusual tread, cursing, and orders in a voice that is not Dr. Jekyll's own! Fearing his master has been murdered, the butler notifies Utterson, and together the two of them break in only to find Hyde has just committed suicide and neither Jekyll's person nor body is in sight!I wish I hadn't already known this story before reading the book; all of the suspense was lost on me. This is much too bad because it would be a great murder mystery novel--Stevenson is great at building the suspense without giving too much away! Even knowing how the story would end it was still enjoyable, but knowledge of what was coming definitely lowered my enjoyment remarkably.Memorable Quote:If I am the chief of sinners, I am the chief of sufferers also.For more reviews like this one, please visit my profile!"},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"This review refers to elements specific to the edition by \\"Headline Review Classics\\".The story has a good premise but it isn't really realized, possibly due to the irregular format. The book doesn't read like a typical novel. Instead it is broken into several small, greatly overlapping parts each narrating the course of events as they were perceived by a character. The first section is told by the lawyer Utterson, who suspects his friend the doctor is being blackmailed by Mr. Hyde, then the reader is presented with the account of Dr. Lawson to whom Mr. Hyde's identity is revealed near the end of the events of the story and finally you get the story according to Dr. Jekyll. Mr. Hyde is of course uninterested in recording his experiences.The problem is that though the idea of building a complete narrative from various points of view is a good one in this case its done rather sloppily. The accounts are more repetitive than complementary and it isn't until the last one that the idea of the duality of man is introduced in a last minute hamfisted sort of way. It reminds me of the last chapter of Brave New World where Huxley decided to spell out what his book was all about as if it wasn't already obvious to the most disinterested of readers. The only difference is Huxley didn't need that chapter to explain his intent, where as the ideas Stevenson invoked weren't at all hinted at in the rest of his book.I've heard this book was written very quickly and surmise that it's parts are akin to the scraps of writing a writer produces in the early stages of writing to flesh out their thoughts and possibly rework to actually use in the story. But Stevenson never got any further in developing his novel, he just strung together the bits of writing he whipped out and called it a novella. It's a real shame since it's a good story and even with the horribly bad structure and organization you can tell that Stevenson knew how to put words on the page, even if he didn't bothered to put his words to unified purpose.The edition I read also included the short stories \\"The Body Snatcher\\", \\"Markheim\\" and \\"The Bottle Imp\\". These also had a tendency to ramble on longer than necessary. Perhaps he was paid by the inch? However they were better told and were fairly sophisticated horror stories with interesting premises. Markheim in particular is the sort of story that would be an interesting piece to analyze for a literature class. It touches on similar themes to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde but is exponentially better at communicating them."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Although we all know the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, you don't really know it until you read it. I was surprised to find out how different reading the book was compared to the various TV and popular portrayals. It's somewhat along the lines of Frankenstein and Dracula although not quite as dark. It's an intriguing story but also carries an underlying moral. The moral focuses on the good and bad parts of human nature. The part that we allow to grow is the part that ultimately takes control. For Dr. Jekyll, he allowed his bad nature (Hyde) to overpower his good nature (Jekyll) and eventually succumbed. A quick and interesting read."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Wow! What an awesome book. This classic thriller/mystery was such a gripping tale of duplicity. I couldn't put it down once I started reading. It wasn't what I imagined it to be, but after filtering all the 1880's lingo, I was spell bound the minute Mr. Utterson stepped on the scene of Dr. Jekyll's front door. I would highly recommend this to anyone over the age of 13. This short novel didn't waste a single word. It was filled with beautiful prose, realistic dialogue (for it's time) and quite a thrilling plot and twist.The brilliance comes through in such passages as,,, \\"First, because I have been made to learn that the doom and burden of our life is bound for ever on man's shoulders, and when the attempt is made to cast it off, it but returns upon us with more unfamiliar and awful pressure...\\" found near the end - near the end of the author's own life.

Although the two men are initially silent, after passing a mysterious cellar door in a basement, Mr. Enfield launches into a strange occurrence that centered around the door. Late one night, while he was on his way home, he chanced upon a deformed, short man who trampled a girl in the street who was on her way to get a doctor. The girl's family and Mr. Enfield catch the mysterious man and instead of getting the police, they decide to blackmail him and force him to give the girl's family money. Agreeable, the mysterious man disappears into the same cellar door and comes out with a check bearing not his own name, but that of the respectable Dr. Jekyll. Surprisingly, the check was not a forgery.After hearing the story, Utterson returns to his home where he removes Dr. Jekyll's mysterious will, which he recently filed with Mr. Utterson. Jekyll's will stated that in case of his death, his substantial estate will pass to Mr. Hyde, but even stranger, in case of his disappearance for more than three months, Hyde will assume Jekyll's life without delay. He also realizes that the mysterious door is connected, in an L shape way, to Jekyll's home. Utterson decides that Jekyll is being blackmailed by Hyde and seeks to search to see his face in order to understand why. After tracking him down, he is initially civil but turns angry when Utterson proceeds in the conversation.One year later, Hyde murders Sir Danvers Carew with a cane. With help from Utterson, the police find Hyde's apartment ransacked. After leaving, Utterson proceeds to Jekyll's and confronts him for harboring a murder. Jekyll claims that he is done with Hyde and promises that he has nothing left to do with him. He does, however, have a farewell note from Hyde. Utterson examines the note and his clerk, Mr. Guest, later discovers that the handwriting from the note matches a dinner invitation written by Dr. Jekyll. Angrily, Utterson assumes that Jekyll has forged a letter for a murderer.More time passes, and we learn that although Hyde has not been located, Dr. Jekyll becomes more and more social until one day Utterson attended a dinner party at Jekyll's where Lanyon was present. Shortly there after, Jekyll secluded himself and Dr. Lanyon fell ill and died. After his death, Dr. Lanyon left Jekyll a letter than instructed him not to read it for ten years. After these mysterious events, Enfield and Utterson again walk by the mysterious door. Through one of the windows, they witness Jekyll having a frightening seizure through the windows of the cellar.About a week later, Poole, Jekyll's butler, approaches Utterson, who is afraid because Jekyll has locked himself in the basement and the only things that hear is strange sounds, including crying. The only communication that has come is letters desperately asking for a specific type of salt. Utterson follows Poole to Jekyll's house and breaks down a red cabinet where the body of Hyde is found. In the laboratory, the two discover a large envelope addressed to Mr. Utterson. Inside, Jekyll urges Utterson to read the package from Lanyon and if he wished to know more, read the further description that Jekyll provided within the envelope.Lanyon's narrative begins by describing a strange letter he received from Henry Jekyll, the night after a dinner party at Jekyll's residence. The letter urges Lanyon to go to Jekyll's house and get the contents of a drawer in the laboratory. Afterwards, a strange caller will come to Lanyon's house in Jekyll's name and recover these same items, powder, a phial, and a paper book. Lanyon does as much, thinking that Jekyll is crazy, and Mr. Hyde appears at the subscribed time. He gives Hyde the ingredients; Hyde mixes them into a potion, and after drinking it transforms into Dr. Jekyll. This shock, the pure evilness of the situation, was what brought about Lanyon's subsequent death.After reading the account of Dr. Lanyon, Utterson then reads Jekyll's own account of his failed experiment. Jekyll believed that the soul is made up of two separate distinctions: evil and the good. These two separate beings live in continuous and inherent conflict with each other. Slowly, Jekyll begins an experiment where he makes two potions and transforms himself into Edward Hyde. Shortly after becoming Hyde, he drinks a second potion and once again becomes Henry Jekyll. This experiment begins Jekyll's exploration of his other self, a side that he freely explores and feels no remorse for the negative and evil actions of Mr. Hyde.For some months, this behavior continued until one moment, \\"I had gone to bed Henry Jekyll, I had awakened Edward Hyde.\\" Alerted that the character of Hyde might irrevocably stay, Jekyll chose to give up the freedom of Hyde and for two months his decision held weight. Unfortunately, he was tortured with Hyde's longing and he once again took the potion and brutally murdered Carew. Because of the manhunt for Hyde, he swore this character off forever and set out to try to remedy the evil...it is an intriguing combination of fantasy and thriller and moral allegory, Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde depicts the gripping struggle of two opposite personalities one essential good, the other evil - for the soul of one man. Its tingling suspense and intelligent and sensitive portrayal of man's dual nature reveal Stevenson as a writer of great skill and originality, whose power to terrify and move us remains, over a century later undimihnished"},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. HydeAn exciting and short bookMr. Gabriel John Utterson and his nephew Richard Enfield discover a man who is ragged and filthy. His name is Edward Hyde. This creature tramples a little girl, and then comes out with ten pounds in gold and a one hundred pound check with the name Henry Jekyll. Mr. Utterson investigates and finds that Henry Jekyll's will gives most of his possessions to this Edward Hyde. When Mr. Utterson talks to Henry Jekyll he finds Dr. Jekyll doing an experiment. Dr. Jekyll's experiment is to bring out the split personality in him. He concocts a formula that changes him into this split personality. Bt his experiment goes wrong, Edward Hyde is trying to take total control of Henry Jekyll's body. Dr. Jekyll has a limited amount of formula to keep Mr. Hyde away. What will happen when Dr. Jekyll runs out of formula?\\"All at once, I saw two figures: one a little man who was stumpy along eastward at a good walk, and the other a girl of maybe eight or ten was running as hard as she was able down a cross street. Well, sir, the two ran into one another naturally enough at the corner; and then came the horrible part of the thing; for the man trampled calmly over the child's body and left her screaming on the ground.\\"\\"He put the glass to his lips and drank at one gulp. A cry followed; he reeled, staggered, clutched at the table and held on, starring with injected eyes, gasping with open mouth; and as I looked there came, I thought, a change-he seemed to swell-his face became suddenly black and the features seemed to melt and altar-and the next moment, I had sprung to my feet and leaped back against the wall, my arm raised to shield me from the prodigy, my mind submerged in terror.\`O God!' I screamed, and \`O God!' again and again; for there before my eyes-pale and shaken, and half fainting, and groping before him with his hands, like a man restored from death-there stood Henry Jekyll!\\"Gabriel John Utterson is a lawyer of a rugged countenance. He never smiled. He's lean, long dreary, dusty and lovable.Richard Enfield is a nephew of Mr. Utterson who is well loved throughout the town.Dr. Lanyon is a wise old colleague of Henry Jekyll. He also knows Mr. Utterson.Henry Jekyll is a scientist. He is very smart and discovers a new split personality formula.The story takes place in London, England in the 1800's or nineteenth century. It is an old fantasy novel with a little suspense mingled in. The problem is Dr. Jekyll's experiment sort of traps him in the body of Mr. Hyde. He can only stay Dr. Jekyll when he has drinking the formula.The author has made this book very suspenseful. He has done that by shifting the point-of-views from person to person and in many different forms. He has made this writing very pithy by using semi-colons and comas a lot. The characters are also described well as with the setting of the book. The plot is just a very good plot.People who like to read suspenseful novels would like this because it's suspenseful. Mystery readers will like this book. Also, people with great imaginations will like this book because it gives a lot of details that paint great pictures.This book isn't like any other book I have ever read. It has a totally unique style with much detail and extensive writing. Yet, this novel is a very quickly read novel, unlike other excessively detailed books like Dracula. This book is not boring like To Kill a Mockingbird and Dracula. This book is fun unlike those boring books. It doesn't discombobulate the plot with detail like those other books. This book is humorful unlike those stern previously mentioned books.Other fantasy books are usually not even close to realistic. Whereas Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is close to being conceived realistic. This book has a general morbid feeling to it where other fantasies are sometimes cheerful and happy. This book is different than Bram Stoker's work. Dracula (Bram Stoker's work) is very boring, morbid, long, and not fun at all to read. Robert Louis Stevenson is a much better writer according to me.The author uses a very wide range of vocabulary. It uses many 19th Century terms that seem weird and different to me. This is very impressive to me. One thing bad about his writing is his punctuation. He uses way too many semicolons and comas. He makes one sentence out of six or seven sentences. He is way too pithy.This book was not the best book I ever read, but was not the worst book I read either. This book was mediocre. It was miles ahead of Dracula and To Kill a Mockingbird. Those books were boring, whereas Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is fast paced, quick, and fun to read. Since it's morbid it's not really good. Since it is very short it is a good book on my list. To read this book is very easy. All you have to do is read until you want to stop. Since this is short and fun you will finish it in no time. Students out there if you need to read a book and you have to read a book, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is your choice. Mainly cause its short and sweet."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"I have read or seen performed several different versions of the Jekyll and Hyde story, but none of them compare to the original short novel.

It kept my attention constantly. In many ways it can be paralelled to Oscar Wilde's &quot;The Picture of Dorian Grey&quot;. Jekyll and Hyde was an adept look at the nature of Victorian Society. It touched on such issues as the importance of appearance and the inevitable consequences of one's actions. It was incredibly compelling, and had no boring sections (like Dorian Grey did). An excellent novella and a very good read!"},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"I read this book once as a junior high school kid and it had mere connotations of a spooky tale. At that age, it paled in comparison to the horror flicks of the day. All the psychological factors did not register at that time. I did decide to re-read the book more recently. I also re-read it right on the heels of reading The Double by Fyodor Dostoevsky and Edgar Allan Poes short story William Wilson. I would have to rank it lower than the story by Old Fyodor but it still had a stronger impact than it did as a pubescent punk kid. It is also a bit more developed than the Poe tale. My interest in the dual nature of man has been piqued by reading these two books. The motifs of the story were more apparent. It is a great work that gets overlooked by the literati but will surely outlive many of the preferred classics that the Academy recommends. I would say that anyone interested in psychology in literature or in the dual nature of man should give this a try. Rediscovering these old literary classics has proven to be a great joy and a very rewarding experience.

Along with Mary Wollstonecraft's \\"Frankenstein\\" (the Thing Without a Name) and Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" (the Vampire) Robert Louis Stevenson's novella is part of the gothic foundation of the modern horror story. All have in common the fact that they promise to tell a story that might best be left untold, which, of course, is exactly the sort of story we want to hear.Given that Stevenson was writing when the genre of horror fiction was not recognized as such, it is surprising that \\"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" is cast in the form of a mystery novel. Stevenson invites his readers to try and get ahead of the story, to put the clues together and come to the conclusion. Today it is nearly impossible to pick up this story and not know the \\"secret,\\" but if you think back to the late 19th-century when this story was written you can get a sense for how Stevenson used the biases and limitations of his readers to his advantage in keeping them from what we might consider to be an obvious conclusion.More importantly, Stevenson is writing several decades before the writings of Sigmund Freud revolutionized the whole idea of human psychology. Yet we can certainly find evidence of the conscious and subconscious mind of which Freud would write. Stevenson reinforces this metaphor with the block of buildings that divides this particular part of London, with one side representing the civilized world of a respected physician and the other side the squalor of the world inhabited by an inhuman creature who gives in to his every earthly desire. The novella also speaks to the topic of evolution, with Hyde being described as \\"ape-like,\\" reinforcing the idea that our most human attributes remove us ever further from the category of mere animal.Of the three classic horror novels, \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" is the most accessible. Not only because of its shorter length, but also because its evil is more realistic, even in terms of our imagination. We might be unable to reanimate the dead or to become the walking dead, but we can certainly relate to the idea of unleashing the beast buried with us. Even if we could not, we can recognize the \\"werewolf\\" in the real world in the form of serial killers who try to show a civilized face to us in public. This is not to say that the novella is simplistic, for Stevenson offers a sophisticated narrative. If this is one of those literary you have never read because you already know the story, then you should take out an evening to sit down and finally get around to reading it."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"If you love action packed book you should read Dr.Jekyll and Mr.Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson.It's about a kind docter named Henry Jekyll,he makes a potiont that turns him into the weirdist scareist creature.

It is full of qualms and wonderments, mysteries, adventure, and sadness.It is an amazing plot, how Henry Jekyll's serect enjoyment of evil deeds leads him to discover a way to transform himself into an entirely new person. But when this evil nature takes him over completely, he can't bear to live with what he's done to his life ...Although I thought the story was wonderful, I only gave it four stars for two reasons:Firstly, Stevenson uses waaaaay too many semicolons. Almost every sentence has one; there was one run-on sentence that went for three quarters of a page!And, of course, the ending... I felt so awful for the doctor, and it really dwarfed my own problems.All things considered, I highly recommend this book, but for younger readers, maybe, the Wishbone version. I am pretty young myself, and I read the Wishbone story first, then the real one, and it helped because some of the language was extremely advanced (I kept my dictionary at hand).

He is a wealthy man who lives in London around 1885. He was making some experiments on him self by taking drugs and turning into another person. He named this person he changed into Mr. Hyde. Dr. Jekyll was living with two different personalities. He was living this character so often that he wrote a will leaving all his belongings to his other character in case he shifts to the other personality permanently. This confused his friends. A lawyer named Mr. Utterson who started investigating about the mystery of the will because Dr. Jekyll did not introduce him to this unknown character. First, Mr. Utterson discussed Dr. Jekyll's character with Mr. Enfield. Mr. Enfield told him about a man who had tripped over a little girl without realizing what he did just stood there silently with out any reaction for how he had tripped over the girl, while people gathered around to help the crying girl, the girl's father came shouting for the police. The strange man finally spoke asking them not to call the police offering a 100 pounds. They accepted the offer and went with him to a house where he brought out a Checkbook in the name of Dr. Jekyll and signed as Mr. Hyde. Mr. Enfield took Mr. Utterson and showed him the door to that house. Dr. Jekyll never mentioned Mr. Hyde's name to him. He then went to visit Dr. Lanyon, a very close friend of Dr. Jekyll, to ask him about \\"Mr. Hyde.\\" Dr. Lanyon knew Dr. Jekyll but he had no idea about Edward Hyde. Mr. Utterson kept watching the back door at night, finally at the third night he saw a little man wearing large clothes at the door. He stepped up to him and called him Mr. Hyde. The man answered back \\"how do you know me.\\" Mr. Utterson told him that Dr. Jekyll informed him about him because he is his lawyer. The man ignored Utterson and quickly unlocked the door, walked in and shut the door behind him. Mr. Utterson went to Dr. Jekyll's house and asked his servant, Poole, if Dr. Jekyll was in the house or not. Poole said that he was out. Then he asked him if he knows a Mr. Hyde and the servant answered that he is a friend of Dr. Jekyll however he had never met him because he usually comes in through the back door of the laboratory.In conclusion, Mr. Utterson's search for the identity of Mr. Hyde was still not going well. He investigated with all the mutual friends. He found through the letters send to him and the rest of the friends that Dr. Jekyll was involved in a serious experiment to control the evil part of his mind.

It's a revelation, it goes much deeper into characters, and is written with such elegance. I think shocking is not too strong a word to describe this novella. It really deserves its fame.

The reasons for this are indefinable, but the fact remains - I do not care overly much for any of his work. \\"Jekyll and Hyde\\" is the only one of his works from which I have gained any satisfaction. Its brilliant characterization, its seductive atmosphere - both serve to give the story depth and immediacy. For all that I couldn't rate it higher than three stars. I suspect that at least part of the reason is that \\"Jekyll and Hyde\\" has become so deeply rooted in pop culture that most people know exactly what the relationship between the two men is, thus removing the element of tension from the story. For me, the biggest problem I had was the anti-climatical ending. While the final two chapters shed a great deal of light on Jekyll's actions, I felt as though Stevenson was beating me over the head with his themes. I would have prefered something more subtle. As for the other two stories in this particular edition ('A South Sea Bridal' and 'The Ebb-Tide'), towards them I feel quite indifferent."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was the book of the century. It was a novel that did a great job dealing with the good versus evil controversy that is within all of us. The character of Mr. Hyde showed that even someone as good as Dr. Jekyll had a side that wasn't perfect. The characters had to struggle through the times of the Victorian period when people were very opinionated and were a lot like the people of society today. Everyone has another side to them and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde can help you find that side. I highly recommend reading this great novel. It can help you deal with the good versus evil that is within you."},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"This book provides a great read considering how few pages it is. The plot itself is entertaining, at least the first time you read it. It's a compelling mystery that is finally solved as the clues are put together. Subsequent readings proved to be more bland, as I already knew the solution of the mystery, which is a big part of the book. Reading about the ending may spoil it for you, but I think it will still be worth your time to read about it unfolding for yourself.Dr. Jekyll is a rich, respected doctor who nonetheless has needs within himself that are socially unacceptable. He indulges in this part of him, Mr. Hyde, by taking a drug he devised. This way, he can attempt to satisfy these desires while still being able to come back to being the respected Dr. Jekyll. Eventually, the sickness of Mr. Hyde grows to be too much for Jekyll to take, so he decides to do away with Hyde. However, we see that those desires and his enjoyment of Hyde aren't totally gone, because he keeps a place and everything for Hyde. Eventually, Jekyll mutates into Hyde against his will, without even taking the drug, and this marks the beginning of the end of Dr. Jekyll.Hyde is a symbol of anti-social desires within us, the \\"Id\\" as Freud called it. Hyde can also symbolize an addiction, avarice, hatred, or any other vice. Hyde is a thing that people may discover and try to play with behind closed doors (Mr. \\"Hide\\"). The lesson is that we can't play with the animal nature of ourselves without becoming that animal, as the difference between Hyde and Jekyll grew blurrier throughout the book until there almost was no difference. It eventually can take control over us and no longer stay hidden. Similar themes are found in \\"Frankenstein.\\""},{"Title":"The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,","review":"This classic tale by Robert Louis Stevenson has been read by people all over the world.

When I began to read I was happy to find that the book lived up to my expectations in portraying the happy go lucky docter who winds up paying for his innocence. The book isn't much of a horror book, though. It is more of a tragedy of the greek variety. If you are looking for a horror book, I suggest you pick up 'The Shining' by Steven King.

I also thought this book was way to long with 54 pages. I think it could have been put into a 20-page book and still have the same content of a 54-page book. I think that this was also very boring. I mean the best part was when Dr. Lanyon wrote that Mr. Hyde came to his house, mixed up a potion, and he turned into Dr. Jekyll. That has very little excitement to it.

A novel of huge scope and political intrigue, it is also a novel in which no character actually wins. All must accept the ironies which fate has dealt them. Setting the novel in the imaginary South American country of Costaguana, the story centers around a silver mine in the mountains outside of the capital, Sulaco, vividly depicting its allure and the price each character pays for its success.When Charles Gould, returns from England to claim and reopen the rich silver mine he has inherited from his father, he has good intentions-- to provide jobs for the peasants and contribute to the economy of the town at the same time that he also profits. Soon, however, he becomes obsessed with wealth and power, and as the political climate gets hotter, he must pay off government officials, bandits, the church, and various armed revolutionaries to be able to work. Each of these groups is vividly depicted as working for its own ends and not for the good of the people, and with their goals focused on the real world, these characters have no self-awareness, nor do they develop it during the novel.In contrast to these \\"unrealized\\" humans, Conrad presents several characters who develop some self-awareness through their experiences. Nostromo, a local legend, is a man of principle who has always kept his word. Martin Decoud, a newspaper man, is a nihilist who has editorialized against the revolution, though he has yet to test himself. Dr. Monygham, captured during a past revolution, broke under torture, and is now seeking absolution by fighting against this revolution. And the good and long-suffering wife of Charles Gould, Dona Emilia spends her time helping others.When Nostromo agrees to protect a load of silver from revolutionaries by taking it out to sea, Conrad provides a bleak commentary on idealism and human nature. The conclusion, which includes a love story that feels tacked on, reveals Conrad's darkest self and offers little hope of change and even less hope for man's redemption. Rich in atmosphere, vibrant in description, filled with characters representing all walks of life and philosophy, and set in a country where revolution is a way of life, the novel is full of dark portents and bleak political outcomes. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Nostromo (Everyman's Library Classics)","review":"Joseph Conrad's 1904 novel NOSTROMO is set in Costaguana, a fictional South American country (though clearly based on Colombia and Panama) that has seen continuous waves of dictatorships and popular uprisings, reducing it to a poor backwater. But things are looking up for its western province where Charles Gould, native-born but of English ancestry, opens a silver mine with the backing of an American magnate and a British railroad company. Conrad's interest is the tension between the European residents of Sulaco, who think that their financial interests are bringing stability and prosperity to a dysfunctional state, and the Costaguanan peasants who think that foreigners are plundering their land. After reading NOSTROMO, I'm pretty confident now that Conrad was a colonialist and a racist, as some critics have long charged, but I think he was a nuanced one.Initially, we get only allusions to Nostromo, an Italian immigrant who distinguishes himself as the leader of the port's longshoremen and by his readiness to undertake difficult tasks for the Europeans. Everyone calls him the \\"indispensable man\\" and he becomes a Costaguanan national myth, but he remains an enigma for much of the novel. Eventually Nostromo's story, his thirst for recognition and wealth, takes over and and relegates the political drama to the background.Unfortunately, I found NOSTROMO tedious. Conrad called this 400-page depiction of a whole society his \\"largest canvas\\", and he gets so involved in world-building that there's no dramatic push. Only about halfway through do we start to see a glimmer of a plot. If your only previous experience with Conrad (as I think is the case with many potential readers) is HEART OF DARKNESS, where the action flows as steadily as the Congo River that is the work's setting, then you may well be frustrated by the slow pace of this novel. Also, Conrad's peculiar English (he didn't speak the language regularly until the age of 20) is intriguing at shorter spans but here just contributes to the burdensome nature of getting through this book. I appreciate a number of elements of Conrad's art, but I find it hard to recommend this.I read the Wordsworth Classics edition of this book. It features a decent introduction and footnotes by scholar Robert Hampson, as well as a glossary of the foreign-language terms sprinkled throughout the text. Unfortunately, the quality of Wordsworth Classics publications leaves much to be desired and after a single reading the binding and paper were beginning to fall apart."},{"Title":"Al Otro Lado","review":"He aqu&iacute; un libro... donde el erotismo alcanza su m&aacute;xima expresi&oacute;n, un libro de confesiones inconfesables, que cuestiona el pecado y tiende una cuerda floja entre el bien y el mal, un libro que ahonda en la escabrosa y fr&aacute;gil naturaleza humana, donde un cura demasiado joven escucha a una joven con demasiado miedo, un libro de org&iacute;as y seducciones, donde una mujer explora a trav&eacute;s del cuerpo, los laberintos del alma, y donde danzan, fren&eacute;ticos y tiernos: prostitutas, corruptos, asesinas, travest&iacute;es, ingenuos, homosexuales y amantes incansables... ...un libro que hace, deshace y te hace el amor.&quot;Al otro lado&quot; ha sido uno de los libros m&aacute;s un&aacute;nimemente celebrados por la cr&iacute;tica.

If completed it could have exceeded Hitler's wildest dreams of the world-wide extermination of the Jews. Yet, unlike Nazi Germany's Holocaust, Stalin's genocidal campaign is generally viewed as an obscure footnote in the Jewish history of the period. Dr. Alexander Rashin's book \\"Why Didn't Stalin Murder All The Jews\\" provides deep insights into this long-overlooked period by mixing a detailed perceptive analysis of the motivations and agendas of the major ruling figures of the USSR with personal recollections and interviews of the individual Russian Jews threatened by this catastrophe.As Konrad Heider's Der Fuhrer did for the murderous elites of Nazi Germany, Rashin draws an illuminating picture of the murderous hierarchies and schemes of Stalin's Soviet Union while at the same time contrasting and comparing Stalin's USSR to Hitler's Third Reich. And like George Clare's \\"Last Waltz in Vienna\\", Rashin also draws an intimate portrait of ordinary life coming under the iron fist of a terrible tyranny and the even more terrible shadow of their planned extermination.For all its horrors, most of the Jews of the USSR and its satellite republics including Rashin's family survived Stalin's rule. The same on the other hand could not have been said for the Jewish communities swept by the Nazi war machine. Searching for the reasons of this difference in outcome is the theme of Rashin's work as he surveys a vast quantity of research materials while never losing sight of the ordinary people whose lives stood on the line in this critical time.Where Hitler's Final Solution for the Jews was an open book and the forthright policy of the regime, Stalin's Final Solution was a more devious and cunning plan that might well have succeeded in accomplishing what the Nazis did not complete. Stalin would carry out a genocide while shifting the responsibility to convenient scapegoats. This would allow Stalin to both exterminate the Jewish people and pose as their protector, helping to preserve and expand the ranks of the Communist Party's heavily Jewish supporters around the world, even as the trains rumbled east to the frozen wastelands of the USSR's Jewish concentration camps.It is this very deviousness that made Stalin's Unfinished Holocaust more difficult to pin down than the genocide of Nazi Germany and that makes Rashin's elucidation of this difficult and elusive material an all the more impressive contribution to Jewish History. Yet Rashin manages to do this without ever allowing his narrative to become the enumeration of dry facts. His book emerges rather as the exploration of history that reaches from the minute details of his parent's ordinary family life to the highest chambers of the Communist Party. \\"Why Didn't Stalin Murder All the Jews\\" differs from more conventional historical works in that for Rashin it is a deconstruction of events that brought about not only the survival of one of the largest Jewish communities in the world, but by extension his own survival as well. The result is an engaging work of historical detection invaluable to students of Jewish and Russian history and a compelling narrative of the transformation of a human tragedy into an extraordinary redemption.Rashin's book differs from most others in one more important way. Stuffier historians might have quibbled at referencing the role of the divine in historical events. Rashin perceptively juxtaposes the secular and religious views of history noting that Stalin's abrupt collapse into his terminal coma happened exactly on the Jewish holiday of Purim. His research leads to a suggestion that this was hardly a coincidence but rather Stalin's backfired attempt to subvert the Jewish people by manipulating their sacred history.There is an ancient Jewish tradition of celebrating the salvation of a Jewish community as a Special Purim. Stalin's collapse occurring on Purim created a concurrent holiday of Purim-Stalin for the Russian (and maybe all) Jews. Rashin unapologetically promotes Purim-Stalin as a thanksgiving and celebration of the recent annulment of a terrible decree against the Jews that according to the tradition happened through the hidden hand of G-d."},{"Title":"Why Didn't Stalin Murder All the Jews","review":"Alexander Rashin wrote a very interesting book about Stalin's last years, largely devoted by the dictator to the final solution of the Jewish question. The book is entitled \\"Why Didn't Stalin Murder All The Jews?\\"And really, why? Numerous answers to this question have been offered. However, the answer offered by A. Rashin struck me as the most convincing, and probably the only correct one. By analyzing a vast number of known documents and evidences, the author creates a wide, multilevel panorama of Soviet life at the times of execution of the Jewish Antifascist Committee and the Doctors' Plot. In fact he shows that just a single circumstance let the Soviet Jews avoid a horrific destiny - a second holocaust.However, comrade Stalin, either because of his age and ailing, or because he came to believe that he was God, became negligent in the latest of his usually extremely carefully planned intrigues. On the one hand, he organized a massive assault on Lavrenty Beria's supporters and prot&eacute;g&eacute;s in Beria's native Mingrelia and in Moscow. On the other hand, Stalin left Beria too close to the real power levers, probably planning to re-use him in the role of a major executioner of the Great Purges of the 1930s. Beria served Stalin as a devoted dog, first as a head of security forces and then as ruthlessly efficient organizer of the nuclear project. He got scared, foreseeing a new purge, and started to look for co-conspirators with prot&eacute;g&eacute;s in the security forces to organize a plot. He hinted to two of Stalin's closest associates, Malenkov and Khrushchev, that Stalin directed him to collect compromising evidence against them, because after the massacre of the Jews they would be accused of fomenting anti-Semitism and of failures in the internal policies. Beria knew all too well the worth of Stalin's inner circle - only to save their own lives would they risk assassinating the \\"beloved leader.\\" Beria was not mistaken, and on March 1, 1953, Stalin was helped into a fatal coma. Rashin rather convincingly sets forth that the date of Stalin's collapse was not haphazard but had a specific purpose in Stalin's own plans.The book reads not as a dry historic account, but as a truly gripping novel of political detection."},{"Title":"Why Didn't Stalin Murder All the Jews","review":"I write this review an hour after hearing Alexander Rashin, the author, speak extensively about the issues raised in his book, which coincidentally I finished reading this afternoon. The uniqueness of this volume is that Rashin's family not only lived through Stalin's anti-Jewish campaign, but Rashin was able to emigrate to the US, then find extensive, emerging documentation to offer multiple analyses of why and how Stalin tried to murder millions of Soviet Jews, and how Stalin's sudden death in 1953 thwarted his plan.Rashin weaves his own family's history together with his portrait of Stalin. He likens Stalin's death/murder to the biblical account of Purim, in which the Jews of the Persian empire were swiftly, miraculously saved from the hangman Haman. Rashin offers a new theory that at the same time as Stalin sought to murder many Jews, he might have planned to publicly intervene to save others, and send them to Israel to become there a fifth column.The book is a highly worthwhile read, in a very personal style, leaving the reader with many \\"what ifs\\" to ponder."},{"Title":"Why Didn't Stalin Murder All the Jews","review":"Minutes after opening Why Didn't Stalin Murder All the Jews I was drawn back in time by the rise to power, inner political intrigues and global machinations of one of history's most ruthless tyrants, Joseph Stalin. Interspersed within the historical perspective, powerfully rich in detail, is the compelling narrative of the author's family during that period, offering a tangible everyman context to all the upheaval, conflict and mass change.The book also details the ruthlessly self-interested cooperation between Stalin's Russia and Hitler's Germany and its eventual culmination in brutal war. Rashin gives anecdotal insights into the personal relationship between Stalin and Hitler, allowing us to imagine what a direct meeting of their personalities may have been like, for them, and for the world. Amazingly, that is only the beginning!Delving into Stalin's motives for anti-Semitism and correlating that with recorded events, the author produces a solid working theory. This theory is threaded meticulously through the actions of soviet politicians, farcical trials, KGB espionage, and into the great mystery of Stalin's end game for the Jews and his sudden enigmatic demise. Aside from the enjoyment I had in turning each page to satisfy my curiosity for the story, I found myself educated about a crucial moment in history. The author has the rare ability to lay the facts on the table without prejudice, letting the reader draw his or her own conclusions.Finally, after finishing the book I was left with a refreshing perspective on life's events and it's coincidences. I whole-heartedly recommend this book to anyone who is a student of history, a student of life, to those with Russian or Jewish interests or simply anyone who enjoys a great read!"},{"Title":"Why Didn't Stalin Murder All the Jews","review":"because Mom and the Talmud always say that if one only has loshon hora to say it is better to not say anything at all. However, this book was a huge disappointment.After reading Chief Culprit: Stalin's Grand Design to Start World War II by Victor Suvorov I really wanted to know more about the subject. Now THIS guy Suvorov paints a picture. I thought I would try this as the description looked inviting. Big mistake.This book, Why Didn't Stalin... is probably 50% mostly information found in Suvorov's book and 50% family reminiscences. Now I like a good yarn but I wouldn't call the old family memories the definitive accounting of Stalin's horrors.Suvorov's book goes into detail, starting pre-revolution and discusses that lunatics insane ways. As a military analyst he gives good military reasoning behind all of the moves documented in the book. (For instance, did you know defensive roads along a border run parallel to that border, but that Stalin build his roads running perpendicular, so as to be able to attack? And he makes a HUGE case of Stalin's aligning with H in 1939 to draw the western Allies into the conflict, to tire them out, so he can march in as savior and liberate Europe from the pangs of Capitalism? It is really excellent stuff.)In short, while I am sure Mr. Rashin has a family to feed I would suggest not relying on the royalties from this book to do so. The writing style is a bit weak and the presentation falls short of making the case.Sorry."},{"Title":"Why Didn't Stalin Murder All the Jews","review":"Stalin accomplished such a lot, that his confounded enemies desparately resort to all kinds of &quot;sci-fi&quot; type nonsense and weave all sorts of slanderous conjecture to try to turn the tables on his memory. And sadly, in this modern age of plenty, where idle and jaded young minds crave something fantastic, credulous fools drink it all in. This book is one such offering."},{"Title":"Science & Survival","review":"This book was a non-fiction book that was written in 1967 and was mostly based on the United States. However, Commoner did talk about worldwide effects too.The characters or people he dealt with in his book were government officials and scientists who kept information secret, other privately funded scientists who found serious mistakes in government testing, and everyone else in society.Science is advancing before consequences of nuclear tests and other tests are known. Commoner urges citizens for reform in government policies to protect us from the evils of nuclear fallout. The story is quite interesting, because he describes a valid point even with the limited knowledge he had over thirty years ago. He warns of the danger of fallout in this quote: \\"To understand the biological effects of fallout we must know what happens at each step of this complicated chain of events. There is now a fairly complete published record of this knowledge. This record reveals a number of important errors in our understanding of the problem, which remained uncorrected until the testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere was in full swing and fallout had been massively disseminated into the environment.\\"This book was left open-ended. He called everyone to make changes in the system. This story still continues. As we continue to pollute our earth, the earth will eventually not be safe from mankind. Only scientists and society will decide how this drama will unfold.The theme is that political power and moral judgment should be used to keep mankind and science from inevitably destroying our race. He says that society should protest against the evils of government testing.I recommend this book to anyone interested in science or interested in the survival of the human race on this planet. I definitely discourage anyone with a short attention span or anyone with limited knowledge in science from reading this book. It gets very scientific and somewhat boring in some parts, but for the most part puts forth a good message."},{"Title":"The World's Greatest Super-Heroes","review":"If you are into Super-Heroes and those specifically related to DC, this is a must have book. The quality of the illustrations is worth every penny.Paul Franco"},{"Title":"The World's Greatest Super-Heroes","review":"Alex Ross is an American treasure. He brings a visual reality to our mythology. This collection of work is an incredible bargain, and something any fan of either his work or the subject matter (the heros of DC Comics' pantheon) will treasure for a lifetime."},{"Title":"The World's Greatest Super-Heroes","review":"This leviathan collects six extremely-expensive-to-produce stories written by Paul Dini and of course, drawn and colored by artistic legend, Alex Ross.It's hard not to be ensnared by the life-like artwork, which really goes without saying, I think. In the back of the book, there's a collection of \\"behind the scenes\\" detailing the work that goes into creating the realistic expressions, poses, and more impressively, the costumes. It's difficult not to be impressed when you see Alex Ross drawing from athletic models fitted head to toe in these costumes to capture it all on page. Indeed, it truly is Alex Ross who makes this collection worthwhile.As implied, this also reveals some pretty thin story-telling. Superman is moved to stave off world hunger after rescuing a starving young woman. Batman is particularly motivated to save a deteriorating neighborhood when a young boy is orphaned. Captain Marvel is taken to entertaining and helping the broken down youth at a children's hospital. Wonder Woman wedges her way into the mortal world by walking among them. And then after a double page origin story detailing the big guns of the Justice League, a lackluster story pits them against a dangerous alien virus, told from the Martian Manhunter's perspective.In text, the stories are almost below average in their simplicity. Paul Dini never misses a chance to bring in all kinds of verbal, situational, and dramatic irony, some being a bit tongue-in-cheek, while others adding to the conflict in the story, an example being the Martian Manhunter's weakness is fire, which he notes as he tries to escape a blaze, is what man regards as the seminal moment of their advancement.I have to admit, I really was disappointed by the quiet down-time nature of each story. Nearly every conflict in each story is one that sure, works for each character's ideals, but isn't at all exclusive to them. Meaning, any superhero could go on a quest to cure world hunger. Any superhero could try to infiltrate an oppressive dictatorship. There's just a certain lack of uniqueness in the stories themselves, which I dare to say, is felt through the absence of any supervillains.One could argue that if you're looking for that kind of story, then go seek out \\"Absolute Justice\\", which is a pure and simple \\"versus\\" story of epic proportions. But I just thought that, with the quality of Alex Ross' work, and the nature of each character, having a super bad guy show up in at least one or two of the stories would have been refreshing. Ah well.You should know that only the last story featuring the Justice League is partially committed to comic-book form, while the rest plays out like a picture book, with dialogue narrated by each respective character, in past tense.Regardless of its shortcomings, \\"The World's Greatest Super-Heroes\\" collection comes recommended to all readers, especially newcomers."},{"Title":"The World's Greatest Super-Heroes","review":"I find Alex Ross to be the best artist in the comic book industry, period. Some people say that a comic shouldn't be painted, but they're just being closed minded. It's about time anyway, especially with some of the work out there being done today. Some comic book artists need a lesson in proportion and figure study, that's all I'm saying. (And for some inkers, a class about understanding the role of light and shadow wouldn't be too bad a thing to take either.)Anyway, like I've probably hinted, I bought this book because of the art. And considering Dini's past experience, I'd expected the writing to be pretty good as well. Unfortunately, it's not all that great. Most of the stories don't use word bubbles (excluding the Justice League story,) in what I'm guessing to be a sort of different take on the standard comic book. I have nothing against that move, but what came out of it was rather flat. A narrative, I believe, doesn't conjure as much interest as dialogue (which would be word bubbles.) Not that there isn't any sort of dialogue in these stories, there are, but more room is taken up by the thoughts of the narrator, which would be the lead super hero in each story. Of course, to read the inner workings of Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman sounds like great fun, but it just comes out rather bland and uninteresting.Two stories that I think worked the best were the Batman and Captain Marvel stories. The two that I think were the least engaging were the Superman and Wonder Woman ones. Others may think differently, but we all have different opinions, so it's up the person. All of the stories in the book deal with humanity issues, which is a nice change. And the Justice League comic isn't bad. And Alex Ross is doing his Alex Ross thing. So overall, if you want the art, just buy it, considering the savings you get with Amazon. If you're more the person that wants an interesting and engaging storyline, you might want to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The World's Greatest Super-Heroes","review":"I have been an avid superhero fan since a child. I have read many comics, both good and bad. This collection of DC stories is by far the most visually appealing. Not only is the art work of Alex Ross incredible, but the story telling is phenomenal as well.In this book Superman tries to cure hunger, Batman endeavors to completely cease criminal activity, and Wonder Woman aims to free oppressed women. Each character runs into the same problem. They are only one person. Despite all their super-abilities they are unable to eradicate the crime, starvation, oppression, etc.The realization the characters come to is devastating but well portrayed. They are timeless stories about ageless heroes.The second section of the book deals with the JLA. My favorite section is the \\"Secret Origins\\" part where each main character of the JLA gets a two page origin spread!All in all the book is worth the money. It is a treasure to read over and over again. Share it with friends and family. A must have!"},{"Title":"The World's Greatest Super-Heroes","review":"This book reprints 6 special comics and does them justice. Alex Ross's art not only looks great, but tells the story well.The pretty pictures do not get in the way of the story. The book is smaller size than the originals, which were the size of the old LIFE magazine, but the art is not impaired in the least and the production values are top of the line.What makes the book worth having, though, are not the pretty pictures but the stories.Paul Dini writes stories which make each of the characters examine themselves, bringing us along in a thoroughly entertaining manner. He makes them very human, complemented by the art which is very lifelike (Ross uses human models.)The Batman story is the best, the Justice League story the weakest, although that is a relative judgement since it is a pretty good story.At the time the stories were first published, I had wished that the 5th volume would be a Plastic Man story and still feel that would have been a better way to go, but such was not to be. Regardless, this book will remind you why we love superheroes."},{"Title":"The World's Greatest Super-Heroes","review":"Whether you're new to the DC Universe or a diehard fan from yesteryear, there is something in this amazing collection sure to delight you.

The chapters contained within the book are treasures of narrative that will keep one's attention without any trouble at all. I am a fan of the X-Men from 'that other Comic Book company'. But I get too caught up in the megalomania of those stories that I realized how much I saw that superheroes dealing with common criminals and situations are as much, if not more, compelling.Each Hero or Heroine here deals with their own problems with as much panache and intensity as if they were dealing with super-powered villains and you see they must also reflect on the results and possible consequences of their invlovement. While I loved them all, I particuarly liked Captain Marvel's story participating as a 'guest visitor' at a hospital for recovering children. He could be fighting Superbaddies #1 and #2 but involved his time with issues such as re-educating an abusive father. A class story through and through.And needless to say, Alex Ross's artwork was as awesome literally from cover to cover as it was on Kingdom Come. I really wish Comic Book companies take a look at examples of Graphic Novel masterpieces such as this and realize why the comic book format can be in better shape than maybe it is today. Five stars and then some."},{"Title":"The World's Greatest Super-Heroes","review":"I own the single books from Dini/Ross teamup. Great books. They capture the essence of each character to build upon it a very meaningful and clever tale. Nothing to add about the art: Ross is well known and always getting better and better, with panels as evocative as the prose. The hardcover edition is the perfect way to enjoy these masterpieces (even if a bit heavy to handle.....). But if you are looking for extra material (as the new edition of Mythology) you could be disappointed."},{"Title":"The World's Greatest Super-Heroes","review":"I love DC's ABSOLUTE format, especially how it lovingly showcases the body of work contained within. It is grand to have this on the bookshelf and it's contents are indeed something to behold. The only reason I didn't give this edition a perfect score is that I wish this omnibus also included both the two page Robin origin and the short Batman/Superman story which were originally published in Ross' MYTHOLOGY book.

Alex Ross's art is as expected: thoughtful composition combined with photo-realistic imagery. You'll need a towel to wipe the drool. Paul Dini's writing certainly does not disappoint. There is a clear theme that ties everything together exceptionally well. Each character's voice sounds like their own. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The World's Greatest Super-Heroes","review":"The book is actually WIDER than the Absolute editions that they release!

Just get it."},{"Title":"The World's Greatest Super-Heroes","review":"The first thing you must realize when reading this book is that it is not set in any real continuity, it is simply tales of these heroes at there finest. What makes you want to read this book is the art work, the writing is what keeps you hooked all the way through out. This book is a collection of smaller works that Alex Ross and Paul Dini did in the past. There are four short stories about some of the more famous comic book characters. These include the big three: Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. The last one is Captain Marvel. The last too are about the Justice League. The first one tells the origins of the big players in the league. The second one tells a story that makes use of all of these major players. Paul Dini;s story telling is brilliant. He really captures these characters at there finest. One of my favorite moments was in the short Superman: Peace on Earth, where Superman realizes though he has all of the greatest powers in the world he cannot save everyone. Some would call this a love letter to the golden/silver age of comics, i would just call it golden. Alex Ross's Photo-realism is beautiful. These hand painted panels are so amazing, you will be afraid to turn the pages. If you are into wonderful art, and somewhat unorthodox comic book plots you will love this book. It is quiet hefty, but it is worth the buy."},{"Title":"The World's Greatest Super-Heroes","review":"I got this book on a recommendation for my husband for Christmas.

It collects all of Alex Ross' best superhero works in one place. A collection of intelligent, almost Rockwellian graphic novels: Superman: Peace on Earth, Batman: War On Crime, Captain Marvel: Power of Hope, Wonder Woman: Spirit of Truth and JLA: Liberty and Justice. These books are beautiful to behold, but not just for the art. Writer Paul Dini understands the essence of every superhero that he touches. He writes each character in their purest form and brings a sense of Americana to these stories. He really shows you that superheroes are American mythology and that they're not to be enjoyed just by children. If you love the DC universe or love superheroes in general, you won't want to miss this!"},{"Title":"The World's Greatest Super-Heroes","review":"The art was very well done.

It wouldn't work if you don't have Alex Ross magnificent paintings. Given that is a perfect compliment beteween human stories with human super-heroe pics the result is somehting over the charts.Is impossible not to be touched by this. I really was on the Superman story, Shazam, Batman and Wonder Woman. The Justice League is more action wise, and is also damn cool.If you don't have it (and you can pay it), just go for it.

The stories feature Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Captain Marvel and the Justice League- however, these are no ordinary superhero stories. Rather than fighting villains with death rays or armies of killer robots, the stories focus on the superheroes' frailties and failures, making them feel more accessible and 'human'. Superman takes on world hunger, Batman attacks the root cause of crime- poverty, Wonder Woman fights for women's rights, Captain Marvel reconciles the child and adult sides of himself, and the Justice League fight an alien virus- which the world thinks they might have created.This is fantastic value- much cheaper than buying the stories individually. Plus you get to see some of Ross' original sketches and photo-references. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The World's Greatest Super-Heroes","review":"Actually, this edition is more a 7 and a half stars worth of material. The writing, which is both accesible to children as to adults, tells the very human stories of legendary DC Universe heroes like Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman among others trying to make the world a better place in their own respective ways.The writing by Dini is excellent, showcasing an understanding of the human qualities of the superheroes few writers seem to understand let alone place on paper.The real reason why anyone would buy this would be Alex Ross' artwork. Its stunning realism and attention to detail makes the worlds of the heroes come to life in ways seldom seen in comic books.This book also comes with plenty of supplemental material by Ross such as unused artwork and promotional material for DC.Rest assured, however, that Dini's writing and Ross' artwork are reson enough to shell 50 dollars (less even from certain sellers here on amazon). You won't be disapointed. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The World's Greatest Super-Heroes","review":"As the title says this book is a must have if you are a fan of the staple DC heroes at all.The World's Greatest Super-Heroes is part comic, part encyclopedia giving you a good story as well as the background on some of the oldest super-heroes in the industry.If you haven't yet seen the book in person let me make sure one thing is abundanlt clear: It...is...big. It comes in a hard-cover sleeve (the same sort of system you get full season TV shows on DVD) that measures in at 9.5\\" x 13\\". This information is readily available but people may still be in for a shock when they receive the book.Once you pull the book from it's housing you will find a fantastic hard-cover book with an artistic sleeve over it. Why do I bother commenting about he artistic sleeve? Well, because it is painted by Alex Ross, a man who I think should be heralded as one of the \\"World's Greatest Comic Artits\\".My first fun in with Alex's work was the Kingdom Come series. If you have ever picked up and read a comic in your life then you know the medium (style and materials of art) has changed over the last century. Modern comics are actually computer shaded and coloured for the most part. Before that was the great days of the sketch artist, inker, colour artist system. Jump way, way back and we had the basic sketch artist to colour-dot print colouring system.Well, Alex Ross doesn't use a single one of those systems. No, the man uses oil paints. Having as many artists around me as I do in my life I can appreciate the skill required for this sort of work. In fact, I have watched Alex paint real-time on a few television shots. He brings the comic book, which is really a hard set of words to use when it comes to Ross' work, characters to a new photo-realistic quality. Seriously, if you are reading this and you have never seen a single piece of Alex's work stop reading and Google the man. You just might be impressed.It's funny, I own over 700 comic books myself, some 40+ years old. I was a Marvel fanatic when I was younger, but I find as I age that the DC universe actually holds more for me. I blame this partly on Alex Ross, Paul Dini, Marv Wolfman, and Mark Waid for bringing me such deep stories with true emotion then presenting them in brilliant form. I know I have harped on Alex Ross' work but the authors mentioned above should be lauded for their work as well (with the respective works being The World's Greatest Super Heroes, Crisis on Infinite Earths, and Kingdom Come).Either way, if you love anything DC you should own this book.Read More at www.GameTechWorld.com"},{"Title":"The World's Greatest Super-Heroes","review":"Ross and Dini rock.

This includes some of his best work. The stories and text are almost besides the point but they are quite good as well with the two JLA being the two weakest by far but still quite good.

First it is Visually stunning. More importantly this is a deep compassionate and intimate look at the human experience and the mitigation of suffering in the World. What Hugo said in a million words Ross and Deni effectively say in a few thousand. Despite their omnipotence, immense power, superior intellects and special powers these super heroes have NO DESIRE to dominate the World; only to serve it which for me is the purpose of life. This is now my most prized possession. And it should be required reading in schools for everyone because of it's deep moral and ethical teachings. If only our politicians, bankers, corporate executives, and Wall Street embodied these values, morals and ethics we could change the world.

Alex Ross, who's now a legend, shows why as he paints every single imaginable detail in such realistic incredibility. Its amazing. Somehow he creates an iconic look for each of these icons without making them look alike. Obviously the selling point of this collection is the artwork by Ross but Paul Dini does a good job with each story focusing on a certain aspect of the hero. While none of the plotlines are earth shattering or matter to the continuity of each hero they are still good. One small complaint was while mostly the book is done without text boxes the text can sometimes be hard to read or even see without them. I understand that the editors wanted as much of the art as possible to be seen but it's a hindrance at times. Overall this is a really good book that you could stare at for hours."},{"Title":"The World's Greatest Super-Heroes","review":"I remember falling in love with these things back in 1998. I STILL have each of my super oversized original editions, in mint condition I might add, and EVERY single time it comes time to move my library around, I am frustrated because these don't really go on or fit any shelves. I guess they weren't meant to, they were meant to be a throwback to the era of coffee table books. But regardless of what they are called, what they REALLY are is absolutely amazing. Words defy the sheer genius that these two legends in the fields of comics have created here. I've often wished for a collective edition folks, and here we have it.I've seen a few reviews grumblings about reduction in size, and the lack of a hard cover edition. I grumble with you! LOL But fear not, my friend who works in the industry said that the plan was to release an Absolute edition if this sold well. And I'm gonna go ahead and guess that it is indeed selling well. LOL And that's works out perfectly, because I had special shelves built just to hold my Absolute editions. LOLI won't go too much into spoilers, except to say that if you haven't read these, do yourself a favor and get this book. The introduction says it all when it says that they posed the conundrum... Alex Ross makes them look real... But what if they ACTED real in these books too? And that's what they strive for. We're treated to hyper realistic versions of Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Captain Marvel, and then two JLA stories. Each and every page bursts with beauty and splendor, and I think the stories are some of the best around. So okay, there might not be the normal rock 'em, sock 'em actions to some of the stories... But they're still INCREDIBLE stories nonetheless. Superman trying to end world hunger, and Wonder Woman standing up for women's rights? Yep, sounds about right to me. And they are wonderfully written, blending perfectly with the stunning art that makes up EVERY. SINGLE. PANEL.Alex Ross is an artist at the top of his game, and this is the stuff he was born to do. If you've never read these books, then now is the time. Give them a try, and I truly believe you won't be disappointed.Thanks for your time folks.Sincerely, R.A. McDowell"},{"Title":"The World's Greatest Super-Heroes","review":"Despite not being labeled \\"Absolute\\" there is no difference between this edition and an Absolute edition. It has a slip case, book place ribbon, and is roughly the same size as a typical Absolute edition. The presentation of this edition like all Absolute editions is gorgeous. The oversized pages with the beautiful coloring combined with Alex Ross' art is incredible.This edition consists of a story for Superman individually, Batman individually, Captain Marvel individually, Wonder Woman individually, and the Justice League. The art on all of these stories is equally beautiful. Alex Ross' true to life but still super-powered heroes rarely look as great.As far as the stories, the Justice League story while good is probably the most generic of the bunch but that could be because the individual stories are so great. Batman's is o.k. but failed to strike a cord with me. His interaction with a young boy is probably the best part of the story. Captain Marvel's story is touching and does a great job to dealing with his duality as a boy and an adult in an interesting challenge. But the two absolutely amazing works are Superman and Wonder Woman's stories; both have tremendous verisimilitude. Superman faces the limit of his powers and Wonder Woman faces the reality of how to be a diplomat and not just a comic book character. Both legitimately engender an emotional reaction which is saying a tremendous amount given the nature of the comic book medium."},{"Title":"The Carpenters: The Untold Story : An Authorized Biography","review":"In \\"The Carpenters: The Untold Story\\" Ray Coleman has written the authorized (with Richard Carpenter's approval) biography of the famous brother and sister singer act, the Carpenters. With many other musical biographies to his credit (John Lennon, Frank Sinatra, Eric Clapton, and others), Coleman surely has the literary talent to tell the story of Richard and Karen Carpenter, yet, unfortunately, Coleman fails to deliver the intimate personal details that help one to understand the tragic and bittersweet story that is the Carpenters.In any autorized biography, there is a tendancy to \\"sugar-coat\\" the live(s) of the subjects, and to gloss over their shortcomings. This then begs the question: Does Coleman tell the fans the entire story of the Carpenter Duo, warts and all? In my reading of the book, I have to answer both \\"yes\\" and \\"no\\". Yes, Coleman tells the entire story of the Carpenter's birth in New Haven, CT, to their relocation across the country to Downey, CA (to further the musical aspirations of Rich Carpenter), to the meteoric rise through the pop charts, and finally, to the sad decline and eventual death of Karen to anorexia at just 32 years of age. The basic framework of their lives is told here with input from many different sources, but what is lacking is the personal and character development of both Richard and Karen. Yes, we learn about their hits, but what do we actually know about their personal lives? What are they like when the stage lights are dim? What did they do for fun? Did they drink, smoke, party, etc.? Virtually nothing is told about their personal lives, and this especially holds true for Richard Carpenter. We know so little about Richard, and yet in the TV movie about their lives, we are given snippets of scenes where perhaps Richard was not lax in partaking of the sexual benefits of being adored by his female fans. Coleman mentions nothing of this. On the other hand, Richard's battle with addiction to prescription sleeping pills is detailed. In an unedited backstage picture with Herb Alpert and Karen, I saw Richard Carpenter with a lit cigarette in one hand, and a drink in the other. I was shocked, Richard smoked and drank?!? Like Jackie Kennedy (and today with Jennifer Aniston), Richard's cigarette habit was obviously a well-guarded secret. In later viewings of that same picture, the frame was edited so that the cigarette was omitted. How interesting it would have been to learn when Richard had his first drink or his first smoke. Did he sneak a smoke in the garage, or did he have the approval of his parents, affterall, his dad smoked a pipe. Details like this would have enlivened the book and given more insight into the complex personality of Richard Carpenter. One gets the impression that Coleman was perhaps limited by Richard Carpenter himself in what details he could reveal.As far as Karen's personal life is concerned, Coleman offers more, but it is still vastly inadequate to understand the person and personality of Karen Carpenter. Coleman mentions Karen's sadness in her inability to establish a personal deep relationship with someone else but her own family. I learned from Coleman that Karen moved in and lived with her boyfriend for a short while, obviously in direct conflict with her parents wishes. What sort of confrontation with her parents resulted from her actions we are not told. How about the other men in Karen's life? In an interview that Karen did in the early 1970's she mentions (almost proudly) that she was not a virgin. Coleman does not mention this in his biography, nor does he mention any details about Karen's love life.Of course, Karen's battle and eventual death from anorexia is an issue which fans are intensely interested, as it is so hard to comprehend why a talented and beautiful woman such as Karen would willingly starve herself to death. There is simply not enough detail on these and other critical issues for the reader to begin to understand the tortured mind of a person suffering from anorexia. The Carpenter home life (with mom and dad) was extremely sheltered, and neither Rich nor Karen moved out of their parent's house intil they were both in their 20's. And when they did move out, they bought a house together, somewhat unusual for a brother and sister. Now it is obvious that they loved their parents and that they loved each other, but is there more lurking beneath the surface that Coleman is not telling, or is not allowed to tell? Could the home life dynamics been a factor in Karen developing anorexia? For instance, it is insinuated that the Carpenter parents, Agnes and Harold, held Richard in such high regard that (mother Agnes) seemed almost resentful that Karen received the bulk of the adoration and love of the fans instead of Richard. Was the career of Karen an afterthought compared to that of her brother Richard? \\"The Karen Carpenter Story\\", the made for television movie, implies that one of the reasons for Karen's descent into anorexia is a desperate plea to get demonstrative love and approval from her mother, who seems to favor Richard as her favorite child. Coleman could have shed more light into the family dynamics of the Carpenters, but unfortunately does not. As this is an authorized biography, perhaps Coleman was prevented from revealing more details in this area to protect the feelings of the Carpenter parents.While much detail is given in regards to Karen's battle with anorexia, the enormous number of laxatives she took, her dieting tricks, etc., there is not enough space given to the possible reasons for Karen's disease. Obviously, Karen suffered from a severe mental disorder, yet, no causative factors are spelled out. Perhaps the answer to this is that anorexia and bulemia are still misunderstood mental illnesses, and at the time of the writing of this book, even less was known. How enlightening it would have been to have had Karen's psychologist/therapist from New York, share with the readership his insights into Karen's illness.Another area in which more detail is needed is in Karen's marriage to Tom Burris. There are no interviews with Mr. Burris in the book, in fact, I have never seen any interviews anywhere from Mr. Burris on his relationship to Karen Carpenter. If Mr. Burris was unwilling to be interviewed, then surely, the couple had friends that could have shed light on their relationship. All we are given is that the two were married, and about a year later, Tom Burris abruptly and mysteriously \\"gives Karen back to her parents\\", stating, \\"You can have her back\\". There is much to be read into his statement, but Coleman fails to bring out the details of why the marriage failed. Was it Karen's anorexia? Was it Karen's attachment to her parents (her mom and dad accompanied the newlyweds on their honeymoon)? Obviously for a marriage to fall apart in a year's time, there is something terribly wrong, yet the reader is left guessing as to what the underlying factors were. Was Burris at Karen's funeral? Again, no details are given. Did Burris remarry? Unfortunately, there are too many unanswered questions.Karen Carpenter was and is a much beloved figure in the music industry. Her multitudes of fans absolutely idolize and love Karen for her innocence, her sweet girl-next-door personality, and of course her astouding vocal ability. Coleman fails to truly bring out the inner Karen Carpenter, the Karen Carpenter behind the sweet smile and image. This is the major failing of his book.Fans of the Carpenters will enjoy the book for the pure nostalgia factor alone, but I believe most readers will feel that there was so much more to tell about both Richard and Karen's lives that would have helped us to understand them better. Perhaps someday there will be an unauthorized biography where the details will come out. Until then, their lives, and especially the life and death of Karen Carpenter will remain a mystery.Jim \\"Konedog\\" Koenig"},{"Title":"The Carpenters: The Untold Story : An Authorized Biography","review":"This is the single best source of definitive material on Karen and Richard Carpenter's lives, but might be of interest mostly to Carpenters fans or those who love to read rock bios. The book attempts to delve deeply into their lives, what went right and what went very, very wrong.As most fans know, the Carpenters had overbearing parents who were attempting to make Richard famous when Karen ended up (reluctantly) in the front. While fans enjoyed their sweet hits, \\"Close to You,\\" \\"We've Only Just Begun\\" and many others, their lives descended into Richard's pill-popping and Karen's tragic anorexia.As one who owns extensive printed materials on the Carpenters, including all their fan club newsletters, it is interesting to see a slight subjective emphasis in this book. Yes, some bios will laud the subjects at hand, while still telling the down side of the story, and this does that to some degree. But oddly, there is too much high stature given to Richard. Though he and Karen were close, it does seem that his control over their career put an extreme amount of pressure on her that helped contribute to her anorexia. Actually, this book has more of an insider picture on her anorexia than anything else ever published. Believe me, it was bad, and you find out just how bad here. I simply wished more information had been developed about when Karen wanted to release her solo album and the family basically talked her out of it. Also, couldn't the author had found more people to talk about the parents' behavior toward Karen and Richard? There's something more there.Other reviewers have suggested this book is somewhat sanitized. While I don't fully agree, I do think there is a tendency to blame everything/everyone else for the decline in the Carpenters' popularity. They were stuck in a groove. Richard wouldn't change his sound and wouldn't let Karen change hers. All groups must change to stay popular. Plus, no record company is going to fully support a band whose leader is sick with they don't know what (they knew little about anorexia then) and looks like a skeleton.It has also been said in other reviews that the book had a terrible writing style. I didn't see that. I thought it was perfectly readable. My only comment is that the book has way too much detail. The editors could have cut 75 pages at least and given it a better pace.That said, it's a pretty decent book. True Carpenters' fans will always take a side or find a fault. But there are no other books on them that are this in-depth, and as time goes on, there probably won't be. Surely Richard won't write his life story, and if so, who cares--it was Karen everyone wanted to know about."},{"Title":"The Carpenters: The Untold Story : An Authorized Biography","review":"To outsiders, it seemed as if Karen and Richard Carpenter were living a dream. And they certainly seemed to have it all - looks, wealth, fame, fans, and an abundance of talent that has gone almost unrivalled in 30 years. Critics from the era and hard rock fans dismissed them, labelling them with phrases such as &quot;Squeaky Clean,&quot; &quot;Too Good To Be True,&quot; &quot;All American,&quot; and many, many others. But appearances can be deceiving.Richard had a drug dependency (the substances he abused were legal, by the way) which almost cost him his career and could have ended his life had he not been rehabilitated, and for 7 years Karen was in the terrible psychological grip of a then unknown disease - anorexia nervosa, a disease which ravaged her emotionally as well as physically, in an identical manner to the fashion in which cancer and AIDS ravage their victims. But despite their personal troubles and turmoil, the Carpenters music remained beautiful, enriching, and touching.With the exclusive co-operation of Richard and Agnes Carpenter and their family and friends, entertainment writer Ray Coleman describes the Carpenters adolescence, their rise to fame, their years at the top, their legendary music, their struggles and Karen's ultimate tragedy in a way that is objective, emotional, and touching, painting a sad portrait of a beautiful woman who never realised how beautiful she was, a beloved woman who never knew how much she was loved, and a famous woman who worked in a corrupt and CORRUPTING industry but never lost her down to earth morality and values, whose greatest wish was to have a family of her own, a wish that sadly, she would never obtain. But if Karen's story achieves anything, I hope it is this - that it may save the lives of other anorexia sufferers. Surely that is what Karen herself would want.It is now 2000, 30 years after the Carpenters debuted. Their records are still being bought, their songs listened to and admired while the artists and critics who deplored them have long been forgotten. Finally, their talents are being acknowledged - Richard is praised for being the great musician that he is, a superior producer and arranger with an unparalleled ear for quality and timelessness. And Karen's voice, that haunting, gorgeous voice, is recognised as being one of God's greatest gifts to music."},{"Title":"The Carpenters: The Untold Story : An Authorized Biography","review":"Growing up in a Christian household, The Carpenters' music were among the few secular artists we listened to. My introduction to the Carpenters was when my parents bought their 1980 Christmas album. We played it almost to death! In fact, I remember as a teenager overdubbing harmonies with my own voice using two tape recorders, just like the Carpenters did on their albums. I was about to turn 10 years old the very month Karen Carpenter died. I could hardly believe she was gone, because the memory of her beautiful voice was so powerful. I was 15 when the ABC movie on the Carpenters came out, which let me see a glimpse of the reason for the tragic end of Karen's life.As an adult, reading Ray Coleman's book brings back fond memories of the Carpenters and their music. It also gives disturbing insight into the sadness, the anorexia, the complex relationship with their loving yet undemonstrative parents, and the overwhelming need of both Richard and Karen to be perfect yet both desiring to be human.I hope to see a documentary video based from this book, along with updates on Richard's life today. The Carpenters will always have my respect for being true to their talent rather than trying to fit into the &quot;image&quot; of everyone else. I will always enjoy their music."},{"Title":"The Carpenters: The Untold Story : An Authorized Biography","review":"I honestly don't know if the reader below is mocking The Carpenters or simply criticizing them, but I feel it's an unfair and biased review, and one that makes me wonder if this person is anything BUT a Carpenters fan?I read this book when it was first issued almost 10 years ago, and even today, the story contained within its pages has long since stuck with me. I certainly didn't detect any \\"kissing up\\" to The Carpenters, as the previous reader mentions. In fact, I found it to be a well researched, in-depth, most informative book on one of the finest female singers of the '70's, and her genius brother. From their humble childhood days in New Haven, CT, to their move to California and the fame that would ultimately take them the world stage, this is by far the definitive Carpenters biography (and sadly the only one) that has ever been written. Sure, there have been other books which speak of The Carpenters contribution to popular music, but none of them go quite as deep into detail as this one does.Also, I don't know what the other reader means when he says that it was The Carpenters fault because their career stalled. Well, doesn't that happen to EVERY artist at one point or another? Elvis went through a slow period, Neil Diamond, John Denver... It wasn't just them that experienced a slow period. It's safe to say that every musician has released that \\"dud\\" album that was a blight on their career. It's no seceret that almost every other artist of The Carpenters genre such as Anne Murray, Dionne Warwick, Barry Manilow, Helen Reddy, and several others experienced a setback in their record sales, although Anne Murray made a strong comeback in 1978 with the beautiful and heartfelt \\"You Needed Me\\" (a song that has yet to be equalled IMO). It was simply a reflection of the music industry in general...The close of the 1970's saw the rise of disco and punk rock. Country Music too experienced a huge resurgence in popularity with the \\"urban cowboy\\" period. It was a time when not only music was undergoing a change, but society in general. The public's tastes were changing. I'm sure that given time, the right material, and had Karen made a full recovery, they would have come back strongly, perhaps even taking 80's music in a whole different direction. And anyone who was an \\"80's child\\" will remember how awful the clothes and music bands were back then. (And I ask you, where are most of these bands today)?There is one thing I agree with, and that's the fact that almost 22 years after Karen's passing, we're still not being told the entire story, and likely never will. There are lots of questions that remain, but we have to remember that those are questions that only Karen herself can answer, and unfortunately she is no longer with us to do so. I only wish someone could have helped this dear woman, and I also find it hard to believe that nobody had a clue of what was going on until it was almost too late. Richard too battled drug addiction. It all started innocently enough with a simple desire (and need) to get to sleep. That was just one more pressure of \\"life on the road\\". The endless gamut of one-night stands and sold-out tours all over the world simply took its toll. Unfortunately, he became addicted to a sleeping drug and had to enter a treatment facility in 1979. He fully recovered and is happily married to a beautiful wife with 5 kids.The year was 1981 when Karen finally admitted to having a problem, and entered treatment in New York with famed psychotherapist Steven Levenkron. She was there for nearly a year before deciding to return home to California, having pronounced herself cured. Many of her friends and family however, were concerned that all was far from well with Karen, and sadly, they were right. We all know what happened next, so I won't go into details, but what I can tell you is that her anorexia was FAR worse than what most people think. (her weight hit a low of 77 lbs at one point)... It's a sad, sad ending to such a beautiful woman with an even more beautiful voice.I simply don't understand what the previous reader means when he said the author was \\"buttering up\\" to The Carpenters. Mr. Coleman was merely repeating what many people stated to him. He travelled from East to West, coast to coast, interviewing over 100 people in the process. I certainly didn't detect any favoritism at all. I simply found that the author wanted to give us a sincere, detailed story on who I (and many others) consider to be one of the finest female vocalists of her generation. It's also a sad reminder of what we ALL lost on the morning of February 4th, 1983...In closing, I would like to quote the author's simple, yet heartfelt tribute:\\"For Those Who Cherish Beautiful Music, And To The Memory Of An Irreplaceable Voice\\"Amen!The Carpenters music is timeless. 100 years fom now, their songs will be just as beautiful, just as jubilant, just as fresh as when the world was first introduced to their sound nearly 35 years ago. If The Carpenters weren't particularly \\"hip\\" during their heyday, time has only reinforced that good love songs--and a timeless voice--never go out of style. I highly recommend this bio to anyone, and feel free to add your comments. I'm sure you won't be disappointed, and I found this to be a very heartwarming book, and a beautiful tribute to a lady who is still dearly missed all these years later. If only these \\"Britney Spears\\" of today could hear what a TRUE singer should sound like, our radio and airwaves (and our kids) would be FAR better off. Rest in peace Karen Anne Carpenter. Thank-you for sharing your music-and life-with us."},{"Title":"The Carpenters: The Untold Story : An Authorized Biography","review":"This is by far the best music bio I have ever read. I am 20 years old and LOVE the Carpenters' music; I own every one of their CDs, including Karen's solo CD.I love the prose style it was written in, and you really felt as though you were with Karen and Richard as they grew up, moved to California, began recording, and the rest is history. I loved how Mr. Coleman wrote out some of the song lyrics and compared them to Karen's tragic life.Some questions do form in the reader's mind (especially regarding her disasterous marriage) and this book really makes you think. You really feel Karen's hurt because she wanted so much what so many of us do...everlasting love and children.Besides being THE greatest female singer that ever was, you can relate to Karen, as if she's your sister or your best friend, someone in your life that you really love and cherish. And I'm happy that Richard overcame his pill addiction and now has a happy family of his own. And he is an excellent musician, too.A MUST HAVE for any Carpenters fan."},{"Title":"The Carpenters: The Untold Story : An Authorized Biography","review":"Yes, this book is missing some of the more intimate and probably painful details of Karen's life. Regardless, it's still an excellent read and it does shed light on certain issues which Carpenters fans never knew about back in the 70's."},{"Title":"The Carpenters: The Untold Story : An Authorized Biography","review":"The late Ray Coleman gives us a glimpse into the personal lives of Karen and Richard. While it leaves many questions unanswered, they are questions that only Karen herself could answer. Besides giving the reader a peek into the mind of an anorexic, it also demonstrates how the pressures of fame, fortune and perfectionism contributed not only to Karen's illness, but to Richard's addiction as well. Karen was and still is the finest female singer of all time, her vocals were always clear, perfect and heart-wrenching, a legacy that remains of a woman who had so much talent and fame, yet yearned for love and family. If you loved Karen's voice, The tears WILL fall when you read this book."},{"Title":"The Carpenters: The Untold Story : An Authorized Biography","review":"Like all the other reviewers of this book I am a long time fan of the Carpenters.I bought this book in 1994 when it was first published and was pleased to be able to read about the history of Richard and Karen and to get an insight into their lives. I learned a lot about them both.Looking back, and having read some of the other reviews here I can only speculate that yes a lot of things will have been kept out of the book. Richard Carpenter is a very private man, and I suspect that he will have been involved in deciding what would be included in the book and what he wished to keep private. Why should he bare every single detail of his family's business for worldwide consumption? Would you or I do the same?The Carpenters' story is a cautionary tale: Be careful what you wish for. Karen and Richard craved success but success ultimately killed Karen Carpenter didn't it?There will be certain things which will stay in the Carpenter family forever and we must accept this. There are no conspiracy theories here. Richard worshipped his sister, yes they came from an extremely close family and were incredibly protective of each other. Karen's demise came at a time when anorexia was virtually unheard of. If this was happening now things would be different.Let's not get too excited about whether Richard smoked, or how many times Karen had sex Mr Koenig. Do we really need to know? This is a very informative book which is very revealing in lots of areas.God bless you Karen. Thank you for your beautiful legacy. And thank you Richard for your artistry."},{"Title":"The Carpenters: The Untold Story : An Authorized Biography","review":"This book is THE definitive Carpenters biography. It traces the story of Karen and Richard's childhood days in Connecticut, their move to California, to their struggles for recognition in the music business, then their triumph to the top of the charts, to the sad and untimely death of one the greatest female vocalists who ever lived. This book is also heartbreaking to read. Why did Karen have such poor self-esteem? Why was Richard nearly destroyed too by a pill addiction? Why did Karen feel so unloved and rejected? Why were the Carpenters widely scorned by music critics? Why now, is the Carpenters music gaining popularity among younger listeners and the younger generation? These are but a few questions addressed in this biography. It is difficult not to be touched by sadness while reading this book. It's also hard to read at times, not because the book is difficult, but because there are so many emotions involved. This is a very good book for all who appreciate and enjoy beautiful music, and by the way, as I've mentioned, tears tend to fall.

Written with the blessing of Richard Carpenter (who also maintained editorial control of what would be revealed), this book skirted around the personal demons which haunted the duo. I came away from reading it with more questions than answers as to why this beautiful young woman, who possessed one of the greatest female voices of all time, developed such a deep self-loathing which culminated in her death at age 32. Most of those questions remained until the release of Randy Schmidt's fine biography of Karen, written without the input of Richard Carpenter(he declined to be interviewed).

The Carpenters were truly a success story and their rise to fame was remarkable. Having 'come of age' in the 70's, their music continues to bring back fond memories for me.

This book made for a mildly interesting read, but it was almost so worshipful to the Carpenters, that I had to practically force myself to keep reading. It was already badly written to begin with, and was also overstuffed with psychoanalysis. I've never read a biography about anyone before this where the author seemed more like a star struck fan than anything. It was almost like reading Tiger Beat at times. Yes, Ray Coleman knew them personally, and like the many others that knew them is protective of their memory. I mean the sad fact is that to many people (not myself) Carpenters does not immediately evoke thoughts of say, \\"Close To You\\", but rather, Karen Carpenter=Anorexia poster child. Sort of like Joan Crawford's memory is now \\"NO wire HANGERRRRSSS!\\", rather than evoking thoughts of , \\"Mildred Pierce.\\" But that doesn't mean he has to make a reader gag at his obvious worshipful and biased view of these entertainers. Even the people he interviewed for this book were kind of vomit inducing. Constantly reiterating that they themselves would have been nothing without the Carpenters, etc; etc. Where would the world be without the Carpenters... The attitude was basically, 'A great big cheer for the Carpenters, we owe them our lives for their genius, blah, blah, blah.' Makes one wonder at the true motives for such loyalty. I'm sure the Carpenters should have been grateful to lots of people too, but you never hear much humbleness on their side of that fence. And all the baloney about being overworked. They made it seem like it was everyone else's fault BUT the Carpenters, oh, they were so young... They were perfectionist workaholics, but alas, it was still everyone else's fault. Even 12 year old entertainers say, 'I need a break.' But, I read on like a trooper, and managed to keep from dropping my groceries (puking). Even the downward slope of their record sales was everyone else's fault but their own. The manager, friends, family, fans, the neighbors, the janitor, Pippi Longstocking, Henry VIII, Miss Piggy... Their loyal friends and family constantly blamed everyone else for that. Fine, but the author was constantly doing the same thing. It was like an ambush times 2. Oh, this person or that person threw off Richard's ever overflowing endless supply of groove, oh, they were marketed wrong, etc; etc. How could anyone NOT play or buy their music? There was obviously something wrong with everyone else, but the artists themselves. There are stars much more talented and much more famous than they were, and whose careers enjoyed much longer and constant longevity, and kept up with the changing times (musically surviving the disco and roller boogie era), that have had similar problems, but have been big enough to say,' \`I suck. I've lost it. It's nobody's fault but my own. I've lost my touch, and people are no longer interested.' I prefer a straight story. I cannot stand lip to butt cheek biographies unless it's about someone like Mother Teresa. You know, where it's obvious that it's warranted. (Or villain biographies for that matter, unless it's about, say, the Zodiac Killer). In this lip to butt cheek bio, boy does Ray Coleman deserve the nickname of \`Hot Lips' for this one. I don't like books in which it almost seems as though the author is trying to lure you into a certain way of viewing something their way. I don't think a biography should be a platform to sort of persuade or hypnotize the reader about what image it would like to represent. I don't care about the subjects' image, I just want to read and have a right to my own thoughts. I prefer having my own thoughts and opinions. It's one thing for those interviewed to speak about things, but it's almost like the miniature sized author is standing on your shoulder constantly whispering into your ear, and then berating you if you don't feel the same way. Just let me read. I prefer a, \`here is the story, just read it,' take on a book. I can't stand the distraction of a \`but just remember this', or \`regardless, they are still the best,' mumbo jumbo mentality. Over and over again, almost like an overbearing parent, it was reminding me the reader how they were the best act in the world (in his opinion) and about how Richard Carpenter MADE the Carpenters what they were (his opinion), how they were so unique (his opinion). He almost made it seem as though if the reader didn't feel the same way, then they had a heart of stone and they didn't know music. O.K., I get it already. Fine and dandy, he loved them, but it was so obvious that the very arrogant (which was another unattractive distraction) Richard Carpenter had a major dictatorship in the writing of this book. Authorizing a book, and being a dictator are two separate things. The author almost seemed to portray him as some sort of God or rather God's gift to music. That he's a genius. A lot of his best work was hardly from scratch, like many of the true geniuses of music (and there's nothing wrong with that). To be quite honest, I like many people concentrate on Karen Carpenter's voice first, and his arrangements SECOND. His work was usually given a leg up from building blocks provided by others. Sort of like, if Vanilla Ice hadn't used Queen and David Bowie's \\"Under Pressure\\", would there have been an \\"Ice, Ice, Baby?\\" Hardly a masterpiece, but a short notice example. It was almost an ode to Richard Carpenter. He's a highly talented musician, but he's no Mozart! Or an Elton John! Not even close. I mean as talented as they were, I think even Eminem could have put a better spin on \\"Boogie Nights\\", than Karen Carpenter did. Talented as the Carpenters may be and may have been, I doubt there will be a core course in music education on them during this millennium. I mean the Carpenters rock, I love their music, but that doesn't mean the author has to tug at your stomach acids to prove it. And please, let me decide for myself."},{"Title":"The Year My Mother Was Bald","review":"In this story, a young girl, Claire, tells the story of her mother's breast cancer in a monthly scrapbook. It starts in June, when her mother's cancer is first diagnosed. In the ensuing months, her mother experiences surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. In the final month, May, her mother is feeling better and appears to be on the road to a good recovery.Each month includes Claire's experiences, hopes and fears. She discusses her daily routine and how it has to change when her mother is too ill to pack her lunch or drive her to school. Eventually, Claire learns to manage some chores, such as laundry, on her own. She feels that she is contributing and that she has learned some new skills. Each monthly chapter also includes scientific information explaining facts that a child might want to know. These topics include surgery, surgical drains, chemotherapy, and hair loss. the illustrations include drawings and photographs. They look like the marginal drawings that a girl like Claire might actually do. they help illustrate her reactions.I liked the way that the book is organized around a specific time frame. A child experiences time differently from an adult. Although cancer treatment often extends longer than a year, the concrete depiction of time passage allows the child or young adolescent to see that there is a progression.The author and illustrator have both had personal experience with cancer in themselves or in their family. They make it clear that different people experience cancer in their own ways, and that different emotional reactions are all right."},{"Title":"The Year My Mother Was Bald","review":"First off, let me say that I would be a lot happier if nobody ready this book. I certainly hope that my kids never have to read this book and that I will never ever have to recommend it to anybody that I know.&quot;The Year My Mother Was Bald&quot; is written for children ages 8-13 who find themselves in the position of dealing with a parent dealing with cancer. Ann Speltz based this book on the experiences of her own family during the year that she was treated for cancer. What she and her daughter, Amelia, went through is turned into this heart-warming volume from Magination Press, with illustrations by Kate Sternberg, who also endured a year when her mother was bald. Here the story is told by Clare, who keeps a journal about the year her mother undergoes treatment for cancer.&quot;The Year My Mother Was Bald&quot; is divided into twelve chapters, one for each month, beginning in June (which means the cycle ends in the spring). Clare is looking forward to summer, making a list of her favorite summer things to do, when her mother comes back from her annual physical with the news that she might have a tumor in her breast. In addition to Clare's journal entries, there are articles that have been clipped from other sources explaining things like what happens &quot;When Cells Go Wild&quot; and &quot;Radiation.&quot; Accompanying Clare's thoughts and this information are drawings, photographs, and resources that will help youngesters understand what is happening, the same way they helped Claire.Not only does &quot;The Year My Mother Was Bald&quot; offer answers to the obvious questions that will occupy the minds of kids in this situation (&quot;Will my mom be all right?&quot; &quot;Who will take care of me if she doesn't get better?&quot;) but also gives kids some pro-active things they can do to not only help them deal with their concerns and fears, but also to help with the recovery process for their mother. However, the primary focus is on helping kids deal with all aspects of this process, which is why perhaps the most poignant moment in the book is when Claire decides what to do with the box underneath her bed that has the hair that her mother has lost.The back of this book provides resources that kids will find useful for finding additional information about dealing with cancer in free booklets, organizations and online sites, and other books. More importantly, Speltz reassures kids that there are no right or wrong feelings and their feelings are not only important, but also helpful. She also reminds her readers that scientists keep making new discoveries about cancer and coming up with new methods of fighting cancer all the time.The only concern anyone could have about the helpfulness of this book would be the gender differences between Clare and her mother and the reader and their parent. &quot;The Year My Mother Was Bald&quot; speaks more to a situation where the mother has been diagnosed (fathers can always claim they are trying to look like Michael Jordan or Yul Brynner), but even young boys should be able to relate to Clare's situation and take comfort from this excellent book as well."},{"Title":"The Year My Mother Was Bald","review":"This very well written, easy to read book is writen from the perspective of a preteen girl whose mother is undergoing testing and treatment for breast cancer. As both a practicing oncologist and a mother of two children (12 and 8 yrs old), I highly recommend this book. The explanations of procedures and treatments were simple, straightforward and easy to understand (my 12 year old agrees). Clare is able to describe feelings and thoughts common to many people in this situation - adults and kids alike - and will let young readers know that they are not alone. This book can also be used as a starting point for further family discussions. The references in the back of the book are quite helpful. The pictures and illustrations are wonderful and make this book unique."},{"Title":"The Year My Mother Was Bald","review":"This book was given as a gift to my ten year old niece while her mom was undergoing treatment for breast cancer.

My daughter was just five at that time.

This is not one of those books.Ms. Speltz takes a scary thing -- a parent's battle with cancer -- and turns it into a learning experience. Calmly and seemingly effortlessly she anticipates the fears, anxieties, and emotions of a young child and skillfully illustrates the questions a child may have and distills sometimes cold and frighteneing medical jargon and presents it in a way that children can hear and understand. At 15, my son is a little old for this book, but I am very glad to have read it because it gave me a lexicon for communicating things about my own cancer to family and friends in a way they will understand.It would be unfair for me not to compliment the illustrator of this book, Kate Sternberg, who did a wonderful job and helped keep the book light."},{"Title":"The Year My Mother Was Bald","review":"The Year My Mother Was Bald is an excellent book; I passed it along to a family friend who has cancer and her kids found it very helpful. It is informative yet accessible for children, having been written from a child's point of view. It seems appropriate for ages 7-14, though it could be used beyond those ages on either end. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Year My Mother Was Bald","review":"This well written and easy to understand book does a wonderful job of explaining what cancer is and the fears children have when someone they know has cancer. Written from the perspective of a child, it highlights the questions that go through the minds of children from the point in which a loved one is diagnosed through surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. \\"Science sidebars\\" included in the book help to explain the \\"foreign words\\" children often hear adults expressing following a cancer diagnosis.As an elementary school teacher and someone who does volunteer work with cancer patients, I feel the book is not only useful for a parent who is diagnosed with cancer but also for adults who may come into contact with children going through this very difficult time. It makes a scary thing more understandable for a child. Use it to begin a discussion with children who probably have similar questions to the child telling this story, but might not have asked them yet."},{"Title":"Melville: His World and Work","review":"Herman Melville (1819 -- 1893) is one of the writers I have returned to again and again over the course of years. Thus, I was gratified to receive this new book by Andrew Delbanco, \\"Melville: His Life and Work\\" (2005) as a gift and to have the opportunity to read it, think again about Melville, and share my thoughts on this site with other readers. Delbanco is Levi Professor in the Humanities and Director of American Studies at Columbia University. He has published widely on American literature, including a book titled \\"Required Reading: why our American Classics matter now.\\" Before reading Professor Delbanco's Melville study, I also read the lengthy review by Frederick Crews in the December 1, 2005, \\"New York Review\\" which is both laudatory and critical.The literature on Melville continues to grow, and in recent years biographies have been published that are longer and far more detailed than Professor Delbanco's. But Delbanco's study is accessible, engagingly written, and concentrates, as the subtitle to his book implies, in placing Melville in the historical context of Nineteenth Century America, and on the works themselves. I will discuss each of these factors briefly.As to Nineteenth Century America, Professor Delbanco discusses Melville's roots as the descendant, on both sides of his family, of heroes of the Revolutionary War. He gives a revealing picture of pre-Bellum America and of the seafaring life. He gives a detailed historical discussion, for a literary biography, of the tumults which split the United States and lead to the Civil War, including the War with Mexico, the compromises of 1850, and the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854. Professor Delbanco shows how Melville responded to both the literary and political events of his time. He also gives a good, if briefer, treatment of the Civil War and of Melville's life thereafter, as the United States expanded and a crude materialism became dominant. But most vividly, Professor Delbanco gives a picture of New York City, both before and after the Civil War, and argues convincingly for the strong formative influence that the city exerted on Melville's writings.As to Melville's writings, Professor Delbanco devotes a great deal of space to Melville's four widely-recognized masterpieces: Moby Dick, Bartelby, Benito Cereno, and Billy Budd. He offers textual exposition, compositional background, and a good literary sense of the complexities and ambiguities in each of these works. He offers shorter yet rewarding discussions of several of Melville's more controversial efforts, including Pierre, The Confidence Man, his collection of Civil War Poetry called Battle Pieces, and the long poem Clarel. I think that Delbanco undervalues some of the poetry, particularly Battle Pieces which I have found over the years a provocative literary guide to the Civil War.The treatment of Melville's life is interrelated well with a study of his works, as Professor Delbanco gives succint discussions of Melville's early years, his decision to go to sea, his marriage, the question of his sexual orientation, the friendship with Nathaniel Hawthorne, his travels and wanderings, the tragic deaths of two of his sons, and the long reclusive years Melville spent as a customs inspector in New York City. We see Melville with all his difficulties and as a great but in his lifetime forgotten writer. Readers interested in a good novelistic portrayal of Melville may wish to read Frederick Busch's \\"The Night Inspector\\", to which Professor Delbanco refers.(...)I came away from Professor Belbanco's book with the desire to revist some of the Melville works that I have read in the past and, perhaps, to read some of the works that I don't know for the first time. I think it is the purpose of a study such as Delbanco's to return to reader to the words of the author, in this case Melville. Delbanco's book succeeds in doing so admirably.(...)"},{"Title":"Melville: His World and Work","review":"Andrew Delbanco has given us an accessible and meaningful account of the writing, life, and world of Herman Melville. This is by no means an exhaustive biography, but Delbanco successfully gives us a good background on his life and times. He weaves literary interpretation, biography, and history into one poetic yarn. He draws on a lot of sources, including letters to or from Melville, but these sources are by no means a crutch to lean on. It was a very enjoyable read, and would be worthwhile to a literary scholar or to educated laypersons, regardless of having previously read a Melville biography or not. It is recommended that one have at least a cursory knowledge of American literature before diving into this word-storm, and I say that approvingly."},{"Title":"Melville: His World and Work","review":"Though this book received several awards for biography, and mentioned as \\"first rate biography' by the New York Times I can't agree. I indeed purchased Mr. Delbanco's 2006 work looking forward to reading a first rate biography on this great writer.Instead, what I got was a long tome with complex and highly subjective psychoanalytical criticism about the Melville canon. I read little about his life, somewhat more about his times and world, and by far more about Mr. Delbanco's parsing the root behavioral causality of Melville's creations.It was, indeed, aptly pointed out by Mr. Delbanco that Melville left a light biographical record; hence, it is difficult for the scholar to research his life at depth. Actually, a book that is by-in-large just biography would be much shorter than this work's 325 pages of text.So there are gaps that raise constructive temptations for the scholar. As one of my graduate professors once said about a project paper, \\"I see some very heavy carpentry going on in this work.\\"And throughout Delbanco's book, there is, in my view, some heavy carpentry that is conspicuously top heavy. He does this often in Melville. Worse yet, he seemed to be primarily of the Freudian persuasion, and once that takes hold of a critic's soul, it can get very wild. There are few sexual spins that Mr. Delbanco's avoids. On the contrary, each of Melville's works is thoroughly soaked in this dubious vat.In presenting the historical and sociological context, Mr. Delbanco's does good work, but it could have been better. Since Melville's foundational works were so tied to the South Seas and Polynesia, I thought he might have shown a more accurate historical light on it, but he did not.By the time Melville came upon the scene , contact was nearly a century old. Depopulation was more than halfway there. The expatriate Polynesians that populated the pages of Richard Henry Dana's Two Years Before the Mast were an accurate account of the time, and Dana's travels preceded Melville's.The Marquesas, one of the root sources for Hawaii's Polynesian people, preceded Hawaii regards the travails of contact. Fact is, Typee was and remains entirely a work of fiction by a young, ambitious writer bent on writing a successful work, and he succeeded. Nothing wrong with that--and as a writer of fiction, I can relate to it absolutely.All the spins and conjectures regards Melville's romping with Polynesian beauties with white, flashing teeth made good fiction but bad scholarship. To see a scholarly spin off on these popular myths regards serious textual issues - well, that is not impressive. By 1800, there weren't many white, gleaming teeth in Polynesia, nor, sadly, clear skins.It was far more interesting--if you did have to get serious about psychological elements regards Melville--why he would write positively--even reinforcingly-- about carefree sexual license. Then, after returning home, he married into such a hidebound, uptight New England tradition. As Mr. Delbanco pointed out, in this culture even anatomical structures (e.g. legs, waists, etc.) weren't considered mentionable in mixed company.One cannot feature Mr. and Mrs. New Englander chasing each other around from window seat to window seat during major sexual frolicking. For one thing was absolutely true about Polynesian culture, it was vigorous and sensual, regardless of health issues.So, if you get this book understand what lies ahead of you. Herman Melville was a creative power of such wide scope and magnitude, that Mr. Delbanco's efforts fall way short of doing him justice."},{"Title":"Melville: His World and Work","review":"Is there anything quite like a great biography? A great novel, you say, and I'd agree, but where are they? Meanwhile, we have these marvelous pieces of writing: Ellmann's biography of Joyce, Edel's biography of James, Holroyd on Shaw. This is not a multi-volumed immortal masterpiece but it has all of the characteristics of such a work, save exhaustiveness. This is an introduction, really, more than a complete life, but it serves its purpose as well as can be imagined. The prose style is inviting and easy, the illustrations amusing and pointedly relevant and revealing. The author's point of view is strikingly original. He begins not with Melville's birth, but with his reputation, from his death to the present. American's do not have a great dramatist, so we have made the drama of Melville's life a kind of literary drama surrounding a masterpiece, \\"Moby Dick.\\" Those who know and love it see it as one of the great pieces of literature of all time. Melville is cast in the role of the likable genius, the sympathetic artist, the neglected and scorned master of American prose. We've been taught to love him, as we have been instructed to hate Hemingway and other dead white male authors. My professor said that Melville wasn't worth reading and recommended in its stead a collection of slave testimony and the lost poems of a female mill worker. I ventured that perhaps I could read him myself and make up my own mind. We live in an odd age that resents greatness. Let's applaud Delbanco's effort to set the record straight."},{"Title":"Melville: His World and Work","review":"Not that by saying that I'm strongly recommending it or anything.I read this recently on a road trip through Iran, which made it a bit more interesting than I think it otherwise would have been, but also made it harder to pay attention to. In fact, I was in Tehran when I read (on p. 8) that \\"as far away as Tehran there is a popular kebab place called \`Moby Dick.'\\" Incredulous, I made my way over there, and sure enough! I managed to finish the next couple of chapters there.I was particularly looking forward to this book after having read Andre Delbanco's famous classic essay \\"The Death of Literary Criticism,\\" with which I agreed wholeheartedly. I liked his spirit and his outlook, so it was with eager fingers that I got a hold of a volume in which he harpoons my favorite author.Really, though, I don't think there's been a better biography of Melville than the one Newton Arvin did in the 50s. Sure, it's out of date, but even at this remove it gives you all you need to know to get going on his books. It strikes the right balance between literary criticism and biography.This latest job may use more recent scholarship, but unfortunately it also falls prey to pop psychology a bit much, not really struggling with Melville on his own terms so much as on ours. There's no sexual innuendo that isn't made much of for pages on end. Sheesh. If Melville had known the trouble he would be getting into on account of Ishmael and Queequeg sharing a bed, he would have had that harpooner sleep in the hall!To Delbanco, Melville is a closet case pure and simple. If you aren't in the mood to constantly hear that, don't pick this book up. Delbanco is the kind of critic that will shape his entire understanding of a work of fiction on a few lewd references.In fact, I would say that my most common emotion reading this book was revulsion. Despite my love for all things Melvillean, it was a struggle to get through. Here's a sample of what I'm talking about:\\"The young Pierre may have felt \`more than cousinly attachment' for his male cousin Glen, but the older Pierre is aroused by the sight of Isabel's nestled \`ear' and craves the sensation of being enveloped by the throbbing walls of her \`guitar.'\\"Brother!"},{"Title":"Melville: His World and Work","review":"This biography of Melville is as balanced, accessible, and thoroughly entertaining as a biography of a literary figure can get while still being considered \\"serious.\\" Delbanco has a great skills as a writer himself, skillfully juggling the story of Melville's life, critical discussions of his writing, and finally the social and historical context of the works.The discussions of the books are excellent, particularly Delbanco's readings of the novels Moby Dick, Typee, and Pierre. But where this biography particularly stands out is the intermeshing the books with aspects of 19th century American literary culture. There are, for instance, interesting discussions of the dominance of English publishing houses, of copyright issues, of publishing in general. Delbanco situates Melville's work before a backdrop of a nation in transition (for example the story \\"Benito Cereno\\" is published in midst of the debate about the expansion of slavery into Kansas territory), and before a backdrop of the city of New York under transition too.Finally, Delbanco discusses the unusual trajectory of Melville's own career and reputation - from almost being forgotten at the time of his death to the towering position he holds in American letters today.This biography is a great summary of Melville's life, and also in a broader sense, of 19th century literary culture."},{"Title":"Melville: His World and Work","review":"Herman Melville (1819-1891) was a strange chap. In this new biography by Professor Andrew Delbanco we go in search of the Great White Dead Male Author of American literature. Delbanco relates the known facts of the New York's author's sad life but is best at exegeting his great works in understandable language for the student or Melvillian fan.Melville's father Allen was a failed businessman and he was dominated by his mother Marie. The family suffered genteel poverty in upstate New York prior to moving to New York City. Melville shipped out as a seaman sailing to the South Seas and seeing a good deal of London and other European ports. He returned home to marry Elizabeth Shaw the daughter of the famous Lemuel Shaw who was a noted judge in Boston. Melville had four children, two girls and two boys. The oldest boy Malcolm committed suicide at 18 while the second son Stanwick died young. Melville never got over these horrible deaths. His relationship with his wife Elizabeth was always rocky. At times he may have beaten her. The couple did remain wed until Herman's death. The author was rejected by the literary community and ended his life in obscurity as a Custom Inspector on the New York City docks. He had been friends with Nathaniel Hawthorne to whom he dedicated Moby Dick but the friendship waned.Melville's greatest work is the monumental \\"Moby Dick\\" written in 1850 which had only modest success with the public. Delbanco is insightful in exploring the novel's themes. Melville was opposed to slavery and may have based Captain Ahab on the South Carolina defender of slavery John C. Calhoun. Other literary sources for Ahab include the Devil. Though a non-believer Melville used countless biblical allusions in his novel. His prose is rich with allusion and metaphor heralding the despair and existentialistic nothingness of life so prominent among great twentieth century masters as James Joyce and T.S. Eliot.Dr. Delbanco also examines in detail such other Melville works as:Typee, Omoo, Pierre or the Ambiguities, Clarel his poem of the Holy Land and his final short but classic novella \\"Billy Budd.\\" Melville wrote great short stories such as \\"Benito Cerito\\" which explores slavery and black-white relations. He also wrote two novels based on his experiences as a sailor: Redburn and White-Jacket.Delbanco is good at showing us how Melville related to the big problem of slavery in ante-bellum society. He was a reclusive man who may have been bipolar. Melville died poor and obscure with his novels not becoming popular until their renaissance in the 1920s. Today he is a staple of college courses on American Literature.Anyone who turns to this book with the expectation that it will be achronological accounting of Melville's life will be disappointed. Anyone who reads it to understand Melville's major themes and personality will be rewarded. This is a good introduction to a great and hard to understand American literary giant."},{"Title":"Melville: His World and Work","review":"Melville's output is uneven. There's MOBY DICK and some of the stories in THE PIAZZA TALES, which are widely acknowledged as masterworks. Then, there are the many novels, such TYPEE, OMOO, MARDI, and so forth. These scold me from my shelves, demanding my time and effort, since they are works by a man of genius. But they aren't great books.While certainly not his intention, Delbanco's terrific book, MELVILLE: HIS WORLD AND HIS WORK, has had the effect of liberating me from second-rate Melville. This has happened because Delbanco describes the work in Melville's oeuvre in relation to the masterworks. As a result, this general-interest reader no longer feels the need to plow through Melville's baroque syntax and obscure references, thinking all the works will repay the effort. Instead, I'm now comfortable leaving TYPEE, OMOO, MARDI, and so forth to the specialists. Maybe, I'll retry them one day. But for now, I'm happy knowing how they led to and from the great books.Using this approach, Delbanco explains, for example, how TYPEE is a young man's book of exotic racy adventure in the Marquesan islands; how OMOO follows this best-seller formula, just moving the locale to the Hawaiian Islands; how MARDI is an effort to get beyond the limits of the adventure form; how REDBURN is Melville's effort to capture urban misery, a la his contemporary Dickens; and how WHITE-JACKET is an implicit reference to slavery. This approach, in other words, places Melville's work within his historical period, as well as shows how an increasingly frustrated mid-list author tried to connect to an audience.At the same time, Delbanco provides very interesting critical commentary on MOBY DICK, BARTLEBY THE SCRIVENER, BENITO CERENO, and BILLY BUDD. This has the effect of making me want to return to these great texts, which I last read before my children were born. (Don't ask.) The literary commentary, by the way, is sometimes hilarious. Here are some examples, with Delbanco discussing PIERRE:o \\"At the beginning of the novel, when Pierre is skipping through the vernal hills crooning nature hymns... he seems a nineteenth-century Tiny Tim doing his eyeball-rolling rendition of \`Tiptoe Through the Tulips'.\\"o \\"Pierre is Ahab gone camp.\\"o \\"In PIERRE, Melville somehow managed to produce both a serious anatomy of the radical imagination that anticipates Dostoyevsky's THE POSSESSED and a manic burlesque that looks toward Gore Vidal's MYRA BRECKENRIDGE.\\"Finally, Delbanco tells the sketchy story of Melville's difficult personal life, which was dispiriting and harrowing, even as he produced his great works. It's truly sad to read about such an amazing talent in his obscure and dark defeat."},{"Title":"Melville: His World and Work","review":"Melville is something of an enigma, as if his brief and quickly declining career were a stage for the apparition called Moby Dick, most likely the Great American Novel, and one of the few novels ever written to approach the tragic mode in the true sense. This brisk and not overly detailed biography is a good lean introduction to the life, or what's known of it, and thus a fitting portrait of the secret intensity of the man behind his sluggish career as a writer. None of which matters beside the magnificence of the greatest of all sea yarns."},{"Title":"Melville: His World and Work","review":"This thorough and quite readable biography focuses on setting Melville and his work within the milieu of his times. Delbanco's work doesn't have the emotional intensity of Laurie Robertson-Lorant's \\"Melville, A Biography,\\" or the extensive detail of Hershel Parker's two-volume \\"Herman Melville: A Biography,\\" but is more the length a reader might want to tackle.Delbanco's extensive analysis of Melville's major works (from a Freudian viewpoint) is fairly routine, but his interweaving of events around the country and world with the themes and content of each novel opens new perspectives on Melville's writing and life.- Lynn Michelsohn, author of \\"In the Galapagos Islands with Herman Melville\\""},{"Title":"Melville: His World and Work","review":"I was in Munich in 2008 and I brought one book with me--Delbanco's wonderful biography of Melville. I've read many biographies of writers, philosophers and statemen. Without any other worthwhile book to read and out of boredom I read and reread his biography and as a far traveler, it seemed as if Melville became a distant uncle, someone I knew or someone who was a good friend. Please read the section about the difference between a pipe smoker and a cigar smoker. Delbanco is writing neither out of passion nor is he writing to impress; he's presenting a great American writer like he would a favorite wine or an inexpensive dish from his favorite local haunt.

The Delbanco bio has some advantages over others: it is fairly recent (I still remember reading the reviews when it came out) and it is fairly concise, eg when compared to the monumental 2 volume H.Parker bio.Delbanco tells us that primary biographic material on HM is rather rare, that there are long phases of his life without solid information, that few letters and notes have been preserved. A shame, but to some extent maybe also a blessing. I am not always sure that overexploitation of personal information leads far. The production of secondary literature is full of questionable results.Delbanco tells us of HM's world and work, according to the subtitle. He does that in an entirely satisfactory and convincing manner, iow, this bio is worth it if you are interested in HM without knowing all that much about him.Do we need to know an author's world to understand his work? Some say no, eg my primary hero Nabokov claims that works of art should stand alone. Right, yes, they should; but that doesn't mean that they have grown in emtpy space, nor that understanding their environmment must be useless. As often, beware of absolutes: excessive social interpretation is as wrong as total abstraction from the world.The author's life is not essential for his work's evaluation, but it is often needed to help us understand it.Always useful is the debunking of myths. One of the myths about HM is that he stopped writing when he became a New York customs officer, after years of commercial failures of his published prose works. Not so, he continued writing, but produced mostly poetry, which has not been re-surrected along with his prose when the renaissance happened in the 20s.Delbanco tries to trace private life events in HM's writing. There are assumptions of an unhappy marriage, hints at alcohol, at possible domestic violence, suspicions of madness. The family's life in New York from the 60s to the end was mostly a period of darkness, culminating in the death of both sons, one by suicide at 18, the other 20 years later from a disease after years of failure to find a footing. Melville seems to have lived this long period like an internal exile.Now I feel ready to attack Pierre (which seems to be the basis for a strong school of thought which claims that HM was actually gay. Or incestuous. There is an oppressive mother and a frigid wife and a sexy sister.) Let's see.An afterthought: a strange parallell to J.Joyce is the family situation of the young man. Not because of excessive religion, after all Melville's family was not Irish, but properly Waspish and Dutch, but because of the experience of social decline. A father who fails in his business projects takes his wife and children down a social ladder; but while JJ's family moved to ever poorer lodgings and locations, HM's kept up style and pretensions until disaster struck. See Redburn."},{"Title":"Melville: His World and Work","review":"All of the comments about this book are true with the exception that the majority of the biographical findings stem from Hershel Parker's groundbreaking, momentuous two-volume work that maintains itself as THE definitive biography of Melville. Credit Mr. Parker for The Isle of the Cross details, not Delbanco who was one of Parker's most vocal critics and once disputed the biographer's findings on The Isle of the Cross. However, if you do not want to wade through Parker's immense work, then go for this."},{"Title":"Melville: His World and Work","review":"Some parts of Melville's writing are so dense even he got confused in them, for perhaps it was not his conscious self in charge of the words spilling out on the page in splendid, mordant constellation. At the end of his life, he returned after 30 years of sometimes brilliant poetry to write one last short novel, BILLY BUDD, in which most of the quixotic exuberance of PIERRE and MOBY DICK, of earlier years, seems to have been burnt away, as if by great pain.Intriguing to hear the story (such as it is) of THE ISLE OF THE CROSS, Melville's lost novel, rejected by Harpers Magazine and then disappeared. Maybe this book will return to us someday, miracles have happened before. Written at the height of Melville's powers, ISLE emerges under Delbanco's suggestive treatment as a parable of his relations with Hawthorne, and the pull of the land versus the romance of the sea.The great pain must have been the suicide of Mackie, Melville's son, who killed himself at age 18 at home; the coroner decided it must have been an accident, a pistol shot gone wrong, after th family protested his earlier ruling of suicide. How awful to think of Lizzie worrying that Malcolm wasn't getting up in the morning, he'd be late for work, and Melville saying, let him stay in bed if he needs to, and he'll pay for his tardiness if he needs to. And then at the end of the day, when they finally made their way into his bedroom, he was long dead, the gun at his side. Though Delbanco says that we will never know if Melville was a homosexual, it seems to me that the whole Mackie drama doesn't make much sense unless you allow he possibility that the boy killed himself to protect himself from further sexual predation by his father. And that CLAREL, JOHN MARR, and BILLY BUDD were the father's attempts to make sense of the wrong he had done the boy."},{"Title":"Last Testament of Oscar Wilde","review":"There is humour and pathos here as Peter Ackroyd presents the voice of Oscar Wilde during Wilde's last days in Paris near the turn of the century. Though he was living in exile and was very poor, Wilde's observations are sharp and he bravely steps back from self-pity. He is able to assess his own life as an aesthete and writer. He spends his time in cafes, with English friends and with French acquaintances. As he becomes more ill the tone of the voice of Wilde becomes more poignant but till the end he is full of wit. At the very end he dies in his hotel room.This is an immensely satisfying book. All who are interested in Wilde will be drawn into Peter Ackroyd's poetic prose as he recreates from his own study and imagination the last days of the Irish wit and writer, with his degradation and dignity. In the end Wildes's literary wit triumphs and remains while his detractors and persecutors are forgotten"},{"Title":"Last Testament of Oscar Wilde","review":"This is a most amazing book. One would almost believe that, like his beloved William Blake, Ackroyd has the ability to rendevouz with the spirits and have Wilde dictate this marvelous account of his exile in Paris. A cunning pastiche of Wilde's wit and wisdom, this book charts the decent into the human condition. Littered with irony and humour, this book will leave the reader hungry for more insights into the genius of Oscar Wilde and I would reccomend it to everybody, even the few that may not be aware of the subject matter. From the dens of sin to the oppressive beauty of Paris society, the reader is on the journey with Wilde all the way."},{"Title":"Last Testament of Oscar Wilde","review":"A journal is being written by a lonely man in a Paris hotel room. It starts, for its sins, on 9 August 1900. There was nothing auspicious about the date, no connection to former grandeur or glory. But there has been a chance encounter, on a rare excursion outdoors, with three young Englishmen. They recognise the journal's author, one Oscar Wilde, and they refer to him as \\"she\\". It is an event worth recording, an event that prompts recollection and reflection on a life.Oscar Wilde's life was lived in public. Through exploration, then success and fame, and finally via notoriety and disgrace the author occupied a public mind. His talent was immense, his desire to exploit it almost single-minded and his success phenomenal. In an era when stardom in the modern sense was being invented, Oscar Wilde played the stage, published, courted society and self-promoted. He pushed at boundaries, sometimes not for reasons of art, but merely because they existed. He was, after all, an outsider, an Irishman of questionable parentage, but dressed elegantly in a frock coat and mingling with the highest.He thus became a star for a while, a centre of attention, a media figure. This was nothing less than celebrity in the modern sense, except, of course, that in his case there actually was some talent and ability in the equation. He was famous primarily for what he did, not for whom he became. But then there was a change. The fame was rendered infamy by publicity he could no longer control. And that downfall killed him. A final journal entry on 30 November 1900, recorded from the author's mumblings by a friend, Maurice Gilbert, records the event. Oscar Wilde had fallen while in prison, and had sustained an injury to an ear, an injury that festered.Early on in his recollections, Oscar Wilde recalls George Bernard Shaw saying that, \\"An Englishman will do whatever in the name of principle.\\" Wilde's qualification was that the principle was inevitably self-interest. It is a beautiful metaphor, because as a talented - even gifted - young Irish writer, Wilde was promoted and enjoyed success while ever he bolstered others' positions. The moment he sought an assertion of his own right, however, he was disowned. Celebrity can thus rub shoulders with the rich and powerful, but only on their terms.And it was their terms that eventually killed him. The sybaritic Bosie encountered, the desire for things Greek aroused, Wilde found himself drawn into a society he could not resist. But he remained a self-confessed voyeur, and never became a participant. He thus remained forever the outsider, on the periphery of even his own vices. But he was eventually pilloried for what he became in the public eye to stand for. It remained only a state to which he aspired, if, that is, we believe him.The Last Testament Of Oscar Wilde thus hops repeatedly across the boundary that separates a public and a private life. Eventually the two distinct existences become blurred. Because one is always trying to be the other, with neither predominating. Peter Ackroyd's book is a masterpiece with much to say about thoroughly modern concepts such as populism, celebrity, fame and identity."},{"Title":"The Essential Kitten (Howell Book House's Essential)","review":"Although they're called kittens, I don't believe they will ever grow out of their curiosity! I picked up this book one day before getting my 1 year old tabby, Luke, and it's been an eye opener. Before I thought it was eat, poop, sleep, play. Now, after reading this, I am more aware of the potential dangers in my own home, and outside. There are plenty of diseases out there that I never really knew about (i.e., FIV (feline HIV), Luekemia, etc.).

Each chapter as a test at the end, and the end of the book includes a full length examination. The concepts are explained clearly. It includes basic grammatical information with clear descriptions followed by work problems that not only include the answers but also the reasons for the answers. It includes a verb chart at the end. I found that this book helped my understanding and working knowledge of grammar. The tests were helpful in measuring progress. How does this book compare with Complete Spanish Grammar by Nussenberg? Nussenberg's book goes into more of the complex verb forms, such as the future perfect and the complex subjunctive forms and it has a glossary at the end. The Nussenberg book also has more practice exercises per concept than the CliffsStudySolver book. For example, when reviewing regular verbs in the present tense, Nussenberg has nine separate, albeit brief exercises using the present tense, while CliffsStudySolver has three. However, CliffsStudySolver includes the reasons why particular answers were given and, as noted above, includes end of chapter and end of book tests. I would recommend either book."},{"Title":"Bypasses: A Simple Approach to Complexity","review":"I have not read all of this book and to be frank some of it is beyond my ability, but quite a lot of it is not. In any case this is not the type of book that you pick up and read in one sitting.The book presents a unifying theory that covers a great many phenomena in mathematics and science. The basic concept is deceptively simple: transform a problem, solve the transformed problem and then reverse transform it. One elementary example is to mulitiply two numbers by adding their logarithms. A second is to communicate across a long distance by tranforming voice into electrical current.This simple idea has wide applicability. Most of the book presents examples from a wide range of fields. They will make you look at things in a different light. Bypasses deserves a wider audience."},{"Title":"Bypasses: A Simple Approach to Complexity","review":"Suppose we have just about any kind of mystery, problem or puzzle to solve and, therefore, some kind of blocking \\"opposition\\" [or it would not be much of a mystery, problem or puzzle]. Well, a large ratio of good solution-methods involve finding or creating a BYPASS above and beyond the main opposition to solving the problem -- by analogy something like a ramp, ladder, bridge or tunnel -- or a series of those using STEPS to divide-and-conquer the complexity of opposition encountered. Just about ANY such concrete or abstract challenge-and-resolution may likely involve breaking it into moderate steps using more do-able better sub-methods -- even if only the very process of modeling the problem abstractly and then successfully solving the symbolic pattern of the model that will hopefully solve the original problem upon transilation back into the original space of the starting problem. Even the most basic usage of numbers, letters and symbols fall under the overall BYPASS idea. It's easier to use a number to count sheep than a rock [calculus] and easier to use calculus to solve geometric rates and sums rather than using pieces and limits. Also effective reasoning by analogy also involves BYPASS -- even if only via the basic usage of words, names and ideas.All of the above is most effectively shown in \\"BYPASSES, A Simple Approach to Complexity\\" by Z. A. Melzak. The Internet and other computerized electronic technology are all great examples of BYPASS even when occuring beyond the era of this book. I recall stunned amazement when first encountering the log function turning multiplication into addition -- and greatly appreciate a certain mentor making me learn the usage of slide-rules to more directly learn about such functions than is possible via pen-and-paper mathematics or electronic calculator or computer math. The BYPASS of the slide-rule allows someone to SEE common functions at work which are bypass-ways themselves to solve equations. The original log function was modeled by Napier using sliding marked sticks. I first encountered this author, Z. A. Melzak, via his other books on \\"concrete mathematics\\" -- which in comparison to the the book under review shows the wide and deep scope of the author -- in finding and effectively presenting the overall \\"reflexive\\" pattern of mathematics and maybe of philosophy, theology and consciousness as remarked upon in \\"BYPASSES, A Simple Approach to Complexity\\" +++"},{"Title":"Exploring the Old Testament: A Guide to the Prophets","review":"Gordon McConville's book The Prophets is part of a series entitled \\"Exploring the Old Testament. This is Volume 4. It is broken into 17 chapters, one for each of the prophetic books. The longer books (such as Isaiah) have much longer chapters written about them then the shorter books (Lamentations or Obadiah). The initial introduction is lengthy and gives a good introduction to the work by answering a lot of general questions about their role within the nation and within the canon. It deals with the prophets as a general source of theology as well as their rhetorical intentions. It also deals with the nature of modern literary, form and redaction criticism from Wellhausen onward and points out some strengths and weaknesses of this school. Overall, he seems to have a higher view of the inspiration of scripture than Carolyn Sharp's OT Prophets for Today.Each chapter deals with the book in five ways. First of all it gives some general modern literary criticism of the book and the redactionist theories of how the book came together. Secondly the chapter contains a sort of commentary where the book is broken down into smaller, logical sections and McConville gives a brief summary and commentary on these sections. Thirdly, the author deals with the theological themes of the book. I found this section the most helpful and enlightening to read.Fourthly, McConville deals with the books' rhetorical intentions. This section deals with the book's intentions and effects upon different group of hearers such as the original hearers of the prophet as well as the significance of the book up the Israelite community after the prophet's death. For those prophets who prophesied judgment it answers the question, what did these prophesies mean pre- and post-judgment?Lastly, the author deals with the book \\"in the Canon\\". I also enjoyed this part because it is really Biblical Theology proper. It deals with the book's place in the whole of Hebrew scripture and then in the whole of Christian scripture. Perhaps this section was too short, but it is connected in some ways with the third section. All in all, I liked the book and would recommend it to one studying the prophets."},{"Title":"Exploring the Old Testament: A Guide to the Prophets","review":"I liked the breakdown of this book with each prophet getting his own chapter. Each Chapter contains a brief history and setting as well as information about authorship, date and so on. There are also \\"Think about\\" and \\"Digging Deeper\\" segments in the book which focuses on certain themes individually thus allowing the reader to go deeper with his or her study instead of just reading the facts. The great advantage of this book is the further reading bibliography found at the back of each chapter which provides the reader with the opportunity to take his or her study of a specific prophet to a greater degree if he or she wishes."},{"Title":"Exploring the Old Testament: A Guide to the Prophets","review":"As a Reader in the Church of Scotland where my prime task is Worship leading is is a pleasure to have a book such as this that can give an easily accessible overview of the Prophets where their relevance and importance to much of the New Testament writings can be joined up.In itself it is an interesting read and the further reading be they Commentaries or Other Books and Articles is very comprehensive.

Truman","review":"Margaret Truman treats the reader to an intimate biography of her father. She tells the traditional stories of his courtship and life long love affair with Bess, his life on the farm, his service in World War I and his unsuccessful haberdashery venture. She continues on through his entry into politics and involvement with the Pendergast machine. The senate campaigns of 1934 and 1940 and the choice for Vice President set the stage for Harry Truman's role of a lifetime. His succession to the Presidency started a dizzying sequence of crises including the founding of the United Nations, the use of the atomic bomb and the surrender of Japan. He then lead the country through a rash of post war strikes and inflation leading to Democratic defeat in the 1946 Congressional elections. Rebounding, Truman fought off the Berlin Blockade and won a stunning upset victory in the 1948 elections. In his second term he restored the decaying White House, was harassed by Joseph McCarthy and had his presidency redefined by the Korean War. Deciding not to seek reelection, Truman began his unsuccessful effort to mold Adlai Stevenson into his successor. After leaving the White House, Truman found most of his satisfaction in his family and in teaching others about government.I like this book for its intimate view of Harry Truman's life. Margaret provides a perspective lacking in all other biographers. Her view of family life and the quotes from Harry's diaries and letters make this book a unique delight.In dealing with aspects of Truman's life this book lacks the depth found in some other biographies. In some respects, Margaret is a bit too strident in defense of her Father. I recommend other works for an initial Truman biography and this one to deepen the reader's understanding of Harry. Other books provide a better understanding of the historical Harry Truman. Margaret provides an excellent introduction to her Dad."},{"Title":"Harry S. Truman","review":"I bought this Truman biography for my 94-year old mother-in-law at her request. She was thrilled with it. Loved the fact that \\"there has been a president who loved his wife and daughter.\\" Even more so that it was written by the daughter. Even as a life-long Republican, the facts above led her to conclude that \\"Truman was a wonderful man.\\" The delivery was very timely and the edition received in good shape."},{"Title":"Harry S. Truman","review":"This was an interesting view of Truman as seen through the eyes of his daughter Margaret who by the way became one of the outstanding American mystery authors of the 20th century. Seening the presidency this way was really interesting as it is from a person who was there not someone just researching and gathering information. Who could know him better then the whole family."},{"Title":"Harry S. Truman","review":"This is a highly personal and surprisingly good biography by First Daughter Margaret Truman (1924-2008). Ms. Truman affectionately examines her father's Missouri upbringing, courtship with Bess, experiences in World War I, as a haberdasher, and as County Judge (Administrator). Readers follow as President Truman (1884-1972) graduates to the U.S. Senate in 1934, his surprise selection for Vice President in 1944, and his ascension to the top upon President Roosevelt's death in April, 1945. Then we follow along through Truman's Presidency, which he later said was akin to riding a tiger - keep abreast of events or get swallowed up. As many know, Truman's nearly eight years in the oval office involved ceaseless pressure from Potsdam, the Atom Bomb, postwar strikes, Israel, the 1948 election, Korea, confronting McCarthyism, etc. No wonder he called the White House the big white jail. Then it was back to Independence in early 1953 as private citizen and elder statesman.Ms. Truman takes an nicely intimate look, with revealing quotes from his diaries and letters. Yet she doesn't always dig deeply enough, at times she's critical of other Truman biographers, and can we expect true objectivity from one who (understandably) addresses her subject as Dad? Still, this book is clearly worth a look. Just be sure to see another solid Truman biography (such as David McCullough's) for a more rounded view."},{"Title":"Harry S.

Instead it told me about Mickey Mouse, Mighty Mouse, Tom and Jerry (I'm not lieing pages and pages were devoted to cartoon characters) and the was but a 1/4 page column on breeding. NO genetics, it only tells you what you can find out on the internet. Let me put it this way: For first time pet owners, or children ages 7-15, this is probably the book they need. But, for me, the experienced mouse breeder, I was looking for genetic information. There are lots of pictures, but not of individual colors or coat types, per afrma (american fancy rat and mouse association) standards. This book shows something about how to distinguish male and female mice, something even the pet-shop employees too often don't know. It also goes in depth to feeding, housing, selecting, showing your mouse, and even to what to do to your mouse when you take a vacation. To bring it to an end, if you are a first time or even a second or third time mouse owner, or thinking of getting a mouse (they are much better than a hamster) buy this book.

Thats right, the Hindus."},{"Title":"How the Irish Became White","review":"Wow. When the best argument your reviewers can come up with for disliking your book are \\"[the author] is a Jew\\" and \\"blacks weren't discriminated against [even at the time covered in the book, during which black people could legally be bought and sold in the South, disenfranchised and barred from most jobs in the North; apparently being legally defined as property doesn't qualify as discrimination], the Irish just worked harder,\\" you know you've struck a nerve.As a Canadian of Scots-Irish ancestry, I found this book fascinating. The history of the Irish in Canada is a bit different from the history of the American Irish; overall I'd say it's less painful. This book shed a lot of light on issues that I didn't expect it to touch, like black-white relations, abolitionism, and the contrast between the antebellum North and South (now I understand a little better why Southerners say they have been unfairly demonized; the Philadelphia and Boston described in the book were hardly freemen's paradise).When the author says he wants to get rid of the \\"white race,\\" he doesn't mean that he wants to get rid of white PEOPLE; he means that he wants to get rid of the category, \\"white,\\" which is neither traditional nor especially meaningful. (I note that the reviewer below refers to the pale-skinned author of the book as \\"a Jew\\" rather than as \\"white\\" - demonstrating the author's point about race quite handily. \\"White\\" clearly refers to something beyond skin colour.) What the author is trying to point out is that blacks were enslaved before the theory of white supremacy came about; people with white skin (in this case the Irish) were not necessarily treated or regarded as \\"white\\" automatically; white isn't just a colour, it's a social position that the Irish had to struggle very hard to get, and which was more or less defined by separation from the people who could NOT get that position no matter how hard they tried, i.e. blacks.I do not see this book as an attempt to smear or blame the Irish. It's not really about the Irish so much as it's a study of American immigration and assimilation to racial ideals, using the Irish as an example. Others could tell and have told similar stories about the Italians, the Jews, etc. In an atmosphere of scarcity, disorder, and brutal competition, people do what they need to do to get by. When there is an upper class and an underclass, people will do their damnedest to get into the upper class, or at least not to fall in with the underclass - this is a matter of survival as well as pride. It's sad to read about disadvantaged people fighting over scraps; it would be nicer to read that blacks and poor immigrants had banded together to fight for freedom, more rights, better pay and working conditions, etc. - but if this is not what happened, it's not Noel Ignatiev's fault, is it?I would have liked to see a few more chapters - the book ends rather abruptly around the time of Reconstruction, and clearly the assimilation of the Irish into \\"white\\" society was not finished at that point. I also think a few of the earlier chapters are a bit unfocussed, but I may just need to re-read."},{"Title":"How the Irish Became White","review":"This was a difficult book for me. The author says much the same thing in the Introduction; yet, as an American whose grandparents came from Ireland in the 60s to escape crushing poverty, it had a personal sting.Nobody likes to hear criticism of his own race or people, which is why we all, whether Irish, black, Jewish, Italian, etc., react strongly to critiques of our peoples, and try to point out the minute flaws in critics' reasoning, or justify these flaws in light of oppression suffered. I certainly don't believe Ignatiev to be an anti-Irish bigot, especially as such bigotry now rarely exists outside the UK.Yet we Irish-Americans need to face up to the facts. We, like any other group, are far from perfect, and, sad as it is to say, many of our blood perpetuated the crimes against us by becoming cruel toward other peoples whom we could, unconsciously or not, trample to step higher. It is understandable that Irishmen would do so, in light of the circumstances, but that does not make it excusable. Ignatiev presents a solid case, showing how this process worked historically.[One sentence in the conclusion struck me in particular. The author notes that in his research, he realised that \\"nobody gave a damn for the Irish,\\" observing that even slaves had abolitionists and religious groups caring for them. Though I, like most of Irish decent, do not care much for self-pity, it has irked me somewhat that almost nothing is taught of the plight of Irishmen in Ireland and abroad; perhaps a sentence or two on the \\"famine\\"--which was, of course, closer to a genocide than a famine--and that's that. This simple, one sentence acknowledgment of the way America and especially England have swept under the rug (unnoticed) their crimes against Ireland, certainly helped alleviate that feeling. We hear incessantly about the crimes of other civilisations--the Germans, the Japanese, the Russians--and rightly so, but scarcely a word about those of ever-fortunate England.]There is, nonetheless, something in this work that makes me feel it is incomplete, perhaps even that it is a rough draft. As another reviewer noted, it stops around Reconstruction, which seems hardly an appropriate starting point. I also wish the author had carried these points about Irish development of bigotry to other groups, even other disadvantaged groups like Jews and--dare I say?--blacks. This would certainly help undercut those, especially my understandably-offended fellow Irish-Americans, who argue some sort of bias on the author's part.Of course, such a connection would be as politically incorrect as they come, but I suspect it would ultimately do a lot of good, and if anybody has the guts to do it, Ignatiev is the man. One must first find the particular problems and seek to understand their causes before they can be healed: if we wish to abolish racism in all its forms, EVERY group, including the Irish, needs to take a long look at its history and mistakes."},{"Title":"How the Irish Became White","review":"This is a hard book to read, not because of any overdose of erudition or inaccessibility of the text, but due to the emotional reaction it can evoke from the reader. (This is easily demonstrated by a look at the other reviews.) If one has Irish ancestry, it's hard not to take personally. However, a historical retrospective of the social perceptions of Irish-Americans over the last 150 years is well worth reading. The shift in Irish-American image over time is fascinating; it's pleasing to see a group pull themselves out of disfavor and disturbing to see it happen at the expense of others in similar disfavor. Ignatiev illustrates the context of this perception shift well, with illustrative examples from events and news sources of the time. The book is moderately well documented, allowing the reader to search out further references at will. While there are a few points where the author oversimplifies for length and cohesiveness of narrative, overall it's an interesting read, and a reasonable treatment of a painful and complicated issue."},{"Title":"How the Irish Became White","review":"Unlike the other reviewer who apparently missed the entire point of the book, I found this book powerful and enlightening. The opening pages of the book delineate the plight of the Irish in their homeland and uses this as a basis for their evolution as citizens in the US. What is more, they are not the only ones who go through this evolutionary process of &quot;becoming white&quot;, the Poles, Italians, Jews and others after them would have their own journey to assimilation into US culture as well. As this book clearly describes, immigrants had the possibility to become white, African Americans did not. Further, the Irish had to choose: conform to the native-born culture or be forever shut out of opportunity just like the Blacks. It is an illuminating look at our society and one which truly does help us understand today. I read this book as part of a 13-book cirriculum for a graduate history seminar whose topic was the history of Racism in the US after 1870. It was one of the best-written texts and provided an excellent foundation for cultural studies. I highly reccomend it to anyone who seeks a better understanding of social history and today's US culture. Rather than placing blame, the author provides the facts and understanding of what happened, good and bad, so that we see the complexity and ultimately, the uselessness of blame. It is only with this understanding that we can start to make changes."},{"Title":"How the Irish Became White","review":"I read this book with great anticipation. I am a student of Irish American history and this book stood out as one that had great potential, but never really got off the ground. Ignatiev, in my opinion, never got to his point. The book rambled on about fire fighters and Philadelphia but never equated how this made the Irish \\"white.\\" It really more argued about how Irish and Blacks lived together for a long time and then all of a sudden the Irish started to hate Blacks--but never went into any detail about why or how; instead it talked about Irish labor strikes--against other whites--and the political career of an opportunistic Irish politician/fireman. The book also glazed over the St Patrick's Brigade in Mexico and never mentioned anything about the role the Irish played in the Civil War, national elections, or the draft riots. This study is not \\"path breaking\\" as the back cover says but is instead incomplete at best. Shannon's \\"The American Irish\\" is a more complete and better told story."},{"Title":"How the Irish Became White","review":"I don't understand some of the negative critiques listed by other readers (or who I presume read the book, it's hard to tell). I recently read the book and heard a speech by Mr. Ignatiev and the label of \\"racist\\" doesn't apply. Pointing out how 'whiteness' became a major part of the Irish-American identity and a method of securing a better place for themselves in America vis-&agrave;-vis free Blacks and slaves, he introduces a very useful analytical tool for looking at labor, politics, and immigration in the U.S. The hardships of the Irish aren't glossed over and neither are the consequences of their support of slavery and race-based politics - a choice that many other groups have seemingly made in coming to the United States.Most importantly, this book helps us to see how much we take for granted the social construction of &#8216;whiteness.&#8217; The reviewer who commented that the Irish were already white might not have paid close attention to the history of Catholic Irish in Ireland (especially Ulster). They were treated as a distinct race and this oppression is depicted concisely, but effectively, in \\"How the Irish Became White.\\"Overall, it is a well-written history book that promotes serious thinking."},{"Title":"How the Irish Became White","review":"Noel Ignatiev. How the Irish Became WhiteIgnatiev&#65533;s stated purpose, in the broadest sense, in writing this work, was an attempt to examine immigrant assimilation and the evolution of an American working class. On a narrower level he sought to divine why the Irish Catholics, an oppressed race in their own land, became part of an oppressor race in the United States. His thesis is that the Irish immigrant made a conscious decision to adopt Anglo-Saxon racism in order to gain a foot up in a competitive society -- to the disadvantage of Afro-Americans and the frustration of the formation of a united working class in America. He failed in his attempt on both accounts.Eric Foner is a Marxist historian. Ignatiev is a wannabe. Foner marshals his evidence, ignores the irrelevant, and analyses the meaningful from a leftist prospective. Ignatiev amasses a great deal of stuff, is unable to cull the meaningless and, without any sense of organization, tries to cram the results into his fevered preconceptions of racial relations in the nineteenth century. The result would be comical if in doing so he had not slandered an oppressed people striving to enter the American working class against all odds. &#65533;Ignatiev created a racial construct -- the Irish &#65533; that fails to account for the substantial differences and interests between the Irish in America and those in Ireland, between Irish-Americans and native-born Irish, and between Irish Catholics and Irish Protestants. Much of Ignatiev&#65533;s evidence relates to events prior to the Great Famine and the mass migration of destitute Irish Catholics to America. The net effect of this conglomeration is to obscure and to trivialize the struggle of Irish Catholics to climb out of the depths of poverty while burdening them with the racial and religious bigotry of their former oppressors. He criticizes the Irish for not taking up the abolitionist cause and labels them as racists for their failure to do so. Ignatiev seems unaware that a substantial number of abolitionists were white supremacists who believed that the superior Anglo-Saxon race abased itself by enslaving the inferior black race. It never occurred to Ignatiev that the apparent indifference of the Irish immigrants to slavery was not motivated by racism but that these people, engaged in a hand to mouth struggle for survival, were trying to avoid the stigma of &#65533;No Irish Need Apply.&#65533; &#65533;Ignatiev&#65533;s publisher makes the claim that the author reveals &#65533;how the Irish used labor unions, the Catholic Church and the Democratic party to help gain and secure their newly found place in the White Republic.&#65533; This assertion raises the question of whether or not the publisher ever read this work for there is not one reference to the Catholic Church and its myriad institutions of charity and education which the Irish Catholics both established and exploited in order to raise themselves from poverty to membership in the working class and beyond. &#65533;It is said that the empty drum resonates the loudest. Ignatiev at every opportunity, in this work and elsewhere, proclaims his abhorrence for racism. Racism, that is, as demonstrated by others. Indeed he is so busy berating others he fails to note the mote in his own eye. Witness Ignatiev&#65533;s stereotyping of the Irish. Huck-Finn must have been Irish because his father was the town drunk. [p. 58.] Witness Ignatiev&#65533;s belittling of the contribution of Irish born volunteers fighting for the Union in the Civil War. &#65533; The number of Irish who took part in the [New York draft] riots was not less than the number who wore the blue uniform.&#65533; [p. 88.] According to official records more than one hundred thousand native born Irish fought for the North in that war, thousands of whom died in combat. According to Iver Bernstein in The New York City Draft Riots, a source favorably cited by Ignatiev, there was far fewer people engaged in those riots, Irish immigrants, German immigrants and native-born Americans combined. &#65533;In summation the book fails both as a work of history and social commentary. It adds nothing, save confusion, to what Theodore W. Allen had already written in 1994, about Irish Catholic immigrants in the final two chapters of his work The Invention of the White Race."},{"Title":"How the Irish Became White","review":"One thing that infallibly determines the quality of a book is the idiocy of those inclined to negatively review its content. This book proves that rule with particular emphasis, as can be seen right here. Noel Ignatiev's book \\"How the Irish Became White\\" uses the methods of the new historians of labor in America, who acknowledge as must be done that race segmented class and became part of it, and that the unity of the working class in struggle against capital in America is a historical lie. To the best extent possible given the often scant material, he applies this methodology to the case of the Irish, in particular in Philadelphia.As Ignatiev shows, race is a social construct, and it was therefore at the time by no means 'obvious' that the Irish were white, as would be the case now according to these classifications. On the contrary, the Irish were especially from the time of the Irish Potato Famine (1845-1855) on desperately poor laborers, which at the time meant they were not likely to be seen as white. So the Irish had to become white, through struggle of their own. This was only possible by participating in the oppression of the class automatically put on the lowest rank of the urban ladder, the black workers. Whether slave or freeman, the Irish hated, despised, and persecuted them, and in the cauldron of this racial antagonism, the Irish working class was bleached white in the eyes of the ruling class.The usual arguments about the relations of race and class in America are shown to be fallacious. Black workers were not strikebreakers per se, but had to become strikebreakers because they were systematically excluded by the Irish unions. Whenever the black population organized itself and formed its independent spheres of power, the Irish attempted to destroy these. The Irish vigorously supported slavery and the Southern cause, only going so far as to reject secession, which would leave them on their own facing Northern capital. When the Civil War increasingly turned toward the cause of abolition, the Irish of New York City revolted in one of the 19th Century's greatest riots. No black worker was even permitted to work alongside an Irish one by the latter, or they would strike on the spot or leave their job.This is not because the Irish were or are inclined to evil or prejudice more than anyone else. It is precisely because the Irish were the most despised of all 'free' labor, and yet were exalted above the blacks. As Ignatiev showed, in late 18th Century Ireland itself, even very poor Protestant Irish considered themselves racially superior to the Catholic Irish. Their feelings of superiority were precisely all they had, and the British did all they could to encourage it, since division within a class greatly eased their occupation. The same phenomenon prevailed in America, only there unity was actually impossible, since the blacks had been brought to America involuntarily whereas all others were voluntary settlers. This incompatibility of viewpoint made the citizenship status of blacks dubious from the very start of the existence of the American Colonies, and as a result, the blacks were not opportunistically, but permanently consigned to the lowest rank within American labor (with Native Americans for the most part excluded from these ranks altogether). For any settler to prove himself 'white', it then became necessary to partake in and support this system.Not so therefore the popular social-democratic myth that capital managed to conspire to divide the workers, or confused them to their 'true' interests. Although they would have been better off united, the very foundations of the American state were laid on the basis of this racial division. As long as America was and remains founded upon it, original African-American workers as a racial class could and can never advance beyond the lowest rung of the ladder, nor could and can Hispanics or the original Asian immigrants. Conversely, no settler or his descendant could or can fall to that level unless they are willing to reject the mess of pottage called 'whiteness' for which they have exchanged their birthright of equality and solidarity among the working class. As Ignatiev shows, in the 19th Century, the number of such workers was very few indeed. Are there more now? Then let them show themselves."},{"Title":"How the Irish Became White","review":"History is best written if it retells the story of the past to explain how we all got to where we are now. Noel Ignatiev's, &quot;How the Irish Became White&quot;, is one of those books where the present is illuminated by the past. He attempts to explain how Irish Americans embraced the privileges of their &quot;whiteness&quot; in the United States over against the plight of their African-American urban neighbors and against the cause of the abolitionists, in order to cast off the scorn of their oppressed existence in Ireland and as despised emigrants in the New Republic. Ignatiev draws from a host of primary resources from writings of key Irish-American political leaders, labor leaders, journalists, and even religious leaders to press his point. Stringing together letters, literature, lithographs, and lyrics with this theme, Ignatiev does seem to get somewhat jumbled with the abundance of resources packed into his book. However, his work makes this book indispensable as a researcher's platform for further historical analysis on the subject. Of notable importance is Ignatiev's extensive analysis on race and labor relations in the Philadelphia area in this book. Ignatiev's book is best read as a historian's attempt to fill in where other historians have been silent: how Irish-Americans ignored or participated in the oppression of people of color in the United States to their own advantage. As an American with an Irish heritage living in Philadelphia, I would highly recommend this book to supplement other more mainstream histories of our difficult past."},{"Title":"How the Irish Became White","review":"Since Michael Sheehan's review here brings up the problem of Ignatiev's stereotyping and his generalizations I won't go into detail on Ignatiev's thesis, which was written as a doctoral dissertation at Harvard and made into a book.That many Irish intermarried with Native Americans, with African Americans, that many fought with the Union to abolish slavery, that many lived in the same neighborhoods with blacks, that blacks and whites worked together to form trade unions in the north, remain indisputable facts independent of Ignatiev's historical theorizing and stereotyping. Ignatiev seems to have fallen for some of the same anti-Irish trope used by the ruling class in England and in the US against the Irish. An example :Irish immigrants worked as labor organizers for safe and equitable conditions in the Pennsylvania coalfields in the 19th century. In 1877, 20 of them were hanged on trumped up charges of murder by Franklin Gowen, president of the Reading RR and Coal Co. They were called \\"Molly Maguires\\"--a term of very dubious history. Gowen used it repeatedly to frighten the population and warn against reprisals that would surely come after the alleged \\"Mollies\\" were executed. Of course, \\"reprisals' by \\"Molly Maguires\\" never materialized as they were mainly part of a fiction invented by Gowen and repeated in the major newspapers of the day. A good union-busting tactic that succeeded.But a century later the executed men were exonerated when Pennnysylvia's Governor Shapp pardoned John Kehoe, their suppposed leader. This fact is commonly ignored. And so defamation in the form of a myth about the Irish union organizers called the \\"murderous\\" \\"Molly Maguires\\" continues to grow with some recent books even building on and extending propaganda that originated with the mine owners over a hundred years ago.Sloppy reasoning and scholarship like Ignatiev's have given a greater platform for books that enlarge on older cultural and ethnic stereotypes about Irish union organizers and the Irish in the US."},{"Title":"How the Irish Became White","review":"Im always struck by how ignorant academia is of race, class, and ethnic relations in America. Although it is true the Irish suffered for centuries under English (British) rule and were treated horribly in America, intermarriage and cultural similarities probably had more to do with their integration into WASP society than a concerted, organized effort to keep blacks down. Just as the Irish were blamed for all sorts of social ills in the 19th Century: violence, alcoholism, orphans, ghettoes, crime, etc., now Ignatiev wants to blame racism on the Irish. Having white skin clearly worked to the advantage of the Irish and many gained acceptance in a Protestant, Anglo Saxon nation but Ignatiev goes too far in judging and generalizing the entire Irish race when many fought against slavery, racism and inequality, especially in labor. Ignatiev seems to have a bone to pick with the Irish, heaven knows they have been oppressed and ridiculed enough already!"},{"Title":"How the Irish Became White","review":"My ancestors, the Scottish highlanders, were long despised even in their own country as barbarians fit only to be exterminated or at least assimilated. This comes close enough to how the Irish were perceived. But I think that Ignatiev's use of the word \\"White\\" is easily misunderstood. He doesn't believe that there is such a thing as the White race. He is a Marxist and a Social Constructionist. Such people don't believe that ANY human category is real or fixed. He is annoyed at the Irish for failing to become Marxists when their proletarian roots theoretically should have driven them in that direction. I consider his ideological theories to be nonsense. This book is not really about the Irish, he is just using them as an example. He could just as easily have written a book complaining about Black assimilationists. He could have written a book titled \\"How the Blacks Became White.\\""},{"Title":"How the Irish Became White","review":"wat a great book! this was the book that started me on my journey to find out what race was really about, and that it doesnt really mean as much as people think it does..."},{"Title":"How the Irish Became White","review":"Says person above: \\"When the author says he wants to get rid of the \\"white race,\\" he doesn't mean that he wants to get rid of white PEOPLE; he means that he wants to get rid of the category, \\"white,\\" which is neither traditional nor especially meaningful.

If the author read work on genocide (including the U.N. protocols) he/she would see that genocide is not necessarily the total wipeout of genes, but rather the system of policies that takes out a group (the \\"social construct\\" of \\"white\\")---- it is a wipeout of \\"ethnicity\\" which is, in fact, in part, ALWAYS a \\"construct\\"--- a construction of a multiplex of shared experience, language, trajectory to a country, arts, and so on----- Wiping out this \\"construct\\" is genocide.If one said they are going to end the \\"social construct\\" of Asians, then you would see what this means.

Using Ignatiev's logic, if these immigrants had landed in the South they would have sought to assimilate with the locals by flocking to the cause of abolitionism. That's almost as brilliant as Daniel Jonah Goldhagen's conclusion that the lack of evidence of anti-Semitism in medieval Germany, shows that anti-Semitism was so widespread that no one even bothered to mention it. If Irish catholic immigrants had really wanted to ingratiate themselves with the Anglo population they would have embraced the draft and converted to Protestantism. Perhaps understandably, Irish peasants fresh from the boat had a slight aversion to facing the half-crazed Scots-Irish soldiers of the Confederacy. To make the point crystal clear they inaugurated a pogrom against the ethnic group they were being enlisted to manumit. The fact that Noel Ignatiev can claim that these attacks were part of a covert conspiracy to rehabilitate the Irish in the eyes of Wasps, says more about his obsession with race than it does about his powers of deductive logic. I expect that when Ignatiev is not calling for the destruction of the White race, he spends his time searching for \\"The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Erin\\". Real historians know that the Irish assimilated into the American mainstream by embarking upon a behavioural reformation inspired by charismatic leader John \\"Dagger\\" Hughes. If Black America had more Dagger Hughes and fewer Al Sharptons maybe Noel Ignatiev would be looking for a job?"},{"Title":"How the Irish Became White","review":"While he choses an eye-catching title, his book is actually a history of the Irish in Philadelphia.

(Though I bet he chose this title to make more money, which he probably is, given the hysterics being written in reviews here).If you're really looking for a book on this topic, I would recommend reading his afterward and trying a few of the books listed there."},{"Title":"How the Irish Became White","review":"History is best written if it retells the story of the past to explain how we all got to where we are now. Noel Ignatiev's, &quot;How the Irish Became White&quot;, is one of those books where the present is illuminated by the past. He attempts to explain how Irish Americans embraced the privileges of their &quot;whiteness&quot; in the United States over against the plight of their African-American urban neighbors and against the cause of the abolitionists, in order to cast off the scorn of their oppressed existence in Ireland and as despised emigrants in the New Republic. Ignatiev draws from a host of primary resources from writings of key Irish-American political leaders, labor leaders, journalists, and even religious leaders to press his point. Stringing together letters, literature, lithographs, and lyrics with this theme, Ignatiev does seem to get somewhat jumbled with the abundance of resources packed into his book. However, his work makes this book indispensable as a researcher's platform for further historical analysis on the subject. Of notable importance is Ignatiev's extensive analysis on race and labor relations in the Philadelphia area in this book. Ignatiev's book is best read as a historian's attempt to fill in where other historians have been silent: how Irish-Americans ignored or participated in the oppression of people of color in the United States to their own advantage. As an American with an Irish heritage living in Philadelphia, I would highly recommend this book to supplement other more mainstream histories of our difficult past."},{"Title":"How the Irish Became White","review":"Apparently the Irish are now to balme for racism against blacks and their inability to assimilate into the white race...ya right.The author has taken liberty in jumping to conclusions from scrapes of references as well as ignoring the Irish plight. The genocide of the Irish at the hands of the English is no where to be found... The tremndous racism of Irish-Catholics is not mentioned either. Where is the mention of murdered nuns and catholics? The books claims that the Irish climbed up the American ladder by pulling the black man off... This is simply placing blame where it does not belong. I suggest the author read up on his histroy to learn the facts"},{"Title":"How the Irish Became White","review":"If the Irish became \\"White\\", why are they still overwhelmingly Catholic? The religious affiliation of the Catholic Irish in no way endeared them to the Protestant Establishment. The Irish also created the Catholic school system in this country. How did that square with becoming part of the \\"White\\" establishment. The fact is that the Irish remained Irish and became the most affluent ethnic group in this country. Why settle for being \\"White\\" when you can be Irish? A non-Irish person could never understand this and Ignatiev is laughably out of his depth. The Mumia Abu Jamal endorsement doesn't help either, this genius never finished high school,killed an IRISH-AMERICAN police officer,and has been in prison for almost 30 years successfully ducking a death sentence.th"},{"Title":"How the Irish Became White","review":"Ignatiev tells the tangled, tattered history of Irish-black relations in America in the 30 years or so leading up to the Civil War. It shows how the Irish used labor unions and the Democratic Party to elevate themselves in the stratified American republic. At first, the white protestant majority in America made little distinction between Irish immigrants and free blacks -- it scorned them both. But by emphasizing racism, leaders of the Irish-American community were able to swing themselves over to the side of the dominant class, to the horror of their brethren in Ireland, who identified the slaves' struggles for emancipation with their own battles against English rule."},{"Title":"How the Irish Became White","review":"Overlook the author's Marxism and overreliance on sources from Philadelphia and you have a book that resonates even today -- how immigrants fleeing oppression trade off their principles in exchange for a place above the bottom of America's racial caste system. It applies to Hispanics in the Southwest today and Asians in inner city stores."},{"Title":"How the Irish Became White","review":"One of the best works of history on race in America ever written. This book will reward the attentive reader with example after example of how the Irish altered their social position by acquiring \\"white privilege\\" long before the word was even known. It dovetails very nicely with the broader and equally brilliant Race: the Birth of An Idea in the West by Ivan Hannaford. Hannaford looks at the 30,000 foot level and the four century perspective. Ignatiev examines one nation, and the history of one ethnic group. Do not be fooled by the ignorant reviewers who did not understand Ignatiev's central thesis. This is a book worth pondering."},{"Title":"How the Irish Became White","review":"I found this book very interesting and well documented from period sources. The author describes the little known and rarely acknowledged attitudes and actions of one immigrant ethnic group, and how this group established a place in America at the expense of other groups. The effects are still being felt today."},{"Title":"How the Irish Became White","review":"Noel Ignatiev's well-researched and well-argued book is incredibly important to understanding the way race has been constructed in the United States and the way that white people are deeply involved in that racial hierarchy - whether they want to be or not. Looking at the reviews of the book it is clear that many of my fellow white people are incredibly uncomfortable with these realities, but their discomfort only proves the point of how important this book really is. Cycles don't change unless we interrupt them, and this book is one such interruption. Hopefully more of us will be willingly to interrupt the current cycle of white supremacy (through colonialism/capitalism/patriarchy/cis-hetero-normativity, and the white-middle-class-ideal that Ignatiev deconstructs so artfully in this book) and not defend it by turning away from the role we play in it."},{"Title":"How the Irish Became White","review":"This book is useful as a catlogue of many important and interesting events, and students will find it a handy reference tool. However, Prof. Ignatiev would have us believe that the Irish, in their natural state, were pure and untainted by bigotry, but that contact with America somehow caused them to become racist. This is untenable at best. He could have argued his thesis more effectively in a shorter essay. Short on analysis, the book is merely an interesting laundry list of riots and other events, and his many anecdotes do not do much to advance his argument. Nonetheless, the work is an interesting read and should prove useful to students."},{"Title":"How the Irish Became White","review":"Ignatiev's brief work documents a rough and unpleasant aspect of urban Irish America in the nineteenth century, its racism. It shouldn't be too surprising to any student of Irish history that an essentially conservative Irish peasantry, transplanted to America, maintained a cultural, rather than class-based, solidarity. Paradoxically, for many, this meant adopting the same racist attitudes towards African-Americans as their own nativist tormentors. Ignatiev's study is sober and well-researched. For those who can get around the enthusiastic back cover endorsement by Mumia Abu-Jamal, and the occasional obtuse side arguments with other socialist scholars, this is a valuable contribution to the history of race relations and the Irish diaspora."},{"Title":"How the Irish Became White","review":"noel ignatiev's book &quot;how the Irish became white&quot; is not necessarily a new idea. it has been written about before. ronald takaki wrote about it a different mirror. while, it's true this is nothing you learn about in school, it's been a well held belief about the irish relationship with african-americans. also, ignatiev's book is much better researched.as an irish american i am not offended by ignatiev's book. certainly, there is much more to this book than how the &quot;big bad Irish&quot; treated african-americans. ignatiev doesn't reduce this book to such a simple theory. the story of the success of the Irish is too great to reduce it to such a simplistic view. the irish were a people that were so tired of being abused that they were willing to achieve success on any terms. luckily, for the irish they had white skin, and used that to their advantage in the democratic party. the story of the irish is the greatest success story in american history. all ignatiev does is portray an honest portrayal of the irish success story. he doesn't say that the irish got ahead just at the expense of blacks, but that it was one factor. too often that the irish look at themselves as being victimized. but it's also important to look at ourselves honestly as well: good with the bad."},{"Title":"How the Irish Became White","review":"The author ignores the most salient information, that of Irish Slavery in America.I dont mean the indentured in America english/scottish tenant farmers of irish land given to english who financed the invading armies in the 1600's.I mean the Irish slaves.In 1623 30,000 Irish\\"Political Prisoners\\" ( read prisoners of war) were auctioned in Virginia.

Of all the chess books I have seen geared purely toward the beginner, I found this to be the clearest, best organized, and, just as the subtitle claims, it is \\"A Picture Guide to The Royal Game.\\"Lots of pictures help explain the moves and motions of a piece in the context of a larger strategy. Chernev and Harkness used photos of the board as well as standard board drawings. They require modernized, as the photos are a bit blurry, and the drawings have an old newspaper keyline look. The copy is succinct, but not dry. As a reader, I found it less clinical than many of the chess books with dozens of lines per opening.This is a long way from anything Lasker or Fischer wrote, but the audience intended here is looking to play the game effectively, unworried about becoming a grandmaster. At least, not yet.The content list breaks things down to subsections like \\"How the King Moves and Captures,\\" and \\"How the Pawn Captures 'en passant.''\\" They provide a special section cautioning the new player of common mistakes, like \\"Premature Attacks,\\" and \\"Pawn Grabbing with the Queen.\\" This is invaluable because young players routinely shoot for point control over game control.I fully recommend \\"An Invitation to Chess\\" by Irving Chernev and Kenneth Harkness.

While the book is well intentioned and covers a wide range of topics about addiction and recovery, I was ultimately quite disappointed in it's presentation. The content is clearly a repackaging of 12 Step (e.g.: Alcoholics Anonyomous) concepts such as acceptance of powerlessness, etc. While this is not by itself a bad thing, the author incessantly uses commanding language beginning with \\"We need to ...\\" that many readers, I anticipate, will experience as preaching and condescending. (Implicitly telling the reader: \\"You need to!\\") The author places a heavy emphasis on labeling (\\"alcoholic\\", \\"addict\\") and de-emphasizes a person's ability to be their own agent of change; both contrary to scientific principles about what is effectively in achieving change. Some chapters contain exercises that invite reader participation but the exercises are not well developed and seem secondary to the overall lecturing tone of the material.

In fact he lost more than just his spouse, he lost some of his sanity.Monica is a teacher so after her father's death she decided to get a job out of London, she applied for a job in Hedgeborough north of London to teach school.After getting the job, Monica needed a place to stay,(why the people hiring her never thought she would need a place to stay in the small town is beyond me). Monica elected to except an invitation from Miss Elphick to stay in her very large home with her.(Miss Elphick said she was the last of the Elphick, yet when she was hurt she went to stay with her brother Donald and his wife)But when Miss Elphick had an accident and she received a concussion and a broken leg, her maid Jeannie decided to close the house until Miss Elphick was well enough to come home because she wouldn't work for anyone else but the Elphicks.This left Monica without a place to stay, but Mrs Merriden had the perfect solution; Monica could move into The Hall where Mrs Merriden lived with her grandchildren Robert Kewson, Theodore Merriden Rosemary Frayne and her son. This way she could be company for Rosemary.Then to her horror the main person to hire her Mrs Merriden turns out to be the Aunt to Robert Kewson. Not only that but his cousin Rosemary and her son are staying in the same house. Rosemary's husband Anthony Frayne is missing, and presumed dead. Tony had left when he found his wife a little too friendly toward her cousin Robert. And then he became ill, and didn't come back for nearly a year.So when Tony calls in the middle of the night to let Rosemary know he is home, and he wants to come to her at her grandmother's home, Mrs Merriden comes up with a plan to keep Tony from being jealous of Robert. She wants Monica to pretend to be Robert's love interest.But this back fires.From the back of the book: 'Mrs Merriden was a benevolent autocrat whose rule over a small North-country village was cheerfully accepted by most of those whom it concerned.But perhaps she went too far in engineering a fictitious engagement between her grandson, Robert, and the pretty school mistress, Monica Page-particularly as Monica considered that she had the best of reasons for disliking Robert.It was a situation that even Mrs Merriden was to find she couldn't completely control.'"},{"Title":"Tanakh akhshav (Hebrew Edition)","review":"Tanach Akhshav, or \\"Bible Now\\", as literally translated, is a collection of essays written from a secular point of view of the Bible (in this review, when I say \\"Bible\\", I am referring to the Old Testament) stories. Written in Hebrew, I don't know how many of you out there will be able to enjoy it, but if you know Hebrew, and enjoy reading the Bible, I strongly recommend this book.Meir Shalev's essays bring us closer to the people behind the myths, the everyday life behind the dogma. He goes against traditional Biblical interpretations that force religious significance upon the most natural of activities, and go out of their way to exonerate the most vile of actions. As he states in the prefix to his book, his Bible is a different Bible; those described in it are real people, impure, imperfect, with their own desires and agendas to drive their lives. Shalev's interpretations make the stories of the Bible accessible, understandable and relatable. He shows us the passions, politics and philosophy that was masked behind religious dogma.In most of the essays Shalev discusses a particular figure or specific biblical story: The passionate love story of Jacob and Rachel; the shining moment of bravery of the prophet Michayahu; The Soldier, Yoav son of Tzuria (chief of Kind David's army). In other essays, he looks at aspects of Biblical life - the prophecy, the names, the politics, the wars. In all of these he gives a clear headed and sensible interpretation of people and events. Often, he'll quote traditional interpretation and question its motives, suggesting a more plausable view.Shalev's strength as a writer comes full play into these essays. Sometimes he'll takes jabs at modern life, contrasting it to Biblical times; in some fields of human endeavor (most commonly politics) he enjoys showing how little has changed. His language is easy, and he does not try to be overly intellecualized or sophisticated. Sprinkled throughout you'll find his gentle sarcasm and dry wit, adding a lighness to subjects that normally are discussed with overt graveness.This is, without doubt, one of my favorite books of all times. I certainly hope someone will translate it to English, so that others may enjoy it, and perhaps more importantly, gain a different view of the Bible."},{"Title":"Black diamonds,: A novel;","review":"This novel is about society in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the lives of several of the people from different classes. Mr. Jokai's writing style is very descriptive and he clearly wants the readers to create visual images of the scenery and homes of the time in their heads.

An interesting side note is that the scenes of capitalist excess and the all-consuming quest for money in this novel will be very familiar to the readers of the 21st century--apparently man's nature has not changed for the better.

This book instead was exactly what I needed, it assume you know PHP 4 and covers only the new features with a good amount of details and a bunch of useful suggestions for code migration. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that in the chapters covering OOP and DOM the author try to explain the new functionalities but also attempt to throw in the mix more generic info on this two topics. The end results are somewhat mixed, the coverage of PHP 5 is, in my opinion, very good, but the material about OOP and DOM instead aren't up to the rest and does more harm than good."},{"Title":"Upgrading to PHP 5","review":"This is a fantastic book. I frequently find that when an existing developer buys a book, he/she has to sort through all the garbage review in the beginning. This book assumes you are a competent PHP4 programmer. Then it takes you step by step through new PHP5 syntax and features that are unique to PHP5. It reviews and explains Object Oriented Programming (OOP), then discusses a variety of PHP5-only concepts, like SimpleXML and SQLite.I recently installed a PHP5 server and this book has been by my side since. All PHP4 developers who expect to use PHP5 within the next year or so should really have a copy of this book handy."},{"Title":"Upgrading to PHP 5","review":"PHP5 has been out for many years now, so this book might seem somewhat irrelevant to today's programmers. But this book is still a valuable addition to the intermediate PHP programmer's bookshelf. The first time I read this book (years ago) I was still programming strictly for PHP4 and had never touched OO programming in PHP. I had a basic understanding of what it was, but I had never tried to use it. This book gave me the logical and practical introduction to OO programming in PHP that I needed. I still take a peek at this book every now and then to refresh my memory on some of the language constructs that I may not use very often. This has probably been one of the most helpful PHP books I have ever purchased."},{"Title":"Upgrading to PHP 5","review":"I got this book some time ago, when still I worked with php. It is a great wrap-up about php good practice with a mashup of techniques about mysql and other ancillary components to php.It is a good reading and still one of the books I remember with gratitude.Is the cover picture about turtles crawling somehow hyronical about the slowness of php programmers?"},{"Title":"Upgrading to PHP 5","review":"I own a sizable collection of O'Reilly books and have found them to in general be very well written and useful. \\"Upgrading to PHP 5\\" continues this tradition superbly.This book is _not_ for new PHP coders; the vast majority of the text assumes good familiarity with PHP 4.x. If you have this familiarity then you will find this book to be a thorough and well-organized primer on the many new features in the new PHP.The first chapter merely lists the major areas that have changed in the latest PHP, each of which roughly corresponds to a chapter in the book.Major enhancement to the OOP facilities of PHP are appropriately discussed in the next chapter. Unfortunately, this is probably the most clumsily written chapter due a strange desire to educate the reader in OOP basics (about the only place in the book where this mistake is committed). The result is a schism that imposes redundancy in the material while simultaneously making it unduly hard to locate specific topics.Thankfully the subsequent two chapters (on the new MySQL interface and the SQLite database) are uniformly well-written. Especially useful is a (perhaps oddly-situated) section on migration strategies from a PHP 4/MySQL 4.0 platform to a PHP 5/MySQL 4.1 platform.A chapter on XML follows, but I did not read it in great detail since my applications tend to not require it, so other reviewers are likely to provide greater insights here.Iterators, yet another feature completely new to PHP 5, are covered next. Unlike much of the conventional PHP fare (even OOP) this topic really does require understanding of rather abstract concepts (especially when debugging the RecusrsiveIterator interface). For this reason, while clearly written it may take hobbiests some time to take this material to heart.The new error-handling functions are introduced next. I think that the chapter could have benefited from a little more discussion; Trachtenberg seems to think providing code samples is almost self-explanatory. At the end of the day, though, the chapter does its job.The chapter on streams and filters is another one that I barely perused, so I defer to other reviewers on this topic.The penultimate chapter provides a very cursory evaluation of a handful of extensions to PHP. While certainly useful to the practicing PHP programmer they are covered in so brief a manner that you will need a separate text to implement them meaningfully. But this chapter does give enough information to at least evaluate the extensions' potential usefulness in an application.Trachtenberg concludes with an example PHP application. I do not like such examples in books - between space limitations and the complexity of real life this and other examples feel too... contrived... to be worthwhile. But I understand that it is included practically as canon, and do not fault the author for its inclusion.So, all things considered, this text covers the changes in PHP 5 in detail in a surprisingly brief 300 pages (and small page footprint). A worthy addition to a book collection, provided you already have general PHP reference available."},{"Title":"Upgrading to PHP 5","review":"The author does a great job summarizing common PHP characteristics and elaborating on PHP 5 improvements, with plenty of well-chosen code examples.

Yes, this is no difficult task, but Ingersoll's perspective and wit make this an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"A few reasons for doubting the inspiration of the Bible","review":"It's excellent information - and if you want something short, this is fine, but if you're interested in more, get some of Ingersoll's books. To me, this item seems ideal as a gift to introduce someone to a different way of thinking.Robert Green Ingersoll is the author of some of the most thought-provoking pieces ever written. He encourages everyone to examine - really examine - what is claimed by those who insist the Bible is literally true. He is an incredible advocate of logical, clear, responsible thinking, and of avoiding being taken in by those who want to control people. Here is an excerpt of a book of his I highly recommend, \\"Some Mistakes of Moses,\\" which can be purchased in its entirety for not much more than the price of this 24-page pamphlet: \\"One of the first things I wish to do, is to free the orthodox clergy. ... They are not allowed to read and think for themselves. They are taught like parrots, and the best are those who repeat, with the fewest mistakes, the sentences they have been taught. They sit like owls upon some dead limb of the tree of knowledge, and hoot the same old hoots that have been hooted for eighteen hundred years.\\" Anytime I hear any portion of a Catholic mass, that quote comes to my mind.Another excerpt: \\"Until every soul is freely permitted to investigate every book, and creed, and dogma for itself, the world cannot be free. Mankind will be enslaved until there is mental grandeur enough to allow each man to have his thought and say. This earth will be a paradise when men can, upon all these questions differ, and yet grasp each others hands as friends. It is amazing to me that a difference of opinion upon subjects that we know nothing with certainty about, should make us hate, persecute, and despise each other.\\"An acquaintance of mine is a Catholic priest who has told me he visits with couples in marriage classes about contraception - which is forbidden by his bosses, but he feels it is the responsible thing to do to provide appropriate education and factual information, and he understands that many couples think it is morally irresponsible to have 6, 8, 10 children. Here is another Ingersoll excerpt that speaks of the unthinking folks who would have this priest thrown out for what he's doing: \\"They are notified to stand by the old creed, and to avoid all original thought, as a mortal pestilence. Every minister is employed like an attorney either for plaintiff or defendant, and he is expected to be true to his client. If he changes his mind, he is regarded as a deserter, and denounced, hated, and slandered accordingly. Every orthodox clergyman agrees not to change. He contracts not to find new facts, and makes a bargain that he will deny them if he does.\\"Read Ingersoll, and maybe you too will find the will to examine what you've been spoonfed for years, by whatever religion/denomination, and perhaps you'll even question the basis for any organization allowed to discriminate against women and hide sexual crimes against children."},{"Title":"A few reasons for doubting the inspiration of the Bible","review":"Col.

The author provides an introduction to each of the major systems of a large commercial aircraft, and explains how flying large jet airliners is different from flying smaller piston or turbine powered airplanes. The author has taken a potentially very difficult subject and made it fairly easy for the novice pilot (or aspiring pilot) to understand. A very interesting book well worth reading, and a must have for all you 'wannabe' airline pilots. (This is a review of the first edition)."},{"Title":"Flying the Big Jets","review":"For those who like planes and decided to understand how it really works, there is still nothing better that I have seen. It comprehends basically all aspects of flying: how a big jet works, how to fly it and basics of aerodynamics and meteorology. In the last chapter, the author vividly describes a complete flight from London to New York, depicting from the pre-flight plan up to the gate at JFK. I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Flying the Big Jets","review":"I was excited to read this book given I have always been interested in what it is like to fly these massive hunks of metal. I have also read a few books by this author about airline crashes, which always proved to be interesting. So here is my problem, I was expecting an interesting and maybe at times even exciting book, what I got was a somewhat bland, even dull at times book that spelled out all the facts about flying a jet. OK, I know that is exactly what the author stated the book would be about on the dust jacket, but he did not mention that the text would be bone dry.With that criticism out of the way, I did enjoy learning about flying a commercial jet. I thought the run down of the mechanical operations of the aircraft and the actual job of flying the aircraft were the most interesting. The rest of the book was informative and in enough detail to be considered a good overall review, it was just a bit dry, textbook dry. To be honest I do not know exactly what I would have done to make the book more exciting, but hey, he is the author. It is his job to make the book interesting. And to be a nitpicker, how much actually changes with each new version of the book? Overall the book was ok, it had some interesting parts but really is only for someone that is truly interested in how these aircraft work and what it is like to fly them."},{"Title":"Flying the Big Jets","review":"This book is excellent reading for anyone who ever steps on an airplane.

Easily understood by the layman, it also gives a good dose of anecdote and interesting information on the industry and the pilot's occupation. Well done"},{"Title":"Flying the Big Jets","review":"Stanley Stewart does an excellent job describing the basic knowlege and procedures for flyng a 747-400. Obviously, you won't learn to fly one just by reading this book, but you will have a good appreciation of the sort of background a senior pilot has.The prose is dry, and Stewart's occasional attempts at humor fall totally flat, but otherwise this book is totally authoritative and therefore a mandatory addition to the armchair pilot's bookshelf."},{"Title":"Flying the Big Jets","review":"On the one hand, what did I expect? This doesn't exactly promise to be a whole new book. On the other hand, this is so much like Stewart's \\"Flying The Big Jets--The 747,\\" that it's clear though most of the text all he did was use a word processor to change \\"747\\" to \\"777.\\" There are of course some areas where this won't do--the aircraft have some differences that must be addressed--but even here he didn't sit down and write new material but rather simply inserted individual sentences and paragraphs as needed, wherever the Triple-7 differed in some way from the 747. Even the flight that's the last chapter is exactly the same except we're going to Boston's Logan Airport now instead of New York's JFK. But the weather and flying condititions, and the descriptions and experiences the pilot has along the way, are identical to those of the 747 book. He could have had it snowing in this trip, for instance, to discuss how a pilot deals with a wintery snow landing vs. the rainy landing of the last book.There are a few plusses: diagrams of the cockpit gauges have been redrawn--much better this time. The section on avionics is updated a bit to reflect new technology. And the text is laid out a little better by the publisher. But if you already have Stewart's 747 version of the book (which I've also reviewed), no need to get this one. If you don't, and you're curious as to what goes into flying a jumbo from chocks away to chocks under, then this is a reasonably good book, if bland at times. (The chapters on meteorology are particularly challenging to stay awake while reading.) There is a near-complete lack of anecdote or personal observation. For a man who has flown around the globe, he has little to say. There are a few attempts at levity, but they fall painfully flat. Stewart may be a fine pilot, but he doesn't sound like he'd be interesting company at a dinner party. He makes something this exciting sound as dull as driving to work. Well, maybe to him that's what it is."},{"Title":"Flying the Big Jets","review":"In my opinion, a must read for any aviation enthusiasts, particularly those interested in the operation of widebody jet aircraft. The latter third of this book documents, in great detail, the flight of a British Airways 777 from London to Boston.

Before his name was announced fans were chanting &quot;Mailman, Mailman...&quot; That draft began a long and very good relationship with the Utah fans. Both have benefited greatly from the union. Unfortunately that part of K.M.'s story isn't in the book. Neither are a lot of things you'd like to know, such as the details of Mr. Malone's famous off-season workouts that make his workout partners puke, although it is touched on. I wanted to know how he developed it and who can keep up with him and what else he does to maintain his high durability in the modern game.Karl deserves better. I met him his rookie year and found out he was a fantastic person, able to handle fame better than most. At that early stage he could make you feel like you were very important - how many rookie NBA players can do that? I've been a huge fan ever since and I don't even like basketball much.I read the book hoping to see his development into the best power forward of all time and instead I got a bunch on newspaper clippings and vignettes on early NBA thugs.

While The Virginian has indisputably served as the model for the genre of the Western, The Rustler remains virtually unknown.Although both novels were inspired by the Johnson County massacre, The Rustler is an account sympathetic to the perspective of the small cattleman, while The Virginian takes the part of the larger cattle operations. Both novels also address, with differing conclusions, the clash between the independent Western man and the genteel Eastern woman.In this story of the stoic, competent, and fiercely independent cowboy Jim and his ill-fated love for the beautiful Hazel Clifford, McElrath offers as alternative view of the West and the standard marriage plot. In contrast to The Virginian, The Rustler points to the vunerability of the cowboy ethos and a different sort of redemption for the frivolous Eastern woman. The Rustler is also a significant example of the connection between the popular and literary traditions whereby sentimentalism, the Western, and a feminist perspective converge in surprising and fascinating ways.Little information about Frances McElrath has survived in public records, but evidence suggests that she spent part of her life in the West on cattle ranches and at army posts, and wrote The Rustler, her only novel, when she was a young woman.

She doesn't know anything about raising a child and must come to terms with it. Then Marcus Jefferson enters the picture, claiming to be the child's uncle.

Overwhelmed, Callie is just about ready to give the boy back to the authorities when Marcus Jefferson suddenly arrives, claiming to be Keeshan's uncle.In the face of Marcus' challenge, Callie realizes the strength of her ties to the little boy. Knowing she cannot simply give him to a stranger, Callie mounts a legal battle to keep Keeshan. Willing to sacrifice everything, Callie is unprepared for the strange attraction she has for Marcus. Can she let go of her own feelings long enough to do what is best for Keeshan? Is Marcus worthy of the prize Callie has to offer?My Review:I've quickly come to learn that Bette Nordberg has the uncanny ability to take any mundane, every day situation and turn it into something with substance and meaning.Callie is a single woman who runs a coffee shop and an upholstery business and is just making ends meet. Her friend, Celia, and her four-year-old son, Keeshan, rent the guest house on Callie's property. When Celia is killed, Callie is given temporary custody of Keeshan but Callie has never been around kids much and is feeling very inadequate about her skills as a caregiver to Keeshan.Just as Callie is settling into a comfortable routine with Keeshan, Marcus Jefferson happens upon the scene. Marcus is a black man and Keeshan's uncle. Here Nordberg opens the subject of interracial relationships. Callie becomes very protective of Keeshan as Marcus has applied for sole custody, but Callie also finds Marcus very attractive. However, having grown up with a racist father, the old tapes from her childhood are running through her head. Can Callie overcome her father's voice from the past? Who will win custody of little Keeshan?This is a story of accepting the detours that pop up into our lives and of learning to trust ourselves regardless of our past. I didn't want this book to end and would love to see Ms. Nordberg write a sequel!!"},{"Title":"Detours","review":"I really enjoyed reading Detours. I felt that the characters were so real. Callie was so full of life although she had a deep hurt. She cared for people. When her best friend, Celia (who rents the guesthouse on her property) was in an accident, she decides against her better judgement, to care for her 4 year-old son. Having never been a mother or around kids she feels totally inept. Slowly as she learns to care for him she finds that she is loosing her heart to him as well. They have not been able to contact any close relatives and so she is granted temporary custody. When Callie and Keeshan (the 4 year-old) finally get into a nice \\"normal\\" routine enters Marcus Jefferson. He is claiming to be the boys uncle. Callie becomes very protective of the boy but at the same time wonders about Marcus. He is very kind, polite and very handsome. They each want custody but they also want what is best for Keeshan. Marcus is renting a room from an older lady named Violet. She is longtime friends with Callie's parents. Violet loves Marcus like a son and is encouraging Marcus to pursue Callie. Will he listen to Violet? Who will win custody? and what is the mystery that surrounds Marcus? Read the book and find out.

After all the hype, I thought this was a substantial work, but it isn't. It is mostly pictures. The pictures are nice but it offers nothing, and text-wise, not enough of it for the price. I'm sorry to say this about Westpoint, but I somewhat resent being misled. It could have taken me but 5 minutes to flip through it at a bookstore to see it was not for me."},{"Title":"West Point: The First 200 Years: The First 200 Years","review":"Ugh. Another West Point coffee table book. The concept is the same as we have seen repeatedly in the past. It's a book of mainly pictures, with sound bites of ideas that can be covered in 5 pages. The result is 95% fluff, 5% something of value. It seems everyone is trying to bilk unwitting customers under the guise of doing something noble for West Point's Bicentennial. What spin. Forgive me for laughing at authors' and publishers' perceptions of altruism! I think, if they are sincere about wanting others to help them celebrate 200 years of this noble and great institution, they should pass out their books-of-celebration for FREE! Uh-oh.

In fact, that's probably the biggest impression I carry away from this book: it's very ... colorful. The text gives an adequate history of the US Military Academy, hitting on all the requisite high points: Thayer, Lee, Flipper, MacArthur, Eisenhower, Hollen, and so on. The images -- portraits, old maps, memorabilia from the USMA museum, etc -- decently illustrate the text (though the contemporary photos mixed in with the historic ones are sometimes rather *non sequitur* to what's being discussed). Among the great piles of books and videos that have been produced to observe West Point's bicentennial, I'm sure this picture book will be very popular. But I suspect it will mean more to people who didn't themselves actually attend the school. Those who did will find little that's new -- and despite the Academy's official cooperation with this production, may find the book too, well, glossy for their tastes."},{"Title":"West Point: The First 200 Years: The First 200 Years","review":"West Point is the companion volume to the PBS series that will commemorate the 200th anniversary of West Point's formal founding as America's military university. Although I have never visited West Point and have never met anyone who described being a cadet there, I had some general familiarity with West Point's past and traditions based on reading news accounts, history books and biographies of our most famous generals.West Point did a fine job of filling in the many blanks in my understanding of West Point's past. Here are some of the questions that I had wondered about that are answered in the book. Why did the British care about capturing West Point in the Revolutionary War? What was the political process that led to the establishment of having the Academy established at West Point, rather than somewhere else? How has education and training evolved at West Point? How did integration of African-American cadets proceed? Where did the hazing traditions come from? Who were the most influential superintendents? What influence did West Point graduates have on armed conflicts prior to the Civil War? What influence did West Point have outside of the U.S. Army? How was pilot training handled before the Air Force was established? Who are the famous cadets who did not pursue military careers?The United States has been well served by its commitment to and investment in military education at West Point. Reading this volume will leave you even more impressed with that point than you were when you started.I especially liked the book's candor about the very difficult problems of establishing and maintaining the quality of such an important educational institution. The early superintendents had great difficulty maintaining discipline and in overcoming political influence used to reinstate ousted cadets, and had very few resources to work with. Did you know that cadets originally had to learn French because almost all major military texts were written in that language? More recently, the difficulties of adapting to co-education, overcoming past cheating scandals, and continuing battles against hazing are all well documented.If you are like me, you will come away astonished by the positive influence that Colonel Thayer had in establishing the permanent character of the Academy during his tenure as superintendent from 1817-1833.Your sense of the Civil War will also be changed as you read about the ways that Academy classmates kept up with each other's lives and needs during and after that terrible conflict.As interesting and rewarding as the text was, I would have liked even more information. For example, military leadership in the United States seems to have greatly improved in the last ten years. What role did West Point play in this enhancement?The photographs and images captured in the book deserve enormous praise for their relevance, reproduction quality, and inherent appeal to the viewer. You will get a strong sense of place, even without ever visiting West Point. I came away with a great desire to visit during peak fall foliage to see the many buildings and landmarks illustrated in the book.What other important institutions does our nation need that it does not yet have? How can you help to see that these bodies are formed and well developed?To enjoy peace, be sure you are prepared for whatever comes your way!"},{"Title":"West Point: The First 200 Years: The First 200 Years","review":"Partly because I grew up as an Army brat, I've always been fascinated by the military and naval academies, as far back as the 1950s TV series \\"The Long Grey Line.\\" This coffee table book is a companion to a special on PBS marking the 200th anniversary of President Jefferson's founding of a military educational institution at West Point, up the Hudson from New York. It's a gorgeous piece of work, with as much attention given to the text as to the pictures, tracing the Academy from its floundering first few years, to the sixteen-year reign of Superintendent Sylvanus Thayer (the true father of the school), through the classes that supplied most of the leaders on both sides of the Civil War (who all had served together in the War with Mexico), through the long years leading up to World War I. Fifty-nine of the cadets in the Class of 1915 (\\"the Class the Stars Fell On\\") became general officers, and one became president. During the later days of the Vietnam War, cadets seldom left the school, they were so badly treated by civilians their own age, and there were several major cheating scandals -- the author doesn?t whitewash any of that stuff -- but the Academy, having revised itself almost continuously for two centuries -- seems to be coming back.

I felt for the father -- Nick Cross -- with his deep guilt over his wife's death and his fears for his son. The bad guy -- Thomas Bevin -- was just fun. Smart and evil, never a good combination. So if you're looking for a spooky, fast-moving read, this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"Scare Tactics","review":"Elizabeth Manz has done what few authors have failed to do, or maybe even attempted to do. Her leading character, Nicholas Cross, has the \\"honor\\" of being the first male to carry on and act like one of those whimpering heroines from countless romance books, who bemoans all the terrible things that have happened to him, and does little if anything about it.I'm not trying to be too hard on Ms. Manz, but Nick is not your typical hero. A successful horror writer, Nick lives in guilt for the horrible murder of his wife five years earlier. What's worse is that his twelve year old son, Jeff, was there when the murder took place, and he feels guilty about not being there when the dastardly deed took place. Now, five years later, looks like the murderer (who was never caught) is back at it again.We meet one Thomas Bevin, an egocentric who claims to be an \\"occultist,\\" which is not necessarily a psychic, but who can \\"direct\\" supernatural things.We also meet one Miriam Cramer, a spiritualist writer, one who can touch a person's hand and get psychic vibes from themm.We also meet Diane Nelson and Alan Howarth, the two detectives assigned to the case, of course Diane falls for Nick immediately and thus ensues a real problem in the story. Diane's career is obviously a tenuous one, and getting involved with such a whiny wimp as Nick, is certainly not going to further her case with her media-centered boss, Lt. Parks.The story takes off with the apparent suicide of Nick's self-proclaimed \\"best fan on earth\\"--a moonstruck 19-year old named Daniel. Daniel spends the night with the Cross family, and the next morning, is found dead in the same chair Nick's wife Linda was found mutilated and murdered. Suicide? You know better.The story piles on so many different attempted twists and turns, from the strange Bobby Tarp to the equally strange Carl Neff. But, it's a derivatively written book that neither scares nor delights. Ms. Manz has potential, but since she has written only one other book, it more than likely was never reached.NOT RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"Scare Tactics","review":"&quot;Scare Tactics&quot; is bone-chilling and creepy.

I worked out theories what might happen on the next page but I was wrong all the time.

Primarily, this was to eventually bed her, but he finally came to believe in her innocence and set out to help her prove it. Women had been his downfall, he would never love again, but his body ached for her - he had to know the truth before he would take her.The story is really quite good and the sex is hot!

A really good author I must say! A+++"},{"Title":"Fanning the Flame","review":"What I like about Kat Martin is that she can write a good, seemingly straight genre book, and take it that little bit further into something more. Here in the sequel to \`The Fire Inside', a Regency romance is thoroughly intertwined with murder, mystery and the very likely incarceration of the central female character.Jillian Whitney, well born but now broke, had found an unlikely heroic figure in her kindly guardian. Unfortunately, most of the ton interpreted their relationship as being that of a physical nature, and Jillian's reputation was in tatters. Adam Hawthorne, the wealthy Earl of Blackwood, also thinks this of the relationship, and is in the process of trying to have her switch protectors when her guardian is killed.Surprising them both with an altruistic streak, Adam takes Jillian in and offers her his protection while the murder is investigated. During this time the two get to know each other and grow closer. The situation is muddied by Jillian's now ruined reputation, the proving of her innocence, and the effect any relationship between them might have on his family.The secondary characters are as interesting as the main two, with Adam's sister Maggie's own romance and the relationship between brother and sister being an engaging secondary line to the main story.Although this book is a sequel, it stands alone as a fully fleshed out story in it's own right. If you enjoy a good murder mystery story, I'm sure you'll enjoy this tale as much as readers of Regency romance will."},{"Title":"Fanning the Flame","review":"This was the first Kat Martin book I had ever read.

Prior to this, I was never into romance books, and especially not historical romance. Heaving bosoms were not my thing. Give me a good mystery or some true crime.But after I read this book, I was hooked. I devour every Kat Martin book I can get my hands on. My mother in law and I like to go to thrift stores all the time, and I usually manage to get a ton of books for very little money, and I have found tons of Kat Martin books for about 50 cents a piece.

I find this one along with Devil's Prize and the book about Adrian Kingsland (don't remember the title) one of her best. Both hero and heroine are very attractive. Gillian is not overly temperamental like some of her other heroines. She's stoic when confronted with the prospect of being hanged for a murder she did not commit while being ostracised by the ton for her supposed liaison with the victim. Adam Harcourt is the kind of man you dream about but never meet, literally very tall, dark and handsome. He is damaged by his previous experiences with women and is distrustful of them. This makes him come accross as hard but as the novel progresses his developing love/lust for Gillian softens him. He is at once protective of Gillian and forceful in his erotic intentions towards her.

Their proximity & time together brings on an affair. But the lack of other suspects & Hero's jaded view about women become major obstacles to their r/s.This was not as exciting as other Martin books. The pace was slow & story predictable. Romance was only ok. The main characters lacked zest &, therefore, the romance did too. Heroine was dependent, too amenable, & weak-willed. She wasn't over the top but the elements were there. Hero didn't trust himself with his love choices & this theme gets repeated A LOT during the book. What made it worse was his frequent regrets for succumbing to sexual intimacy with heroine. It made him look weak & insecure about himself. Sexual chemistry & sex scenes were fine. Emotional pull was on the flat side.A mediocre recommendation."},{"Title":"Fanning the Flame","review":"I've read almost all of Kat Martin books.

Couldn't put them down."},{"Title":"Fanning the Flame","review":"This was a very good read and would have been near-perfect if not for a few little things which always drive me crazy in historical romances (details below, because some of them are slight spoilers). The murder mystery that is weaved throughout was not painfully obvious, as you sometimes find, and I liked how it was solved and what the explanation ended up being. There was a secondary romance between Maggie, Adam's sister, and Garth Dutton, Jillian's lawyer and standing alone, the romance was good, well-developed, etc., but personally I don't usually like romance sub-plots with other characters and in this case, it really drove me crazy because _____ (spoiler, so see specifics below to know more).Setting: England, 1806Sensuality Rating: 8.5 (a lot of chemistry between hero and heroine, very hot kissing scenes and well-written erotica)SUMMARY (from the back cover):\\"The London ton is abuzz with the latest scandal. Jillian Whitney, well-born but penniless, has been living under the roof of a wealthy nobleman old enough to be her father. When Adam Hawthorne, the mysterious Earl of Blackwood, meets the lovely rebel, he's intrigued enough to want to lure her into changing protectors.Suddenly, Jillian's beloved guardian is murdered, and she is the only suspect. Forced to flee, she falls into the arms of the earl, who offers refuge from the law but no escape from an intoxicating passion. Although Jillian swiftly loses her heart, she knows that the eligible earl would never marry a woman tainted by scandal. But is Jillian underestimating the strength and depth of a man's passion?\\"SPECIFICS:(* = kind-of-spoiler; ** = spoiler)(1) I liked that Jillian was an independent woman and able to stand her ground and hold her head high despite the rumors surrounding her regarding Lord Fenwick. Adam was one of those wonderfully-handsome tortured and untrusting heroes just trying to hide his vulnerability, ::sigh::. Jillian seemed to succumb quite easily to him - over and over again!, though I don't blame her - but the erotic scenes were very well written and in the end she proves her strength.*(2) Adam's unwillingness to bend regarding Christopher's possible parentage and his initial treatment of the boy was not at all in keeping with his otherwise honorable character.*(3) I CANNOT stand when authors find it amusing to fill their books with constant misunderstandings and things left unsaid or misinterpreted. I thought I was in the clear with this book: I was on page 337, the murder mystery has been solved and now all that was left were the love realizations, marriage declarations, and the usual wonderful happy ending that we all read these books for, right? Wrong! One last obstacle must be thrown in our lovers' paths - of course!**(4) Regarding the secondary romance between Maggie and Garth, the reason it really soured for me was because in this case it ended up negatively impacting the primary romance and causing the entire misunderstanding. (Garth is from a very prestigious family that puts a lot of weight on being scandal-free; Adam's family is scandal-ridden and his recent harboring of a murder suspect - Jillian - just adds to it all. The fact that he now intends to marry her makes it even worse). Maggie wasn't completely to blame, because she doesn't ask Aunt Sophie to speak with Jillian - doesn't even know their meeting occurs - but still, she should have openly spoken about it with Garth and shown much more sadness and regret over Jillian's rejection of Adam.**(5) The thing I do have to commend Martin about regarding the words-unspoken/mistunderstanding debacle is that when Jillian goes to Adam because she knows he's planning on proposing and she lies to him, telling him she's in love with someone else and is going to marry that man, Adam responds so amazingly that it was all I could do not to say \\"awww\\" out loud. He's so heartbroken, but he's willing to give her up because he thinks that is what Jillian wants: \\"For the first time in his life he understood the true meaning of love. He understood that when you really loved someone, you cared about their happiness more than you did your own.\\"BOTTOM LINE:Read it! A wonderful Kat Martin book that I will definitely reread ... though maybe I'll skip pages 343-380 from now on."},{"Title":"Fanning the Flame","review":"Fanning the Flame by Kat Martin has a mix of mystery, romance and bad luck.

Good romance and great plot make a good combo."},{"Title":"Fanning the Flame","review":"Although it was an okay book, it was not really very memorable. I actually got half-way through the book the second time before I realized it was in the wrong pile and should be with the already-read books.Jillian is accused of murdering her father's friend who has taken her in when she has no family of her own left. When she is discovered over the bloody body, she panics and runs. Luckily Adam runs into her and is willing to take her in and help her find the real murderer. So the usual story ensues- he's bitter over a past betrayal, she falls in love with him but knows marriage is not an option.

Fanning the Flames is certainly fun, but it's not the best of her offers. The characters are witty, so although the stories a bit thin, there's enough there to hold the interest."},{"Title":"Fanning the Flame","review":"In 1806 Earl Adam Hawthorne finds himself attracted to Jillian Whitney though she is reportedly the mistress of a codger old enough to be her grandfather, the Earl of Fenwick. Gossip aside, Jillian is a penniless innocent all alone except for Fenwick taking her in and caring for her as if she really is his ward; her sire was a close friend of his until he died.Adam hears a shot and almost immediately finds he holds a shocked Jillian in his arms. Jillian tells him that someone killed Fenwick with a servant accusing her of the deed. To avoid prison she begs Adam to hide her, which he does. As they fall in love, a war wages within his mind as he wonders if once again a deceitful female has used her wiles to trick him. Still he desperately seeks proof of her innocence in the homicide as easily as he learned how innocent she was in the boudoir.Though the return of lead characters from previous tales add a feel of homecoming for Kat Martin fans, the well written FANNING THE FLAME is an exciting but by the numbers Regency romantic suspense. The story line entertains the audience, but has no twists even with the amateur sleuth investigation. Jillian is a desperate damsel in distress while Adam is a brooding cynic skeptical about her yet unable not to be her knight in muted armor. Regency purists will applaud Ms. Martin's likable tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Fanning the Flame","review":"Despite being hailed as a regency-era intrigue, the latest from Kat Martin - Fanning the Flames clearly bolsters itself on the strength of the romance and passion. Besides suffering from infernal phantasm of carnage in Egypt, war-veteran Lord Adam Blackwood is haunted by past betrayals of his heart by two faithless women. He detaches himself from love when it unexpectedly arrives in the form of Lady Jillian Whitney who is the ward of the old earl of Fenwick. When Fenwick is murdered and Jillian is held as the prime suspect, chivalry prompts Adam to save her from the gallows - but could he be rescuing the murderer? The promising sypnosis deceptively plunges you to a plot full of intrigue then gravely disappoints you when the mystery is left undeveloped with a few suspects thrown in. It is thus a hoax to connect the would-be lovers together and erhm, fan the flames with blossoming passion. The intrigue is brittle - and Ms. Martin's much-too contemporary narration lacks the intricate flair of the regency period. So the weight of the story gravitates to the romance. It is thus fortunate that the characters Jillian and Adam have enough heart and emotional intensity. They catalyze this feeble plot-line with sincerity and scorching passion right through the heart-twisting epilogue that sprouts redemption and forgiveness."},{"Title":"Fanning the Flame","review":"I had been waiting to read this book. I was not disappointed. It was a great book. I ended up reading it in one 24 hour period, stuck at an airport hotel. one thing I love about Kat Martin's writing, is that she reintroduces you to old characters and always has a cute secondary romance in the pages of her books.

MY PARROT, MY FRIEND by B.M. Doane will not answer all your questions, but it will give you a broad overview of what to expect from various types of parrots. As the owner of ten parrots, I found little of specific interest about my own birds, I must rely on specialty books for that. However, if you know nothing, you will not know which specialty book to buy. For example, are you thinking about a small bird or a large bird? The author discusses generalized personality traits forgenuses of Psittadaceae( parrot family). Did you know that \\"budgies\\" (a.k.a. parakeets) and love birds were types of parrots?Coloration, characteristics such as an affectionate nature, and length of life differ across parrot genuses. According to Doane, while most Cockatoos like to be handled, most Cockatiels are not interested in human affection. The specially bred colors such as Lutino Cockatiels may not live as long as birds with the natural coloration. Budgies are most susceptible to cancer (all of them are predisposed to it apparently) and thus most budgies have relatively short life spans.

I contemplated on whether or not to give this book a two, or a one star rating. As I sit with my own copy in my lap and peruse through it I find that the first 1/3 of the book is filled with hardly-changing basic facts, like how long it takes for macaw chicks to fledge. Good general stuff to know. As I kept looking I found that the other 2/3 of the book had nothing but outdated, conflicting, confusing, and outright medieval concepts about how behavior works and what actions get the best results. And for that I christened it with a single star, too bad.When I was younger I adored this book, it claimed to have all the answers and I was determined to know it all. But now that I am older and a bit wiser I know better...One of the many examples that I am horrified with is the book's consistent encouragement to use flooding techniques. On pages 179-190 the author uses the system of \\"PRPT, Parrot Responsive Phase of Training\\" which gloatingly basks in the ideas of flooding (the first instance of this that is encouraged is her way of \\"teaching\\" birds not to bite).But the first thing she wants you to teach to your new bird? Towels are scary things. Draping a bird with a towel and grabbing it from its cage to toss it on a perch for daily training (like how not to bite) is ridiculous. Whatever happened to building a bond up with the animal stress-free and quickly via target training? This is an outdated read indeed.There are many problems contained in this book but it's not worth my time to discuss it here.

It was very long, and the style of writing didn't jive too well with me. Of course, I don't know who I am to criticize Cardinal Newman. I still would recommend this to those wanting a fuller understanding of how tradition develops, but I like Congar's book \\"The Meaning of Tradition\\" a lot better. Shorter, more readable, and to the point."},{"Title":"An essay on the development of Christian doctrine","review":"John H. Newman wrote four magisterial works (not including his large body of sermons) of which this Essay is one of the most important and influential. It is perhaps the most accessible of J.H.N.'s works, and the most significant.The problem that Newman wants to resolve is how can Christian doctrine develop, if, as is commonly believed, Jesus embodied all revelation, once and for all. Another way of attacking the same problem is to determine how certain doctrines not stated in an overt manner in the Bible (e.g., purgatory) can be shown to be a licit and legitimate development based on scriptural integrity. Newman doesn't hold the view that the Bible itself is the only form of revelation, but he does hold the view that subsequent development of doctrine cannot repudiate biblical statements. Broadly and coherently developed, Newman shows that development of Christian doctrine under certain restrictions is both necessary and fundamental to the Christian dispensation.Where Newman is less convincing is with more recent papal doctrines like the immaculate conception and the assumption of the blessed Virgin Mary. While these latter two doctrines have different aetiologies, one clearly developed in a manner consistent with scripture while the other is plainly contradictory. The Assumption (or else, Dormition, Glorification, etc.) of Mary has very ancient traditions and is the manifestation of the doctrine of our own glorification on the Last Great Day. Conversely, the immaculate conception was determined by Thomas Aquinas, the angelic doctor and preeminent theologian of the church, to be inconsistent with the sacred deposit once and forever revealed and directly contradicted by scripture.What do these two doctrines have to do with Newman's book? Newman wants to insist the doctrine continues to &quot;evolve&quot; or &quot;develop,&quot; but that this growth, be be licit and legitimate, must be consistent with the initial sacred deposit once received, and that this development must grow organically out of that which the Church has inherited and must not be a novation or innovation. The doctrine of Papal primacy has likewise remained consistent with some form of belief from the Church's earliest beliefs, but the notion of papal &quot;supremacy&quot; is of recent origin and not consistent with scripture or church history. Both papal supremacy and the immaculate conception are at odds with the Church's earliest positions, was repudiated in the Middle Ages, and is contrary to Scripture's insistence.So Newman's task is a difficult one. He wants to defend the Roman tradition, but the Roman tradition, especially as it embarked on the nineteenth century, created a few novations that and innovations it heretofore had repudiated. Newman, I think, succeeds in walking this fine line of showing how the sacred deposit fully and for all time singularly received does develop over time by the synthesis of episcopal collegiality, consensus fidelium, sacred scripture, and venerable tradition. Newman's hermeneutic allows for the Spirit to breathe multiple understandings of the same ostensible dogma in such a way as to be said to &quot;grow,&quot; but it remains consistent with the original deposit through the four-fold synthesis through which the Holy Spirit operates.Where a chasm occurs is with doctrinal novations, such as the immaculate conception and papal supremacy. The dogma of the immaculate conception is not only INCONSISTENT and INCOHERENT, it is also CONTRARY, to the received tradtions; likewise, the magisterial belief in the primacy of the Petrine See having been remade into the supremacy of Papal infallibility. In all candor, it is Newman who remains consistent, while the Church that has breached its historical deposit.Newman, except for these two important exceptions, shows how development of doctrine is not only consistent, but necessary, over time. To keep the Church static in one solitary interpretation or understanding is to deny the Church's variety of charisms. Perhaps more importantly, to deny an evolving and developing plethora of understandings is to stifle the Third Person of the Most Holy Trinity, which is the Person guiding and governing the Church since Pentecost, from expressing its kerygmatic and paraclitic mission.These exceptions set aside, this wonderful book can be profitably read by all Christians of all stripes to great personal and collegial benefit and enlightenment."},{"Title":"An essay on the development of Christian doctrine","review":"Before I begin my review, allow me one caveat: the casual reader, to be sure, who stumbles upon this work after seeing it quoted in popular apologetics books (i.e. Keating's Catholicism and Fundamentalism), risks being in over his/her head completely. Such was the case with me about 3 and a half years ago when I was starting out my study of doctrine and history. For 3 years this book sat on my shelf, all attemts that I made to read it having failed because I lacked the proper foundation. It was only after I spent considerable time studying history and especially the ancient heresies that I was able to grasp what Newman was saying. The following example, taken from a passage found on pages 314-315, should demonstrate my point:\\"It is very observable that, ingenious as is their theory and sometimes perplexing to a disputant, the Monophysites never could shake themselves free of the Eutychians; and though they could draw intelligible lines on paper between the two doctrines, yet in fact by a hidden fatality their partisans were ever running into or forming alliance with the anathematized extreme. Thus Peter the Fuller the Theopaschite (Eutychian), is at one time in alliance with Peter the Stammerer, who advocated the Henoticon (which was Monophysite). The Acephali, though separating from the latter Peter for that advocacy, and accused by Leontius of being Gaianites (Eutychians), are considered by Facundus as Monophysites. Timothy the Cat, who is said to have agreed with Dioscorus and Peter the Stammerer, who signed the Henoticon, that is, with two Monophysite Patriarchs, is said nevertheless, according to Anastasius, to have maintained the extreme tenet, that \\"the Divinity is the sole nature of Christ.\\" Severus, according to Anastasius, symbolized with the Phantasiasts (Eutychians), yet he is more truly, according to Leontius, the chief doctor and leader of the Monophysites. And at one time there was an union, though temporary, between the Theodosians (Monophysites) and the Gaianites.\\"That being said...The premise of this book is to examine the developments of doctrine that have occured both within and without the Catholic Church since the earliest times. In the earlier part of the book, Newman spends considerable time discussing the methods used by the Anglican Divines to discern developments from corruptions, and shows how their methodology is flawed, and how in many cases they rejected things which had more early concensus than things they accepted.Other points he makes throughout the book is the treatment of the Catholic church by the various heretical sects and dissident groups. He shows how despite their disagreements with each other, they were usually united in opposition to the Catholic Church, using the same blasphemous phrases to describe her as the Reformers did and many Protestants continue to this day, while the latter group would generally accept the body accused of these things as orthodox in earlier times.After his rather long introduction, so to speak, Newman lays out his seven principles which will serve to distinguish developments from corruptions: 1. Preservation of Type, 2. Continuity of Principles, 3. Assimilative Power, 4. Logical Sequence, 5. Anticipation of its Future, 6. Conservative Action on its Past, and 7. Chronic Vigour. Newman then goes on to examine each of these in detail (though the first 4 are examined in far greater detail than the latter 3), showing how doctrinal developments in the Catholic Church throughout history, as well of those proposed by groups deemed heretical, have fared when these 7 principles are applied to them.The details of his agruments are covered well in other reviews, and indeed a thorough examination of them cannot be done justice here in my 1,000 word limit. Suffice to say that this book will be guaranteed to give the informed reader, be he symathetic or skeptical, something to ponder seriously, as this is indeed the most comprehensive work written on the subject of the development of doctrine."},{"Title":"An essay on the development of Christian doctrine","review":"That might sound like an exaggeration but I am serious. There is no book in print that I am aware of that discusses this most crucial of areas in the Christian revelation with the degree of nuance and thoroughness then this work of John Henry Newman's does. One of the founders (and the soul) behind the Oxford Movement in England in the 1830's and early 1840's, Dr. Newman's research into Church history troubled him because he did not realize how far the Church of England had drifted in essence and principles from those of the early Church. Newman examines the different distinctions between the beliefs held by Catholics, the Eastern Churches, and Protestants and seeks to show through the records of history - both what they reveal and what they conceal - how to distinguish between &quot;developments&quot; of Revelation and &quot;corruptions.&quot; The major doctrines of the different Christian churches are looked at with an eye towards explaining how often what appears to be an &quot;addition&quot; to the Christian faith is but a development or a greater understanding in an explicit manner of what was held in earlier times implicitly. These are properly termed &quot;developments.&quot; Likewise, many beliefs that are taken as &quot;givens&quot; by Christians are shown to be anything but &quot;givens&quot; in terms of their relationship to the ancient Church or their profound absence from it in any form explicitly or implicitly (the latter are properly styled as &quot;corruptions of Revelation&quot;, &quot;inventions&quot;, or &quot;traditions of men&quot;). Undoubtedly the conclusions drawn will not make everyone happy of course. But then who said that the purpose of Truth was to conform itself to the individual whims of man? Rather, man must conform his views to that which is true. I firmly believe that this is the one book that every Christian honestly in search of the Truth should read and read again meditating upon its contents. A wonderful work by one of the most brilliant minds of the 19th century (or indeed any century) by a man who was as deeply spiritual as he was brilliant."},{"Title":"An essay on the development of Christian doctrine","review":"There are many books, indeed series, which attempt to account for the development of the Early Church, and how things became settled over the centuries. There are far fewer people who have any sense of these things. Newman treats these issues with utmost seriousness, and challenges long-held beliefs, and inverts those who are upside down in their faith and practice. Newman's compedium knowledge of the early Church helps him to distill the plethora of works into an easy-to-read single volume. This is ONE of those rare books that every Christian should be required to read. The past is explained as a venture toward the future. Newman's style is at his usual best."},{"Title":"An essay on the development of Christian doctrine","review":"The sainted Cardinal Newman's &quot;Essay&quot; is a masterpiece, one of the few books of it's kind. This work, which was undertaken by him while he was in the process of deciding to convert to Roman Catholicism, is based upon a simple premise - that the nature of the human intellect is to grasp the full implications of an idea or set of related ideas slowly, over time, by a process of development. Because of this, any set of formal doctrines held to by a body of believers will necessarily grow and *apparently* change over time, in just the same way that a human being gorws and changes over the span of a lifetime. However, just as the human being is physiologically and metaphysically identical with himself over the course of his life, so too will be the body of doctrine and the standards of practice given to the faithful, provided it is guarded from corruption by a teaching authority insured from error.N.B. - this is *not* the same thing as saying that revelation must be ongoing. The faith itself may be delivered once and for all, in it's entirety. What needs time to develop, and what can never be truly completed, is the systematic exposition of what that faith means, and why it is so rather than otherwise. For example, that there is a God is an article of the Creed that can be communicated once and adhered to forever. But why there should be a God, and only one rather than five or six, and why that God should have such attributes as He is said to possess - these matters are the doctrines that are historical and developmental, and each of them will in turn raise more questions that will need to be answered. Revelation is finished, but theology, the explanation of revelation, is a continuously growing enterprise.Newman's book does not stop at these abstract considerations, which, after all, could apply to any religion built on a alleged revelation. It proceeds to examine the specific points of controversy between Protestants and Catholics as to whether or not the Catholic faith or the Protestant faith is the authentic inheritor of the Apostlic community. Needless to say, it comes down on the side of Rome. The only real flaw in these detailed portions of the book is the lack of specific footnotes for the points Newman cites in the Fathers of the Church. The editions he used, or course, would be long out of print, but it would still be useful to know what portion of St. Basil's or St. Augustine's texts he was quoting from.If you are interested in the history of Christian dogma, orare looking for a highly erudite Catholic apologetic, this is a fine book to own."},{"Title":"An essay on the development of Christian doctrine","review":". . .of an outstanding work.This is it. This is the book which, upon its completion, convinced John Henry Newman that he needed to make his submission to the Catholic Church.This painstakingly researched book describes the historical process by which doctrine develops in the Church. It has, in the years since its publication, become the primary text for anyone wishing to study this subject, regardless of their denominational background.Unfortunately, the typical response to this book, by Christians of other denominations, is NOT to actually engage the specific points raised by Newman, but rather to attack Newman's person and character. This was true while Newman was alive, and remains true to this day. (The notable exception is Adolph von Harnak, who, while sharply disagreeing with Newman, actually did engage the concept of doctrinal development itself).An interesting historical note: The Catholic Church was, at first, not particularly sympathetic to this work, as it was not written in Latin, nor in the fashion of Catholic theological works of the day.This edition, with a forward by Ian Ker, is, for me, the preferred volume. Ker is noted world-wide as being a top Newman scholar - and his scholarship shows in this work."},{"Title":"An essay on the development of Christian doctrine","review":"Cardinal Newman's piece remains the definitive work on the development of Christianity. As Christianity is a historical religion, it is essential that Christians know the history behind their religion. This is the book to discover that history! Far too many Christians today are ahistorical about their own beliefs, which causes much confusion and theological error. This work is the perfect starting point for understanding authentic Christian doctrine. I can't recommend it more. It is a must."},{"Title":"An essay on the development of Christian doctrine","review":"This is the eighth (and final) edition of \\"An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine\\" by John Henry Cardinal Newman from 1878, which includes \\"various important alterations... in the arrangement of its separate parts, and some, not indeed in its matter, but in its text.\\" It was while the first edition of the work was in the process of being published in 1845 that Newman converted to Catholicism; \\"it was his intention and wish to have carried his Volume through the Press before deciding finally on this step. But when he had got some way in the printing, he recognized in himself a conviction of the truth of the conclusion to which the discussion leads, so clear as to supersede, further deliberation.\\"Newman's conversion was inevitable, as evidenced in the Introduction where he writes the lines chilling to any Christian not in communion with Rome:\\"History is not a creed or a catechism, it gives lessons rather than rules; still no one can mistake its general teaching in this matter, whether he accept it or stumble at it. Bold outlines and broad masses of colour rise out of the records of the past. They may be dim, they may be incomplete; but they are definite. And this one thing at least is certain; whatever history teaches, whatever it omits, whatever it exaggerates or extenuates, whatever it says and unsays, at least the Christianity of history is not Protestantism. If ever there were a safe truth, it is this.\\"He follows just a few sentences later with his oft-quoted aphorism: \\"To be deep in history is to cease to be a Protestant.\\"This work is divided into two parts and the first, \\"Doctrinal Developments Viewed in Themselves\\", takes up the first third of the book. Here, Newman looks at the question of development in and of itself: How do ideas develop? What kind of developments take place? Can we expect some kind of authority to referee these developments, and would that authority have to be infallible if we're dealing with Divine Revelation - and what form would that authority take?Newman backs up his answers to these questions with the historical record and, importantly, with holy writ:\\"the Kingdom of Heaven\\" is even compared to \\"a grain of mustard-seed... which indeed is the least of all seeds, but when it is grown it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree\\" it \\"shooteth out great branches, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof... so is the kingdom of God... the seed should spring and grow up... for the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself.\\"So how is true development discerned from heresy or innovation? The answer is the subject of Part 2, \\"Doctrinal Developments Viewed Relatively to Doctrinal Corruptions\\"; and wherein the first part is plodding by necessity of its establishing a proof, it is here in the second part where Newman excels as an exegete, an historian, and a writer. It's all the reader can do to keep up as he traces the bark of Peter through the secular currents and heresies which buffeted it from its inception. Historical fact, holy writ, and right reason are woven together in a fascinating depiction of the growth of Christianity using seven measures or \\"notes\\" of authenticity. True doctrinal development will:1. Preserve its Type2. show a Continuity of its Principles3. demonstrate Its Power of Assimilation4. have a Logical Sequence5. be able to Anticipate its Future6. Conserve its Past Actions7. all while exhibiting Chronic VigourMostly through the words of ante- and post- Nicene Fathers and the Heresiarchs that challenged them - or provided the grit that produced the pearl of great price, to view them another way - Newman builds a convincing case that the Catholic is indeed the Church Christ founded, and that Protestants have stripped it bare looking for a Church that never existed. I highly recommend this work to all Christians; it will confirm Catholics in their Faith, and raise some serious questions for Protestants and hopefully spur them to further investigation."},{"Title":"An essay on the development of Christian doctrine","review":"Newman's \\"Essay\\" is an in depth attempt to justify - historically, theologically, and philosophically - his movement to Roman Catholicism. He converted shortly after this volume was published. This is not for easy beach reading - and the Victorian prose can at times be tortured and burdensome - but there's much, much here that warrants the effort. Newman's nutshell is his attempt to provide a rationale for the development of doctrines distinctive of Roman Catholicism that don't seem to have existed explicitly in the Early Church. Newman's thesis is that all doctrines that have developed (e.g. purgatory, the Papacy, a celibate priesthood, etc.) existed in implicit \\"seed\\" form early on as part of the apostolic tradition and only came to fruition in the face of controversy and heresy. (One could perhaps include the doctrines of Christology and the Trinity along with the Canon of Scripture).

It was his intention and wish to have carried this Volume through the Press before deciding finally on this step. But... he recognized in himself a conviction... so clear as to supersede further deliberation... His first act on his conversion was to offer his Work for revision to the proper authorities; but the offer was declined on the ground that it was written and partly printed before he was a Catholic, and that it would come before the reader in a more persuasive form, if he read it as the author wrote it.\\"In his Introduction, he states, \\"the Christianity of history is not Protestantism. If ever there were a safe truth, it is this.\\" (Pg. 7) He states that the book is directed towards the difficulty that, \\"from the nature of the human mind, time is necessary for the full comprehension and perfection of great ideas... This may be called the Theory of Development of Doctrine.\\" (Pg. 29-30)He concludes that \\"We have no reason to suppose that there is so great a distinction of dispensation between ourselves and the first generation of Christians, as that they had a living infallible guidance, and we have not.\\" (Pg. 85) Later, he suggests that \\"the notion of development under infallible authority is not a ... less winning hypothesis... then the chance coincidence of events... or the working of Antichrist, to account for the rise of Christiantity and the formation of its theology.\\" (Pg. 92)He admits that in Church history there have been \\"Bishops against Bishops, Fathers against Fathers, Fathers against themselves,\\" but asks instead \\"whether... the Church herself, acting through Pope or Council... has ever contradicted her own enunciations. If so, the hypothesis which I am advocating is at once shattered; but, till I have positive and distinct evidence of the fact, I am slow to give credence to the existence of so great an improbability.\\" (Pg. 120-121)He concludes that if the whole of Christendom is to form one Kingdom, \\"one head is essential\\"; he then adds, \\"wherever the Pope has been renounced, decay and division have been the consequence.\\" (Pg. 154-155) His summary statement is perhaps this: \\"modern Catholicism is nothing else but simply ... the natural and necessary development, of the doctrine of the early church, and that its divine authority is included in the divinity of Christianity.\\" (Pg. 169)Obviously, this book is far too complex to cover within the confines of an Amazon review.

If the book is not fun, then I at least want to be presented with a story that makes me think. \\"The Green Brain\\" did not fulfill either purpose adequately in spite of the fact that the verbal creativity used to described various landscapes was inventive and the character development is quite good.It was not a fun read because, though you do come to know the characters (and you do feel empathy for their desperate circumstances) you don't find yourself admiring them or respecting them. None of the three main characters (Joao, Rhin, and Chin-Lhu) are principled people and, in this respect, the book does not uplift.Neither was the book insightful. Without giving it away, the main \\"message\\" (which is summarized in the last chapter) is quite underwhelming and is a bit of a stretch given the story that was presented to support it. Though the internal dialogue of Chen-Lhu provided one an opportunity to refect on Machiavellian doctrines, still, it was not necessarily uplifting or insightful. In fact, it was more frustrating than anything else (which may have been intended). But, if you intend to frustrate without providing insight, you are not giving the reader a very good reason to read your story.I do not recommend that you read this book. The story will not go where you may anticipate it going. The beginning is very promising and the journey of Joao, Rhin, and Chen-Lhu is involving but the two segments of the book don't feel very well connected. A good amount of tension and anticipation is built for a resolution but the last chapter of the book feels so different from the rest of the story that it leave one feeling dissatisfied. Finally, there is a general lack of morality within the main characters and this cements my inability to recommend this book.

As the insects are faced with extinction, mutations appear that are better able to combat the new threat. Things get pretty strange, but this is by no means a bad thing.Oh no! A *CHIGGER* has appeared inside of the insect-free zone! By the way, the chigger is half a meter long and spits acid. Yes, I realize that that is technically impossible. Don't worry: technicalities like that are taken care of.Anyway, it gets better. The insects have also managed to copy the human idea of INTELLIGENCE--hence the title of the book.The introduction and exploration of these ideas are done admirably during the first half of the novel. Then, around the half-way point, the whole tone and direction of the story changes. And this is when it gets REALLY good. The final chapters are composed of pages and pages of description. Sound boring, does it? Not in the least. This is the best description I have ever read in my life. The mood is perhaps described best as &quot;Poe-esque&quot;--subtle psychological descriptions that pull you right into the story, make you really understand how the characters feel. It takes you right along with the characters, providing real empathy, fear, love, anger and understanding all the way. Of course, it's more than JUST description. The Master brings so much into the writing in ways that only he can do. There's just no way to describe it--like everything Frank Herbert, you need to read it for yourself to know what it's like. I didn't really like the very last chapter, but I suppose nine out of ten ain't too bad.The philosophical theme of the story is basically deep ecology or something similar to it. Herbert really shows his conservationist side in this one. Also, a lot of it kind of reminds me of Nietzche.This is a very short novel (208 pages), but every page Frank Herbert writes is worth ten pages written by a lesser author.

One of the big themes of Dune is, of course, ecology. In The Green Brain, Herbert explores ecology in another setting - the jungles of a future Brazil, on Earth. In this future Brazil, the humans are trying to eliminate all insects in an effort to decrease disease and increase food production (they will keep some bees around to pollinate the crops). Needless to say, this is an ecological disaster in the making. And the bugs find a rather unique way to fight back - they develop a group brain that is every bit as bright (or brighter) than the humans. But the Green Brain does not want to fight a war with humans - it wants to find a way to communicate with them, and get them to stop the destruction of the ecosystem that all life depends upon.Herbert has some really interesting ideas here, but the short length of the work prevents him from fully developing them. He also does not fully develop the three main characters (a Brazilian who fights the bugs on the front line, a beautiful Irish entomologist who also acts as a seductive spy, and a Chinese scientist who helped eliminate insects in China with very bad results). I was particularly puzzled on what the Chinese man's motivations were, as he knew what happened in China was a disaster, yet still pushing for the destruction of insects in Brazil.Great ideas, but simply not fully developed..."},{"Title":"The Green Brain","review":"I am a huge fan of Frank Herbert's work.

Unfortunately this pace stalls at thehalfway point (and this is actually a novella rather than anovel, so the disappointment hits home quite soon!),and the remainder of the story quite literally floats,and floats... and floats away to a memorablebut ultimately unsatisfying and abrupt ending.The Green Brian suffers from its sketchy conception and rushed,slap-dash execution. This is a shame because the basic idea,setting, characters and themes had so much potential.Frank could also have availed us a small glossaryfor all those Spanish/South American titles and terms he constantly used here.Obviously his pot had boiled over in the middle 60's,with so many projects cooking - not to mention theincomparable Dune and its still nascent sequel.Nonetheless,in the hands of a decent film script writer(or is that an oxymoron?)an updated and more fully developed version of this story's plot and characters would make a very interesting, intelligent and exciting science fiction movie...Something rarely ever accomplished.

It's fun and well worth the reading."},{"Title":"Archbishop Mowll","review":"I chose to read this book because every time I've heard Archbishop Mowll spoken of in Australian history, it has been in reverent tones. I now understand something of why.For those who don't know who Mowll was, he was Anglican Archbishop of Sydney from 1934-1958, a regular acquaintance of the Royal Family, and the man who first invited Billy Graham to Australia in 1958. When he died that same year, 150,000 people lined the streets of Sydney to farewell him.Of course I'm not at all sympathetic to Anglicanism on a number of points. Still, it is historically undeniable that the Evangelical strand of the Anglican church has championed the gospel for centuries and given us such men as Hugh Latimer, Isaac Watts, John Newton, Charles Wesley, George Whitefield, and Charles Simeon not to mention such more recent figures as C. S. Lewis, John Stott, Alister McGrath, Iain Murray, Phillip Jensen, Peter Jensen, etc.I was particularly interested in Mowll because the Sydney diocese of the Anglican church is among the most conservative in the world. It seems to me that the Anglicans in this diocese hold tenaciously to the fundamentals of the faith, are aggressively evangelistic, and are perhaps the leading Evangelical publishers in Australia. That is, in some significant part, the legacy of Archbishop Mowll.Mowll was born in England and trained at Cambridge before working for some years in Canada and then serving as a bishop in China for a decade before taking up the position of Archbishop of Sydney, and later Primate of Australia.Mowll seemed to gain the respect of ministers all across Australia and indeed around the world. He spent much of his life travelling covering five continents in a time when travel was not as simple as it is today. He ministered on the Canadian frontier, was held for ransom in China, and served as a military chaplain in World War I. His gifts were used by God to keep Sydney a strongly Evangelical diocese. Mowll went to great pains to build and protect the autonomy of the diocese in theological matters so that their position would not be dictated through the hierarchy.There is much more worth sharing about this man's life, but I'll content myself to recommend this biography heartily and close with one incident which occurred after Mowll's death. It had been, as mentioned above, Mowll who first invited Billy Graham to hold a crusade in Australia in 1959. It is said that Mowll was the only man capable of uniting Sydney's churches for such an event. Mowll passed away before Graham arrived, but when Graham did arrive, he said he'd never been in a city where the influence of one man--Archbishop Mowll--was so powerfully evident.I rejoiced as I read to see how God used Howard Mowll for the furtherance and preservation of the gospel in Australia."},{"Title":"The Annotated Mother Goose","review":"An outstanding book for those interested in the origins and meanings of the old nursery rhymns and tales.

One question that arose is this: Is Windelband's history of philosophy accurate as far as his systematizing the entire process of philosophy, how each philosophical system sublates the former. Surely there are connections, but then surely not.In Windelband's view, Socrates leads to Plato (Idealism) that leads to Aristotle (Realism) and then back to idealist, such as Descartes, who leads to Hume (the everyday view of science, which is Realism) and then so on to Kant and Hegel's Idealsm in a very closed system of necessity. This is highly suspect for many reasons too protracted for this review--and because I have forgotten the real arguments.If I had to suggest reading either Windelband or Coppelston for a history of philosophy, it would be Coppelston hands down. But Windelband is interesting and worth the read if you have time. It can only add to an understanding of what and how philosophy forms and how it has helped lead to science also.

Moore, with a full dozen stories published plus three fine novels (\\"The Fairy Chessmen,\\" \\"Valley of the Flame\\" and \\"The Dark World\\"), and in 1947, sci-fi's preeminent husband-and-wife writing team continued its prolific ways. Before the year was out, the two had succeeded in placing another 15 stories into the pulp magazines of the day, in addition to the novel for which Kuttner is best remembered: \\"Fury.\\" A classic of Golden Age sci-fi, \\"Fury\\" originally appeared in the May, June and July issues of \\"Astounding Science-Fiction\\" under one of the pair's many pseudonyms, Lawrence O'Donnell. The story goes that legendary editor John W. Campbell needed a quick novel from the team, and that Part 1 of the serialized novel was in print before the story was even close to being finished. \\"Fury\\" was finally released in book form in 1950. Though hurriedly composed, the tale betrays no signs of its rushed origins, and is indeed an elegantly written (I love that line about libation inducing libration), fast-moving novel that is nevertheless multigenerational and epic in scope. It tells the story of the Landside colonization of Venus in the 27th century, long after Earth has been destroyed by atomic wars. Mankind now lives in Venusian undersea cities known as Keeps, as the surface of the planet is virtually uninhabitable, with deadly forms of plant and animal life in riotous abundance. The book's hero (or should I say \\"antihero\\"?), Sam Harker, is born into one of the families of Immortals that rule the Keeps. When his mother dies during childbirth, Sam's enraged father has the infant genetically altered so that he looks nothing like the tall, graceful folk of the Immortal clans. Sam grows up in foster care, with no knowledge of his background, his heritage, or even the fact that he will probably live to be 1,000 years old. The story of how Sam climbs up the criminal ladder, inadvertently becomes one of the most despised and influential men on Venus, and ultimately causes mankind to migrate out of the undersea Keeps, is the story of \\"Fury,\\" a book whose title refers not only to the vengeful force inherent in its lead character, but to the Landside Venusian environment as well.But a capsule description of \\"Fury\\"'s plot really doesn't do the book justice; it's like saying that \\"Gone With the Wind\\" is a story about a Civil War gal trying to get her house back. Kuttner & Moore generously supply the reader with an abundance of interesting characters, colorful backdrops and unforeseeable plot developments. Among those interesting characters are Sam's Immortal foes, Zachariah Harker and Kedre Walton; Robin Hale, a mercenary Immortal determined to colonize Landside; the Slider, a Fagin-like underworld figure who helps Sam in his illicit projects; and the Logician, an immensely old man given to dispensing homespun, commonsense oracles. Among those colorful backdrops, of course, are the Keeps themselves, nestled on the Venusian sea bottoms under their impervium domes, and the surface of Venus. Readers who are interested in seeing the various terrible life-forms alluded to in the novel's early sections will not be disappointed in the book's latter half, as the Landside settlers encounter giant lizards, foot-long beetles, the monstrosities known as the mud-wolf and the siren web, etc. (Indeed, the life-forms of Venus seem to be so very aggressive in \\"Fury\\" that they might cause the reader to wonder whether or not Harry Harrison was influenced here when he wrote his first novel, \\"Deathworld,\\" in 1960. Likewise, this reader was compelled to entertain the possibility that the vengeful Gully Foyle, of my favorite sci-fi novel of all time, Alfred Bester's 1956 classic \\"The Stars My Destination,\\" might have been patterned after the driven Sam Harker character here, in addition to Bester's admitted debt to \\"The Count of Monte Cristo.\\") As for those unforeseeable plot developments I mentioned...well, the less said, the better. I would be the last to deprive potential first-time readers of any of the many surprises that this cleverly plotted book dishes out.I should also add at this point that I recommend all potential readers of \\"Fury\\" to search out the Magnum Library edition pictured above, as this volume contains an introduction by C.L. Moore herself. In it, Moore tells us how she and her husband were accustomed to work; a fascinating look at how this famous team operated. While most of the Kuttner-Moore pieces of fiction were indeed collaborative, Moore confirms in this intro that her actual contribution to \\"Fury\\" was minimal, adding up to perhaps 1/8 of the novel's total word count. If I read her correctly, her contributions here deal mainly with colorful descriptions and sections pertaining to male-female relationships. Still, as usual, the melding of talents is quite seamless, resulting in one of the best pieces of science fiction that I've read in a good long while. The novel concludes with a two-word epilogue that is just wonderful, certainly opening up the possibility of a \\"Fury\\" sequel. Sadly, that sequel was never to be. Kuttner, who writes somewhere in \\"Fury\\" that \\"the life-span of an ordinary man was too short,\\" died of a heart attack in 1958, at the age of 44. Though the man himself was far from immortal, I'd like to think that his works may indeed be...."},{"Title":"Fury","review":"Warning: There are spoilers partway through (You'll be warned again).

Characters personifying one's deeply felt beliefs and values test them out in a fictional world. You don't know at the time what's happened. You just know you feel wonderful. Long afterward, rereading the work, you can see what lies just under the surface.\\"There's an obvious passion for writing in those words, and yet you won't find them in a manual about writing, or in the autobiography of some world-famous writer. They're in the introduction (sadly never to be reprinted in other editions) to a 1972 Lancer Books paperback edition of Fury, a classic sf novel that was first serialized in Astounding Science Fiction in 1947 under the pseudonym Lawrence O'Donnell, came out as a hardcover book three years later as by Henry Kuttner, and had been retitled Destination: Infinity for a previous 1958 paperback.Fury's publishing history makes the novel seem purely a matter of commerce rather than art. And yet it is a work of art, as we can tell from the work itself as well as that introduction by Kuttner's widow C. L. Moore - who therein reveals that she wrote some of the scenes, and could still recognize her part in their collaboration 25 years later. Henry and Catherine Kuttner, who frequently wrote together in relays as \\"Lawrence O'Donnell\\" and under other pen names, shared a love for sf that transcended the seemingly cynical imperatives of what was often regarded by outsiders as nothing but pulp fiction.Moore related that she and Kuttner were driven by thematic imperatives that went beyond sf itself. \\"Hank's basic statement was something like, \`Authority is dangerous, and I will never submit to it.' Mine was, \`The most treacherous thing in life is love.'\\" These worked their way into Fury, set on a Venus to which the human race has fled after destroying Earth in a nuclear holocaust. But mankind on Venus has abandoned any effort to tame a savage planet, instead retiring into a \\"luxurious Eden\\" of undersea Keeps - and, \\"with no challenges left, would slowly strangle in its own inertia if, out of nowhere, a deliverer did not come with a flaming sword to drive them back to life.\\"That deliverer is Sam Harker/Reed, a monstrous freak unknowingly robbed of his heritage as one of the elite of Immortals who rule Venus. Reed is driven only by hatred and a lust for vengeance. He was Kuttner's creation, and Moore couldn't identify with him at the time. But on re-reading the novel, she came to understand that to make the premise work - to make the story work - \\"he had to be what he was--utterly ruthless, terribly intelligent, terribly vulnerable, fighting every hour of his life by every savage form of trickery, betrayal and murder, to reach a goal he was never truly aware of.\\"The story of Sam Reed is headed with a quotation from Shakespeare's MacBeth, the scene where MacBeth learns that Macduff, his nemesis, \\"was from his mother's womb Untimely ripp'd.\\" Reed himself is \\"untimely ripp'd,\\" cruelly mutilated and abandoned at the behest of his enraged father after his mother dies in the Caesarian, thus setting the stage for a life out of a Shakespearian tragedy. But the reference to a classic of English literature tells us something else.\\"You can't write science fiction well if you haven't read it, though not all who try to write it know this. But nor can you write it well if you haven't read anything else,\\" Ursula K. Le Guin remarked on the occasion of a British Library sf exhibition, regarding what she had learned from reading Virginia Woolf's Orlando (1928) at age 17. \\"Genre is a rich dialect, in which you can say certain things in a particularly satisfying way, but if it gives up connection with the general literary language it becomes a jargon, meaningful only to an ingroup. Useful models may be found quite outside the genre.\\"It is often assumed, perhaps even by Le Guin, that genre sf writers generally don't read anything but sf, let alone find any \\"useful models\\" outside the field. But that isn't true of leading writers today, and it wasn't true of Kuttner and Moore back in the 1940's. Ray Bradbury, in his introduction to The Best of Henry Kuttner (1975), sets things straight, recalling his elder's role as a mentor - and not just by helping him put out a fanzine:\\"Along the way, he also sneaked me the names of people who might influence my life. Try Katherine Ann Porter, he said; she's great. Have you read Eudora Welty? he suggested, and if not, why not? Have you re-read Thorne Smith? Get to it. How about the short stories of Faulkner, or--here's one you never heard of--John Collier.\\"In Fury, then, allusions to the classics are intertwined with science fictional concerns about the fate of humanity:\\"Blaze and Bessi - it was a Romeo and Juliet story with a happy ending, up to the time Sam was conceived. They were casual, purposeless hedonists. In the Keeps you had to choose. You could either find a drive, an incentive - be one of the technicians or artists - or you could drift.\\"For lesser drifters, there are escapes like dream dust and happy cloaks - the latter, derived from a native life form, slowly consume their addicts. But Sam Reed, born Harker, isn't a drifter; he is a driven man, as driven as any of Shakespeare's tragic heroes, hating himself and hating the Immortals - never knowing until the end that he is one. Only, there's no coven of witches or a Greek chorus to set the plot in motion or comment on its import. Instead we have the Logician, an Immortal unknown to the other Immortals - a man born on Earth who understands what happened there (\\"It wasn't atomic power that destroyed Earth. It was a pattern of thought.\\"). He can foresee the future on Venus, but he is powerless to intervene - except in the subtlest ways.Fury is actually a sequel to \\"Clash by Night\\" (1943; the title is an allusion to Matthew Arnold's \\"Dover Beach\\"), set centuries earlier, when rival Keeps fight proxy wars on the surface through the Free Companies: bands of mercenaries bound by a strict code of honor. The Keeps themselves are never attacked, and should any ship of any warrior band break the taboo on atomic weapons, the others will turn on it and destroy it without mercy.Scott commands one unit in a war for economic advantage between the Montana and Virginia Keeps. But his loyalty to the Doones comes to seem a foolish one; the romantic ideals of the Free Companies are delusions: \\"Blind, stupid folly!\\" He longs for the hedonistic comforts of the Keeps. In the end, however, he cannot abandon his company, for it helps serve an objectively necessary end: preserving the Keeps from the danger of war, until the Keeps themselves tire of war and make the mercenaries objectively unnecessary:\\"The Doones meant nothing. Their ideal was a false one. Yet, because men were faithful to that ideal, civilization would rise again from the guarded Keeps. A civilization that would forget its doomed guardians, the waters of the seas of Venus, the Free Companions yelling their mad, futile battle cry as they drove on - as this ship was driving - into a night that world have no dawn.\\"In Fury, the season has changed: rot rather than fire is the greatest threat to mankind. The Keeps have turned inward, refusing the challenge of conquering the land; in their decadent hedonism, they have surrendered to a cultural entropy that can lead only to extinction - \\"it wasn't the individual who paid. It was the race that was paying.\\" And so Sam Reed is just what the race needs.(Warning: spoilers follow, but Fury is worth re-reading, and you'll love the novel even if you know how it comes out.)Motivated only by envy and rage, he turns to crime, at which he succeeds so well that the Immortals themselves seek him out for a murder contract against Robin Hale, a veteran of the Doones whose crusade for colonization of the land is upsetting the social equilibrium. Their mistake: Reed almost instinctively sides with Hale and therefore with Hale's cause. A ruthless cunning that once served him in the underworld now serves him in the struggle to defeat a savage environment and thus win the survival of mankind.Only, that is never his motivation; he never thinks of anything but his own survival and vengeance against the Immortals. His crimes range from blackmail to murder; when his false promise of Immortality for colonists is exposed, he sabotages the Keeps, forcing millions to abandon them or die. He has saved mankind, but now the Logician, following an allusion to Moses - who was suffered to see the Promised Land but never to go over thither - delivers his judgment:\\"Men like you are mighty rare, Sam. When they get to the right position, at the right time, they're the salvation of the race of man. But it's got to be the right time - a time of disaster. The drive never stops, in a man like you... If you can't conquer an enemy, you'll conquer your friends. Up to now, the enemy was Venus, and you licked it. But what have you got to fight now? ....\\"If you hadn't been born, if Blaze hadn't done what he did, mankind would be in the Keeps yet. And in a few years, or a thousand, say, the race would have died out. I could see that ahead, clear as could be. But now we've come landside. We'll finish colonizing Venus. And then we'll go out and colonize the whole universe, I expect.\\"You're the one who did it, Sam. We owe you a lot. In your day you were a great man. But your day's over. You got your power by force, and, you're like most dictators, son, who reach the top that way. All you could think of was repeating the things that made you a success - more fighting, more force. There wasn't any way but down for you, once you'd reached the top, because of the man you are. You had the same drive that made the first life-form leave water for land, but we can't use your kind any more for a while, Sam.\\"And so, Sam must be put to sleep, at the very moment of his triumph, lest he endanger mankind. Yet Kuttner thought he might be needed again, although he never told Catherine what he might have had in mind when he wrote the two-word epilogue: \\"Sam woke--\\"We feel for Sam because Kuttner felt for him when he created the character. We are caught up in the story of Fury because Kuttner and Moore themselves were caught up in it. In telling that story, they put everything of themselves, of their reading of the classics and science fiction alike, of their experience of life and knowledge of history and evolution and much else, into their work. And somehow, everything they put into their novel, the reader can get out of it. That's what true reading is all about."},{"Title":"Fury","review":"This story gets down to what we think about death, immortality and those who ultimately control our lives... our parents."},{"Title":"A Human Error Approach to Aviation Accident Analysis: The Human Factors Analysis and Classification System","review":"The authors briefly discuss aviation accidents from a historical perspective (Chapter 1), and argue that various frameworks that have been proposed to analyze aviation accidents can be grouped or categorized into six different perspectives, each of which has various strengths and weaknesses (Chapter 2). The authors then discuss the model of accident causation developed by James Reason, consider the strengths and limitations of Reason's accident model, and describe the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) which was developed to apply Reason's accident model to accident investigation and analysis (Chapter 3). The authors use three commercial aviation accidents as case studies to illustrate how the HFACS can be used as an investigative and analytical tool (Chapter 4). The authors then discuss how the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps have used HFACS to improve the safety of their aviation, and argue that general, nonmilitary aviation needs to improve its efforts at aviation safety (Chapter 5). The authors also acknowledge the need for validating any framework used to investigate and analyze aviation accidents, discuss how such a validation could be performed, and use HFACS to illustrate how the validation process can work (Chapter 6). Finally, the authors address several questions that critics might raise about HFACS (Chapter 7).The book advocates the HFACS model for investigating and analyzing aviation accidents. But, that advocacy does not detract from its value. The book is interesting, informative, and thought-provoking, regardless of whether the reader accepts or rejects the authors' arguments for HFACS, in whole or in part.Although the book discusses technical matters, it does so in a way that an educated layperson can understand. This book could be of interest to a variety of people besides aviation accident investigators. Although the book focuses on aviation accidents, it could be useful to professionals who investigate and analyze non-aviation accidents. Lawyers and law enforcement personnel who deal with cases involving accidents might find it useful and informative. It also could be helpful to educate and inform elected officials and government personnel who need to address political or governmental issues triggered by, or arising out of, accidents. Business owners and managers interested in understanding and reducing accidents in their companies or industries should consider taking a look at this book to get a different perspective."},{"Title":"A Human Error Approach to Aviation Accident Analysis: The Human Factors Analysis and Classification System","review":"I learnt about HFACS in my Human Factor course during the Master of Science in Aeronautics Program and now I'm addicted to this framework.

There was no apparent editing of the manuscript evidenced by the sloppy punctuation, incomplete sentences and the horribly repetitious material. The two following sentences illustrate these three flaws and the trivial nature of the information presented throughout the book. Page 54 (hardcover) contains this sentence: &quot;It was not unheard of that the station agent doubled in brass as the barber, postmaster, express agent, real estate dealer, seed salesman, druggist, florist, cemetery manager, even dentist.&quot;(sic) Then on page 274, this sentence appears: &quot;In some communities, the agent doubled as postmaster, and it was not unknown for him to be the barber, the seed dealer, or even the dentist.&quot;Finally, the author makes a factual error about recent history which calls into question the accuracy of the rest of the book.

A fast reader orone cursed with a good memory will see constant repitition ofminor interesting points in several chapters, making the book feelpadded. I'd pass on this one"},{"Title":"All Aboard!: Railroad in American Life","review":"ALL ABOARD! was a gift to me from a fellow volunteer at our local historical museum, and he himself had received it as a gift from the first owner, the late Klink Garrett, former official of the Railway Express Agency and co-author of Ten Turtles to Tucumcari, a fascinating account of his wide-ranging experiences with the REA. With this history behind the copy I was given, I was determined to read it, and, after three months, I have. Unfortunately, that time span is very indicative of the readability of the text and of the level of interest it engenders in the reader.Another reviewer in this forum has already castigated Douglas for the grammatical errors in the book, and I must agree with that reviewer to an extent. The first hundred or so pages are indeed replete with egregious misspellings, creating words that are totally and nonsensically out of place. These errors, which are indeed distracting to any careful reader, appear to be the result of Douglas' having employed a poor typist and the absence of competent proofreading. However, the author must have engaged a more competent typist or at least a more professional proofreader, for these errors thankfully diminish and recur only occasionally in the following 300 pages. Still, I must admit that, only three pages from the end of the narrative, the well-known and widely published railroad author Lucius Beebe appears as \\"Beebee.\\"These typographical errors aside, Douglas' writing lacks imagination. While it may be too harsh to describe his style as plodding, neither is it creative or scintillating. \\"Lackluster\\" is perhaps the most accurate descriptor of the author's vocabulary and sentence structure. When I wrote that I was determined to read the book, my own word choice may have been influenced by the fact that finishing all 399 pages of narrative did require determination.The book does enjoy its strong points, however. Too many published railroad histories are hopelessly mired in a plethora of minutiae: dollar amounts of loans and company indebtedness down to the actual cent, miles of track constructed in each year down to the tenth of a mile, names of every unknown functionary who ever sat on a governing board, and so on. Douglas' book never enters that trap, focusing as it does on the broader influences that the railroad has exerted on culture, society and mind set in the United States.The writer paints the railroad history of this country with a fairly broad brush, yet, in so doing, does present some surprising revelations, such as the fact that suburbia began as a result of the availability of rail transport and was not a child solely of the automobile as I had supposed. Similarly, Douglas explains that the origins of the very word \\"commuter\\" lie with the railroad, which reduced, or \\"commuted,\\" the cost of tickets for frequent riders. I find that facts such as these go far in redeeming the book from its other flaws, and I cannot totally condemn any book from which I have learned something new, despite its other shortcomings.Ironically, though, it may be the extensive bibliography in this book that argues most strongly against it. So much has been written about the history of railroading that one is forced to ask whether yet another book on the same subject is really justified. To enter such a competitive field successfully, an author must produce a genuinely outstanding work, the result of research that has uncovered new insights into the subject and which is expressed in captivating prose. Douglas' book, unfortunately, falls short of both criteria. In fact, its greatest contribution may be its bibliography, which can guide the inquiring reader to other and more satisfying books on the continuing saga of the railroad."},{"Title":"All Aboard!: Railroad in American Life","review":"I applaud Douglas for breaking away from the typical approach to railroad history. It seems like every other book follows the &quot;all hail the railroad&quot; model. Douglas tries to tie railroading into the social fabric of American history. I think it is an approach that is long over due."},{"Title":"All Aboard!: Railroad in American Life","review":"I enjoy reading railroad history. That's why I read All Aboard. I was disappointed throughout.As noted by others, Douglas commits many, many and several redundent (sp) statements, so after awhile you begin to expect them. His writing style is, to say the least, a bit confusing. It reminds me of 'word loading' papers in college to meet the prof's word count. But, others have pointed that out here better than I could.Douglas also attempts to cover way too many topics in the book. For example, I expected a graceful entrance to the current state of railroads in America near the end of the it, but instead got chapters on railroading in culture, books, music, et al. That really broke my train of thought, and into an area I wasn't much interested in. I've already read enough about the history of American music, and how it connects to railroading.One major problem I have with the book is his often confusing (and not needed) pot-shots at labor, unions and the likes, all the way up to modern Amtrak. On one hand, he praises the work of railroad workers. He acknowledges their hard and dangerous jobs, and the roles they played in making the roads work. However, his shots at unions and his implications (too many to count here) that they were to blame for (on many accounts) railroading's ultimate decline are just plain wrong. For example, he notes that Amtrak workers in 'the southwest' were good despite their being 'union workers' and overpaid. He also makes a comment that turn of the century labor laws had forever changed how railroads operated and, in sumation, began their downward spiral.To me, those digs are not in keeping with good writing. The represent his own, personal thoughts and are not proven facts. I wont argue the union side to this, but I can say that unions were needed to protect workers from management.I can imagine there are readers out there who would enjoy this book. I really tried to, but, given the writing style and his anti-labor union POV it was very hard. On the positive side, he breaks away from the fawning style of many writers in this field. He attempts to relate railroads to their affects on our society and culture. If taking cracks at unions is part of that mind-set, then I don't think this book can be rated as good."},{"Title":"All Aboard!: Railroad in American Life","review":"_All Aboard!: The Railroad in American Life_ by George H. Douglas is a history of the development and use of the railroad and its impact on American culture, society, politics, war, and the economy. It is a richly illustrated book with endnotes and an extensive bibliography (yet easily read by the average, non-specialist reader).The central them of this book is that the railroad made the country what it is today. Prior to railroads, travel between cities and states was costly, long, uncomfortable, difficult, and sometimes dangerous. Roads in many areas were virtually nonexistent or almost totally unusable, sometimes no better than game trails. There was virtually no interstate (or even intercity) commerce, as each region had to be virtually autonomous, as only the wealthy could import goods and even then rarely in great quantity. As late as the 1830s, the U.S. was a \\"disjointed nation composed of lonely and self-sufficient farmers.\\"The railroads changed all of this forever. Cities that once took days to travel between suddenly took only hours. Many once isolated communities became forged into one national community. In addition to linking towns, cities, and regions, the railroads gave rise to whole new communities, literally \\"something from nothing.\\" New towns sprung up where the railroads went, either arising on their own thanks to the advantages offered by rail transport, or created by the railroads themselves, first in the Midwest, later in the Far West. Confounding European visitors, these \\"railroads to nowhere\\" opened up vast sections of the country, provided land for many thousands of Irish, German, Scandinavian, Italian, and Eastern European immigrants (many railroad had agents in Eastern port cities or even Europe itself to encourage and aid immigrants), and by opening such tremendously fertile land, providing rail transport and such innovations as refrigerated cars for milk and meat, enabled American agricultural output to dwarf that of the rest of the world.Douglas wrote that the railroad was what \\"brought the United States into being,\\" creating the nation with which we are familiar with today. In addition to creating a national identity of being an American, making long distance travel safe (and later quite comfortable) and long distance trade economically feasible, settling the Midwest and the Far West, and making America the breadbasket of the world, the railroads brought into existence the suburbs (well before cars and paved roads became commonplace, a myriad of commuter lines served small towns, allowing people to live in one place and work somewhere else; the very word commuter arose from the concept of \\"commuted\\" fares in the 1840s, when railroads offered lower ticket prices as a reward to regular patrons). Railroads also gave us the shopping mall (most of the great 19th century and early 20th century urban train stations had a multitude of shops, restaurants, and other services), the modern vacation (railroads were the first to publicize such places as our national parks, Niagara Falls, and the beaches of Florida as well as provide cheap transportation to them), and even country music (Jimmy Rodgers, the \\"Father of Country Music,\\" was for a time a rail worker, writing many songs about life on the train and was heavily influenced by music he heard while working on the railroad, particularly from cowboys, work songs, and the music of black railroad workers).Douglas covered many aspects of the technical development of railroads, though he tended to be light on technical details and focus more on the economic, cultural, and societal impact. He covered such things as the evolution of passenger accommodations, from the early days of hard wooden seats in coaches without springs (often a rough ride) to the development of luxurious Pullman sleeper cars and even more palatial private railway cars, the advent of the vertical end frame for passenger cars (which reduced the violent movement of cars, particularly from starting and stopping), vestibules that covered the platforms of railcars (which allowed people to safely travel from car to car, a vital invention that enable the dining car to come into being), the automatic coupler (patented in 1868 by Eli Hamilton Janney, this device saved the lives of thousands of brakemen), and the air brake (introduced by George Westinghouse in 1868, it allowed trains to run faster and heavier and was safer than risky hand brakes).The types and jobs of people on the railroad was discussed at length, including the importance of the station agent (for decades a very important man in small towns, sometimes serving also as a barber, postmaster, druggist, and even dentist), the conductor (for many years the principal public relations contact with the general public and often becoming locally very well known as they often rode the same trains for decades), and the news agent (or news butcher, young men who supplied newspapers, books, candy, drinks, and other niceties to passengers).Throughout the book, the author provided interesting comparisons with European railroads. European railroads grasped the idea of grand urban stations and fences and other protections along tracks and crossings much earlier, but shied away from trains entering the hearts of cities (unlike the Americans, who once had plans for a depot on the Mall in Washington D.C.) and disliked the Pullman sleeping cars (much preferring separate and closed sleeping compartments).Trains in art, literature, and popular culture are covered, Douglas discussing everything from Frank Norris's _The Octopus_, the novels of Theodore Dreiser, and the railroad prints of Currier and Ives to the legend of Casey Jones, the movie _The Great Train Robbery_ , the films of Alfred Hitchcock, and Lionel model trains.The decline and later partial rebirth of the railroads was also covered. Not only did airplanes, cars, and trucks provide competition, but even the bicycle and the interurban and city street car (which itself largely perished due to the automobile) provided problems for the railroads. Fortunately, railroads were able to tap new markets for freight shipment and cities belatedly realized the great importance of keeping commuter trains running in highly congested urban areas."},{"Title":"Popular Front Paris and the Poetics of Culture","review":"This Paris of the 1930s is not that of the Belle Epoque.

He actually found his father's old boat and brought it back to attempt as a restoration in parallel, or even replacing, the restoration of the other one.

There were retirees from local factories who had tremendous skills in duplicating oddly shaped wooden pieces, in metal work, in engine repair. One of the most incredibly stupid things about the way we have allowed our industries to \\"globalize\\" and \\"outsource\\" is that we are losing a whole category of manufacturing skills, and since so much is passed on from person to person, we are crippling ourselves from ever becoming a strong manufacturing economy again. No-one likes to consider themselves \\"working class\\" - everyone wants to be white-collar, and unions are a diminishing force, though that's an effect rather than a cause.

It's extremely inspirational for a young girl. Some, like Matilda, might feel alone in this big world, but if you have enough determination, there's nothing you're not capable of! Also, Ronald Dahl's writing style is great for kids ages 7 and up! It's easy to understand and engaging at the same time. I'm gonna go and watch the 'Matilda' movie for the 50th time. Good thing the movie captures the book pretty well or eles I would sue for ruining such a wonderful story! hehe"},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"I think Matilda, by Roald Dahl, was an excellent book. I gave this book this book a rating of four stars because I enjoyed it but certain happenings in the story were predictable. Some events in this book caught me by surprise but mainly I could tell what was going to happen. I would recommend this book though to anyone who likes to read fictional stories. Matilda is also a popular movie but if you haven't seen the movie yet I suggest that you read the book first. I was pleased with this book because it's kind of like a good vs. evil story. Although it's not exactly a classic story of good vs. evil I still enjoyed it very much. Another reason why I enjoyed this book so much was that Roald Dahl writes in the dialog that the characters would have spoken in. This story takes place in England so he writes the characters dialog as though they were speaking with an English accent. I believe that adds to the book and makes it seem much more realistic. If everyone talked the same it would still be a good book but it would get boring. Also the characters in this book had very distinct personalities and also had very realistic arguments and opinions. Many of Roald Dahl's books have memorable characters and events. Matilda is no different. This story is about a little girl named Matilda who has extraordinary powers. Only one person truly understands Matilda and that's her teacher, Ms. Honey. When Ms. Honey figures out how special Matilda is she does all that she can to help her. When she shares a terrifying secret with Matilda that she had never shared with anyone else before Matilda becomes very interested and then the fun begins. Matilda learns to use her gift to her advantage and gets revenge on people who have her wronged her including her parents and her principal (but only if they deserve it of course). She uses these powers and becomes a hero at Crunchem Hall (Matilda's new school) when she stands up to the terrifying bully of a principal named Ms. Trunchbull who is despised by everyone. I won't give away the ending but as I said before many readers will find it very predictable and will have a good idea of whats going to happen to all the characters even before it actually happens. Besides the predictability of this book I was not disappointed and thoght it was very well written. I would recommend it to anyone who likes to read a good book."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"My seven year old son and I are big fans of Roald Dahl.

It's about a girl living in rough time's with a mean teacher, and mean parents.

I think they do it deliberately, just to annoy me.\\" And her parents are so abusive they didn't even know how old Matilda was!

She use's this to face her problems and she never gave up. I feel Matilda's very brave because she's only six and she smiles through a hard life. Matilda teaches Mrs.Trunchbull a lesson by haunting her. This shows her that she's not as tough as she thinks she is, and she learns what it feels like to be scared just like her students. She also haunts her dad by gluing a hat on to his head, that teaches him not to mess with Matilda.I recommend this book because it's made by Roald Dahl, who's done a great job on a kid friendly book that's heart filling and entertaining like his other books, James and the Giant Peach, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.I personally would tell you to read this book because many kids can be a Matilda.

I loved the fictional story of Matilda, but thought the author could have taken more time developing the story and been more descriptive.

People get amazed on what she can do since she is so young. Her family might be so mean to her but she still loves them no matter what. This book will really get your attention."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"In this story a little girl named Matilda was brilliant, though her parents did not care for her. When she was about six she read newspapers and chapter books, while her parents watched television all day. One day, Matilda went up to her father and asked him if she could go to school. He replied saying that school is a waste of time and what do you need it for, but in the end they let her go to school, so they could get rid of her. So when she went to school the next day she found out that she was one of the smartest girls in her class. So days passed and one day Mrs. Trenchble, the school principle, came into the class and asked them a lot of questions. She was being really rood to Matilda's teacher, and to all of the students. She was known to hurt the kids who disobeyed her. One day, she was getting on Matilda's nerves and she got so mad that she made water splash on Mrs. Trenchble with her brain. So then when she got home everyday she would usually pull a trick on her parents for not caring for her. She put glue in her dads gel, and she also did other tricks to them. Matilda and her teacher became really close, almost like best friends. One day, Matilda went to her house and they talked for hours. They talked so much that they began to love each other. Matilda's teacher told Matilda that Mrs. Trenchble was her aunt. That was why she was so mean to her. In the end, Matilda and her teacher ended up living together. She adopted Matilda and lived happily ever after.One thing I did not like about Matilda was that her parents did not like or cared for her. I don't think that any parent should not like their child. I did not like in the book when Matilda's father said, \\"Who needs to go to school? \\" I think that they should not have said that too her because it is making her think she doesn't need school, and everybody needs to go to school. I also did not like how Mrs. Trenchble treated her students. She was very mean to all of them, and even including Matilda's teacher.My Favorite part of Matilda was when Matilda and her teacher just sit and talk and talk for hours. I think that they were meant to be once they saw each other. Matilda deserves a mom who can help her and be there for her and I know she can do it. I also love the ending because the ending is always the best part of the whole story. This is my favorite book. I love all the books Rauld Dahl has read."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"I read the book Matilda by Roald Dahl. It is about a little girl that is brilliant and changes her teachers, life. Unlikely hero is the theme because she has the ability to, levitate, and she got her teachers house back from doing it. The message is you can never be to, small to be a hero. Because when Matilda uses her powers to write on the chalk, board to get Miss. Honey's house and wages back from Ms. Trunchbull. I think it is a good message because Matilda saved Miss. Honey from being pore in a cottage and now she is in her real house. If I could trade places with anyCharacter, it would be Matilda because she has the ability to levitate with her eyes. The Trunchbull is a true symbol for evil because she chucks Amanda Thripp. She also makes Bruce Bogtrotter eat a whole big chocolate cake. I like the character Mr. wormwood because he has a funny voice and he owns a car dealership and my dad does too but he does not cheat his customers. Before I read Matilda I thought it was going to be about an ordinary girl that goes to school, but now that I have read the book my schema has changed and I think Matilda is a genius and a hero as a five-year-old girl. I would recommend this book to a boy or a girl that is nine and up. The reading level is about end of the year 2nd grade and up.

The book was not so interesting. It was mostly about a smart girl who reads lots of books even though her parents don't like her too. I like reading books with more action, like the Series of Unfortunate Events. I would recommend Matilda to a kid that likes school. Also to younger kids, maybe 3rd graders. The book was easy to read which made it kind of boring to me."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Matilda is not very exciting, it is not not very clever, and it is not very funny. Matilda is a bland adventure with a very mild plot about a very smart 5 year old girl with a massive range of acedemics.

This is a popular summer reading requirement...Amazon needs to get on the ball!"},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"If Matilda existed and if she really had anything between her ears, she would not like this book. The humor consists of endless repetitions of the scathing insult &quot;You little twit.&quot; Matilda, who has had no exposure to intelligent conversation and has never heard of mathematics, has an adult vocabulary at two years and can multiply any numbers in a second, not to mention pushing things with her eyes. Roald Dahl's sick humor and pathological desire to revolt are ever-present. The only thing that can be said for it is that it might conceivably encourage children to read more. However, this is no use if readers are bent on, against all common sense, reading Matilda over and over again."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"This book was terrible! There was no suspense at the end of the chapters, the ending came too quickly and made little sense, and the telepathic powers were inplausible and unbelieveable. Roald Dahl bombed this time"},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"I find it hard to believe an acclaimed author would promote disrespect, mental abuse of children, physical abuse of children, revenge, and poor language. I found the book to provide a very NEGATIVE outlook on life and not the least bit entertaining."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Matilda is a dark tale of child abuse and neglect, criminal deceit and murder. It communicates to children how cruel and mean adults can be, that Olympic althletes can be criminals, and weak snivelling teachers are to be admired. Of course, the FBI is a bunch of bungling idiots so reporting the abuses to the authorities is out of the question, the child must take matters into her own hands or \\"eyes\\" as the author indicates. The child, like Stephen King's Carrie, resorts to telekinesis after her minor attempts at revenge surprisingly do little to improve her plight.Yes, magic is the answer to all that is bad and wrong with the world. The author in his usual dark way encourages children to laugh at the abuse of other children, delight in their humiliation, brush off the physical abuse of animals, make fun of greed and gluttony, and then rejoice in the impossible fantasy outcome of \\"all is as it should have been from the beginning.\\" The theory that an author can terrorize a child as long as he or she writes in a few pages of happy ending is ridiculous.My child's teacher read this to the class and then asked for permission to show the PG movie. My husband and I watched the movie and were shocked at the level of violence and disgusting language. My husband speculated that it was just Hollywood's typical overblown exaggeration of a work of literature. Not so. Upon reading; the language is abhorrent, the subject matter vile and there is nothing funny about this book.Thank goodness this is a fantasy or poor little Matilda would have never made it to the ripe old age of 3 - she'd have died from infection, starvation and neglect. There are not many stories on the news of little perfectly dressed three-year olds found healthy and nicely coiffed when her parents severe neglect finally came to the attention of authorities. Equally hard to swallow is how a child could manage to learn to spell her own name at just a year of age when her own parents can't even remember it themselves. And of course, the FBI who were staking out the house observing the criminal activities of Matilda's father would never question why a three-year old was walking unescorted to the library - just like the nice librarian would have never thought of calling the authorities. Yes, children you need to take matters into your own hands, adults just can't be trusted to care for you. Great message Mr. Dahl. Next time - try psychotherapy."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Matilda is a girl of many talents but no-one see's that in her all they see is a little brat!

Even though I have read it before I still forund it interesting to read. I enjoy the book much more than I enjoy the movie. The movie has the story all wrong from what Roald Dahl's story is like.

When she goes out to play, then she meets the headmistress, Ms. Trunchbull, who Matilda later on in the story finds out that she is Ms. Honey's aunt.

The book has a little bit of a religious touch to it. It is mentioned that the students have prayers and read the scriptures. Also it calls Matilda's gift a miracle and says it was the best miracle since Jesus. The scene where Matilda moves a lot of objects around in Trunchbull's house does not happen. By the end of the book she no longer has her telepathic gift. The teacher believes it is because she is finally being challenged in school.One of the Trunchbull's means of punishments is to forcibly make a fat (somewhat rude) boy by the name of Bruce Bogtrotter eat an enormous cake to try to make him sick after finding him guilty of stealing food from the kitchen. In many of Dahl's novels there is a rude character that is extremely fat."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"When Matilda sees Miss Honey and her small cottage in the middle of nowhere and Matilda moves in the cottage is my favorite part!"},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"I had already seen the movie and was surprised by the story, so very similar to my own childhood.

Matilda is a child character but has so much to teach adults. Her powers are just an extension of her strength of will and smarts and confidence. Its so rare to find a book that speaks to kids as much as adults. It goes without saying the writing and story are wonderful, tightly-written, and supremely funny. My new old favorite book."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Matilda by Roald Dahl is about a small, sweet girl who is a genius. She deals with over-exaggerated bullies in her parents and the headmistress of her school. Her father is a used car salesman who thinks females are dumb and only useful in the kitchen. Her mother believes a girl should focus on being pretty to catch a man. Both her parents love TV and hate books. While the headmistress is a giant of a bully, Matilda finds a confidant in her teacher Miss Jennifer Honey.The plot is slow-moving and I think ends rather abruptly but overall it was ok and slightly amusing. Some reviewers complained the adults were too idiotic and overly abusive. In my own experience this is typical of British literature. Yes, the characters tend to be one-dimensional, but this is a children's book published several years ago. For those who complained it was unbelievable--it is a fantasy, it's not meant to be believable.This won't make my list of favorites but I would still consider it a contender for classic in British children's literature."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Roald Dahl's books are classic. Mathilda and Charlie and Chocolate factory are the best. In mathilda, story is weaved with great flow. The characters are serious, hilarious, genius and caring. The kids these days learn of discipline back in the days and how Mathilda through her strong reading skills and genius skills tackles peoples and makes friends. Any kid will love this book. There is a movie with same name that can be enjoyed after reading the book. Good for children ages 7 and up. Girls will especially love this."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"When I ask my five year old what her favorite chapter book is, she replies with \\"Matilda\\" every time.

So she got her dream. She got to go to school with an awesome teacher called Miss Honey.It was so funny when Matilda hot glued her father's hat. He got it stuck to his head. Also when Matilda tricked her father. She dyed his hair tan. It was heart warming when Matilda got an awesome teacher, Miss Honey.So, you should read this juicy book to find out what happens to Matida and her rotten parents."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Matilda was, according to Roald Dahl, one the most difficult books that he ever wrote, but it is also one of his most popular, standing alongside Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, BFG and The Witches. It is a story that revolves around an exceptional little girl, whose intelligence is unrecognized by her parents. Because of this, she learns right from the start that she has to do everything by herself to get exactly what she wants. Very episodic in its first half (incidents with Matilda's parents), the story's plot shifts in a straight path in its last half as Matild enters school and has to face an extremely vicious Headmistress, both to the students and to the teachers.Those that have read Roald Dahl's books will know that children in his stories face difficult and cruel situations from imposing figures of authority. This will not please certain parents or adults who may consider those things too scary and upsetting for children; even accusing those books of promoting rebellious ideologies. But to me those opinions are just rubbish and untrue. Instead, I think this book is an excellent way to warn children and adults that there are adults who have no respect for them and that it is essential to stand up to them. In fact, every time I have read Roald Dahl's books, I have always felt that he is one of those writers who treats children, and readers, with respect because he is showing to them the brutal truth about the world, the adults and the bullies - including those that are respectable authority figures - who think that they can get and do whatever they want because they have the higher power.As for the audiobook version, I was amazed by Joely Richardson's reading. She has the perfect voice tone for each character and she makes the reading such a pleasure that I didn't need to have the book to follow the storyline, and I never got lost by what she said. Why there were times, by looking at Quentin Blake's illustrations and the actress's photo at the back of the audiobook, when I felt Joely Richardson looked just like Ms. Honey.In the end, I think this book, and its audiobook, are some of the most important story everybody should read at least once in its life. For its story, its joy of reading and its respect towards its readers (children or adults)."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"I remember reading this as a kid and totally loving it. I recently bought it for my neice and read it again. It brought back fond memories. Mathilda is a very bright little girl whose level of genius goes completely unnoticed by her ignorant parents. It is so funny and Dahl is still the undisputed king of children's fiction!"},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"I read Matilda when I was living in England. I started to read it when a boy called June recommended it to me. I still read it these days.It's a story about a girl and her parents, who ignore her.Matilda is an ingenious girl with quick learning ability. When her dishonest parents go out, she starts going to the library to read books. Matilda gradually gets smarter and smarter, but her parents still ignore her. Soon, her parents disaprove of Matilda because she's so different from the other members of the family, who are the kind of peaple that only sit infront of the TV.When Matilda goes into school at the age of six, she meets a nice, kind quiet teacher called Miss Honey who gets convinced of the fact that Matilda is exceptionally smart, Matilda also meets a monsterous Headmaster who hates children, Ms Trunchbul.Matilda gets to like Miss Honey and finally gets to go to her house and listens to Miss Honey's tragic story of the past. By that time, Matilda has developed psycyic powers to move things using her eyes, and she decides to pay back her parents for all the things they've done to her, she also decides to pay back Miss Trunchbul for being very spiteful to the children at school.In the end Matilda gets adopted by Miss Honey and spends a wonderful life."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"This book has a wonderful plot. Its main characters are fully developed to the exctent that you can see them. I highly recomend this book for people 8-80."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"One of the last novels written before Roald Dahl's death, \\"Matilda\\" reads almost like a goodbye, with a thank-you to all the authors that have touched Dahl during his lifetime - the text even includes a reading list of books recommended to Matilda - and through her, to the reader. And Matilda herself, despite being female, could very well be a reflection of Dahl himself as a child: a precocious bookworm with a fascination with words, people and places. As such, \\"Matilda\\" holds a special place in the canon of Dahl's literature for children, and Matilda herself is one of those shining characters that you simply wish was a real person and your friend. It is a rare thing indeed for an author to not only create a character who has practically no faults, and yet never become a goody-two-shoes or implausibly perfect, but to give her a remarkable gift (in this case, her hyper-intelligence) and make it seem less important than her goodness, her loyalty, her sense of justice and her love of learning.Matilda Wormwood is born to two rather awful parents who have no interest whatsoever in their young daughter, instead pouring all their attention into their work, (for Mr Woodworm) bingo, (for Mrs Wormwood) and occasionally their first-born son Michael. However, they are mean-spirited enough to take umbridge at the sight of Matilda indulging her great love for reading. To get back at them (and to keep her own sanity) Matilda engages in a series of practical jokes every time her parents are beastly or dishonest - which happens on a rather regular basis.But all of that changes when she starts school and Matilda meets the two most important women in her life: the lovely Miss Honey and the terrible Miss Trunchball. The gentle and timid Miss Jennifer Honey is Matilda's adored teacher, whereas Miss Trunchball is the Headmistress of Crunchem Hall Primary who terrifies student and teacher alike. Miss Trunchball may be a rather unfortunate stereotype of a butch, unattractive, athletic woman, but as an incarnation of psychotic feminine rage, she comes second only to Lewis Carroll's Queen of Hearts. More a force of nature than an actual person, she's sure to send a shudder down any child's spine - however bad your teacher is, you can be sure she's not *this* bad!It soon becomes clear that the students of the school are waging a war against Miss Trunchball, one that Matilda is all-too-keen to become a part of when she realizes that there is a mysterious link between her beloved Miss Honey and the tyrannical Trunchball. And it just so happens that around this time, Matilda finds that she has a remarkable ability: to move things with her mind. Being a moralistic girl as well as an intelligent one, she soon realizes that she now has the perfect tool with which to restore Miss Honey to her former fortune and deliver Miss Trunchball her just desserts.The text is full of allusions to other books and stories, making it a remarkably rich read for a children's book (and will hopefully get young readers interested in other books - as I'm sure was Dahl's intention) and of course includes plenty of Dahl's trademark love for the grotesque and macabre, components that have always made him controversial in the adult community, and beloved in the child's world. But even more in \\"Matilda\\", there is a sense of the spiritual and the sublime - Matilda's emerging powers seem to not only stem from her intelligence, but from her great spirit as well, particularly when she describes her powers as feeling like: \\"flying past the stars on silver wings.\\" With justice served in the guise of a tiny five year old (captured perfectly in the illustrations by long-time Dahl collaborator Quentin Blake), and an ending that manages to be both happy and bittersweet, \\"Matilda\\" is a must for any children's bookshelf."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"This is a really cute book (that I see has recently been made into a movie). Matilda is a smart girl that likes to read, who has a car salesman father that sells cars he illegally fixes up (like putting on a fender with glue).

She wants to prove to them that she is smarter than they think she is. To do this she uses her extraordinary brain to scare them out of their pants.Those aren't the only people Matilda has to deal with. At her school there is Miss Trunchbull, the headmistress, who is a total kid-hater and abuser. When Matilda personally experiences the horror of her headmistress, she has this urge to teach Miss Trunchbull a lesson she'll never forget. But how will she do it? She's just a kid and Miss Trunchbull is more than an adult. She's a tyrant!Roald Dahl is an outstanding author for children of all ages. This book, like many of his others, is very humorous and suspenseful. It's the kind of book you just can't put down. If you enjoyed some of his other books, such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and James and the Giant Peach you will definitely enjoy Matilda."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"The book that I am reviewing is Matilda. Matilda is by Roald Dahl and illustrated by Quentin Blake. The book is about a little girl named Matilda. Matilda is a smart and intelligent girl. By the age of one and a half, Matilda's speech was perfect, and at the age of three, she could read the newspaper. Matilda has a dad, mom, and a brother.Mr. Wormwood, (Matilda's dad) is a car dealer. He buys cars that are cheap, and then makes it looks nice. He is a crook and is very mischievous. The cars will break down when the buyer drives it. Mrs. Wormwood plays bingo five afternoons a week. Matilda is left alone at the house while her mother is gone. Michael is a normal boy that goes to Primary School.Matilda goes to Primary school at the age of five and a half. The headmaster (Ms. Trunchbull) is a strict and mean lady. She once threw a girl named Amanda Thripp by the ponytails. Amanda went flying in the air and landed back down safely. Miss Honey is Matilda's teacher. She is a nice and cheerful lady that loves children.The writing style that Roald Dahl does is very interesting. He writes it in a funny, and then goes back to being serious. His writing can make me picture the setting and characters in my mind. Mr. Dahl's writing can make you picture what the characters look like. He uses describing words such as obstinate, cruel, and eccentric. One of his funny quotes is \\"What's the matter with you, are you ill\\" and a serious quote is \\"You are a vile, repulsive, repellent, malicious little brute.In my opinion, I think that Matilda is a good book. I can picture what happens in the story by using the words that describe what is happening. I would recommend this book to readers who like to have a story that is mysterious and adventurous. The book is a well thought out book by Roald Dahl. Matilda is the main character of the story."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Ron Keith did such a WONderful job narrating this story!

But miss honey loves kids and her job. Matilda scares her dad and miss trunchbull for being mean to her.I liked this book because it's a funny book. I like when Lavender puts the newt into Miss Trunchbull's water. I would recommend this book and Dahl's other books because his writing is creative."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"I just finished reading Matilda by Roald Dahl for the second time. This book was published in 1988, two years before the author passed away. When Roald Dahl was a boy, his mom told him stories about trolls and other mythical creatures. He liked listening to these stories. When he was nine he went to a boarding school. He missed his home and had a hard time obeying the strict headmasters when he was there. Some people think he used these experiences to help him write his stories.Matilda is about a little girl who is a genius. Matilda could talk very well when she was only one and a half. She taught herself how to read when she was three. Even though she is smart, she has bad parents that don't appreciate her talents or care about her. In the book, it tells this by saying, \\"To tell the truth, I doubt they would have noticed had she crawled into the house with a broken leg.\\" Her dad works at a car dealer and her mom goes and plays bingo. Then, they spend all their free time watching television.At Matilda's school, the headmistress is Miss Trunchbull. She is mean to the children. She threw somebody named Amanda Thripp just for having pigtails. In the book it says, \\"Amanda Thripp was traveling so fast she became a blur, and suddenly, with a mighty grunt, the Trunchbull let go of the pigtails and Amanda went sailing like a rocket right over the wire fence of the playground and high up into the sky.\\"Matilda does have a nice teacher at school though. Her name is Miss Honey. Miss Honey cares about Matilda. She invites her to her house. They talk about a gift Matilda has to make things happen with her mind. \\"You know,\\" she said, \\"I've been thinking very hard about what you did with that glass. It is a great power you have been given, my child, you know that.\\" Matilda uses her power to get back at Ms. Trunchbull and to help Miss Honey.I definitely recommend this book. It is a great story. The characters in Matilda are developed really well. Reading the book made me feel sad, happy, and excited for Matilda and the things she went through. I really like Roald Dahl's writing style. The characters say and do funny things.

Her new teacher, Ms. Honey, was the best thing about school. She loved Ms. Honey. Then, when she met the principal, Ms. Trunchbull, everthing was horrible. She had heard really bad things about Ms. Trunchbull. She heard that she had this really little room where she put kids if they didn't follow the rules. It has spikes on the walls and tacks on the floor, so you couldn't sit down and you had to stand there the whole time. Ms. Trunchbull kept her eyes on Matilda because her mean father told Ms. Trunchbull that she was a very bad child. This story takes place at Matilda's house and at school. The problem is that she is stuck with the worst parents and she loves school but she has the worst principal. She also has to move away. Matilda's problems are solved with her power and intelligence along with help from Ms. Honey and her classmates.

But unfortunately for Matilda, her parents doesn't really care much of her pressence in the family. That, however, didn't stop her from nurturing herself with self taught skills, such as reading, self grooming, and cooking on her own. Nevertheless the pain of being part of the family that's quite negligence to her well being, and always finding faults to whatever she did, she usually found ways to actually get back at her family. which i much say although they deserved it, don't try it at home kids.MATILDA went to read most of the books in the library on her own, which in turn giving us the list of books we might like to read after this in the future. Once she started attending school, her new set of adventures started. There, she met her new friend, Lavender; a wonderful teacher Miss Honey; and a dreadful principal, Miss Trunchbull who loom a shadow over the children attending that school. Matilda, who's an intelligent young girl, found out she has developed powers of telekenesis while she was in Miss Honey's class in the pressence of Miss Trunchbull. With this, she actually formed an intelligent plan to get rid of Miss Trunchbull for the good of Miss Honey and the rest of the school.This is a funny, cute book but of course I wouldn't recommend letting much younger readers without the supervisons of adults explaining them the moral of actions taken in this story itself, just in case.

It made me want to keep reading it. If I owned the book I would read it over and over again, but I read it in school so I don't own it.Roald Dahl makes the book Matilda out of excitement and humor. I think it was very creative about the way he wrote about Matilda. I liked the fact that Matilda gets powers near the end of the book. It was exciting how she made a glass with a newt in it tip over. In the book, when the newt was about to tip over Matilda whispered, \\"Tip it!\\" \\"Tip it over!\\" When it tipped over the newt slipped out and fell onto the Trunchbull. She started yelling, \\"Who did it? Come on! Own up! Step forward!\\" And then she slapped it off with her hand. I could imagine it in my mind really well.The reason I like Roald Dahl's books is because I can always imagine the pictures in my mind, even when there are pictures I can imagine stuff even better than the pictures because it's just so exciting. I can imagine pictures of exciting and funny books like Roald Dahl's."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"At the time of this review, there has been a paltry 3, yes three, a mere trio, of reviews on Matilda. How? Is this not deservingly one of the all-time classics? Crazy stuff. For my money, I'm pinning this odd occurrence on global warming. Anyway...the book! If you read the opening page, you're in. How can anyone resist that stuff about parents thinking their truly hideous children are so gorgeous and gifted? And it's all good from there on out. C'mon, Trunchbull is hilarious with her quick talking, exclamation point-driven dialogue and barbarian attitude toward everyone. And that little Matilda... The book does differ somewhat from the movie, so even if you've seen the flick, the book is still a great time.As an aside, and to anyone considering a career in writing, I understand that Roald's first draft had Matilda being kind of bratty and evilish in the first half of the first draft. Roald's editor (maybe agent) told Roald to rewrite it to make Matilda sweeter, or at least more understandably evil, in the book's first 100 pages or so. As this was Roald's final book, I believe, this fact is heartening to any would-be writer--a skilled veteran like Dahl still making errors! It gives us all hope. Further, and only when you know the above info, when you read Matilda, you can almost see where Roald went to the trouble of rationalizing Matilda's somewhat dastardly actions toward her parents. Fascinating!"},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Wonderfully written of a child, Matilda, who is a ferocious reader with special ability and great human perceptions. It may inspire children to read more, imagine and discover the treasures of what books can offer. Happens to be a favourite of my 3 and 5 year old daughters."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"I feel sad for anyone who has seen the movie before reading this book because it certainly doesn't do it justice. Dahl is by far my favorite children's author and he never runs out of witty hilarity that's peppered throughout each book. Matilda is no exception. Dahl puts a spin on the orphaned child motif by empowering children. He also spices it up with a big of magic that's directly connected to Matilda's love of reading and her knack for creative problem solving. Matilda's lovable, humble, and a wonderful model for young readers who, well...love to read."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"All of Roald Dahl's key works contain common features that make his books special and unique. Apart from gripping tales of the unexpected, the key reason for their appeal is in the treatment of the baddies in the story. However, Dahl counters this rollicking, uproarious and wicked humour with deep relationships between the young protagonist and a sensible grown-up in his social circle. This theme features throughout most if not all his works, and was first introduced when he wroteDanny, the Champion of the World (Puffin Novels), maturing when Dahl wroteThe BFG,The Witches (Puffin Novels)and Matilda.On the surface, Matilda may be a gripping yarn that revolves around Matilda's environment of Crunchem Hall Primary School and the domain of fearsome Miss Trunchbull, arguably the most revolting villain that Dahl ever created. This harks back to his own dark days as a student. As with all his books, Dahl keeps his audience of young readers in mind. Not only is his style easily accessible and lively, but he sides with his young audience through his writing, He draws the characters of Miss Trunchbull and Matilda's repulsive parents such that they convey revolting personas and you wouldn't want to befriend them. Dahl particularly draws the character of the Trunchbul effectively such that we readers can really feel her as a \\"holy terror that frightend the life out of the pupils and teachers alike\\". I admit that this book dwells a little too much on the Trunchbull's torturous punishments, but these only serve to make the Trunchbull more real. A signature twist to make this a tale of the unexpected is when Miss Honey reveals that Matilda's father was a crook who sold stolen cars.However, the understated core of the book should be Matilda herself and her relationship with Miss Honey. His portrayal of this relationship offers distinct echoes of Danny's relationship with his father in Danny the Champion of the World. From the moment that Dahl first introduces us to Matilda's maturity, we know that we are getting to know an extraordinary little girl. In spite of her sensitive and brilliant mind, she is a character who engages our sympathies. Matilda always strives to break free of the thrall of her crooked family, especially her father, who acts and talks like a gangster towards her. Matilda strikes up an acquaintence with Miss Honey and quickly learns of Miss Honey's situation. She is then able to do things in her power to help her and restore her rightful claim to her father's inheritance. This may appear to be self-interest on Matilda's part, but sshe does this because she shows a genuine sympathy to Miss Honey's plight.In short, this swansong in Dahl's long children's novels stands as an undisputed masterwork and demonstrates the maturity in Dahl's children's writing. It's truly a work that shows Dahl at the top of his game, at the pinnacle of his writing career, and sums up all that his children's writing has come to stand for. (Apparently he spent 20 years writing this book.) Although I could have done with less coverage of the Trunchbull's cruelty, this book is still an undisputed Dahl classic that deserves to be up there with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Fantastic Mr. Fox and The BFG."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"I adored Matilda. She was born into an abusive family with dim-witted parents. All they do is watch t.v and never pay attention to Matilda.

Her parents are so annoyed, that they send her off to school, where Ms. Trunchball, the headmistress, is very ugly, mean, and nasty to children. She hates them all. But Matilda soon falls in love with her teacher, Ms. Honey, and then she developes an exquisit power to move things with her eyes. I would love a power like that.

I really like this book because it is entertaining and it kept my attention from the beginning to the end. This book teaches a very valuable Lesson. The lesson is not to bully others or they might bully you back.Another thing I really like about this book is that Matilda is a young girl that has powers. Some of her powers are controlling things with her eyes and mind. She also is a very smart girl and has very brilliant ideas.(Matilda) is a humorous book? The way ROALD DAHL explains how Matilda takes revenge is extraordinary. He shows it in a funny way. He shows how smart Matilda is, but also how creative she can be. In some parts the story can be sad, like when her parents accuse her of things she never does.I recommend this book to young readers because I think they will this book very fascinating.

One part was whenMrs.Trunchbull walked up to a girl with pigtails, picked her up by her pigtails, then launched her overan iron gate. She landed in the field of flowers next to the school.The whole book was great. Matilda's parents could have been a little nicer and theTrunchbull could have been a lot nicer. The funniest parts of the book was when Matilda played allthose jokes on her parents. The funniest one in my opinion was when Matilda put super glue and it stuck to his head. In my head I could imagine Mrs.Wormwood cutting the hat off her husband's head and then him having a pale ring around his head. That part put a smile on my face.I would recommend this book to someone who that enjoys reading a funny book because this book has many funny parts to it.

I can relate to this story in many ways because there are many times when i feel as if my parents and sisters make me feel as im the odd one, and they just dont take me seriously.Matilda was never tooken seriously and was told and shown in some cases that she would never amount to anything. In my family if you act funny in any way my dad would find a way to make fun of you. Matilda never really saw her family and at points they didn't even realize she existed.Some things which were unbeleivable to me were the exaggerated points in the story were Matilda mysteriously had powers. Things would break or move and she was making it all happen with her mind. For example in the book during class Matilda had proven to her teacher Mrs. Honey that she had powers by moving a pitcher of water with out her hands and later Ms. Honey enjoyed her wonderful gift of powers. I think this book was a little exaggerated but very entertaining."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Matilda By: Roald Dahl Reviewed by N.Thakor Period 1This story is about a young girl who is magnificently gifted. She is very smart indeed from when she was just a little baby. Her favorite hobby was reading books. Her parents never supported her. They always thought she was wise alek and a troublemaker. Unbeknownst to them she was one of the smarteset children on earth and could use her noggin to move things with her mind telepathically. Her father finally gave in and he told matilda she could go to a real school. The teacher was very nice and her name was ms.honey. The meanest teacher of all was ms. trunchbull. She was the principal and lived to torture students. Matilda and ms. honey both hated her and they used their special talents to make ms. truncbull's life so miserable, she never came to the school again. In the end Matilda went to live with ms. honey and they both lived happily ever after.I really liked the book beacause it spoke to me in a way only spoke some books could. The moment I picked up the book i was immediatley hooked to it. I looked up at the clock it was 4:00 P.M and i started reading at 1:00 P.M! I loved this book because this is kind of the way my life is. A lot of people think i am just a weirdo, but i am really smart and funny once you get to know me. Overall I really liked this book because it related to me personaly and emotionaly.To tell you the truth, i really didnt find anything bad or anything to critisize in the truly magnificent book Matilda. I thought everything was ship shape and were it needed to be. I am not a real picky person about books, if i think it is agood book , even though some parts stink, i still finish it. Even from someone else;s point of view this book was good beacause it had everything a powerful novel needed and more. This is defenietly one of the best pieces of literature i have ever read in my life so far.My favorite part of the book was when Matilda found out she had mental powers. It was like opening up a sequel to the book beacause so many things happened when she found out she had the power to move things with her mind. On that basis, hte entire book changed dramatically, and it opened a whole new world for matilda and her friends. Ms. Honey invited Matilda to her home and told her thar the trunchbull was her aunt, and this shocked matilda deeply. You see, just on that one scene in the book the entire story and plot changed, that was my favorite part of this magnificent book."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Very interesting, and intreging.

This book is about a super genius girl who has trouble at school with her principal, Miss Trunchbull. When Matilda goes to school she makes friends with her teacher whose name is Miss Honey. Matilda soon finds out that Miss Honey is Miss Trunchbull's niece. You can never be too small to be a hero, is a message in Matilda because Matilda saves her teacher from the meanest principal there could ever be. I would like to trade places with Bruce Bogtrotter because he has the chance to eat a 12 inch chocolate cake and when they described the cake it sounded good. The Trunchbull represents fierceness because when the Trunchbull is in the story she is ill tempered. I like the character Lavender because she is funny and clever. She is funny and clever when she put a newt in the jug and it bites the Trunchbull. It was clever to volunteer to be the watergirl. Before I read this book I thought a little girl couldn't beat a very mean principal in battle but now that I read this book my schema has changed.

Her parents always made her do all of the work. They also bossed her around. For example, they wouldn't even let her read a book in peace. One day, she got sick of the way her parents treated her.

Then the parrot started speaking, and they thought it was a ghost. It was funny because even the father screamed like a little girl. That was hilarious.

Our beloved author is able to create a perfect blend of magic, mayhem, and mystery all in one novel again! Our friend, Mr. Dahl, is an expert at creating a sense of magic in his stories without detracting too much from the main plot, and this story is no different. He has also perfected the craft of creating charming, interesting, and developed characters, even as he presents them for children.The story begins with the explanation of Matilda being born into rather degenerate parents, and they are quite degenerate in many aspects. It is an interesting twist on the trope of children always being lumped with guardians which have less or no blood relation to them, such as the \\"evil step-parent\\" syndrome presented more often than not in stories. No! These are her actual parents! How upsetting! Little Matilda exerts traits of brilliance, but sadly they are stifled by her parents ideals of the important aspects of life in their eyes. \\"Who needs books when you have television?\\" If you thought her parents were atrocious, feast your eyes upon the terrifying Trunchbull.Trunchbull seems as if it were some sort of monster, right? Spot on! She is the headmaster of Matilda's school, and a powerhouse as well, but not in a good sense in the slightest. When she is not practicing her shot-put, she flings around little girls by their pigtails. When she is not belittling heavy-set children for their eating habits, she puts Matilda's worth of a person under a calculator! How horrific! How will Matilda combat against all these evils? Roald Dahl has discovered a clever way that will keep children believing that someday they will accomplish the same as Matilda does!As I read this when I am older, this book brings into light more aspects about it which I had not seen when I was younger. It is incredibly interesting how Matilda settles her conflicts and how the use of magic is applied in this story. The use of magic is unlike other stories of which I am familiar. To keep myself from spoiling, it is incredibly interesting how the conflicts are settled in quite non-violent fashions. These methods are fantastic messages to convey to children as many of them would believe that violence could settle most problems, and especially so with the types of antagonists presented in the story. In a way, the antagonists are also presented in such a fashion that one cannot help but feel sympathy towards them, and this is simply because of how void of compassion and intelligence they can be.Compared to Dahl's other works, this story is one of the more realistic ones. Magic is apparent, but it is not a terribly powerful force nor is it common in Matilda's world. With this realistic setting, this story can allow children to connect with it and feel quite immersed. I would recommend this book to anyone of any age. The story presents itself in such a fashion where children who read for entertainment and literary scholars can enjoy it alike."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"This is my seven year old's favourite book. It is not a good read aloud, but perfect for a good reader to curl up with. Dahl's adult characters are mainly the usual grotesques and Matilda is a joy to read.I love the way Dahl never compromises. He writes tension. And scary scenes. Plot is always well paced. Vocabulary is challenging enough. My daughter keeps a notebook for jotting down unknown vocabulary - albeit pronunciation or meaning! Realistically, this would be unsuitable for under sevens - as the unknown vocab would be way too much!Now a classic - but do yourself a favour - do not use it as a read aloud at a young age. It should be savored as a juicy morsel when reading to oneself.Suitability 7- 12 years."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Matilda, by Roald Dahl\\"Matilda\\" may be my ultimate favorite of Roald Dahl's books, but that's probably because I'm a voracious reader, just like the title character.Matilda is an oddity in her household - she prefers books to television - but aside from that, her parents don't really like her. They treat her nastily, and as a child, she doesn't have many options for revenge. But as with all Dahl books, she takes matters into her own hands, using her amazing intelligence to pull some creative pranks on her parents.But Matilda's brain power really comes in when she wants to rescue Miss Honey, her school teacher, from a truly despicable situation. If you haven't read the book I won't spoil it. It's a very fun and creative story.The illustrations by Quentin Blake are the icing on the cake for me in \\"Matilda;\\" normally I don't look much at pictures, but I rather like all of the illustrator's images. They add to Dahl's already excellent book.5/5."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Matilda was (and still is) one of my favorite childhood movies. I remember going to watch it in theaters when it came out and watched it endlessly when it came out in VHS. So, when I found this book at my thrift store for a dollar, I absolutely had to pick it up.Matilda was just an amusing, captivating read. At once, you have a heroine you can root for and just love to pieces because she's so unique. As I was reading, I kept picturing the parts happening in the book as they were in the movie. (For example, the part where one of Matilda's classmates are singing the 'difficulty' poem and Trunchbull yells \\"Why are all these women married?!\\" That's seriously my favorite part of the movie and this part of the book had me in stitches, too.) The book was not only cute, but it was pretty funny. Some parts had me chuckling a little, but most parts had me laughing out loud.Even though I enjoyed this book immensely, I still have to say that I love the movie a little bit more. I think it's mostly a nostalgia thing. I just loved all the actors who portrayed the characters in the movie. I also loved movie\\"Miss Honey\\" more than book\\"Miss Honey\\" and I sympathized more with movie\\"Matilda\\" than with book\\"Matilda\\".All of that being said, Matilda is still a keeper on my shelf. I think this is one book that I'm going to find myself re-reading for comfort (just as I rewatch the movie) and on those rainy days when you just want to read something familiar. I definitely can't wait until my sister's a little bit older so that she can read Matilda. I definitely recommend this book to children and adults (especially if those adults have kids...). It's really an enjoyable read for all ages."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Ever since I was seven years old, in a classroom with my friends reading this book together, \\"Matilda\\" has been my favorite book of all time. Taking place in a English community in the late nineteen hundreds, Matilda lived unnoticed in others' lives. That is, until she asks her father for a book. Her parents, who didn't appreciate Matilda as a daughter, looked upon her as nothing. When Matilda finally goes to primary school at the age of 5, her teacher, Miss Honey, finds incredible intelligence in this small girl. Through this story, the principal, Miss Trunchbull, tortures kids with their parents unknowing. Even the slightest thing ticks her off and she will explode in any moment. Matilda uses her brains against her, when she finds a hidden power within her eyes that makes her able to move things with her thoughts. When Miss Honey reveals that Miss Trunchbull is her aunt, and that she has taken everything that her father left for her, Matilda formulates a plan to get it all back. By posing as Miss Honey's late father, Magnus, Matilda \\"chases\\" Miss Trunchbull out of the city. It ends, of course, happily, with Matilda's parents giving her away to Miss Honey, where they live happily ever after. I recommend this book to people of all ages, from seven to a hundred and two, because this heartwarming tale brings all together.Like his other books, Roald Dahl puts fantasy and magic into a book that would otherwise depict the life of a normal child. He comes up with Matilda's powers, the Witches' alienation from others, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory's grandeur to give us readers an amazing collection of storybooks that we can all enjoy."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"This story takes place at Matilda's school and home in England. Matilda is a very smart girl and with magic power. She went to school and made friends with the teacher. The story talks about all the things happen at school. I love Matilda because she is not just smart, but she is brave too. This book is very funny and scary at the same time. It contains some magic too. IF you like funny story, I bet you will like this one. I highly recommand this book to you."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"By Roald Dahl standards, this is a fairly \\"normal\\" book. That's not to say it's dull or predictable, it's just that it doesn't have any giants, enormous peaches, fantastical chocolate factories, or any of the other wild elements in Dahl's books.What this book does have is a likable little girl (Matilda), her caring teacher, her uncaring parents and, especially, Miss Trunchbull.Miss Trunchbull is the over-the-top evil headmistress of Matilda's school and you just love to hate her. There's no shades of gray here. Miss Trunchbull punishes students by locking them in a dark closet lined with broken glass. She throws students over fences. She screams relentlessly at them: \\"You festering gumbol! You fleabitten fungus!\\"I read this book to my 7-year-old son, and my 9-year-old daughter read ahead on her own at about the same time. We all enjoyed it. It's a nice story, with enough surprises to keep us going.I think kids - girls especially - can relate well to Matilda. While some parents might not like that Matilda plays tricks on her mother and father (even if they deserve it), the book has the admirable message that reading is good. And my kids certainly appreciate their school principal more after reading about Miss Trunchbull."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Matilda Wormwood is no ordinary girl - at the age of three she taught herself to read. Since then, she has been devouring books just as other children devour candy. Books fascinate the little girl since she delights in discovering new worlds and meeting new and amazing characters. However, her parents don't seem to appreciate Matilda's vocation as they are too preoccupied with watching TV and scamming other people. Thus, when the little girl finally attends school, she is happy to have found a friend in her kind teacher, Miss Honey, who immediately recognizes that Matilda is a special child. But when Miss Honey tries to speak to the headmistress regarding Matilda's outstanding learning abilities, the cruel and frightening Miss Trunchbull doesn't believe Miss Honey, since she despises children. As Matilda discovers that she possesses even greater abilities, the little girl is determined to use her extraordinary tricks in order to defend the helpless and to fight for justice.Matilda is such a wonderful and delightful book about a young girl with amazing abilities and a great sense of justice. This lovely book is packed with charm, intelligence, warmth and magic and I loved everything about it as Matilda delivers some very important messages to everyone out there! Matilda is a brave young girl who is ready to fight for justice at all cost; she is not afraid of anyone and is willing to do everything in order to help those who are weak and who cannot stand up for themselves. That just shows how great this little girl is and others really can learn a lot from her. I loved Matilda's courage, her enthusiasm for books and her drive for knowledge and I think that she sets a perfect example for other children.I must admit that I have watched the movie Matilda quite a few times without even knowing that the book existed. But when I checked out Roald Dahl's books, I discovered Matilda and I was eager to read it, as I love the movie. And I am so glad that I had the opportunity to read this beautiful book, as I think that it's even better than the movie. Matilda is now one of my favorite books and I can't wait for my daughter to grow up so we can read this book together.When I finished reading this book, I was very sad, as I wanted to read more about this little girl and her adventures. Actually, I was so sad that I had to hug this book a few times! Luckily, Roald Dahl has written many books, and I plan to read some of them in the future.Matilda is a charming story about friendship, courage and justice, and I highly recommend it to everyone book lover out there and to everyone who wants to read a book with a positive and conscious theme."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Matilda is probably one of my top 5 books. This book would inspire children to do well in school. But just like in Calvin & Hobbes you might get some mean children doing terrible pranks on adults. I would recommend this book to older elementary school kids that are looking for a good book to read."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"The book is about Matilda who is a kind, clever, little girl who has a benevolent teacher called Miss Jenny Honey. It details her life with horrible, cruel parents and the head teacher Miss Agatha Trunchbull.Matilda has some incredibly hilarious and entertaining parts that I was laughing at even when I was asleep! One example is when Miss Trunchbull said, \\"I've got eight coconuts, eight monkey nuts and eight nutty idiots like you\\", as part of a weekly test in Maths. Sometimes kids get back at the head by tying knots in her enormous shorts and putting itching powder in them, so that she jigs and scratches her privates during prayer time!!!!!My favourite chapter is the Platinum-Blond Man where Matilda's scruffy, black-haired dad accidentally dyes his hair blond! The ending reminds me of the ending of Roald Dahl's Cinderella where she gets married to a honey man. Both stories end with the unlucky character changing family and having a happy ending.I highly recommend this book for 8-9 year olds who enjoy fun and hilarious adventures and give it 5 stars.by Arantxa Flores Gonzaga, age 8"},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"I read this book many years ago in elementary school, and this book is as classic as ever. The movie is wonderful, but honestly, if you're going to watch a movie, might as well read the book that it was derived from, since books ARE usually better than their film counterparts.There's plenty of comedic situations, and the illustrations also add to it even though I DO feel that the art could have been better. This is a nice classic of a kid with an extraordinary gift and flourishing despite her circumstances due to finding outlets for her curiosity. This would make a great gift for anyone who loves to read, especially a kid."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Purchased this for my grand daughter and she was delighted. Arrived on time as promised. Would buy from this seller again."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"MATILDABy Peter RussellMatilda is a little girl with a massive amount of brainpower. She gets into trouble with the Trunchbull often. Matilda is an unlikely hero trough out the story. She is an unlikely hero because she used her eyes to save her teacher from her dreadful aunt and head mistress of the school. I think the message is you can be a hero no matter how small you are because... (Like I've said before, she saved her teacher!) If I could trade places with one of the characters from the book it would be Matilda because she can move stuff with her eyes and I would want to make a pencil write by itself. I think Ms. Honey represents kindness and sweetness. Matilda...she represents a FEMALE EINSTIEN!!!!!! I think the title is good for the book because it's the main character's name. Before, I thought Matilda was 8 or 9 years old, now I changed my schema and now I know she is 5 years old. I recommend this book to boys and girls of ages 7-10, for grades 1-5 because the book is very long language and there are certain chapters that are hard to understand. I give this book a five star rating."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"The book I am reviewing is Matilda and written by Roald Dahl. I think this book deserves five stars because every page, the book got more exciting. This book is about a small young child that gets treated horribly throughout home and sometimes school time. Her parents don't care about her and they're jealous, since she's very smart. Her teacher is the only person in the world that treats her how she wants to be treated. A problem that occurs in this story is that her family wants to move to Spain, when her life's perfect. I'd recommend this book to my teacher. Other books written by this author include James and the Giant Peach and Danny Champion of the World.Emerson, NJ Fifth Grade Student"},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"MatildaBy: Ronald DahlThe main character is Matilda and she is a very smart young lady and lives a life where it is like she is invisible.

But she will soon discover that she has more powers then she thinks. Matilda has many problems one is that she loves books and her parents love the television and hates books, they are complete opposites. Matilda wants to go to school but her parents think she is only 4 years old! The worst part is that her father made a deal with the meanest school principle and she is still glad she is going! This story mainly starts at a small town near a terrible school but the date is anemones. This story is made mostly to tell children that no matter how rough life gets there is always a great power in side us.

She is only four years old, but she can read books. And also, she already knew two-times table before she went to school. Her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Wormwood, were really mean to Matilda. When she was five years and half, she started to go to primary school. Her teacher, Miss. Honey, is kindhearted teacher. But her school's headmistress, Miss. Trunchbull, is mean person. She hates little children.Matilda always made me feel exciting. Especially when she gave tit for tat to her parents and Miss. Trunchbull. And Miss. Honey made me feel worm when she was helping Matilda from Miss. Truchbull's mean behavior. And I like Matilda and Miss. Honey's kindhearted mind. Even Matilda is genius, everyone never be jealous. I think every classmates like Matilda's kindness mind.I like this book. Actually I don't really like reading books. But this book, Matilda, never make me feel boring. This book is one of my favorite book. When I started to read this book, I couldn't stop reading it. I could see that Roald Dahl was telling everyone not to be mean adult like Miss. Trunchbull. The person who like reading novel, may like this book, Matilda. Someday, I will try other book written by Roald Dahl."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"This book is about a young four year old who has the mind of a 7th grader. Her name is Matilda.

This book is defenetly for people with a sense of humor. it would be for 4th, 5th, and 6th graders."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"When I started reading the book, it was almost impossible for me to stop reading. The most important characters were Matilda, Mr. Wormwood, Mrs. Wormwood, Miss. Honey, and Mrs. Trunchbull. I love when Mrs. Trunchbull thought Matilda put a fish in her jug when it was Lavender who did it. And when Matilda lifted a piece of chalk with her eyes and made Mrs. Trunchbull faint, Oh! I love that part! I think the people who would like the book would be children of all ages."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"This book is about a girl who lives with her parents who are very mean to her.

Later in the story she gets really angry and knocks a glass of water over with her eyes onto the mean and evil Trunchbull. Miss Honey, Matilda's teacher, is the only one that knows about Matilda's power. I give this book four stars. I liked this book because Matilda found out she has special powers. I would recommend this book to you if you like really funny stories, and you're between 9 and 13. Just read this book you'd probably love it."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Matilda was born into a family that loved TV. By the age of two she already loved learning. She could already read by a very young age. Her parents didn't approve of reading and learning.When she finally went to school, her principal was very strongbut mean. The good part about school was her teacher Mrs. Honey,and she found out she had powers. She uses her powers to stop her principal. If you want to find out what happens, I think you should read it. I think you should read all the Roald Dahl books;they are really great."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"This is a good book that I personally liked because of the vivid description and the humor. For example, when Matilda is playing a prank on her father and I can see her putting super glue into his hat clearly in my mind and the idea was wonderful. He then had to shave his head to get the hat off.In this book, young Matilda, is despised by her parents. While most parents think their child is a little angel, her's think she's a little devil. She taught herself to read and is a genius. She uses her gift to get back at those who ruined her life.I would recommend this book for anyone who likes funny, clever books, or is a fan of Roald Dahl."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Matilda is a little girl that since she was little loved to read books.

Matilda did not get to go to school until she was about 6 because her dad did not like school. Matilda was ancies to go to school but when she got there she did not spected what she saw. There she met a nice teacher called Miss. Honey which was the only person that was nice to her."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"I think that Roal Dahl did an extremely excellent job on putting together this childrens book. I first read this book as a fifth grader in my middle school. I immediately fell in love with this book after I read it. I can say that I have read the book at least ten times, and each time it still gives me the same wonderful feeling I recieved as the first time I read it.Matilda was a very talented girl, whose parents did not realize it. At the young age of four, Matilda read all of the children's books that were in the library. Her very dysfunctional family could not understand why she always wanted to read and not want to watch television like them. When Matilda finally started schooL, one of her teachers, Ms. Honey, realized her wonderful ability and acknowledged it. Also when Matilda started school she had to dodge the school's most feared teacher Mrs. Trunchbull.She was known to throw children out of the window,or place them into what was call the \\"chokey\\". That was a room with sharp knifes and pins that could stick the children. Successfully Matilda dodged the horrible teacher each time. Her family did not accept the fact that she always read. Her father was very hard on her reading books,which Matilda loved to death.Matilda went on to spend as much time as she could with Ms. Honey. It seemed like Ms. Honey had been Matilda's real mother. She could never understand how she ended up with a family like that. Matilda's parents made Ms. Honey Matilda's baby-sitter. Both Ms. Honey and Matilda loved that idea, because both could enjoy the time together that they spend. Matilda's family decided that they wanted to move out of town. Matilda did not want to move with them, so she posed the question that Ms. Honey adopt her. Matilda's parents did not have a problem with that so they signed the papers and went on their merry little way.Dahl indeed out did himself on this one. This movie deserves five stars if anything for this book. It was put together in a well-written manner. I enjoyed every single second of the book and I could read that book almost everyday and get the same feeling."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"I think people should read the book Matilda by Roald Dahl because you can get hooked because of the author's creativity.A good thing about the book is that it is very detailed.

I can really see her ugly bottle-green stockings with turn-up tops and flat-heeled brogues with leather flaps.The book also gets interesting at some parts.

Because my parents posessed little money, I was used to the idea of not getting anything frivolous other than on my birthday or Christmas. Needless to say, I was surprised when my mother asked me which one I wanted. She told me she was proud of me for never getting into trouble and for getting good grades at school, so she thought I deserved to get something, even if money WAS tight. Looking over shelf after shelf of books, I spotted a group of books that looked somehow familiar. The year before, I had been introduced to chapter-books, starting with a short book entitled \\"Fantastic Mr. Fox\\", by Roald Dahl. I had loved that book so much that not only did I finish it before the rest of my class, but I read it twice before giving it back. So when I saw these groups of books by the same author, I knew I had to pick one. All of them looked good, but the one that stood out the most was \\"Matilda\\". I read the first 5 pages just standing there. This was the book. I had to have it. At only the age of 9, I read that entire book in only four days. Since then, I have read it more times than I can count. At the age of 20, I have introduced the very same copy to my 10-year-old niece and she, too, is hooked. To date, I have found no other book, (children's novel or adult), that has given me more joy to read than \\"Matilda\\".

That book couldn't be a movie, it is a book. &quot;Matilda&quot; IS A BOOK AND NOT A MOVIEWhy din't it get 10?

Roald Dahl was a great storyteller and is truly missed"},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"The happenings of Matilda are what every kid dreams of having"},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Originally published in 1988, \\"Matilda\\" was one of the last books author Roald Dahl wrote before his death in 1990. Most authors as they age become more cynical and dour. Think of the final writings of Dickens or Twain and how bitter they seemed in their late years. Then look at \\"Matilda\\". Here we have a sweet charming little piece of literature about a girl that is both good and interesting. Creating characters that you identify intrinsically with is not only difficult but (in children's books) sometimes near impossible. Reading \\"Matilda\\", it becomes clear that Roald Dahl never lost his touch for creating wonderful original characters and situations.The heroine of this little book also carries its name. Matilda is incredibly intelligent, even as a small child. Living with her boorish parents and oblivious brother, she teaches herself to read from the various magazine and newspapers lying about the house. Her parents are completely indifferent to their only daughter and it is only by playing small tricks on them when they've been particularly nasty that little Matilda is able to keep a hold on her sanity. By age five and a half Matilda has read all the children's books in the library and quite a few of the adult ones as well. On entering school for the first time, our protagonist comes face to face with a very worthy enemy. The Head Teacher, Miss Trunchbull, is the worst kind of dangerous violent adult. It is only through Matilda's cleverness that she is able to come to the aid of her teacher, Miss Honey, and save the school from the Trunchbull's insanity.As I mentioned before, Matilda is just the nicest kid ever. Intelligent without ever becoming pig-headed. Nice without becomes precious. She's just a swell child all around. Through her, Dahl takes some mighty fine cracks as his fellow kiddie lit authors. I was especially fond of the portion in which Matilda points out that though C.S. Lewis and Tolkien are fine writers, \\"There aren't many funny bits\\". And as we all know, Dahl is the master of the funny bit for kids. This book is chock full of them too. It contains all the usual peculiar Dahl touches (like kids being swung out of the playground by their pigtails) as well as practical jokes and nasty adults. The Trunchbull is perhaps THE nastiest adult ever to grace the pages of the Dahl world. Definitely unhinged, she abuses the children around her, coming just shy of actual physical contact. It is amazing then that Dahl doesn't dispatch of her in a violent or crazy fashion. She merely...disappears. Likewise Matilda's parents get their comeuppance by merely fleeing the country to Spain. Dahl was quite soft in his old age, it seems.Reading this book today I was struck by how much Lemony Snicket owes to Mr. Dahl. Not just the usual adults-are-nasty-cruel-and-possibly-batty take, but the narrative voice as well. It took me a couple minutes to realize that this was Dahl talking and not Mr. Handler. Illustrated by Quentin Blake, the book is perfectly complimented by the illustrators' insane imaginings and concoctions. The Blake/Dahl pairing is often inspired, and it works to its best advantage here. I can't imagine this book without Blake's particular little pointy nosed heroine gracing the pages. For those parents who either don't approve of Dahl or just don't \\"get\\" him, I think \\"Matilda\\" is the perfect story to win them over. You'd have to be pretty hard of heart not to love its little heroine and the troubles she gets into. A charming treat to be enjoyed for years to come."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"I'm out of the country with my 6 years old daughter for a week. When we travel together we always bring enough reading stuff, and our main book this time is Matilda - a fantastic book about a fantastic girl. I have read all of the Roald Dahl books for my kids several time, Matilda has always been and still is my favorite :-)Matilda is a small girl with extraordinary talents. Already when she is three years old she starts visiting the local library and reads all the books there, starting with the children's books, keeping on with the world classics. Matilda's parents are very neglective, and refuse to see any of Matilda's talents. But Matilda is a fighter and finds her own very creative and very funny ways to get revenge.Matilda is a funny book, showing a girls fight for her individuality, in a typical RoaldDahlish way. I love it, and all my kids have loved it as well. My youngest daughter is only six, and should be a little too young for the book. But still the book works perfectly for her. The chapters are quite long, but none of us manage to stop after just one chapter. Being on holiday, we can sleep long in the mornings, and can read for a long time in the evenings.An extra pluss with the book is all the fantastic recommandations of future books it gives us. Dahl has made a wonderful list of the books Matilda read at the library.Britt Arnhild Lindland"},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"I think Roald Dahl is the best children's author ever! I'm 20, and I still read his books. Matilda tells the story of a little girl genius. Matilda taught herself to read from the newspapers lying around her house when she was a baby and she practically exhausts the local library's collection before she even begins school. She is an extraordinary child, but she's not just smart. She has a daring vengeful streak... She gets excellent revenge on her father for horrid things he says to her. Once, he even tears up her library book. You really can't help but laugh and cheer for her when she gives the bad guys a dose of their own medicine!Dahl's gift for inventing extraordinarily horrid characters is exercised beautifully in this story. Matilda's father is a cheating used car dealer, and her mother regularly leaves 4-year-old Matilda home alone all afternoon so that she can play Bingo in the next town. The Headmistress Trunchbull even throws a small girl across the playground by her pigtails! Matilda's parents ignore her, the Headmistress is a holy terror, and Matilda's only comfort is her kind teacher, Miss Honey. After the Headmistress, AKA the Trunchbull, does some particularly horrid things to the students and Miss Honey, Matilda uses her extraordinary brain to take back some of their own...Like most of Dahl's books, there is an undeniable element of cruelty woven into this story-- but this is the best kind of cruelty! When the good guys win, like they always do in Dahl's books, kids cheer on the fall of the real evil.Matilda is my favorite Roald Dahl book, but The BFG and The Witches are close runners-up. I highly recommend all of his books!"},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"I confess -- I love the book \\"Matilda.\\"A total fantasy novel lies behind the mask of a British school tale.Roald Dahl crossed the line into the utterly unbelievable by making his villains so incredibly bad. It's preposterous, and funny. So while this is a book that prominently features bullying, intimidation, horrible insults, and violent mistreatment of children, it isn't scary at all -- instead, it is funny.It's the vocabulary words and the quality of the writing that get me. Superb.As a read-aloud mom, who can read it and share the laughs with my family, I love this book. Still, I have to caution parents to pre-read it before you give it to your children. There is over-the-top anger, name-calling, and violence directed at kids -- and the kids take revenge in dangerous and harmful ways. We treat this the same way we treat Tom and Jerry or Sylvester and Tweety bird -- total fantasy. Don't behave like that. Isn't it funny?Parents are the best judges. Give it a try.Parent notes: truly awful name-calling, raging adults, parental abandonment, revenge against adults, mixing chemicals for revenge, lots of Forbidden Words, and a nice message in there about practice gets you to your goal."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"I read this book when I was 6, now 8 years later I still remember the content very well. A little girl who was a genius but his parents never discovered it, they never cared much about her at all. At school, Mrs Trunchbull, was an extremely mad and unresonable headmaster who threw school children up the air just for fun.Although the environment Matilda grew up in wasn't nice at all, she met her class teacher(err..forgot her name), who appreciated her talent and gave sympathy to her situation.Later, Matilda discovered that she had supernatural powers and used it to teach Mrs.Trunchbull a lesson, and the headmaster was nowhere to be seen again after she fleed from her house in a hurry. Matilda'a father, because of selling old cars dishonestly, had to escape from the country as well. Matilda offered to stay in her teacher's house and so they lived happily ever after.I just love the stories told by Roald Dahl, his stories always fascinate me, his words are suitable for children and the stories are full of imagination."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"The book Matilda has the characters Matilda, her brother, her mother, her father, Mrs. Honey, Mrs. Trunchbull, Lavender, and Amanda. Matilda is the main character. Her parents took her as a mistake. They didn't like her at all. In fact when they got home from the hospital, they forgot her in the car. But Matilda is very smart. She learned how to take care of herself when she was about 4 - 6 the way that people would take care of themselves in their early 30's. In the morning her parents would go off to work and leave her nothing but cold uncooked soup on the stove. She would dump that and make herself pancakes. Then she would take the long trip to the library to read some books. Her parents had miserable jobs. Her father sold cheap old cars that weren't worth what he charged them. Her mother went off and played bingo. Matilda's father finally sent her to school. The principal at the school was very mean. She put children in a closet called the chokei and there were nails sticking in it and she locked it so they couldn't get out. Since her parents were very mean to her at the end Matilda's teacher Mrs. Honey adopted her. They both lived very happily for the rest of their life's. This book takes place in the present and most events occur when Matilda is in school. She acquires almost the entire school as her friends, even the older kids. When she was in school Mrs. Trunchbull made a boy called Bruce Bogtrotter eat a whole cake in front of an assembly of kids. Matilda cheered him on the whole time. along with everyone else. All together this book is a very good book,. and very, very exciting."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"One of the last novels written before Roald Dahl's death, \\"Matilda\\" reads almost like a goodbye, with a thank-you to all the authors that have touched Dahl during his lifetime - the text even includes a reading list of books recommended to Matilda - and through her, to the reader. And Matilda herself, despite being female, could very well be a reflection of Dahl himself as a child: a precocious bookworm with a fascination with words, people and places. As such, \\"Matilda\\" holds a special place in the canon of Dahl's literature for children, and Matilda herself is one of those shining characters that you simply wish was a real person and your friend. It is a rare thing indeed for an author to not only create a character who has practically no faults, and yet never becomes a goody-two-shoes or implausibly perfect, but to give her a remarkable gift (in this case, her hyper-intelligence) and make it seem less important than her goodness, her loyalty, her sense of justice and her love of learning.Matilda Wormwood is born to two rather awful parents who have no interest whatsoever in their young daughter, instead pouring all their attention into their work, (for Mr Woodworm) bingo, (for Mrs Wormwood) and occasionally their first-born son Michael. However, they are mean-spirited enough to take umbridge at the sight of Matilda indulging her great love for reading. To get back at them (and to keep her own sanity) Matilda engages in a series of practical jokes every time her parents are beastly or dishonest - which happens on a rather regular basis.But all of that changes when she starts school and Matilda meets the two most important women in her life: the lovely Miss Honey and the terrible Miss Trunchball. The gentle and timid Miss Jennifer Honey is Matilda's adored teacher, whereas Miss Trunchball is the Headmistress of Crunchem Hall Primary who terrifies student and teacher alike. Miss Trunchball may be a rather unfortunate stereotype of a butch, unattractive, athletic woman, but as an incarnation of psychotic feminine rage, she comes second only to Lewis Carroll's Queen of Hearts. More a force of nature than an actual person, she's sure to send a shudder down any child's spine - however bad your teacher is, you can be sure she's not *this* bad!It soon becomes clear that the students of the school are waging a war against Miss Trunchball, one that Matilda is all-too-keen to become a part of when she realizes that there is a mysterious link between her beloved Miss Honey and the tyrannical Trunchball. And it just so happens that around this time, Matilda finds that she has a remarkable ability: to move things with her mind. Being a moralistic girl as well as an intelligent one, she soon realizes that she now has the perfect tool with which to restore Miss Honey to her former fortune and deliver Miss Trunchball her just desserts.The text is full of allusions to other books and stories, making it a remarkably rich read for a children's book (and will hopefully get young readers interested in other books - as I'm sure was Dahl's intention) and of course includes plenty of Dahl's trademark love for the grotesque and macabre, components that have always made him controversial in the adult community, and beloved in the child's world. But even more in \\"Matilda\\", there is a sense of the spiritual and the sublime - Matilda's emerging powers seem to not only stem from her intelligence, but from her great spirit as well, particularly when she describes her powers as feeling like: \\"flying past the stars on silver wings.\\" With justice served in the guise of a tiny five year old (captured perfectly in the illustrations by long-time Dahl collaborator Quentin Blake), and an ending that manages to be both happy and bittersweet, \\"Matilda\\" is a must for any children's bookshelf."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"It's only fair that this book be mentioned in comparison to the Harry Potter books, since this book is similar in tone, character, and sheer genius. In fact, MATILDA is probably the predecessor to Harry Potter, and deserving of as much praise and admiration.Matilda is a girl who doesn't jibe with her parents, is despised by the school principal, Ms. Trunchbowl, and has a wonderfully sweet teacher named Miss Honey. Oh, and Matilda just happens to have special powers. This book follows Matilda in her search for friendship, approval, and the key to her magical powers.The tone in this book is whimsical and magical, with a huge helping of humor and outrageousness. The characters are strong and entertaining, and the story is engaging. This book is a must read for fans of Roald Dahl's other books, specifically CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, as well as fans of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"This is a very interesting and exciting book. It talks about a young girl who would rather read a book and go to school than to stay home all day and look at televisioon. This girl has a very tuff life at first, until she finds a person, her teacher, who's life isn't very much different than hers. Matilda's parents are people who love to watch telivison all day long and they only care about money. Her parents really don't appreciate her that much. They wanted her to be exactly like them. She has a brother who takes after her parents. Her teacher believes that Matilda is a very young educated girl for a child who is in a way neglected. Her teacher knows exactly what Matilda is going through, since she lost her parents at a young age and had to live with her wicked aunt. This book teaches us that no matter how tuff life can be you can always find happiness one way or another. I think that this book is a very good book. It is also very exciting. I give this book five stars. The reason I give this book five stars was because I never really thought that a kid could love to read and go to school. This book taught me to appreciate things more. For example, I am very lucky to have parents that would allow me to read and would allow me to go to school. This book really influenced me and I'm sure that it would influence a lot of young children out there."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Looking back on my twenty-three years, I remember the first time I was introduced to Dahl's writing. I was in the fifth grade, and our teacher was reading us \\"The Twits.\\" From that day on I did my best to read all of his books. Matilda was always my favorite.This book shows perfectly the differences in Dahl's writings when compared to others. Dahl was never afraid to create mean charecters that were exactly that. In Matilda we have a Headmistress that throws kids by their hair and locks them in a box that has broken glass and nail covered walls.Don't worry parents. Dahl isn't out to scare your children. What I love about his writings is how Dahl creates a story to show how no matter how big the bully is, they can always be overcome by a small child filled with determination and intelligence.I hope that every child has the ability to discover the world of Dahl. A world where it doesn't matter who you are, you can accomplish anything that you set your mind to. Where the unexplainable it explained. And where the life of an old english man touched the life of millions of children across the world.The world needs more Roald Dahls. May his life live on through those he's impacted."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"I loved reading Matilda. It was a fabulous children's book, especially for 4th grade kids. The story of Matilda is full of action and comedy. It keeps your interest and you won't want to put the book down. Matilda is about a young girl that is very smart and goes off to school and meets a horrible woman that the children call The Trunchbull. This woman is the Headmistress of the school that Matilda goes to. The Trunchbull is not nice and always has negative things to say. Matilda gets picked on a lot but when one of her classmates wears her hair in pigtails things get a little rough. The Trunchbull hates pig tails and catches the girl and reminds her \\"I hate pig tails.\\" She yells. But the little girl tells The Trunchbull, \\"My mommy thinks I look pretty.\\" Then The Trunchbull bellows back, \\"Your mommy is a twit.\\" Then she grabbed the girl by her pigtails and throws her over the playground fence into the courtyard. The poor girl just gets up and stutters away very sad.This book will make you laugh, feel sad, and keep you on your toes with lots of action from all the characters. But poor Matilda has it hard at school and at home. She loves to read. You feel really sad when she asks her Dad for a book. She finally get the courage and says \\"Daddy do you think you could buy me a book?\\" \\"A Book?\\" he said, \\"What do you need with a flaming book?\\" \\"To read Daddy.\\" \\"What's wrong with the telly for heavens sake?\\" \\"We've got a lovely telly with a 12 inch screen and now you come asking me for a book? Your getting spoiled my girl!\\" But that didn't stop Matilda she went to the library everyday when her mother would be at Bingo and her father would be at his car dealership. She read every single children's book and some adult ones too. Matilda teaches a great lesson that you can do anything if you set your mind to it. These are just a few of the wonderful , sad, funny and action packed moments that the book has to offer. it's a book for everyone young and old.Roald Dahl is a funny and very hilarious author. Dahl published Matilda a short amount of years before he died. Usually the stories that an author publishes before he dies are all sad, but not Dahl he keeps his books alive and comical. If you read Matilda you will learn many valuable lessons, laugh, and see things that don't happen to ordinary people. I want everyone to read Matilda because I guarantee you will love it! If you like Matilda you can read some other good books by Roald Dahl like, Fantastic Mr. Fox or James and the Giant Peach. I absolutely love Roald Dahls writing style.

Lots of strategies that people look for in a author. Buy this book and any other Roald Dahl book. HE'S AMAZING!!!"},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"The book my 6th grade class and I read was Matilda by Roald Dahl. The book was about a girl named Matilda Wormwood who was treated wrong by her family. Her mother Mrs. Wormwood was a weird lady who was addicted to playing bingo everyday. Matilda had an older brother Michael who wasn't very smart, and her father was a dishonest car salesman who lied to his costumers. Matilda's parents left her home alone as early as the age of 2, but she liked it that way because it was her quiet time to get away from her crazy family and read anything she could get her hands on.The main characters in the book were, Matilda, Jennifer Honey, Agatha Trunchbull, and Matilda's family. The students of Crunchem Hall, the school Matilda attended also played an important part of the book for me. At the age of six, Matilda was allowed to go to school and that is when she discovered she had a talent witch was to move or levitate objects with her brain.The favorite part of the story for me was when Matilda used her powers to get rid of Ms. Trunchbull, the principal of Crunchem Hall. Ms. Trunchbull was a very mean character in the story to the children. Another main character in the story that I liked was Jennifer Honey, Matilda's teacher. Ms. Honey was very nice to Matilda and treated her like a daughter, although she did not have children.I liked the book because you would never know what would happen next it always surprised you, I liked what happened to Matilda and miss honey at the end because kids deserve a good life and a good family. I believe that Matilda is a good book for all middle school kids to read because it is filled with magic surprises and it makes you laugh."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"I think that if I read Matilda when I was a kid I'd probably like it more. It was a good little read and highly recommended to children."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Anyone who has ever been a child stuck in an unfair situation -- and anyone who has an ounce of empathy for what that might feel like -- will appreciate this book. Matilda is a razor-sharp, witty, entertaining revenge fantasy.Dahl paints characters with exaggerated traits in the manner of melodrama: Matilda's slovenly, thickwitted, self-centered parents are super-obnoxious, her dastardly headmaster is super-awful and aims to make school a veritable fortress of humiliation and misery, even Miss Honey is super-sweet, super-patient and super-oppressed. This liberal sloshing-about style of characterization takes what might have been an unbearably hideous and painful story of abuse and trauma and transforms it magically into lively fodder for humor. Surrounded by and struggling with this outrageous cast, Matilda (herself a super-genius) is the most normal, levelheaded one of the bunch.Matilda is not only smart but inventive, resilient, and passionate in her quest for justice. Her larger-than-life difficulties provide the opportunity for a larger-than-life triumph: the disaster and sadism of Matilda's adversaries function in much the same way as Harry Potter's horrible adoptive family or Buffy Summers' high school social problems, as a framework for a wider narrative. This is not meant to be a realistic story but a colorful pastiche of the underdog coming out on top. Not without some reason, kids often feel like they have the short end of the stick, and Matilda's story is a way for them to identify with her satisfyingly silly and ultimately pretty harmless plans for revenge. Dahl delivers vividly and lovably."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"When I read this book, I was in third grade. Even if I was a senior in college it would have had the same effect on me.

Not only does her principal hate Matilda, but her family doesn't treat her well either. With the help of her teacher, Ms. Honey, Matilda uses her smart mind and special powers to make her's and many others' lives better.My favorite part in Matilda is when she uses her special powers to get Ms. Honey's house back. Agatha (Matilda's principal, also known as the Trunchbull) was the guardian of Jenny (Ms. Honey's first name) when her dad, Magnus, mysteriously passed away. The Trunchbull hid Magnus' will, stating that the house should be in Ms. Honey's hands. After Ms. Honey tells Matilda this story, Matilda makes a plan that will get Jenny's house back for sure. One day in class, when Agatha is teaching a lesson, Matilda uses her special powers to lift up the chalk with her eyes, and start writing on the chalkboard. \\"Agatha, this is Magnus. This is Magnus. And you better believe it. Give my Jenny her wages. Give my Jenny her house. Then get out of here. If you don't, I will come and get you. I will come and get you like you got me. I am watching you Agatha.\\" This makes the Trunchbull faint, right in the classroom, and after that, Ms. Honey got her house back, and Agatha left and never came back again.If you have seen and liked the movie, you should definitely read the book. The book is just like the movie, except the movie has a few differences, and extra scenes. I would recommend this book because it is funny, but also serious about the things Matilda has to deal with in her life. This book teaches people not to give up, and that anyone can achieve anything, if they put their mind to it. It is an inspiration to all of us. Matilda is an easy read, and I recommend it to anyone that reads adventure stories, because Matilda's journey is unforgettable."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"I loved this book because I just kept wanting to read more and more.It was so cool. I love it! The movie is cool too. The book had some kind of magical force that tempted me to read it.The trunchbull is hilarious and scaryMatilda is kind and smartMiss honey is understanding and lovingLavender is courageous and coolMrs. Wormwood is nicer than Mr wormwoodMr wormwood is really mean.I was laughing out loud when the newt hopped into the glass.It's really sad that miss honey was poor.My favorite character is Matilda because if you just talked a conversation about anything other than mathematics or school she would seem like an average four year old."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"I love Matilda. It is a nice story about a little girl with incredible talents and she is good at reading. She has horrible parents who do not like Matilda and refer to her as a scab. This is a really cool book. It is very funny. I hope everybody likes the story. This is written by a 8 year old girl."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Matilda has a horrible life. Even though her family thinks that she has the same value as dirt, she stays gentle, kind, and smart. When Matilda finally starts school, she feels like a bubble of joy. Unfortunately, her bubble got popped when she meets Ms. Trenchbull, her horrible principal, who abuses the students at her school. At school, Matilda finds out that she's incredibly smart. She makes many friends and has daring adventures, which all have to do with Ms. Truncbull. Soon she has her most exciting adventure with a very special, very unique power. If you want to find out more about Matilda's powers and her adventure, read the book &quot;Matilda by Roald Dahl. If you thought the movie's good, the book is even better! This is because it is so suspenseful that I couldn't put it down, and it made me laugh. It makes me thankful for my family, which is much nicer than Matilda's is. I recommend this book for people who love to read."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"I am an American middle school student living in Paris. I have just read the book Matilda by Roald Dahl. I thought it was a great book and I recommend this book to children 8-12 years old because it was very exciting and funny. I personally could not put the book down. The book is about a little girl with special powers which she uses to find happiness. I really liked the scene where Matilda hid the parrot in the chimney and pretended it was a ghost and scared the wits out of her parents. (I wish I could do that!)I found that the book was better than the movie because the author wrote in a very descriptive way, which was fun to read. The author used very colorful language full of metaphors and similes. The movie offered lots of action, but the book offers both exciting action and enjoyable reading.Finally, the illustrations are really a good match with the book. The really add to the experience."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"It's been a while since I've read Dahl's children's books, and I'd actually never before read _Matilda_. I remembered seeing advertisements for the movie version a few years ago, then forgot about it completely. Somehow, I ended up buying this book, just remembering how much one of my college roommates loved it, and find that I feel the same way. It is a wonderful book about a little girl who is more than just a prodigy at math and reading...she's almost like a kind old soul in a little girl's body. The way she temporarily escapes her mundane existence with the most annoying, awful parents there are reminds me of how I used to be a voracious reader, when I was young (not that I had awful parents, but I didn't particularly care for the school I went to). The book _Matilda_ provides a similar escape - suddenly, you're no longer in a small, overcrowded airport, waiting for your plane that's been delayed an hour. You're in the classroom of an English village, watching Matilda stun her teacher by doing complex calculations, and using that wonderful brain of hers to seek revenge on the horrible Miss Trunchbull, headmistress/ogre of the school. A brilliant book - one I would particularly recommend giving to a child who all too often feels powerless."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"With all the talk of the new Harry Potter series, I find it essential to bring attention back to Roald Dahl. I love the Harry Potter books and give them all 5 stars. However, I also realize many themes from Harry Potter have been covered by Dahl years before. After reading Matlida as a young child, I went out and tried to read any and all Dahl books. They are wonderful pieces of work and inspire. In an age where Harry Potter is becoming a classic, let's not forget the books which paved the way for Rowling. Matlida and Harry Potter are both great books, both classics."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Matilda by Roald Dahl is a children's book which could also be a book for any age.Not just Matilda, but any book by Roald Dahl recalls something that we forget in our normal lives. I am not quite sure &quot;why,&quot; but I can tell that there's something that makes you want to read books by Roal Dahl, and I am pretty sure that most of us enjoy and think that it is worth reading it. To tell the truth, Matilda wasn't my first book that I read in the series of books by Roald Dahl, but I chose to read this because I thought it was going to be valuable and worth while. If you were five years-old, what do you suppose your life would be like? Probably, most of us would agree that we would be dependent on our parents (for the most part) and self-centered (since children can be bossy). If you think you agree with this statement, you are actually lucky, you will realize how lucky you are if you get to know Matilda Wormwood, a five year-old girl. Matilda is a genius with idiot parents. Therefore, she can not be dependent on her parents, for there's no time for her to be self- centered. She was born into the situation that made her &quot;no ordinarily child;&quot; she can do two digit multiplication in her head, and read books like Dickens, at age five! Matilda has at least two big problems, which if you were an ordinarily child, would mean you would just put up with them. Living in the situation with idiots (who bother her) and the &quot;Trunchbull&quot; (the headmistress of the school were Matilda goes) whose hobby is to give children cruel treatment is quite a problem. However, Matilda handles these problems so well, that she actually will make the happy ending for the others and, of course, herself. To those of you who already have read Dahl's books, and have enjoyed reading them, I think you know what I mean by my statement that it is &quot;not just childrens' book.&quot; And to those of you who actually haven't read his (Dahl's) books, I encourage you to read one of his books at least one time to see if my statement was true."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Matilda is a story which any child would like. If you have seen the movie you will know thta it is the story about how this brainy child saves her teacher from getting caught up in a dead end. This is nothing like the movie though for one reason. It is miles better. It captures the imagination and everyone can look like what you want htem to look like. This book gives you a better indication of how Miss Trunchball really looks. This is a great book from Roald Dahl. But most of his books are. This is good because it keeps the excitement going and lets imaginations run wild."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Do you like exciting and mysterious books? If you do then you'll love Matilda?

It was read to me by my teacher Ms. LoCicero, and since I really liked the book, I ordered it. So if you ever want a book that's very interesting, imaginative, and/or fun to read, order this one!By a just 10 year old boy"},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"...have been fond of Roald Dahl ever since I read \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" in second grade, but I never got around to reading Matilda until now. This is a fantastic book, and is easily one of Dahl's best, with his trademark loveable, oddball characters and sense of invention and wonder...what startled me most about this book was that Dahl included some very mature themes in the final few chapters. Without giving away any plot twists (and believe me, there are some good ones here), the issue of child abuse is brought up. The characters don't dwell on it, but for a mature reader like myself who has seen children's entertainment deteriorate into mindless, sugar-coated garbage, it's refreshing to see such things mentioned. Young children will realize the seriousness of what is being said but won't be overtaken by it, which seems like the ideal way to make them aware of these issues. Thank you, Mr. Dahl, for reminding us of a time when children's stories could be both fun and meaningful.On a lighter note, I'm getting more used to Quentin Blake's new illustrations. While I'd still prefer to see copies of Dahl's novels with their original drawings, Blake's style fits Matilda quite well, and even gives Miss Honey her due and makes her really pretty.All in all, Matilda is a book for everyone, and adults will enjoy reading this book to their children."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Do you know some one who is smart and could do magic? I read the book Matilda. It was about a girl named Matilda. She was very smart and she was magical. It all happened in Worn wood's house. Every morning Matilda's mom would go to bingo and her brother would go to school every morning. Her mom would leave her alone. By that time she would know how to take care of herself. As you can see her mom would not take care of her. When she turned 4 years old she already knew how to read. Matilda's dad would work as a crook and he didn't care about school or reading a book instead he would stay watching T.V. I recommend this book because it is an interesting book and a funny book. I don't want to give the rest so if you want to find more about the book why don't you read the book!"},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Does anybody here like real funny books with great comparisons?

The thing is her parents are crazy! Her dad is a crook, and never thinks about education. Matilda's mom is addicted to bingo, and has the weirdest hair dye ever.... She also had an older brother Mike, who is just fascinated with his father's crook business. So, her family is a bit crazy, huh?When Matilda did enter school, she had the sweetest teacher ever, Ms.Honey. Ms.Honey soon found out how smart Matilda was, and went to the so very mean headmistress, the Trunchbull to tell her how Matilda needed to be in a higher grade. So, Ms. Honey had Matilda studying higher grade level books in class. I told you Matilda was smart.Matilda started going to Ms. Honey's for tea, and soon found out something very, very bad.

She taught herself to read and speak before she was four-years-old--all without the help of her lazy, ignorant parents or older brother, Michael--and goes on to develop telekinetic abilities. Her teacher, Miss Jennifer Honey, is impressed with Matilda's accomplishments, and with further tutoring, she helps the young girl master her spectacular gift. This gift later becomes useful when Matilda decides to save Crunchem Hall Primary School from the sadistic Headmistress, Miss Agatha Trunchbull, and free her favorite teacher (Miss Honey) from poverty.Like all of Roald Dahl's books, this was a breeze and delight to read, filled with lots of mature humor and fun games. The book was made into a movie in 1996, and although I never saw it, I'd encourage anyone who plans to watch it to read the book first. Generally, Dahl's books outshine the movie version. Highly recommended for 8 to 12+ year-olds."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"I wish I was Matilda.Matilda has magical power that can make things move.She is a very brainy kid but the bad thing was that she came from a disfunctional family.If I were her,I could play tricks on people and make them think that there is a ghost.And also I can relax my mind when it comes to any subject.I can read books every minute.I'll love to have her brainy little brain.I know she will be successful one day.I admire her for her brain.I said to myself,&quot;Wow,what a girl.&quot;.It's a pity her parents think that she is a scab when she is a genious.Luckily,she has a pretty and reliable teacher to confide her fear,happiness and misery.The best part of the story was when the headmistress,Miss Trunchbull had a newt on her blouse.She had to shake it off.Everyone in the class roared with laughter.The way she (danced) was so teribbly funny.I like Matilda because she is a wonderful girl."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"What a wonderfully funny story!

I never knew that this book was so much fun which I thought looked a little daunting when I was little. Indeed, the English was stupendous and maybe a little deep for a 10 year old. 13-15 would be much more a right age. The story is very much a fairy tale, and yet at the same time blended with wit, adventure and mystery wrapped together in a very much believable context. Although it's a little grimly to read about the violence of the Trunchbull. Watch the movie, starring Mara Wilson, you will love it. Makes a great Birthday or Christmas gift. It's not too early to shop for the holidays, is it?"},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Sweet. Zany. Creative. Each of these things describes the wonderful little girl named Matilda.

Matilda's mom and dad don't care about her school work or her love for books or even for her opinion, but she has hidden talents and secrets that come alive in her class at school.

She is very hateful and grim toward all of the children in the school. She also dislikes any bright colors or signs of happiness. Her teacher, however, is very insightful and caring. She is very fond of Matilda. In the end, Matilda is adopted by her teacher. They live happily ever after. This is a wonderful book for the primary age. It really holds the reader's attention. Also, children can relate to this book on a personal level. There are many different themes, which teachers can use to develop meaningful lessons for their students. It deals with family life and school life. It deals with social issues, along with personal issues. However, Dahl makes this book fun by giving Madeline these special powers.

It's full of crazyness and makes you wonder at the end of each chapter. If you're not nuts about reading, there is also a movie that gives you the same excitement as the book but even more. This book is about a young girl named Matilda. She has a really mean head misteris named Miss. Trenchbull. But she gets a teacher named Miss. Honey. At home she's a prankster to her parents who don't care what Matilda does or her education. But she wants to be a hero to her entire class, so Matilda play's a trick on the \\"Trenchbull\\" with Miss. Honey at her side and......... you'll find out what happens next if you read the book!The main characters in the book are: Matilda, Miss. Trenchbull, and Miss. Honey.Matilda is a young girl who has the meanest teacher in the world. She may be nice and sweet at school, but when she reaches home she's a little prankster.Miss. Trenchbull is Matilda's mean head misteris. She is 200 lbs. of kid-hating-disaster. If you do something bad to her, she will squash you like the little bug you are. (The little bug you are to her!)Miss. Honey is a teacher who NEVER raises her voice. She's a calm, settle, caring teacher who loves kids. She always knew when someone was nervous on the 1st day just by the expression on the kid's face.The main setting in the book is at Matilda's school. That's pretty much where everything happens. But there is a surprise setting that may surprise you. Maybe even burst your bubble. Some parts of the book are at the library and at Matilda's home.The main theme is survival. Just to remind you that if your not hot on reading books, or hot on reading books that give you jitters, there is also a movie that makes you get the jitters more. But anyways, the main theme is survival because when she tries to pull a prank on the \\"trenchbull\\" nothing goes right. Everything ends up not the way she planned it would be. But then at the end there is a happy ending that will, yes, give you another surprise.I would recommend this book to all of the kid's and or parents, or teachers who love a survival/adventure book. And including my friend Nalee, who's life if full of adventure. Even though she may not be \\"One of a Kind,\\" she is still my best friend, and the moment you see her, you will see that she is full of adventure!"},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"This story is about a brilliant 5 year old girl named Matilda that goes to Crunchem Hall Primary School.

However, she is stuck with ignorant, mean parents who lie and cheat and who want her to watch television rather than waste time reading. Through her teacher, Ms. Honey, Matilda discovers just how extraordinary she is and uses her new special powers to help Ms. Honey vanquish her ogre of an aunt, Ms. Trunchbull, and to outwit the witless parents in her own life. One of Dahl's best along with James and the Giant Peach and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"One of the few Roald Dahl books I read, it remains one of my favorites from childhood. I saw the movie too, and the movie is very funny, and I felt it did the book justice.Matilda is about a precocious little girl named Matilda who has a crazy family (who doesn't support her at all and certainly doesn't respect her intelligence). At a very young age, she is able to read very advanced books and she wins the admiration of her new teacher Mrs. Honey. The only problem is her dim parents and the evil Mrs. Trunchbull who rules the school with an iron fist. And then there's Matilda's new found super powers.It's very funny, the predicaments Matilda gets into and the things Mrs. Trunchbull says, even if she is cruel. It might be a little scary to very young children, but it depends on the child."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"I'm a 34 year old who occasionally needs to read a children's book for enjoyment and to remind myself that I'm not necessarily the slow reader I think I am.This book shows Roald Dahl and Quentin Blake at their best. It is fun, thoughtful and slightly thicker than some of their other volumes, such as \\"The Twits\\".Matilda is a lovable girl with many hidden talents. Gradually throughout this book these talents are revealed. For an adult reader it becomes more and more unreal. But this book is intended for young readers and the miracles that take place (not that I want to reveal too much) are just the thing to keep a young mind interested.Matilda and those around her made me laugh out loud at several points in the book. I only wish I had more opportunity to read more Roald Dahl when I was young - goodness knows, I needed to laugh just as much then as I do now, possibly more. Highly recommended, 5 stars."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"I'm 26 years old, and this story is still dear to my heart. I read it every now and then, and it makes me feel so good inside.

This must be the best among Roald Dahl's many books, and all his books are excellent. The audio version is excellent as well, the reader made the scenes alive. My 7 year old son keeps imitating the british accent of the reader, it is hilarious. We listened to the CD's on the way to a ski trip. It made the 3 hour drive each way feel like minutes. We sat in the car for a chapter to finish before we got out to ski!"},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Matilda is a substantial book that proclaims Roald Dahl's mentality in writing.Reviewers including Chicago Suntimes and New York Times tend to coincide with my conviction. You may cite books like The BFG, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, James and the Giant Peach, Going Solo, and many more by Roald Dahl. Publisher Viking Penguin dismissed this 272 page book in the year of 1988. Quentin Blake assisted Dahl by illustrating this absorbing book. Just read Matilda!If you are still reading this review, I obviously haven't persuaded you yet. Maybe you are still waiting for me to give you a summary of the book. If you are into mind-power books, then stop reading this review and start reading Matilda. WHAT?!?! You are still reading?!?! O.K., fine, I'll tell you what happens. Matilda is basically a genius stuck in a mindless family. All her family cares about is watching \\"the telly\\" She gets yelled at whenever she tries to read while her family is too busy watching \\"the telly\\" Matilda knew vocabulary exceeding most adults when she was 2 and learned to read perfectly at the age of 4. She possesses something that she never thought was possible. She uses her powers to fend off the evil headmistress of her school, The Trunchbull.The creativity Roald put into this was just inconceivable. Matilda put her mom's platinum hair dye in her dad's hair thickener and turned her dad's hair white. Someone had to have come up with that because the book doesn't just write itself. Roald Dahl wrote that and some other creative ideas. Matilda scared her family by burrowing a neighbor's parrot that repeats the phrase, \\"Rattle my bones\\" and stuffed it up their chimney in their house. The way Dahl had Matilda defeat Miss Trunchbull was another prime example of creativity. You'll have to read it to see it.The ideas that are put into the book by Roald are prodigious. This is very well linked to his creativity. This book personally satisfies me because, I always love to hear theories and think about them. One of them was written in the book through Matilda's teacher, Miss Honey about Matilda's mind-powers. \\"Well, it's only a guess, but here's what I think. While you were in my class you had nothing to do, nothing to make you struggle. Your fairly enormous brain was going crazy with frustration. It was bubbling and boiling inside your head like mad inside your head. There was tremendous energy bottled up in there with nowhere to go, and somehow was able to shoot it through your eyes and make objects move...\\" Just the way Matilda got rid of the Trunchbull was pretty clever. Other things happen to the Trunchbull that appear to be out of the blue. We all know who is behind this. Read to find out what happens to the Trunchbull.I am just tying to benefit you into reading more preposterous books. I would highly recommend this 5-out-of-5-star (in my opinion) book. The Charlie books are other good books by Dahl. So are you going to read Matilda?Yes-Good, my writing did its workNo-Bad, I did all this work for nothing"},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Matilda is a story by roald dahl.

She taught herself reading and calculating. Her parents, who think a lot of themselves and who are criminal, neglect her. Miss Honey, Matilda's first teacher, is very nice and smart; also, she had a cruel childhood. Her aunt, Miss Trunchbull treated her all the time. Her aunt Miss Trunchbull is the brutal headmistress of Matilda's school. Miss Trunchbull hates all children and uses them to stay in shape as a hammer thrower. Since Matilda met Miss Trunchbull for the first time, they fight against each other. In the end, Matilda helps Miss Honey to get her property, which Miss Trunchbull stole, back and Matilda's family allows her to stay by Miss Honey.We think this book contains a good humour and it is written with a lot of fantasy. Because it is also easy to read, younger people, who are not able to understand much English, are able to understand Matilda's adventure, either.It might be a problem that Matilda does not spend much respect on her parents, what is shown very often, when Matilda punishes her parents for their behaviour.

Her name is Matilda and she has a nasty old dad, fat plumpy mom, and a normal old brother. You see, Matilda is not just an ordinary girl, she is a genius. So brillient, that she could skip to 4th grade! She started to read newspaper and magazines when she was three- years old. At four, she went to the local library and read all the books!Not that she is only smart, but nice. ...My favorite part in Matilda was when Matilda seemed like a little girl to everyone but, inside of her, she has physic powers. She has powers to push, pull, grab, and to throw any objects at will with her eyes with 9 feet distance! That is one of the way she helps Ms. Honey .... I think that part is the best part of the story.\\"Why this book?\\" There isn't really an answer to that question. \\"Well, as usual, I was playing games when my mom stops the game system and tells me to read a book.

The author grew up in abusive English boarding schools, and that comes through loud and clear. But since when is vengeance and spiteful retaliation something to encourage in children? Ok, so this book shouldn't be taken too seriously, but I can see some kids getting the idea from Matilda, that it's ok to play nasty pranks on parents or teachers they think are being mean to them. Dahl's emotional baggage comes through clearly in this book.I think it's ironic that Dahl, speaking through Matilda, criticizes the works of Tolkien and C.S. Lewis as being too serious for children, and not having any humor in them. Matilda is all humor, using absurd comic situations, to teach kids that it's ok to anonymously exact justice using whatever means necessary. Lewis openly teaches about self-sacrifice for others, forgiveness, and redemption. Tolkien teaches on the folly of greed, selfishness, and pride, and the virtues of unity, courage, and humility. And Lewis and Tolkien often make use of humor in their writings. What is Dahl teaching?"},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"READ THISI gave it one star because i wanted to get your attention cos i just got to tell you that this book is great ,pay no attention to the people who have rated it one star they are totally wrong , i totally recomed this book, its good for 9 and under its a totally cute book it has fantasy humor and all that kind of stuff , one of My favorite parts was when she lernt how to read when she was only"},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"I guess it depends on what you are looking for in a book.

For a Roald Dahl book Matilda is pretty good-it has an interesting plot, at least.Unfortunately aside from that I hate it. The characters are all either Mary-Sue's or horrible cardboard villains. Matilda is so annoyingly perfect, she taught herself to read as a baby, soon read the kids section of the library, is a complete genius, quite nice, and has telekinesis. Miss Honey, her teacher, is annoyingly sweet and smart. Headmistress Trunchbull and Matilda's parents are ridiculously mean with no attempt whatsoever to make them human and realistic, and no one bothers to explain why Trunchbull got her job or wasn't arrested for her horribleness.

I usually try to read all the books she reads so I know what to expect for her. I read it, and I don't find it appropriate for her at all. Modern children are growing up with values much different than the old days, or at least the norms projected in this book. A principal hurting and humiliating children in her school the way Trunchbull does and that too publicly is unimaginable in today's world. In a child's world - this is like Taliban's atrocities. And that there is nobody this principal is answerable to - not even to law enforcement - is absurd in today's world. Given that the setting of this book is mostly at home and at school - children will try to imagine themselves in Matilda's position and may believe that these situations do happen. Resorting to magic, and getting rid of Trunchbull only through trickery - gives a very wrong message to children. I am going to have my daughter wait until she is 10 before she reads this book."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"At first I thought this would be a good girl's book for Story Time, but I'm sorry to say that it's not so good. None of the mature female characters are good role models: Miss Honey is wimpy, The Trunchbull is cruel, The Mother is indifferent (the Father and Brother, bullies); what's here for a girl to look forward to in adulthood? Nothing good, I daresay.Dahl's rather bizarre idea of girl empowerment encompasses petty revenge and telekinesis; hardly what ordinary girls in the real world can depend on for life skills.One might say, \\"Lighten up, it's just a book for fun.\\" But I suspect that kids or young teens who identify with this book have experienced what Matilda has, and need to find more uplifting literature."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Book Review of MatlidaThis book is about a girl, an evil principal, a teacher and magic.

I know that you will not read the book once but over and over again. You will want to share this book with all of your friends. This book is fun filled.The theme is about loyalty, sweetness and kindness. Matilda was brave to stand up for Bruce to the Trunchball. It was brave that Lavender put a salamander in Trunchball's glass. It was sweet that Lavender decided to be Matilda's friend. It was loyal when Lavender told Miss Honey where Matilda was. It was sweet that Miss Honey took Matilda in from adoption.You will love this awesome book. Matilda and her friends went through. It was funny when Matilda put glue in her dad's hat. It was mean when theTrunchball put Matilda in the Chokey. It was cool how Matilda could turn things around. It was hilarious when Bruce ate the huge cake.

You can imagine how the Chokey must look like. You can picture what Miss honey's cottage. You can smell and imagine Matilda's dad's auto shop.

Roald Dahl is such a creative writer that if i were to put down everything i like about him it would take up two journals, and that's just his children's books! So i will tell you my favorite. Well here they are.First off, i love how much detail Roald Dahl puts in his writing. He doesn't just put: \\"Enter,\\" said the Trunchbull. He writes a scentence like this. '\\"Enter,\\" boomed the deep and dangerous voice of Miss Trunchbull.Secondly, he puts so much livelyness into his work. Roald Dahl writes it like you are write there, at that time, with one of the characters, feeling the tension or happiness. It feels like you are experiencing it live.My favorite character was the Trunchbull. I really enjoy the way she acts, it's like a cobra. She gets all sweet and quiet wen she becomes dangerous. Miss Trunchbull also shows no mercy what so ever. She'll hold a boy by his ears if he can't spell the word \\"what\\".The plot of this story was entertaning and meaningful, (which didn't suprise me at all when i knew it was written by Roald Dahl). It was perfect, just what you don't expect with a little girl growing up in alittle family don't give a hoot about her or her education. Yet you want her to grow up going to good schools and you hate her parents because they don't care about her, and you do.I like the way the events are written in Roald Dahl's writing. He doesn't just hammer the events ll down at once, he puts an event, then a breather, then an event, then a breather, and so on.I have come to an end on the \\"preview\\" that i did on Matilda, because, as i said in the begining; it would take at least two journals. So if i were to give this book a rating, 1 being the best, 10 being the worst, i would give it a 1. And i hope as many people did and will enjoy Roald Dahl as i do."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Since Roald Dahl published his first children&#65533;s book, The Gremlins in 1943, children as well as adults have enjoyed his mystical fun-filled adventures. Dahl&#65533;s use of language and character development has earned him a spot among the greatest children&#65533;s writers. Matilda is no exception. The book is a series of mischievous, clever, funny, and sometimes heartbreaking circumstances where the reader becomes completely captivated by Matilda.Matilda is a child genius stuck with her less than idyllic parents and brother. Her father is a used car salesman who more than fits into the typical view of this sort. Her mother is a bingo addict. Both of her parents find immense satisfaction in watching the &#65533;telly&#65533; and eating TV dinners. They are also very confused and upset that Matilda spends her time reading; they feel it&#65533;s distracting their nightly routine.Matilda learns to read on her own with the help of the local librarian who gives her suggestions on what to read. In a very short period of time Matilda has read every children&#65533;s book in the library and has moved on to adult literature. She accomplishes all of this before even entering school.Her parents find Matilda as a major thorn in their sides, &#65533;a scab&#65533;, and continually do horrific things to her. Her dad yells, calls her names, and doesn&#65533;t listen to her all the while treating his son as a prince. Matilda decides to get back at her parents by using creative methods. These include using items like super glue and parrots. The reactions that ensue from the practical jokes are hilarious and make the reader somewhat envious that they didn&#65533;t do the exact same thing when they were 4.We follow Matilda through her adventures in school and her experiences with the dreaded Miss. Trunchbull and the wonderful teacher, Miss. Honey. Matilda fits right in and even though it&#65533;s evident to everyone that she&#65533;s a genius, her classmates still love her. Her biggest dilemma is the school principal, Miss. Trunchbull with whom she fulfills her most creative and daring practical revenge.Dahl&#65533;s expert use of language and dramatic situations make this a perfect book to read aloud to your class. Students will love the witty comments and acts Matilda uses and their imagination will soar to jokes they&#65533;d like to complete in their own lives. Quentin Blake&#65533;s magical illustrations are the perfect complement to the story. Kids and adults will both like this book and find themselves re-reading it many times."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"MatildaBy: Roald DahlReviewd By : J. LeePeriod: P.1This story was about an intelligent girl named Matilda. She wasn't loved or noticed by her family. Her father was a crook, all her mother loved to do was play bingo, and her brother got all the attention. Matilda is like a genius, but only young of age. Her parents just thought that she was a little girl that should not be heard or seen. They used her as an excuse of everything wrong that went on in their lives. But that became worse when she was sent to Crunchem Hall Primary. Her teacher, Miss Honey, was a sweet person that loved little children, but the headmistress of the school, the \\"Trunchbull\\", was the problem. Aside from Matilda's parents, Miss Trunchbull was the other person that blamed Matilda for everything that went wrong in her life. Miss Trunbull wasn't only the headmistress of the school, but was also an ex-Olympic hammer thrower. The only person who actually cared of and noticed Matilda's intelligence was her teacher, Miss Honey. At first, Miss Honey was puzzled by how much Matilda knew, but later, she brought text books from the older classes for Matilda since Miss Trunchbull wouldn't let her move up. Matilda became closer to Miss Honey and she became to know more of her. One day in class, Matilda found something amazing about herself. She was able to move objects with her eyes. She was at first surprised, but later, got used to it, and soon, she had a great idea. The day Miss Trunchbull came to teach the class, Matilda played a little prank on Miss Trunchbull, and that caused Miss Trunchbull to return everything in her posession to Miss Honey, who was the true owner. Matilda's family had to move to Spain, and because she didn't want to be with them and they didn't want to keep her, Miss Honey became her new guardian, and they lived happily after.I liked this book because it had unnatural things, such as having the power to move objects. I liked the idea that Matilda became interested in books and taught herslef to read around 2 or 3. It was interesting how she was such an intelligent child with not so intelligent parents. Even though she had parents that didn't love her and didn't give attention to her, she had an intelligent mind and a sweet heart. I think that's what made me love this book most of all.\\"'Your daughter is a cheat and a liar,' the father said, taking his plate of fish and placing it on his knees.\\" I was surprised by the way Matilda's father spoke about his own daughter. He was cold-hearted and said it as if her didn't know her. What amazed me most was that even with parents that just watched TV all day, she was a genius.\\"The Trunchbull, this mighty female giant, stood there in her green breeches, quivering like a blancmange.\\" I believe that this chapter had the most humor, because there was much about Miss Trunchbull's fears, and how she reacted towards it. It was funny how she thought a small, harmless newt was a snake or a crocodlie. With her strength, I was surprised that she wouldnt be able to take a snake, or even a newt.My favorite part of the book was when Matilda lifted the chalk with her eyes and started to write on the wall. She wrote to Miss Trunchbull pretending to be a ghost. Miss Trunchbull, standing in the classroom, watching a floating chalk writing about what she had done wrong years ago made her turn white. Soon enough, Miss Trunchbull was on the floor and unconcious. The next day, everything was returned to the rightful owner and she was nowhere to be seen. It was my favorite part, because Miss Trunchbull got what she deserved after all these years of torturing children and others, especially Miss Honey."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"This book is awesome.

This is definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Matilda is a five year old girl who has parents who don't know her intelligence. Matilda has gone to the library since she was four years old. She read all the childen's books in the library. When Matilda started, she was five years old.Miss Honey is her teacher.When Matilda started school, she learned about the Trunchbull. She learned that the Trunchbull picks kids up and throws them out the window. She puts them in the chokey. The chokey has nails and glass pointing out of the walls.Matilda scares away the Trunchbull by tipping water over with a newt in the drinking water.She also practiced picking chalk and writing messages on the board from Miss Honeys Dad.Somebody might want to read this book because it's exciting and intelligent, but I didn't like it."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Do you like mischievous books?

Her principal is so mean. So she gets back at her principal. Then her dad got in trouble so they moved.I believe you should pass on the book Matilda. Some reasons are I don't understand the text says mum instead of mom and tele instead of t.v. And it just doesn't make sense. Also it leaves you hanging it doesn't give enough information but the information isn't always helpful. Her parents are mean to they don't let her read she can only watch television.

It's about a girl living in rough time's with a mean teacher, and mean parents. Her teacher named Mrs.Trunchbull is so mean that she said, \\"I cannot for the life of me understand why small children take so long to grow up. I think they do it deliberately, just to annoy me.\\" And her parents are so abusive they didn't even know how old Matilda was! Her dad, Mr.Wormwood, asked Mrs.Wormwood, \\"Dearest pie, how old is Matilda?\\" Mrs.Wormwood says, \\"Four.\\" Matilda tells them that she is six-and-a-half, but then the father says, \\"You're a liar!\\"Matilda discovered she has magic powers. She use's this to face her problems and she never gave up. I feel Matilda's very brave because she's only six and she smiles through a hard life. Matilda teaches Mrs.Trunchbull a lesson by haunting her. This shows her that she's not as tough as she thinks she is, and she learns what it feels like to be scared just like her students. She also haunts her dad by gluing a hat on to his head, that teaches him not to mess with Matilda.I recommend this book because it's made by Roald Dahl, who's done a great job on a kid friendly book that's heart filling and entertaining like his other books, James and the Giant Peach, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.I personally would tell you to read this book because many kids can be a Matilda. Many kids can have a hard life with mean parents and a mean teacher. But you could overcome them."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"This book is very influential. When i first read the book i figured out that as i read it the message of the story was thereare no limits to learning and when you do the power of reading and knowledge will be so strong that it will seem as if you had superpowers.

As Mathilda is a little girl growing up she finds out she has a major interest for books wile her family spends their time watching T.V.

We first got it from the library when she was 6. She loved it so much she wanted her own copy and got one for her birthday. Now she reads it to me! My daughter loves the smart, polite, yet mischievous Matilda. She laughs out loud at the funny passages in the story.Be prepared; this is a typical Roald Dahl book, and the humor is a little quirky. Matilda is the exceptionally gifted daughter of parents who think she is a \\"twit\\" and a \\"scab.\\" They either ignore her or verbally abuse her. Matilda gets back at them by playing tricks to \\"punish\\" them. My daughter says that I should warn you that your child might learn some tricks from this book. These punishments are things that you would not want your child trying at home!Matilda finds a heroine in her teacher at school, though Matilda becomes a heroine to her teacher, rescuing her from her own problems.

Matilda's parents are always gone. The mom goes to bingo and the dad works at a car dealership. During that time Matilda goes to the library to read books. Every time she goes she reads a different book.One day Matilda finished all of the books in the kid section so the librarian helped herfind a new book.Matilda is in kindergarten and her principal's name is missTrunchbull. Miss Trunchbull is really a problem for everyonebecause she is what I would call a devil. For my opinion Iwouldn't dare to do something bad at that school. MissTrunchbull is a cake stuffer and a horrible principal. She isa wonderful evil character.Matilda's parents aren't the best. Something really cool that Matilda dos is that she gets her parents back for everything and I think all of it is really funny. Matilda has a best friend named Lavender, she is also in kindergarten her and Matilda always play together and sit next to each other. At school Matilda has some problems with kids in her class because they are mean to her.My opinion of this book is it's really funny and great because the author made it seem that the characters came to life. The author made it seem so real I thought I was right next to them.

Kinda like Lemony Snicket the author of the series of unfortunate events. Some people think I choose this book because there is a movieof the same name but I have seen the movie it is a lot different then the book. I would have to say the book is more enjoyable.This book is about a small girl named Matilda Wormwood whoher parents do not care about her at all.

There are also different types of kids. There are some that want to learn and there are some that don't care if they learn anything. There are also many combinations of attitudes differences between parent and child. For example, some kids don't what to learn and get an education but the parents do.Matilda by Roald Dahl tells a story about a five year old girl that has wanted to learn since she was 1 years old. But because of her parent's attitudes about learning, they did not embrace her extraordinary mind. She is so extraordinary that she taught herself to read by the age of three.Roald Dahl gives a wonderful view of how people don't want to admit that someone might be smarter then them. For example, Matilda thinks that her dad is jealous of her because she is smart. She also thinks that somewhere deep inside her dad wishes he was smart, like Matilda.This book also taught me how really important books are and how books are full of wisdom and a chance to learn something new. I strongly suggest this book if you love learning new things."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"This was a great book. After i read it i decided to do it for my school book report.

MoonPeriod 1This book is about a young little girl name Matilda. She is very smart but the rest of her family was not as brilliant as she is. By the time she was four she had read all of the famous novels. For example she read novels from Charles Dickens. When she entered kindergarten, she met a very nice teacher by the name of Miss Honey. Her kindergarten teacher was nice but the head principal was very cruel. Her name was Miss Trunchbull. By the first day Miss Honey met Matilda, she knew that Matilda should have been in an upper class. Matilda was very smart. She was a genius. Then Matilda found a special power. She was able to move objects with her eyes. As the months went by, Matilda got to know more and more about Miss Honey. She found out that the Trunchbull and Miss Honey were related. Then to get back all of the things the Trunchbull took from Miss Honey, she used her powers to get them back for her. The Trunchbull left the school and never came back.I enjoyed reading this book a lot. It had a lot of funny moments and thrilling moments. It is a fun-filled book. This book is meant for all readers and it is very enjoyable. There were some moments but to help but ask yourself what is going to happen next. I think if everyone reads itMy favorite part of the book was the part when Matilda went to the Trunchbull's house to get back all of the things Miss Honey owned. I thought it was very clever of her to think of such a thing to do. You could just imagine a small little girl moving things around with the power of her eyes. This part is very enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"MatildaBy: Roald DahlReviewd By : J. LeePeriod: P.1This story was about an intelligent girl named Matilda. She wasn't loved or noticed by her family. Her father was a crook, all her mother loved to do was play bingo, and her brother got all the attention. Matilda is like a genius, but only young of age. Her parents just thought that she was a little girl that should not be heard or seen. They used her as an excuse of everything wrong that went on in their lives. But that became worse when she was sent to Crunchem Hall Primary. Her teacher, Miss Honey, was a sweet person that loved little children, but the headmistress of the school, the \\"Trunchbull\\", was the problem. Aside from Matilda's parents, Miss Trunchbull was the other person that blamed Matilda for everything that went wrong in her life. Miss Trunbull wasn't only the headmistress of the school, but was also an ex-Olympic hammer thrower. The only person who actually cared of and noticed Matilda's intelligence was her teacher, Miss Honey. At first, Miss Honey was puzzled by how much Matilda knew, but later, she brought text books from the older classes for Matilda since Miss Trunchbull wouldn't let her move up. Matilda became closer to Miss Honey and she became to know more of her. One day in class, Matilda found something amazing about herself. She was able to move objects with her eyes. She was at first surprised, but later, got used to it, and soon, she had a great idea. The day Miss Trunchbull came to teach the class, Matilda played a little prank on Miss Trunchbull, and that caused Miss Trunchbull to return everything in her posession to Miss Honey, who was the true owner. Matilda's family had to move to Spain, and because she didn't want to be with them and they didn't want to keep her, Miss Honey became her new guardian, and they lived happily after.I liked this book because it had unnatural things, such as having the power to move objects. I liked the idea that Matilda became interested in books and taught herslef to read around 2 or 3. It was interesting how she was such an intelligent child with not so intelligent parents.

I don't think of it as a \\"children's book,\\" but as a \\"whimsical fantasy\\" that will delight young and old -- and everyone in between.Matilda is a child genius whose parents treat her like dust on the furniture, even when she gets even for being ignored by adding bleach to her male parental unit's hair pomade and making her female parental unit think the house is haunted. She has a thirst for learning, so she goes to a school -- run by the Headmistress from Hell, who thinks everyone who's not an adult is a \\"piece of filth\\" and gets her jollies by torturing the youngsters. Spiked torture boxes! Grabbing little girls by their braids! Throwing children over the fence! Why, she even force-fed one unfortunate young fellow a WHOLE chocolate cake in front of the whole school. (I felt poor Bruce Bogtrotter's pain during the famous -- or should that be infamous -- Cake Scene) But the one she REALLY had it in for was -- you guessed right -- Matilda, who is not only a genius but has powers of telekinesis to boot!Her one adult ally is Miss honey, as sweet as her name, who shows Our Heroine what it's like to feel cared for.If i could give this book 10 stars I would!

She is not loved at home by her family. She turns to where else? The library, to take herself into a story. Matilda then is offered by her reluctant parents, to attend school.

The movie is more Americanized and the story is smoother, but it lacks one of the books very strong points--a higher level of vocabulary.In Matilda Dahl (also the author of The BFG, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The Witches and James and Giant Peach) presents his typical style, pitting a child against horrible adults who actively hate or seek to do the child harm. The title character lives in a home that not only doesn't appreciate her high level of intelligence, but ridicules it because her family is intimidated and scared by it. Matilda's family is emotionally abusive and neglectful, which some parents would seek to avoid, but I find an honest approach to life. Dahl's books don't treat children like they can't handle the darker side of things. Dahl doesn't ignore that there are some pretty crappy people out there, and sometimes they happen to have kids.Dahl, unlike a lot of authors, presents childhood as a battlefield. However not all children are perfect angels (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is an example here), and not all adults are horrendous bullies. In Matilda her family may be part of the problem, but she finds an ally in her teacher, Miss Honey, who is a survivor of a bullied childhood.Through the book we learn not about revenge on bad people, or being nice despite being bullied and neglected, Dahl teaches kids to recognize and treasure the good parts of life, without letting the bad parts define themselves, or their experience.Also a smart part of this book is the accelerated vocabulary, which again, shows that Dahl distinctly decides not to treat children as incapable or juvenile. Because of the number of big words, all used in a context that makes them easy to understand, this book is best read as a collaborative effort between an adult and child, unless an child closer to teendom is the reader.I highly recommend Matilda on every level, especially because in the realm of fiction girls are often sentenced to be side kicks and creatures of first crushes, but Matilda is a strong, independent, intelligent girl who solves problems on her own. Matilda is the precursor to the more recent Coraline, with less a less scary and a more over the top spin."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Matilda Wormwood is one of the youngest protagonists in YA literature, but don't be fooled by her small stature; she is a genius when it comes to reading and performing mathematical processes in her head. Her clueless and callous parents ignore her prodigy--leaving her alone all afternoon. Encouraged by a kind librarian and later by a sweet teacher, Miss Honey, little Matilda at 5 sets herself to reading British and American adult Classics.Her father is a dishonest used car salesman who prizes their son, but his unreasonable punishment of Matilda merely serves to inspire her ingenuity for private revenge. Naturally modest and well-behaved the little girl is pushed to domestic extremes. All of which proves a prelude to her greatest challenge--the horrendously malicious Headmistress, Miss Trunchbull. Can a tiny tyke, even with her super brain, outwit and banish the school's entrenched bully?This is a delightful read for kids of all ages, as Matilda matches wits with dishonesty on several levels. There is hope for two lonely females who need and deeply appreciate each other. This charming book is funny yet thoughtful, as the author takes literary potshots at his own sadistic teachers. With Dahl one can be sure that social and personal justice will eventually triumph!"},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"The book \\"Matilda\\" was a very fascinating book by the scrumdiddlyumptious storyteller Roald Dahl.

Personally all I have to say is that her family should open up dig way deep down and try to respect the little girl. But anyway back to the book. Matilda lives with her father who sells second hand cars. He brings all the bacon to the house. While her father goes to work her mother goes to play bingo in some town faraway, and her brother goes to school. While she stays alone in the house she starts going to the library not very far away from her house. There she starts reading every single children's book while the librarian watches her being very faisinated. After she's read all the books she starts reading many classics by Charles Dickens. One night her father rips up her library book. That's when she gets really ticked and she brews up a plan to get revenge. Everytime they tick her off, she brews up a plan. So that's why they send her to school. Her teacher Miss Honey is very nice. While the headmaster of the school Truchbull isn't if you want to find out the rest. Get the book!!! Matilda is a classic you and yout children would love to share."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"I read the book Matilda. It\`s about a six year old girl who lives with her mean bossy parents. Her dad sells old broken cars and her mom plays bingo during the week. She finds out she has powers to move things with her eyes. She uses them to defeat her mean principal Miss Trunchbull who will do anything to get rid of kids. I liked the book because it is about a girl with strong powers. I like Miss Trunchbull because she tortures kids if they can\`t do something right. I hope you read and enjoy this book by Roald Dahl."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"My son loves Roald Dahl books and I know that some of the content is inappropriate for a 6 year old but he seems to really connect with Roald Dahl's writing. He read Matilda tonight before going to bed and around 10:00pm came into the living room balling his eyes out. He couldn't understand how Matilda would want to leave her parents or why her parents would not even look back as they were leaving forever. It took over an hour to console our child and I regret not reading the book myself first. I understand that great books do exactly what Matilda did to my child but use caution with younger kids, I only wish someone would have posted a review similar to mine and I would have never bought Matilda for my son. While I'm here, he read Holes and was very upset by the child abuse portrayed in that book as well, again, just a warning."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"i think htis story was the was the story of all.I think htis story is good because it\`s really intersting."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"As a child,i have always enjoy reading books written by Roald Dahl,Christopher Pike... This is no exception.I first read Matilda when I was ten.That was in 2000.I think it is indeed very humourous,and though Mr Dahl did exaggerate the story plot a little bit,I think it is one of the best book ever written by him.When two real irritating and hard-hearted people got married,what do you expect? Mr and Mrs Wormwood owned a car business(it was an illegal one,where they stole cars,then polished and revamped them before selling them to innocent buyers),they had two children,a boy named Michael a girl named Matilda.Usually,or should I say,all parents wished to have a gifted child.But the Wormwoods were exceptions.They think that their television programmes are more important than their kids' education.They don't encouraged reading,in fact,they think reading is a real freaking stuff to do.Matilda likes reading,she detests watching television...and that was how her parents came to think their daughter is a nuisance.They'd neglect her,treat her as though they'd no daughter,but just a son.In fact,they even sent her to school at a later age,when most kids are already at.But Matilda is smart.She is quick-witted,intelligent and sensible for a girl of five or six.She reads great books written by good and famous writers in bombasic languages,she knew difficult mathematics and she created havoc(not really for her parents deserved them)like putting super glue onto her daddy's hat.When she goes to school,she meets the nice,kind-hearted Ms Honey who seems to share a bond with Matilda.She also meets the tyrant of the school,feared not only by the students but also the teachers.She is Ms Trunchbull,who,coincidentally,is Ms Honey's bad,bad aunt.At the same time,Matilda realises she has extaodinary powers,and she's really good at them.And she uses them to deal with the bad,bad Trunchbull woman.I've watched the film,and I think this is indeed a very good book.The language is simple and for people who really don't like reading,I can assure you,this is the book where Matilda,the Wormwoods,Ms Honey and the Trunchbull woman will all come alive and capture your imagination.Trust me.You will enjoy this book.And I mean it."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"In Matilda by Rald Dahl Matilda is a very intelligent 6 year old girl she wants to go to school, but her parents don't care about school there to caught up in selling old cars .One night matilda finds out that she has a power and unleashes the power .

When she figured out she had an amazing power, I was constantly wondering and wondering what would happen. In Matilda, it was suspenseful.

Her parents think reading is a waste of time. When Matilda starts school there is a mean headmisstress named Miss Trunchbull. She thinks Matilda is a menace.Can Miss Honey, Matilda's teacher,and Matilda with her cool powers change Miss Trunchbull around? I believe it is an excellent book because it keeps you guessing what will come next."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Have you ever thought of how cool it would be to move things using your eyes? Well, it's not as good as you think. Matilda, the main character, gets in a lot of trouble because she has this power. I knew Matilda was going to be a good book because, it was written by the world famous Roald Dahl. The pictures were neatly drawn by Quentin Blake. This outstanding book was published by Viking Penguin in 1988. The best part about this book is that Matilda is a quality literature novel. One of the reason it's a quality novel is that it has many reviews. Some of them are by the Wilson's Children Catalog and the School Library Journal. It has a lot of humorous parts that made me laugh all day. Matilda is a very clever student who stands up for her rights.At the beginning of the book, Matilda seems normal for a young girl. One thing that's odd about her is her intelligence. She can do math in her head as fast as lightning, and can also read high level books that are made for adults. Her family is always mean to her, so when they are mean to her, she plays a prank on them. Her kindergarten teacher is very nice, caring, and is aware on what she knows, but her principal is the exact opposite. Her principal chucks students out the window for not paying attention in class. People in Matilda's class always tricks Ms. Tunchbull, the principal, but she always blames the whole class if she doesn't know who did it. Matilda finds a power that helps her in her life. This power is, that she can move things with just her eyes. Miss Honey, her teacher tells her about a problem in her life that she wants Matilda to solve.Whenever you think of sticking up to a bully, you never do. Matilda actually does but to a teacher. She takes risks that could get her in big trouble. Some of her big risks are playing tricks on people. She tricks The Trunchbull by making her think that an evil spirit is after her. Not only does she stand up to her, but Bruce Bogtrotter does too. He surprises her by eating a whole cake when she thinks he can't. She wouldn't need all this bravery if no one was mean to her. This takes a lot of bravery to do all of these tricks to an adult.Have you ever thought that you were smarter than your elementary teacher? Matilda is, but in every subject. Matilda has read a lot of books that are written by best-selling authors. She is also very clever and sneaky. She plays well thought-out pranks on anyone that is mean to her like her parents. Some of her tricks are: a ghost in the chimney, a spirit from the dead, and making her dad's hair fall out. She can move things using her eyes. She just concentrates on an object and it will move when she wants it to. This power helps her a lot in this book. Without this power I don't know how she could survive. This character selection was great for this book.Matilda was a very humorous, but yet courageous book. I loved this story, and I will recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good book. The reason I admired it was, that it had a specific event in each chapter. This is a good book for middle-age childhood (9) and also for adults. It wasn't a very challenging book, but it was fun to read. If I ever read it a second time, than I will probably like it more than the first time. I bet you will enjoy it as much as I did if you ever read it. If you're ever looking for a good book, go to the library and check this book out. You will enjoy it the minute you open it."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Matilda is a lovely and brilliant little girl, who is ill-treated and neglected by her disgusting parentsShe go's to the library, to take books out, everyday, by four, and slowly discovers brainpower within herself (as the narrator reminds us, we only use less than a tenth of our brainpower-well not Matilda!).Finally her father agrees to send her to school, a school which is run by the hideous and cruel psychopath Miss Trunchbull, who resembles something of Stalinist labour camp commissar.Well, she certainly abuses the children, from swinging a tiny girl by her pigtails, to locking children up in a tiny dark chamber with spikes in the door.By the way, this can all be very frightening to children of pre-school age.But Matilda is shown love and care by her wonderful and sweet young teacher, Miss Honey The most wonderful part of the film however is seeing Matilda see that the horrific Miss Trunchbull gets her comeuppance, and finding the happiness and love she deserves.Beautifully written with deep sensitivity and great wit.One of Dahl's best works for children"},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"The novel Matilda by Roald Dahl is about a little girl, called Matilda, who is a complete genius. She taught herself reading and calculating. Her parents, who think a lot of themselves and who are criminal, neglect her. Miss Honey, Matilda's first teacher, is very nice and smart; also, she had a cruel childhood. Her aunt, Miss Trunchbull treated her all the time. Her aunt Miss Trunchbull is the brutal headmistress of Matilda's school. Miss Trunchbull hates all children and uses them to stay in shape as a hammer thrower. Since Matilda met Miss Trunchbull for the first time, they fight against each other. In the end, Matilda helps Miss Honey to get her property, which Miss Trunchbull stole, back and Matilda's family allows her to stay by Miss Honey.We think this book contains a good humour and it is written with a lot of fantasy. Because it is also easy to read, younger people, who are not able to understand much English, are able to understand Matilda's adventure, either.It might be a problem that Matilda does not spend much respect on her parents, what is shown very often, when Matilda punishes her parents for their behaviour. It could be a problem that younger children think that they are also allowed to play such tricks when they do not agree with their parent's decisions."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Matilda written by Roald Dahl is a children's book about a young girl called Matilda who is a genius. That does not seem to be a problem but her parents do not care about what she does. Her class teacher Ms. Honey is the first one who recognizes her amazing talents.

If she does not like a pupil's behaviour she will at once get brutal. All pupils hate her but they are not brave enough to do anything against her just until Matilda comes...Matilda is a book that is easy to understand. Roald Dahl has managed it very well to write a story about an intelligent and perfect girl without making the reader think Matilda is a swot. The character of Ms. Trunchball even makes you fear. But this is also the problem of the book: All characters behave in the same way during the whole book so that you can easily predict what the end of the story will look like. That makes the book be interesting for children but not for adults. Furthermore, the book is based on very improbable or even unrealistic facts so that it might only be good for fans of fictional books.

I adore his diversity along with his sweet way of making his fans and readers sincerely care what happens with his many characters: i.e. \\"Charlie Bucket\\", \\"Sophie\\" and now our heroine, MATILDA!Matilda is probably Dahl's finest creations. She is not only a sweetie but quite the genius with a heart to match. Dahl has been accused of hating children, due to his stories that involve many shenanigans that revolve around children and a their demise. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The Witches, and even Matilda. All these stories center around adults despising children.Matilda Wormwood is a little girl that is neglected and treated badly by her asinine parents because of her intelligence. She has taught herself how to read and even finds her own way to the library. Matilda's passion is overwhelming when it comes to books. Matilda develops telekenitic powers and uses them in the most ingenius, resourceful and cute ways. Especially on her mean old Principal, Miss Trunchbull.However, her teacher, Miss Honey is a soft spoken, sweet as honey teacher who loves being around children and teaching with bright colors, cute little ditty's, and dances. Matilda's dysfunctional life at home is ludicrous and certainly shows Dahl's grim outlook of children but drives out some of the best stories ever written. By the time Matilda enters school, the little darling has read the old classics from Jules Vern and Charles Dickens. Matilda is a very well-rounded and cultured little girl, who dwells in the most horrible of circumstances and living conditions. She is truly a hero by every sense of the word: HERO. She will warm your heart and keep you smiling as you turn the pages.The book is beautiful as the words inside.

I enjoyed it so much for many reasons. Here are some of them. The story line is easy to follow and it is enjoyable for all ages. Once you get into Matilda's story, you can't put it down. If you read for a while you can get a great picture of everything that's there, from the people themself, to the color shirt they were wearing. Who would have thought, such a story could be funny and so touching and descriptive all at once! I rate Matilda 5 stars and if you read it, I can advise you, don't see the movie! It wrecks your perfect image. I rate it 5 stars because of all the things I just mentioned; description, touchingness, and humor. I hope you take my advice and read Matilda by Roald Dahl, and I'm sure you will enjoy it. Also, it is a fantasy and unlike most fantasies, it has a great moral. It is .... wait, I can't tell you! I guess you will just have to read it and find out! Just a piece of advice, this may sound as if I'm trying to turn you down to reading it, I'm not. The story of poor Matilda, is as you may know very sad, happy and funny. If you don't like any of those things, don't read it.

My entire 4th grade class read the book, and we did a really fun project on it.The author used very descriptive words like \\"The red brick building at the end of the road\\", and \\"This was a sensible and quiet little girl\\". He also used vocabulary words like \\"rigid\\", for example. I even had to look up the definition of some words!When I was reading, I could picture the setting and the characters very clearly, because he described them very well. For example \\"Miss Trunchbull wears green britches with a brown coat\\".When I get to the end of a chapter, the author doesn't leave a cliffhanger ( when you really want to know what happens next, but you have to stop reading ). The author didn't leave a cliffhanger at the end of the book, eitherThe author started off with a great beginning, not a boring one that makes you not want to read the book. Like when Matilda first started school, the author put that Matilda knew what fourteen times nineteen was. The author also put a really crazy event where Miss Trunchbull took a girl named Amanda by her pigtails and threw her across the playground.I recommend this book to anyone who is in 3rd, 4th, or 5th grade.

Here are some key points in the book you might want to know before you start the book. The setting of the book is in London and it is about a little named Matilda. Matilda was born to a family that did not love or want her Matilda is a four year old girl who taught herself how to speak at the age of 1 and read perfectly by 4. Matilda is so smart that every day when her dad goes to work and her mom plays bingo, she sneaks out to the library. In the book, she pulls pranks on her father. The ending of the book, I am saving for you so I don't ruin the book.In the book it talks about how Matilda's parents didn't love her. They would leave her at home while her brother, mom, and dad are all gone to do something. They called her names like not smart and a cheater because she was different than other kids. It was clear that they loved their son more than Matilda.Matilda loves to read. Whenever Matilda tries to read her dad interferes and he does something mean to not let her read. Like when she was reading her dad took the book away and ripped all of the pages out of the book and called it filth and garbage. He then threw the book away. Another time was at dinner, her dad would not let her read her book after dinner and her dad made her watch the T.V so she could be more normal like other kids. So to get even, she starts pulling pranks on her father like she putting glue on his hat.Matilda does lots of pranks on her father. The best prank she does is to make her dad think there is a ghost in the kitchen by putting a parrot in there fire place. Parrots repeat sounds they here. They heard the sound so they thought that there was a ghost in there kitchen.I really like this book because I felt a range of emotions. Some parts of the book were sad, he wrote the sad parts in a funny and sad way. Other parts of the book are funny, like when Matilda glues her dads hat to his head .The language in the book is written in a comical way. The setting is in London and two key words told me that and they were pounds pence. I would recommend the book to read because it is a good book."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"I'm 9 years old and you would think it would be for younger children.

This book was one of the last books Roald Dahl wrote before he died. This book is based on a little girl who's family doesn't understand her at all. She really wants to read, but the only thing in her house is a cookbook, so she sets off in search of a book. She grows to be 6 and starts school as the new child, and soon finds out that her principal is mean. She makes a good friend, and then meets another girl who warns her about Miss Trunchbull. Matilda's teacher is kind and gentle, and loves Matilda vary much. In the end she has a good suprise! Sometimes people say I read to much, and that I'm almost exactly like Matilda!"},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"This is a fantastical book that I thought I would dislike at first, but wound up falling in love with. It centers around a girl of genius intellect named Matilda who pulls pranks on her dimwitted parents, who are too blind to take notice of her multiple skills and criticize her passion for reading, as punishment for disrespecting her. After she commences schooling, she meets a loving teacher and a strict, abusive headmistress named Miss Trunchbull, who is revealed to be her teacher's aunt and had wreaked havoc for her during her childhood. After discovering that she possesses telekinetic abilities, Matilda decides to use this against the headmistress and assist her teacher in this entertaining, magical book that I definitely recommend to you right now. Buy this immediately, because you definitely will adore it."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"I would recommend Matilda: by Roald Dahl to anyone 8+. Boy or girl, you will love this book. The thing that drew me to this book was the cover art and the thought of dominating Miss Trunchbull, the Head Mistress. Miss Trunchbull is a fat, strong, cruel head mistress who is Mrs. Honey's aunt. She grabs people by the ears and stretches them and the hair to the point that it's going to fall off. In comparison, there is a lovely teacher name Mrs. Honey. She is Matilda's teacher who is the nicest teacher. Matilda helps get rid of The Trunchbull by scaring her. The book was written in first person from Matildas' view. My favorite part is when Matilda spilled a glass of water with a newt on The Trunchbull with her eyes. Matilda could levitate and tip light objects until Miss Trunchbull quit. I loved the book and think it is awesome. I would most certainly recommend this book to anyone who would be willing to try it. This is one of Roald Dahl's finest pieces of work."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"This might be one of the last books that Dahl wrote but this was the first one I read. I still remember the day I got it, it was a book fair in the library in my middle school, I had 10 dollars to spend on whatever I wanted. I looked at all the books (there must have been about 100 books for sell), then I saw it a yellow cover with a little girl sitting on a pile of books. Somehow I saw myself in that picture so I got it.In reading the book the little girl, Matilda, was not much like me at all other than she liked reading books. She had really bad parents but she was really smart and so she did her best to take care of herself (much like Lisa Simpson), she started to go to the library by herself to read books since she was very young. Then it was time she went to school. She ended up getting a very nice teacher but the head master of the school was very mean, much like her parents but far worst. One day she discovers she has powers and that's when the main story begins. It's basically about how she uses these powers to get the life she deserves.I would highly recommend this book to any girl that likes to read."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"December 15th, 2010Hannah from room 204Matilda is about a young girl named Matilda, she has two parents named Harry and Zinnia but they wouldn't be the ones who care that mush about their children.

Probably if you had bad parents you will also want to live with your teacher. This is a story with lots of miracles in it. It is a fiction story but also an adventure story.Matilda is an extraordinary child because she has power in her eyes. She can drop thing with her eyes, and write things. This child loves to read, but not the books we red when we were five. She read books for adults like some eight hundred pages or more here is a list of some of the books she has read:* Nicholas Nickleby* Oliver Twist* Jane Eyre* Pride and Prejudice* Gone to Earth* KimAnd more, this demonstrated that she is a very clever girl. The supporting characters are Mrs. Phelps she is the gentle librarian, Miss Honey is the lovely teacher, \\"She had a lovely pale oval madonna face with blue eyes and her hair was so slim and fragile one got the feeling that if she fell over she would smash into a thousand pieces, like a porcelain figure.\\" Finally the horrendous Trunchbull that was the Headmistress and hated children.I liked this book because it has very funny parts. \\"Fiona has the same beauty as an iceberg, but unlike the iceberg she has absolutely nothing below the surface.\\" Also because the ending is good, \\"Matilda leapt into Miss Honey's arms and hugged her, and Miss Honey hugged her back, and the mother and the father and brother were inside the car and the car was pulling away with the tyres screaming.\\"I also liked this book because it had a lot of descriptive words like the one of Miss Honey, describing here how she was in the external part. I will recommend this book because you will love how Roald Dahl exaggerates the character and make them his best friends. Read it!!!!"},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"I first read \\"Matilda\\" when it first came out years ago, and I can still well remember the impact this seemingly simple but very far-reaching tale made on me at the time. In his child heroine, the brilliant, sensible and ultimately deserving child Matilda, Mr Dahl has created a classic role model many adults in our fast-paced, self-serving society had best stand back and take a closer look at. By creating a child prodigy who is undervalued, disliked and misunderstood by almost everyone around her including her own family, despite the fact this is intended as a children's book Mr Dahl takes a very distinct swipe at the shallow values that underpin our own society, and encourages children everywhere to see others for who and what they are and not what they look like or how popular they are.Matilda Wormwood is an accomplished self-taught prodigy by the time she is five years old. However, this quiet, modest child is just tolerated by her self centered, shallow family, headed by her criminally inclined car salesman father who does not appreciate Matilda's shrewd observations about his crooked dealings! Life for this stifled child centres around visits to the local library and keeping out of her parents' way when they are watching soapies and so-called reality shows on the TV (the extent of their cultural life! Sound familiar to many?) Whenever she is mistreated in any way, Matilda responds by some wonderfully ingenious pratical jokes that in true Roald Dahl style are quirky, inventive and very graphic, such as putting peroxide into her father's black hair dye bottle!Upon reaching school age, Matilda is finally sent to the local school, and at long last meets a soulmate in her sweet-natured, understanding new teacher, Miss Honey, who recognises the remarkable potential in this small child. However, the school is ruled by the iron fist of ex-Olympic athlete, Agatha Trunchbull, a snorting rhinoceros of a woman who regards children as a personal enemy. The tyranny of the Headmistress extends across the staff as well as the children - and when Miss Trunchbull takes out her spleen on Matilda, who discovers some very nasty truths about the tyrant headmistress and her relationship with the oppressed Miss Honey, the stage is set for Matilda's inventive genius to wreak the ultimate vengeance.Perhaps this book's greatest achievement is the strong theme of mind over matter, a theme many children would do best to grasp. Matilda's frustrated brilliance finds a most unexpected release through psychic energy and in her ability to perform some truly magical Uri Geller style tricks (for more detail read the book). Although this book is now over 20 years old, its appeals remains fresh regardless of the generational gap. Brains over beauty, goodness over brute force - Matilda is neither stuck up, conceited or self confident but a sweet, modest child who is simply wanting to earn some honest respect in her life. This theme has strongly inspired some of my own writing as it is a theme I believe modern media has very sadly missed. For any parent, especially those with daughters, this book is a very definite must."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Roald Dahl is somewhat of a literary evil mastermind. He has the uncanny ability to create the most twisted, repulsive adults every imagined in the world of children's stories. Matilda is the story of a young genius born to a family of ignorant twits. She goes to a school with the horribly cruel headmaster, Miss Trunchbull, who locks children in a closet of nails if they misbehave. The only kind adult in Matilda's life is her teacher, Miss Jenny Honey, who turns out to be Miss Trunchbull's niece. This friendship leads to numerous adventures as Matilda discovers certain special abilities she has, beyond her highly-developed brain. Miss Trunchbull is one of my favorite characters of all time. She's a vicious body-builder whose greatest pleasure in life is torturing children. This book is funny but dark, and like all of Dahl's tales, it is incredibly entertaining. For Roald Dahl lovers, I can also recommend Fantastic Mr. Fox and George's Marvelous Medicine for some more delightful reading."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"I adored this book this book as a child and continue to adore it as an adult. This book speaks to that little girl who looked at her parents and decided she was decidedly different.

The story is a great one if you want to get your kids to love reading."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"I recommend this book for grades five and up because the father calls Matilda inappropriate names. Other than that it is an awesome book. It is a book about a young girl who is very smart. She can read books that a ten year old would be able to read. In the end there is a shocking surprise. If you like fantasy books that take you into a new world and you are in grades five and up. I suggest you to check this book out from your local library. By ILhorses"},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"** spoiler alert ** A book I liked because the main character is a bookworm who can move objects with her mind. I was also a bookworm, but am still working on the mind-control thing."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"I have read a couple of Roald Dahl's books in the last couple of days. These include Matilda, but alsoJames and the Giant PeachandCharlie and the Chocolate Factory. I feel that these are some of the better know works by the beloved children's author. I have been recommended other works by him, but these three have been sitting around my house before I picked them up.A theme Dahl likes is to have some outside agent create something special about the main child characters of his books. Charlie gets a golden ticket; James spills a bag of magic at the base of a peach tree. Matilda, already a precocious child, develops telekinesis.A difference is what the protagonists do with the intervention. James and Charlie to me are ciphers. They just pass through the amazing events that happen to them without effecting any real change. They stand as blank slates for the child reader to project the self onto. Matilda is different. She's different from her peers in school, but also from the other Dahl characters. She takes the gift that Dahl gives her and makes it into something that changes her world. Matilda has an agency that other Dahl characters lack, and for me this makes her a far more relatable and sympathetic character. She creates her own happily ever after, and isn't just handed it.Although, as a critique, Matilda inhabits the same black and white world that is fairly limited in the possibilities of what can happen. Characters are either wholly good or wholly bad, and nothing else. I realize the audience requirements expected at the time of writing supported a world like that, but more recent YA fiction allows for complex characters that have depth."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"The title of my book is Matilda. The author of my book is Roald Dahl.Matilda is four, a genious, and has psychic powers. How could she get anymore perfect! Matilda is a very smart little girl, but her parents are not. Her parents also will not admit that their daughter is smarter than the whole family. In addition to this she's only in Kindergarten and tries to hide her powers from the rest of the class, but they all know she is really smart. I reccomend this book to anyone who likes adventure and suspense.This book has lots of adventure in it, but I especially liked the parts where she played tricks on her family. One example is when she put superglue in her dad's favorite hat. It also didn't come off, so Matilda's mom had to cut it off. Another example would be when she borrowed her friend's bird and put it in her chimney. Then when her family came home she claimed it was a ghost and they ran out of the house. She also played another trick on her dad by putting blonde hair die in his hair supplies. So that morning he went to work with platinum blonde hair.Matilda loves to manipulate people and she makes it really hilarious when she does! One time she was with her dad and her dad was counting up how much money he made in one week, and talking to Matilda's brother about it. He would tell her brother the math problems as he figured it out. Matilda would tell him the answer once he even said the problem. Then she would manipulate her father and tell him she was right and he was wrong. There was also another time where he told her \\" T.V makes you smarter than books.\\" Matilda told him he was wrong but did he listen? No, she manipulated him all over again like before with the math problems. She also manipulates miss Trunchbull into thinking a ghost (her brother) was watching her and to give his house back to his daughter Miss Honey (Matilda's teacher). Then Miss Trunchbull leaves town and gives Miss honey her house back.The suspense in the book is wonderful; you just keep wanting to turn the pages. Such as when she plays tricks on her family. Or when she tricked Miss Trunchbull into leaving town when she was giving a weekly lesson. Also when she was practicing how to lift items inside her house.I recommend people to read this book because its action packed and full of hilarious moments. It is also a really thrilling book to read. Any one will like this book, there really no reason not to!M. Barganier"},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Matilda is a five and half year old genius. She is neglected by her parents, but still manages on her own to advance her education beyond her years by reading books. To punish her parents, for their lack of interest in her and for their mishandling of her upbringing, she decides to play some practical jokes on them (or especially on her father who is a crooked car salesman). As a parent of two girls who are 5 and 7 I was a little apprehensive about appearing to give approval to some of the things Matilda does, so I had to remind my girls that this was just a story, and they seemed to understood (or at least I hope they did.) As the story progresses Matilda goes to school for the first time, and has to do battle with the evil headmistress Miss Trunchbull, who is an ex-Olympic hammer thrower. She has been terrorizing the school for years by physically abusing all of the children who do not measure up to her standards. She especially hates the younger children. If they do anything wrong, she twirls them around by their hair as if they were a hammer and throws them out windows and across the schoolyard to help her stay in shape. The kids would go home and complain to their parents, but the stories about the headmistress would be so outrageous that none of the parents believed they could be true. The kids were left to deal with the headmistress on their own.Matilda's first grade teacher Miss Honey is extremely nice. She is the first person to recognize Matilda's brilliance and wants to help Matilda reach her full potential, but Ms. Honey has problems of her own, and isn't strong enough to face the Trunchbull either. Since Matilda is being held back and is not allowed to use her brain to the fullest of it's potential, a force builds up inside of her. This gives Matilda some special Telekinetic abilities which she uses to come up with a plan to defeat the Trunchbull and improve her and Miss Honey's future. Roald Dahl tells another great tale that captures the kid's imagination and held them greatly entertained. Quentin Blake's illustrations once again add greatly to the story. Dahl touches upon some of his usual quirks that he hates, such television, T.V. dinners, and calculators. He also seems to be against advertisement's that sell something for $9.99 instead of $10.00. It was interesting to note that he does also mention several other children's writers in this story, and seems to give his own opinion on each. For instance he has Matilda comment that C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien are great writers, but he believes their writings are too serious. He believes children love to laugh, and that is why children's stories should have so much more humor in them. He also seems to be a big fan of Charles Dickens. My girls are now looking forward to seeing the movie that was just released a few years ago based on this book."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"This delightful tale, about an extraordinary girl named Matilda who lives with her dreadful parents, was also made into a movie in 1996. Children love the absolute meanness of the adults in the book, and Matilda?s unique solution to her wretched life. Mr. Dahl, author of Charlie and the Chocolate factory and James and the Giant Peach, balances the ludicrous behavior of the adults in his book with the sweet natured child who has reached her limit.My children loved it -- an absolute keeper!"},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"The book is about the little girl Matilda. She's about five years old. Her family doesn't care much about her, they mostly care about money, the TV and bingo. Matilda is very talented, she can read already and she loves it. Her first day at school her teacher, Miss Honey, notices that Matilda is very talented. She goes to the Headmistress to ask if Matilda can jump to the final grade. But Miss Trunchbull (the headmistress), who doesn't like children, doesn't believe Miss Honey.I don't want to reveal all of it but the bok is about the &quot;war&quot; against the Trunchbull, because nobody likes her. I think it is a nice end to the book anyway.It wasn't too hard to read the book because it is a children's book. It is easy and fun language. The characters are also funny. Like the father who is selling broken cars, the platinum blonde mother and the Trunchbull, who hates children and usually swing girls by their pigtails above her head and then throws them out the window.It is a good book and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Matilda Wormwood is a girl who's parents don't really care for her. Matilda's parents really didn't know how to take care of a baby so they would leave her home every day. Matilda would be left home alone but that really didn't bother her it was one of the best things that could of happened to Matilda. Matilda starts to go to school at the age of 6 and had one of the meanest Principals that their is. When Matlida starts to go to school with one of the nicest teachers and has some really nice friends. Matilda is a smart she loves to read and is a really briallant girl.One day when Matilda was in class the Truncbal came into class and Matilda got mad and moved the glass with her eyes. So all the other times that Matilda would get mad at someone she would use her magical powers to get back at people. So one night Matilda goes to the Trunchbuls house to get Mrs. Honeys doll back and does by getting the Trunchbul very scared.Her father is a car dealer who who steals car parts and puts them on used cars. Her mother is a bingo player who hits on other guys. Mrs. Honey is a sweet who is sweet to her students.So if you people out there like magic and complex stories then Ithink you should read this book. I thought that this book was interesting and I think that kids will enjoy raeding this book."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"Matilda, is a book written mainly for children and thus much of it is not quite possible. In other words, the book lets your imagination run wild. An example would be the nasty Trunchbull who took hold of a child by his hair, lifted him up into the air and flung him straight out of the window just because he was eating chocolates in class! And it would be a Guinness world record if a child like Matilda could read books like Shakespeare! So in that way this book, mainly for children is just for stretching your imagination like a rubber band.Roald Dahl has made every single character in this book marvellously exciting but that is probably the only similarity between them. All the characters have their own unique personalities. For example, I will compare Miss Honey with Mrs. Wormwood. Miss Honey is a school teacher who was very startled by Matilda's brilliance on her very first day at school. Mrs. Wormwood, Matilda's mother, on the other hand was absolutely not interested in education or Matilda. Her opinion was that \`A girl should think about making herself look attractive so that she can get a good husband later on. Looks is more important than books,\\" By reading this you can see how totally different each character is.My favourite character in the book is Matilda who is a genius and a child prodigy. In Roald Dahl's words ' ...extraordinary, and by that I mean sensitive and brilliant. ...Her mind was so nimble and she was so quick to learn that her ability should have been obvious to the most half-witted of parents.' The parts where she takes revenge on her parents for treating her badly are full of suspense.I would recommend this book to my friends as I have thoroughly enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"I liked matilda because... it is very funny, and I read it a zillion times, but the entertainment is still great. I like the way it ended. I liked the book better than the movie. The movie should be a horror movie because of the way the trunchbull killed Miss Honeys' dad. My dad loved it, my mom thought it was okay, and my sister, mind you, never even wanted to try it. She said all Roald Dahl's books are stupid (yeah right). I was reading BOY, and Roald Dahl said he wanted to write a book saying that kids can be very smart even some kids are smarter than thier parents.

That is PRECISELY what happpens when one sits down with Roald Dahl's unforgettable &quot;Matilda&quot;. It ranks among his very best work, arguably the best story he's constructed for readers of all ages. This story was first released back when I was in fifth grade- it quickly became my constant companion- on the bus on the way to school, on the bus on the way home- my nose was buried deep among Dahl's magical words. When I picked up the story again recently (in part due to the euphoria surrounding the Hary Potter phenomenon) I found the story as brilliant as ever- there are few &quot;children's&quot; books which stand the test of time (those of us who have tried reading Ramona into adulthood can attest to this) and Matilda is perhaps the best example of a timeless tale in modern times. If you are a child, read it every day for a year and I promise it will not grow tiresome. If you are an adult, read it once, and you will long again to be a child so you could read it every day for a year without wanting to put it away."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"I enjoyed the book so much that I have read it 4 times and every time I loved it.

They are what are called a 'legend.' MATILDA, by one of the best selling children's authors of all time, Roald Dahl, tells the fantastic, dangerously hilarious story of a young genius girl named Matilda. Living in a society and a family full of stupidity and selfishness, she adapts to her surroundings with her prodigal skills. Attached to her library, she reads out the entire children's as well as adults' section, and finds herself reading almanacs and dictionaries at the age of five. It's only until one incident angers her that she discovers in herself a fantastic gift -- using this uncalled for gift, she lets out her powers on her cruel parents and snobby brother. She soon enters school, that way her thief parents don't have to worry about the 'spoiled brat' anymore. (Her parents never bought her a thing in her life, don't know her age, and sometimes forgets she's even there. They're also unaware of the fact that she could spell her name at two.) There, she enters the only world that she could ever love -- the world of children. And the world of her sweet, loving teacher, Ms. Honey. And it is there that she sees an evil in her school -- the Trunchbull, her rather cannaballistic principal. From the laughable memories of Bruce Bogtrotter to the tale of the Trunchbull's past to the magical, hilarious, and wonderful last page, MATILDA makes itself my favorite novel of all time.Showing you that a child can be so strong, showing you that a little girl could be so heroic and talented , is a masterful work to compile. Written with Dahl's loving style, it is among the best of children's novels of all time. Leveling and even surpassing Lois Sachar's HOLES and Philip Pullman's HIS DARK MATERIALS trilogy, Matilda is the most loving novel I have ever read and will continue to be. It is good to know that no book will ever beat this classic, no matter how fantasticthe book will be. Matilda is legendary. And if the rating system would go up to 10 stars, it would still be unratable. This is not overhype; this is perfectly true. It's absolutely unforgettable, the flagship of all children's books."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"THIS IS ABOOK FOR EVERY CHILDREN IN THE UNIVERSE!!THIS BOOK IS GREAT!!

I liked the ending because Matilda didn't have to live with her mean parents anymore she got to live with miss Honey."},{"Title":"Matilda CD","review":"I think Matilda is great.

It is about a topic that is extremely intriguing to say the least, one which will confound the cleverness of the minds of all those who really think: Kenneth Lipton addresses the mystery of mankind's phenomenal quantum \\"spurt\\" of technological development in the 20th century, with a particular emphasis on nuclear technology: electricity, automobiles, aircraft, the Space Age, the Computer Age, medicine.... Now these are things which \\"normal everyday\\" Western and other citizens just don't give a second thought about and take for granted in the most unconcious of ways, and yet when we bring scrutiny to bear on this issue, it turns out to be the most mysterious aspect of man's history staring us squarely in the face, defying ALL so-called conventional scholarly explaination. For instance, if one studies civilisation from the ancient Greek time of Alexander the Great (323 B.C) to 1750 A.D - the time of the reign of British monarch George II - one will see that the world and humanity had changed very little technologically speaking: except for the development of clockwork, gunpowder, the printing press and the telescope - all in the 2-3 centuries prior to George's reign, technological abilities had remained absolutely the same over the vast expanse of these two millenia. (Coal had just begun to be used on a large scale around 1700). For instance, a British silver penny or any coin from 1750 compared almost equally in the qualitative sense to a silver Drachma from Alexander's time. British and European sailing vessels compared as equally with ancient Greek vessels and galleys. So did agricultural techniques, pottery, weaving and other arts and articles of life and living. Swords, daggers, bows and arrows, pikes and spears (and shields and armour) were the principal weapons employed over this 2000 year period.Now, we have been seeing a steady rise in technological advancement since the latter half of the eighteenth century, but the actual development as we know it, all occured during the last century. Now what occasioned this remarkable \\"spurt\\" in the 20th century A.D? And why didn't it take place at any other time in history, in the 5th century A.D - or the 1st century B.C - instead? Kenneth is a plumber by profession, and his earthy and ordinary language make his approach and discourse even more remarkable and refreshing. He follows the classic \\"paleo-civilisations\\" theme by thinking that mankind had attained technological heights before, and then brought about his ruin each time by misusing these abilities. He quotes the Sodom and Gomorrah story from the Bible, and the Indian holy epic the Mahabharat to substantiate his case. Then he goes on to present evidence for ancient Uranium mines in the US. His theory is that although the previous technological epochs of man are now shrouded in myth and scripture, mankind retained some kind of \\"genetic memory\\" of those past achievements, which somehow got reactivated in the 20th century, resulting in the amazing leap from just horse-and-cart in 1900 to supersonic aircraft, Cadillacs and atom bombs by the mid nineteen-forties, and more later on. This is an ingenious conclusion, and although I don't agree with it for various other theoretical reasons, I praise the nature of his insight. It is on the right track indeed. Kenneth thinks that mankind is once again on the brink of technological ruin and reversal, his technological abilities having brought on a Dark Age, instead of the proper use of their immense potential. Once again I agree, but I believe our \\"end\\" this time around won't exactly be because of \\"nuclear\\" reasons alone... This book is a must to read, and will stimulate immensely the expansion of the mental horizons of the reader."},{"Title":"Yellow Sky: An Alternative Perspective About the Human Condition and History","review":"Mr. Lipton did a wonderful job in writing this book. He is a plumber and thus, he has a layman's way of writing which is much better than alot of &quot;professional authors&quot; in my opinion. Plus, he has a refreshing outlook on archeology having found many things in his profession. Mr. Lipton presents a very good case, in that, he produces quite a large amount of evidence which supports his hypothesis. I hope he writes another book as I'll be the first to buy it.

To uncover the truth, Caleb Tanner will masquerade as a simple groom and try to get close enough to see whether or not she is responisible for secrets making their way to France.

Vermillion finds herself attracted to this man as well, but believes such a match would never work. Even when she finds her true identity, the situation appears hopeless.The complexities of war and of the 'ton are equal, and when meshed become a tangle that only skillful minds can fathom. With Ms. Martin's long heralded skill at delivering a sensual romance, this novel gives readers a most unique heroine. Wise and innocent simultaneously, Vermillion is somewhat like the younger days of Elizabeth Taylor, while Caleb is the kind of hero readers have grown to love.

Though she thought she had come to terms with her destiny, she soon finds that she is far from sure if she wants to spend her life as a mistress. When she meets Caleb Tanner, the new head groom at Parkland, she finds someone who can ignite the fire deep within her. As the weeks pass, she realizes that she has to be independent, even at the cost of her aunt's dissapointment.Captain Caleb Tanner has been assigned to Parkland in as a groom to try to uncover a traitor to the Crown. He didn't count on meeting someone as seductive as Vermillion nor as innocent as Lee. Though Vermillion and Lee are one and the same, only Caleb has uncovered the true person she is.Though Secret Ways isn't has emotional as Martin's previous historicals, it is still an easy read that you will want to finish. Caleb and Lee work together to uncover a traitor which is a little unbelieveable, but the sexual tension between them is undeniable. Also unbelieveable is the fact that Lee is a virgin, which is what all our heroines in historicals are. It was a change from historicals where the heroines were a part of the ton, as Lee had more freedom to do what she wished. I have had a hard time lately getting into historicals, but I'm glad I took a chance on this one!"},{"Title":"Secret Ways","review":"Just when I was about to dive off the Kat Martin bandwagon, she writes this little treasure. I'm not saying this book is phenomenal, but it is enjoyable.Our heroine, Vermillion Lee Durant, is a trained connoisseur in the art of pleasuring a man. Throughout the lustful London male society, an unknown detail stays hidden -- Vermillion is only trained. As yet, she has not practiced her satisfying skills. She will remain a courtesan student until she turns nineteen; at the conclusion of this birthday ball, Vermillion will choose her first lover.The youngest son of the Earl of Selhurst, Captain Caleb Tanner, a British officer, has been called back from the Spanish front. He is an expert horseman and will act as an undercover spy in the Durant stables. His mission is to uncover the traitorous traitor who has been leaking information to the Napoleon military.I appreciated the length Kat Martin employed for sexual tension -- all the luring glances, aching desires, illicit kisses -- were paced for the reader's total enjoyment. Such longing earns the word romance. The stable scenes are delightful. Gently written was the soft and assuring manner Caleb used to help \\"Lee\\". Their competitive horse-race \\"the contest\\" is assembled with innocence and fun. Martin allowed such tender moments to help the reader overlook the anxious times our two lovers are forced to suffer.Kat Martin's two lovers may not see eye to eye, but at least, they are not fighting, demeaning, hating, and then regrettably making love - the usual Martin outline. Kat Martin, if you are out there in author land, your writing skills are extraordinary, but please keep your war machine and arguing lessons in the skim mode.Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada."},{"Title":"Secret Ways","review":"Courtesy of Love RomancesVermillion Lee Durant is approaching nineteen and it is time for her to choose a protector among her admirers.

Kat Martin is a wonderful author and I only have to see her name on the front and I'm assured of a great read. Caleb Tanner is the perfect hero and Lee Durant is the perfect heroine. It couldn't have been written any better. It's actually quite a touching love story and I enjoy reading books where the hero and heroine don't hate each other throughout much of the book, only to end up together in the end.

Problem is, Vermillion is not sure that that is the kind of lifestyle that she wants to lead. She loves the outdoors, raising, and racing her horses. She doesn't think that when the time comes on her 19th birthday that she can choose a protector. Especially since none of her suitors interest her in the least. There is also the added problem in the fact that she is finding herself drawn to the new groom in her stables, Calab. He is everything a servent should not be. He is arrogant, assertive, and just too good looking for Lee's peace of mind. Still he awakens not only her heart, but her young body to passion.Calab Tanner is not what he seems.

It is a romance at heart with ingenue Vermillian Lee Durant following the footsteps of her aunt Gabriella to become a cyprian well-craft in the arts of seduction. British cavalry Captain Caleb Tanner sneaks inside her manor as a groom to ferret out a treasonous spy and suspects Lee and her aunt. Smoldering passion soon complicates Caleb's investigation and leads him to believe Lee's innocence. The identity of the culprit abruptly comes out as a hasty denouement - disappointingly so when Ms. Martin painstakingly whips up paranoia in the mystery.

She would rather be Lee, riding horses in the countryside, but she knows that her destiny as the third generation Durant courtesan is to be Vermillion.Secret Agent Captain Caleb Tanner seeks a traitor. He goes undercover as a groom at Parklands, the estate owned by Vermillion's aunt. Caleb believes that Vermillion is a hardened, avaricious but well paid whore. That is until he meets Lee. As he and Lee fall in love, Caleb knows the mission remains first, but plans to become Vermillion's first protector. However, she needs more from him now that love is part of the relationship.SECRET WAYS is an exciting Regency romantic suspense tale that sub-genre fans will fully appreciate. The story line is loaded with action, but also slowed down at the bit by the girth of detail on horses. The lead couple is a delightful duo especially the almost schizoid lead female protagonist as Lee battles with Vermillion for supremacy before Caleb's love enables her to enjoy both sides of her complex personality. The traitor investigation adds the depth that will leave readers applauding Kat Martin for a fine novel.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Secret Ways","review":"Almost-19yo heroine is drawn to her new groomsman despite trying to decide among 3 influential men she was going to choose as her protector on her birthday party.

Their secret affair soon reveals the truth about heroine to Hero & changes the tune of their r/s as well as his part in his spy work. What kind of future will these 2 have with heroine's destiny as a courtesan & Hero's overseas military career?This has Martin's usual sensual & emotionally-evoking writing. The romance is fraught with various social challenges. It took me some time to figure out whether I liked the main characters or not. In the 1st 3rd of the book, I wasn't sure if heroine would blindly follow the courtesan path of her foremothers or attain some independence esp since she was already independently wealthy. I also didn't know if Hero would continue to judging heroine harshly while wavering in his sexual resistance to her. Soon enough heroine followed her heart & choose to be herself. Hero fell in love with simple-side of heroine & understood why she put up a courtesan image she to others. It helped that they both became upfront about things & made for a more intimate & sweet r/s. The suspense part wasn't predictable & played side part to main romance. Overall, this was an enjoyable read.Recommended."},{"Title":"Secret Ways","review":"I have to admit that I really enjoy most of Kat Martin's other books, however this one feel flat in my opinion. The story was predictable, something that I don't hate as long as the story is well told and the characters are likable. But honestly, I just wasn't that crazy about the characters.Caleb lies to everyone, and no one but Vermillion is upset - why isn't her aunt or one of her friends upset? I certainly would be. Then he LIES AGAIN. As for Vermillion/Lee, she wasn't my favorite character either. I like that she was loyal to her family and that she wanted to make them happy, but there is such a thing as taking it too far.As for the traitor, that wasn't much of a surprise. And all the timing was just a little bit too coincidental. So that part of the story didn't add anything for me.All the above makes it sound like I hated the book, but I didn't. I was just disappointed in it compared to her other books. If you are a fan on Kat Martin, check this one out of the library or borrow it, and it is not an awful read.

Both Lee and Caleb are sympathetic characters torn between duty and desire, between obligation and love. However, even with several subplots and a few surprising twists and turns, it seemed as if a spark was missing.

In fact, I was leery of reading Ms. Martin's contemporary books, but was pleasantly surprised there.This book is a bit of a mess. I'm pretty good at suspending belief. It did bother me that the heroine was 18 at the start and celebrated her 19th birthday during the course of the story, but I perservered anyway. However, I fell from my suspension with a bang when I read that she'd purchased a house 2 years before and filled it with unwed mothers. Wait a minute! That would mean she was 16 at the time she did this. In Regency England, no less. I don't think so! It would next to impossible for a 16-year-old in out own time to do such a thing. Granted she was rich and was given a lot of leeway. But still....After that, I found some other discrepencies which spelled very slopping editing and I just couldn't get back into the story.

You will also get to know a man who suffered neither fools nor collectivists left or right gladly, yet had the surety never to make it a personal or a venal rebuke. I could point to numerous examples of just how lyric, how embracing, was his way of enunciating all the reasons why we should be and remain suspicious of the encroachments of the State against the sovereignty of the individual, but perhaps this will do for an introduction, from his gentle rebuke to the militant wing of the anti-Communist movement, written at the threshold of the Smith Act trial of 1949, &quot;How To Curb The Commies.&quot; Here is wisdom we would do wisely to heed even now, as only too many of our fellows seem sooner disposed to a curb upon our freedoms than a healthy defence thereof):&quot;Heterodoxy is a necessary condition of a free society...Whenever I choose an idea and label it 'right,' I imply the prerogative of another to reject that idea and label it 'wrong.' To invalidate his right is to invalidate mine...The danger, to those who hold freedom as the highest good, is not the ideas the communists espouse but the power they aspire to. Let them rant their heads off - that is their right, which we cannot afford to infringe - but let us keep from them the political means of depriving everybody else of the same right.&quot;As unpretentious and as gently stylish in his way as was his great mentor Albert Jay Nock, Frank Chodorov's championship of freedom should never be purged from what remains of our patrimony."},{"Title":"Fugitive Essays: Selected Writings of Frank Chodorov","review":"Frank Chodorov was anything but an \\"ivory towered professor\\" as these essays will attest. He was a self-made man, and he was not swayed by the political trends of his times. He had little patience with the naive leftests, and he separated himself from what Lawrence Dennis called \\"The Dumb Right.\\"Chodorov was opposed to socialism. He was obviously at odds with the True Believing Communists, but he also expressed criticism at the New Dealers whom he thought would inaugurate socialism under different labels. He shared many of the same criticisms that John T. Flynn had of the New Deal programs.One of the themes that Chodorov emphasizes is the fact that the \\"Capitalists\\" did not do a good job of defending themselves in refuting their Marxist and socialists critics. Chodorov is clear that anyone looking to the professors for intellectual support against Marxist and socialist criticisms was wasting their time. Chodorov was also against supressing Free Speech and Free Press of the Marxists and socialists. He remarked that to do so was to emulate the Communists wherevever they held power that emulating the Communists' tactics lowered Americans to their level. Chodorov's solution was for men to refute the ideas of the Marxists. In other words, one should confront the buzz words and phrases and slogans of the Marxists and socialists such as surplus value, greed, etc.While Chodorov disagreed with Big Communism, he was no supporter of the Conservatives dreams of the U.S. Military State. In fact Chodorov was disillusioned with many Conservatives who wanted to build a garrison state in the U.S. and match such as state with a police state. Chodorov stated that the Conservatives would split over Anti-Communism, and Chodorov had little patience with \\"The Dumb Right.\\" In fact, he stated that if anyone ever called him a Conservative, he would punch that person in the nose.Yet, Chodorov's criticism of Big Communism was more incisive than most Conservatives. One remark he made that was so true was the Big Communism would rise over the dead of the Capitalists AND the workers in The Workers' Paradise. Chodorove also accurately argued that Big Communism would collapse due to its disasterous economic policies. He knew that only because the West, including the U.S., subsidized Big Communism, Big Communism survived. In other words, Chodorov thought that Big Communism's collapse would result from ecomonic policy rather than fruitless wars.Frank Chodorov's thinking and writing was similiar to that of Albert Jay Nock and other thoughtful men who valued liberty more than they hated \\"The Enemy\\" whoever the enemy was at any given time. This reviewer's only criticism of Chodorov is that he could have embellished his arguements against socialism and especially Big Communism by citing historical examples.Frank Chodorov's writing is clear and thoughtful. Anyone who reads his work would learn not only clear thinking, but they would learn good writing from someone who did not clutter his work with quotes and useless phrases."},{"Title":"Fugitive Essays: Selected Writings of Frank Chodorov","review":"A collection of 45 essays ranging in topics from natural rights, socialism, individualism, foreign policy, as well as many others, Frank Chodorov lays out these essays with impeccable reasoning and clarity making for an excellent read. Chodorov demonstrates in his writings that he is an independent thinker who doesn't fit into the \\"left/right\\" paradigm with whom at times he is highly critical of. He doesn't use ad hominem attacks which is a relief, he just lays out the arguments in a straight forward logical manner which is quite refreshing given our day and age.Clearly in the writings Chodorov takes issue with the aspects of big communism, but unlike many conservatives who advocated combating communism through military intervention, Chodorov argues that communism should be judged on the merit of its ideas. Chodorov reasons that using force to combat communism you actually submit yourself to the same tactics used by the communists, such as suppressing speech, military intervention, etc. Also, in his defense of nonaggression Chodorov criticizes American Cold War policy which asserts that we must use military force to stop the advancement of the ideals of communism. In the essay Reds Are Natives, he asks how the United States plans to stop the spread of communism in America. First he analysis our techniques of military intervention and then applies that logic domestically showing how such a position is erroneous for both foreign and domestic policies.Chodorov also has interesting insights into the aspect of what is known as isolationism. He believed that an inherent feature of human nature was centered on the individual and localism. Chodorov thought that people were concerned more with their individual self and what happened locally which makes up \\"isolationism\\" instead of being concerned with the international community and policies. He cites the shift in thinking with the policies pursued by Wilson and his Mexican policy to help promote democracy, later taken up by Roosevelt. Wilson used the military force to help back Carranza and basically states that when you use force to undermine the position of the people of a given country, that tends to have an alienating affect upon the people who move toward a hostile position against you. How people can't see this truism which still continues as our foreign policy today is beyond me. With the shift in ideology from \\"isolation\\" to interventionism/internationalism, I believe that had a profound impact on our society as a whole. The individualism that once defined our society has transformed us to becoming mere statistics within a vast bureaucracy which I believe is dehumanizing.Other important aspects of the book include Chodorov's position concerning natural rights as well as taxation. He is critical of people who dismiss natural rights. His views of taxation are pretty straight forward, taxation is robbery. His essay on Henry David Thoreau is very interesting.Overall the essays are very insightful and easy to read. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in independent thinking."},{"Title":"Fugitive Essays: Selected Writings of Frank Chodorov","review":"American politics is comprised of three kinds of people: Those who wittingly support the state, those who unwittingly support the state, and those who support the people. Representing the third kind, Frank Chodorov was a relentless champion of the people. In a conversational style, Frank Chodorov wrote tirelessly on the threats to liberty (threats spearheaded by the state itself). He told us that an income tax was unAmerican and how it is a disguised confiscation of property. He told us that militarism was unAmerican and that political powers gained through war are never abdicated. He understood the game of dictators and he could see that America was in the game.Why does it take men of Russian heritage, men like Chodorov, Soltzynizn, Dostoevsky, to tell Americans what freedom is? Because Americans have been duped into believing their leaders are gods. \\"The censorship of thought is a military necessity\\" wrote Chodorov. Familiar with the warning in George Orwell's 1984, Chodorov wrote, \\"if the war draws large chunks of our population to the land, an American state after the pattern of orwell's 1984 may be averted.\\" It wasn't averted. Chodorov writes, \\"the direction of the American state will be toward the acquisition of power for war purposes...the tendency will be more and more toward totalitarianism. That is unavoidable.\\"Chodorov knew the game so well he could make predictions that were correct to the smallest detail. Anticipating the Cold War, he wrote, \\"We are again being told to be afraid. As it was before the two world wars so it is now: politicians talk in frightening terms, journalists invert scare lines, and even next-door neighbors are taking up the cry: the enemy is at the gates; we must gird for battle.\\"And so it was.And so it was again when we went to Vietnam in 1964 and so it was again when we went to Iraq in 2003. The game of dictators. Chodorov was our leader, and no one has ever heard of him.Frank Chodorov has been dead since 1966. Today, his invisible torch is carried by 2008 Presidential Candidate RON PAUL. These great men who represent the people are so few. The people are the victims of their own ignorance, their own apathy, their own dogmatism. And only when our national buildings and Interstates are stripped of their criminal identies such as Hoover, LBJ, and Bush, and replaced with those who stand for freedom, like Chodorov, Nock, Rothbard, and Paul, will the people know that these men made a difference. And that difference was liberty itself."},{"Title":"A Dream Come True","review":"This is a &quot;must read&quot; for all people in every stage of their Christian life....especially those who bleed the blue of Kentucky.

Mr. Mon&eacute;nembo has lived in exile from his native Guinea since 1969, studying in Senegal, Abidjan, and Lyon before settling in Normandy. The Oldest Orphan is his seventh novel, and second of his books to be translated to English.The narrative is fragmented between flashback and a blur of present tense, where the protagonist Faustin's memory wanders between age 10 and age15. At age 15, Faustin exists in prison, awaiting execution, accused of killing the boy who allegedly raped his sister. Faustin faces heroic challenges with humor, resourcefulness, and remnants of an innocence that has been brutally truncated by genocidal mania. The facts are difficult, and blurred, against the backdrop of social & political upheaval.This is an important novella concerning the Rwanda genocide of 1994, written by one of the strongest literary voices available in translation from the African continent."},{"Title":"Things That Make You Go Hmmm: The '90s Music Party Game","review":"this book is awesome for small parties and especially for just hanging out with your roommates on a foggy minded sunday morning. you know the kind where you're sitting on your front stoop, drinking coffee and wondering wahat happened, and maybe should you go get some burritos. i like both of his books. they rock! they also make you want to check out music that you haven't heard for a while. very cool."},{"Title":"Things That Make You Go Hmmm: The '90s Music Party Game","review":"Like the 80's version, this book will challenge even the most die-hard music trivia buffs.

The tutorials in this book are missing steps and are unclear. What the user sees on the screen after following each step in the tutorials does not resemble the illustrations in the book even in the most basic of exercises. I called the publisher thinking that perhaps there were typos and was told that there were not any errata. The e-mail address that I received for the author of this book was invalid.

I logged on to this site hoping to find another book on Amorphium, but no luck. FYI - The &quot;Learning Amorphium Pro&quot; CDs by Vince Parker are very thorough in explaining the in's and outs of Amorphium, tips on things to watch for and a few modeling instructionals.

However, I came across Amorphium because I was looking for a low-cost alternative to Z-Brush. Amorphium offers many of the same capabilities as Z-Brush but the results just aren't as polished. That being said, there's an awful lot \\"under the hood\\" with this piece of software. I like the visual approach to all of its tools. I like the texturing capabilities and it's many modeling options. Having exhausted all the online tutorials I could find, I searched out this book and was dismayed by the reviews.However, I'm already well aware of Mr. Mortier's other books and his many tutorials going back to the Commodore Amiga. I already knew he has a very individual visual style that is certainly all his own. If you can get past the visual style (he's more of a surrealist than a realist...no ultra-realistic hulking demons or monsters here), his writing style is very clear and his many tutorials break down each tool in an easy to understand fashion. I appreciate the \\"learn by doing\\" approach which makes this book a great alternative to the reference manual type of software book.All in all, I'm very happy with this purchase, especially since the book can be purchased for very little money and the software itself is very reasonably priced. I highly recommend both!"},{"Title":"The Amorphium Pro Handbook","review":"The book contains some good tips and tricks and the author seems very familiar with the tools. Unfortunately, the models that appear in the book look very amateurish. This is certainly not a book you would use to show off the capabilities of Amorphium Pro. The author also annoyingly exports most of the models to Bryce for rendering instead of using Amorphium Pro's renderer. How does that show what Amorphium Pro can do? It doesn't.At one point he makes a snide remark that \\"Liquify\\" is spelled wrong in the program and should be \\"Liquefy\\". This seemed petty to me, and according to my dictionary both forms are acceptable. The book also doesn't cover texturing as well as I thought it should. Still, considering it is the only book currently available on Amorphium Pro, it does have some handy tips and if you have the money to spare, it is worth a read. At least until more comprehensive and professional looking Amorphium Pro books are published."},{"Title":"The Amorphium Pro Handbook","review":"This author has over 20 different books.

I found this book to be muchbetter and less formulaic than the HOUSE OF SPIRITS was. Thecharacter is fully fleshed out and seems more real; perhapsbecause the protagonist is a woman, Eva Luna herself, and inthe other book, Allende offers the narrative through adomineering and somewhat obtuse man's eyes. The growth ofEva Luna is beautifually told and readers will identify withher throughout. This evocative novel set my imagination onfire and made all the colors in my world appear brighterwhile I was reading it."},{"Title":"Eva Luna","review":"Conceived on her father's deathbed and almost strangled to death by her umbilical cord, the baby who emerged would become the woman, Eva Luna. Her birth is incredible and her life is even more so as Eva spins for us her story and the story of those who impacted her life.Isabel Allende captivates the reader by having us take a glimpse of the life and times of Eva Luna, a child whose life is so surreal and incredible to the point where fact and fantasy become one and the same. Eva's voice sweeps us into the dark world of perverts, undesirables and revolutionaries. Through Eva's stories you get a closer look at a society rotten at its core while masquerading as a democracy.Come with Eva, as a little girl where she plays with a stuffed puma owned by a mad-man who uses Indians for his embalming experiments. Watch as this orphaned girl is \\"sold\\" off by her strange godmother who believes in the gods of her ancesteral Africa and the saints of Catholicism. Watch Eva as she grows from childhood to adolescense to an adult who has to confront the reality of love and revolution.EVA LUNA is a lyric tale whose language draws you immediately into the life of the character and her supporting cast. You feel a deep empathy for this woman and you see through her eyes the contradictions that life has to offer. Allende has given us an exceptional work that explores both the spiritual, political and sensual side of a woman caught up in the stream of chaos in her South American country. Come, let Eva tell you a story, her story and you will find yourself unable to tear yourself away from her amazing tale."},{"Title":"Eva Luna","review":"Sometimes, actually pretty often, Isabel Allende's writing overflows with her own love of language, and you kinds want her to dial it down a little. Not so much, however, in Eva Luna. The writing is more controlled; the book reads as tho an editor actually paid some attention to it before sending it to press.Child of a servant, the beautiful and enchanting Eva Luna escapes into lyrical storytelling when life gets too tough to bear. She and Rolf, a film maker, are brought together through Eva's guerrilla lover. The result is a lovely piece of literature that works as a metaphor for salvation through creativity.It's a good one."},{"Title":"Eva Luna","review":"This amazing story of an orphan whose life seemed to have finished an expedition through the most enigmatic and most pleasurable world, is the novel that is to be never forgotten because of its amazing magic. Magic that will serve as your carpet ride through the most amazing story of a woman's life: Eva Luna's. Eva Luna, the sexy, naughty, adorable, beautiful woman is a shining proof of the existence of literature's wonders. Isabel Allende created a literary jewel."},{"Title":"Eva Luna","review":"I found the first half of the book put-downable, meaning that I didn't have a COMPULSION to read it. Nevertheless, I kept it with me and was enchanted whenever I was reading. [NB It evoked similar feelings when reading it to Gabriel Garcia Marquez's Love In The Time of Cholera, so if you liked that, you will surely like this]However, as Eva moved out of her childhood, and the character range widened, the book became more and more un-put-downable, to the point where I was reading it walking down the street.Allende is a beautiful story-teller. That you learn about the social and historical background of Chile - unstated, but unmistakeable) is a subtly conveyed bonus.Thoroughly recommended!"},{"Title":"Eva Luna","review":"This is one of my favorite books, and I recommend it to everyone. I love the main character, Eva Luna, a strong young woman with a no-nonsense approach to life and love. The stories are enticing and complex, so well written you'll feel you're actually living the scene. Read it and then buy the sequel, Tales of Eva Luna, which is also excellent."},{"Title":"Eva Luna","review":"I think this book illustrates the situation in revolutionairy Chile very well. But it also gives the reader a very fine view on the South-American life. I must say that a reader has to be interested in these two subjects. But that is a rule for any Allende book. If you read one and you enjoyed it, you might read them all (and there are a lot of books written by her). She writes in a very typical style. Very much her own style, but I think it has so many Southern influences, the sista-style perhaps. The sentences are sometimes a bit difficult, but the story is so wonderfully built from the first brick to the last one. I would really advise anyone to read the book. It is a bit sad, but also a big victory on life. Absolutely great how abstract it is written, from one thing to the opposite..."},{"Title":"Eva Luna","review":"In the tradition of great novelists, Allende creates a life for her female hero that's full of adventure and interesting characters, each having grand adventures of their own. As picaresques, they're both peculiar and lovable. And because they love the endearing Eva Luna, she survives her difficult orphan's life and lives happily ever after (like her fictional siblings Jones, Flanders and Twist). Magical Realism is Allende's specialty. So is telling a woman's tale. Like House of the Spirits, this one is very educational as to the politics that inspire rebellion, the romance of revolutionaries that makes for a great story, and the ways in which women get caught up in the fever. Speaking of getting caught up in the fever, so does the reader. In Eva Luna, we're introduced to many worlds and cultures, each more exciting than the next."},{"Title":"Eva Luna","review":"For those of you who are stalwart devotees to Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who believe Updike is a mere scribbler compared to the Latin literary lion, who believe \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" should be worshiped more piously than the Bible and Koran put together, it may behoove you stop reading this review ahora mismo. OK, I'm going to admit \\"One Hundred Years\\" is the only novel I've read by Marquez, and \\"Eva Luna\\" is the only novel I've ready by Allende. But \\"One Hundred Years\\" is supposed to be Marquez' magnum opus and \\"Eva Luna\\" is not generally considered one of Allende's top works, so I think it's OK to compare. Having said this, I would rather read ten more novels by Allende than one more by Marquez.As I began \\"Eva Luna,\\" I was afraid that I had stumbled into a Marquez imitator who was going to be even more mind-numbing than the original. Instead, I found a writer who, I'm sorry, has taken the madcap, Latin-style adventure story thought by many to be perfected by Marquez and improved on it so much that I wondered if Allende has been inspired by Marquez at all. Now I understand that Marquez is an immensely talented artist and that it could very well be that I belong to a small minority of literary fiction readers who merely don't care for Marquez' particular style. Some may even want to point out that Marquez' style is just too high-brow and advanced for my philistine intellect, which may very well be accurate.Nevertheless, it is clear to me that Allende's characters are obviously more well-rounded, more interesting, and more human than anything Marquez could ever conjure up. I appreciate the level of thought in his stream-of-consciousnesses, but they didn't necessarily add to the story. In fact, it muddied up a novel that already contained to many half-formed characters that seemed more like dashed-off profiles of historic figures than anyone I would be interested in learning more about. All of Allende's main characters - Eva, Rolf, Huberto, madrina, the gloriously sexed-up twin sisters who lived with Rolf - are all clearly labors of love from Allende. Her interwoven plot devices are also more disciplined than Marquez, which may be because Allende doesn't seem to take herself as seriously as Marquez. One gets the impression that Marquez was busily mopping his brow while hunched over his keyboard pounding out \\"One Hundred Years,\\" thinking to himself how the magnificent piece of art he was creating was going make Joyce look light a lightweight and make even another Nobel Prize look unworthy. Allende, on the other hand, gives the impression she actually had fun writing her novel, perhaps smiling wryly at the fact she was creating such a fine piece of literary entertainment, happy and content that she has been given the gift to do what she does.I can't say I'll never read Marquez again; in fact, I hope to give the man another shot one day soon. When someone gets called the \\"Greatest Living Novelist\\" as often as he does, it's possible I'm just missing the boat. But I'm much more anxious to get back to gorgeous, intelligent, and even somewhat philosophical stylings of Allende before too long. \\"Zorro\\" seems to be getting mixed reviews, but I don't care. This woman makes me want to become proficient enough in Spanish to read fiction in its original form."},{"Title":"Eva Luna","review":"I have to remember that as much as I like the concept of \\"magical realism\\" I, for the most part, don't like the genre. I can think of two books I have actually enjoyed: Macuna&iacute;ma by M&aacute;rio de Andrade and The Yellow Sofa by Eca De Queiros. Most of the time the genre leaves me cold, confused and somewhat bored. There are often too many tangents and too much extraneous detail: Eva Luna has these problems.I wanted to read Eva Luna after having enjoyed Daughter of Fortune back in 2003 and having had a moderate enjoyment of Zorro in 2005, although I had felt the author hadn't really understood the character. While there are some beautifully written passages in Eva Luna they didn't flow together to create a feeling of a coherent story or a plot that was actually going somewhere. Nor, though, did it feel like it was written strictly as a mood piece. Poor Eva seemed to be forced to tread water in the middle of all that flowing prose, bobbing her head up whenever the story required her to be present in a scene.Eva Luna starts as a memoir of an illegitimate daughter of a maid and an indian. While Eva Luna continues to narrate the story of her life, she is but a passive witness to a disparate group of odd balls who end up becoming political revolutionaries. Their stories are so much more interesting than Luna's. Her constant rambling drags down the story and her role in all of this beyond reporter and maybe lover isn't clear."},{"Title":"Eva Luna","review":"Allende's use of magical realism in her book,Eva Luna,is highly redolent of the style of other Latin American writers of the same genre e.g Gabriel Garcia Marquez.However, unlike them,she gives her own unique touch to it,thereby creating sometHing fresh and seemingly new.I enjoyed reading most of the book but felt the end was a bit rushed.That Eva should end up with Rolf Carle was not exactly prefigured.I somehow missed the subtle innuendos and other hidden messages one would expect would lead to both of them coming together.However, Allende's evocation of imagery is stunning and her characters are fully formed and easily recognisable-Rogelio,the Turk,the Turk's wife who kills herself physically after an emotional demise, when her young lover departs.They are all people we see everyday , interact with and talk to.Infact, they are all of us, in a sense."},{"Title":"Eva Luna","review":"I read this book after I read The Stories of Eva Luna and I'm grateful that I did. I was able to read teh stories first, to see the creation and not the creator first. Sort of like not standing backstage at a magic show. Eva is not quite remarkable as surprising in her life's, notice I don't say her because that takes a while to mature, innate ability to continue. She bounces around so much in this novel and into so many situations that are both hilarious and heartbreaking. The whole Riad the Turk story is close to beign the best section. Unfortunately the whole Eva Luna Storyteller image allows you to see the book as a construction of short stories but also appreciate the natural way that they flow from one to the other.I liked that Allende has a writer within her own stories and then has that writer write, it's a nice play on sub-realism. I would say that Eva does come off better as a heroine that Eliza in Daughter of Fortune and I'm not even touching the ninny in Love &amp; Shadows as a comparison.Dare I say that there is another Eva Luna book cloating around out there, a collection of short stories again, a further novel step or perhaps an interaction with another character from another book. That's what I always get the feeling that Allende is doing, creating all of these threads but not attaching them. It's like watching a corner from across the street and seeing two really interesting people about to turn the corner and meet but instead somebody turns around and walks away or drops dead or vanishes.I like Allende for the strength of her writing but I find them all a little Pre-Awesome, if you know what I mean."},{"Title":"Eva Luna","review":"It's pretty good. I actually picked this up from my sister's bookshelf and it's the first Allende novel that I've read. Honestly, I'm a little disappointed.

It seemed to reduce the sprawling luxury of the work.However, this was a hugely interesting and entertaining read, and certainly one I enjoyed more than 'Daughter of Fortune'.It had the same epic grand narrative voice and a somewhat intricate path, but was both easy to read and likeable.I plan to delve into more of Isobel Allende's outstanding works; revel in their complexity and language, and would recommend this book for reading, though perhaps not for purchasing."},{"Title":"Eva Luna","review":"I've been searching for this book in my neck of the woods for the past five or so years.

With a background filling beginning, Eva Luna's life unfolds in front of the reader's eyes as she struggles to survive in an unnamed Latin American country full of political strife. The plot of the novel is interesting as Eva Luna travels and tells her stories to whomever will listen to them. Eva Luna's story captivates the reader as she tells of how she had been conceived on her father's death bed and how she had almost died at birth. The novel is full of sexual scenes and includes a transvestite named Mimi as well. Although the beginning of the novel was not as compelling as it could have been, the remainder of the novel was enchanting with it's humor and spell-bounding plot. House of Spirits is completely different than Eva Luna in many ways because in Eva Luna, the story of one woman's life is told in completion rather than having the lives of many people told at one time. If you have been intrigued by House of Spirits, Eva Luna is a great novel to read but it is more aimed towards a mature audience. Isabel Allende is a truly fantastic author while intertwining magic into a truly entertaining story and making it flow simultaneously."},{"Title":"Eva Luna","review":"This is a tale with three protaganists.One is the narrator, who must surely qualify as one of the most improbable female characters in the history of literature. She can levitate. [So does the book.] She consorts with policemen, guerillas, the elite, the dregs of society, cabinet ministers, artists, and Indians. She loves a beautiful woman who used to be a man. She loves a fierce man who used to be a shy boy. She loves a disfigured man who is old enough to be her grandfather. She loves that man's effete brother as well as his impossibly self-centered wife. She even learns eventually to love herself. She is on both sides of every sort of conflict and doesn't care that this makes her inconsistent. She is above inconsistency. She is a sort of feminine Don Quixote with a long series of Sancho Panzas of three genders.The second protaganist is a Germanic immigrant to the fictitious Latin American country that is the setting for the tale. He escapes from an abused childhood to become the sexual plaything of two sisters, the official photographer of a violent revolution, and at last the predestined lover of the first protaganist.The third protaganist is you-- the reader. That's right, you don't just read this story. You don't merely become immersed in it. You become part of it. The author's style weaves a web in which you become entangled. There's no escape. Not that you want one. The book infects your dreams, and improves them.Most fiction requires the willing suspension of disbelief. This book doesn't bother with that. Disbelief becomes inane when you yourself are part of the story."},{"Title":"Eva Luna","review":"I, like so many others I'm sure, go through phases where I cannot get enough of a certain genre of literature. Coming off of a Japanese Lit. high, I made my way to Gabriel Garcia Marquez. After devouring every book of his I could get my hands on, I was hooked and declared that he was my new favorite author. I cried, I laughed, and fell even more in love with my life. I was looking for something else that could measure up to my Comlumbian boyfriend. A friend recommended Eva Luna and within a week, I was addicted. Once again, I devoured every Isabel Allende book that came my way. I now believe my love for Allende's work is beginning to trump my passion once reserved for Marquez.If you love language and have an obsession with rich, metaphysical literature, you will not be disappointed with Eva Luna. It is one of those books that will most certainly send you on a quest for more, more, more. Books that measure up will be few and far in between."},{"Title":"Eva Luna","review":"i love the way Allende writes. she's a master!! this is a great love story. but it's not typical. its not expected. it is epic and it doesn't just limit its focus to two people. you meet many wonderful, crazy characters. what a world she has created. it's like one long dream reading this book."},{"Title":"Eva Luna","review":"Isabel Allende wrote Eva Luna in a way that would keep the readers wondering what happens next. I got trapped reading the story because I wanted to know what happened to the characters. Allende talked about a different character of the story until the last few chapters of the book and then she put them together. Every character that Allende wrote about in the book was somehow connected to the life of Eva Luna. By the time I got to the second chapter, I had already figured out the ending of the book, I thought.Eva Luna's mother, Consuelo, brought up a good question when she talked to the nuns at the church where she had been sent: &quot;Yes, but who had the say in heaven, God or his Mama?&quot; For some reason that question just stuck in my mind. I think Allende wrote this in her story to show that Consuelo had a questioning mind, although people thought that she was silly. Eva Luna was six years old when her mother died, and she instantly became an orphan. A man said that he was going to leave Eva Luna everything, &quot;Write in my will Pastor. I want this little girl to be my sole heir. Everything is to go to her when I die.&quot; Allende creates sympathy for Eva because the Pastor did not write in the will what the man had wanted for her. All of the people who worked in the man's house had ot go find more work for themselves. The government did not know of Eva Luna's existence until she got Riad Halabi to pay someone to get her some type of papers. Eva worked very hard when she was a little child. People said that they would teach her how to read, but they never seemed to have the time. When Eva finally learned how to write and read she said &quot;Writing was the best thing that had happened to me in all my life; I was euphoric.&quot; Through out Eva's life she told stories to people who would listen to her. As she learned how to write, she started to write down her stories. She ended up being a writer as she became an adult. Allende has written a story that expresses a child's life and lets the readers watch her grow up. I got confused by some of the Spanish words that Allende used. There were a couple of other words that she used that confused me, but it did not take away from the book. I think that if I reread the book, I would pick up on things that I missed the first time. There was one time during the book that I was confused about the idenity of a couple of her characters. I had to go back and find whick name she used for a certain character when she would bring them back into the story.Isabel Allende held my attention through out the book. I felt that I could relate to the characters of the story because I know how hard it is when you move from place to place. Allende gave me an excellent picture of what she was writting about. I liked the fact that she used a large cast of characters in her story. I think that it added to the book. I enjoyed reading about how hard it was for Eva Luna to receive an education, and what she did with it afterward."},{"Title":"Eva Luna","review":"Isabel Allende, desde su primera novela que le&iacute; &quot;La Casa de Espiritus&quot; hasta la m&aacute;s &uacute;tlima, por tanto que me fascinaba su escritura, siempre voy a ser su fiel lector.Ella es una verdadera cuentista y en &quot;Eva Luna&quot; conlleva a lo m&aacute;ximo su creatividad en &quot;crear cuentos&quot; espontaneamente para una noche solitaria.Buen libro que recomiendo a todos los que a Uds. les gusta tema de amor que se termina feliz."},{"Title":"Eva Luna","review":"One feels like a heel for even writing a review of Allende books. While there are a couple of duds, most of her books are so infused with magic that there's nothing a reviewer can say to improve upon or invoke the sense of wonder that he takes away from such a text.In Paula, Allende said that this book was the most difficult to write as she was trying to write a novel from the outset and she got stuck halfway through as Eva Luna ran into her revolutionary boyfriend only to realize that he was a clod. Intended ending had to be changed but what resulted was one of the most brilliant texts ever. Eva Luna is a strange girl of the streets learning to tell stories in order to transform reality into something wondrous. Her soulmate is the abused son of a Nazi captain whose childhood leaves indelible scars. Throughout the course of the novel these two go through various adventures, accidents and side tracks on the inevitable road to each other. A road which neither can recognize until they are staring each other in the face.Of all of Allende's books this is the one where Magical Realism is most pervasive as two headed children are born and bodies refuse to decompose. Besides House of the Spirits and Paula this is her best book. It's on a smaller scale than House of the Spirits but the life of Eva Luna is just as compelling as the history of Chile."},{"Title":"Eva Luna","review":"I love Allende's characters and her writing. Zorro was my first read of hers and I have purchased everything. I get very involved in the story and characters. Her trilogy for kids is in my library and is checked out all of the time. Good writing is good writing."},{"Title":"Eva Luna","review":"This novel is a romantic one. The romance starts nearly at the end of the book, but it's a very good novel. It will make you laugh and make you amazed!!! Although, it's magic realism, you should try keep an open mind. It's a different book that's all. But you'll love it!!!"},{"Title":"Eva Luna","review":"Isabel Allende has yet to disappoint me. Her books are delightful. I was introduced to her work through \\"Daughter of Fortune\\" and I've been hooked ever since. After having read almost everything Allende has published, Eva Luna remains one of my favorites. The characters and story are larger than life, but still somehow relatable. Follow this one up with \\"The Stories of Eva Luna\\"."},{"Title":"Eva Luna","review":"The story of Eva and Rolf is spellbinding. Isabel Allende proves to be a wonderful writer with this book. The only problem is that the book turns boring at some point, some parts drag on for too long and she seems to get lost in tangents. Otherwise it's an excellent book."},{"Title":"Eva Luna","review":"This was a book I got over the summer in Ecuador and continued to read, finishing somewhere offshore of the Galapagos Islands. The perfect &quot;escape&quot; book that combined a fantasy story with jungle images and adventure. After Eva Luna I ran out to get &quot;Paula&quot; and &quot;The House Of The Spirits&quot;. If you like Eva Luna definitely check out other works by Isabel Allende."},{"Title":"Eva Luna","review":"Do not be fooled by the first sentence being shown in Spanish above (as I was). This is the English language version of Eva Luna, and Amazon mistakenly put the first sentence of the Spanish version by the title. I know this is not a review of the book, but I would like to prevent someone else from making the mistake I did and ending up paying almost the full price of the book in shipping charges to try to return it and get the correct version."},{"Title":"Eva Luna","review":"Isabel Allende's Eva Luna manages to be about many diverse things: a picaresque soap opera; the story of Latin America; the tale of a woman coming to self-determination; an autobiography; a description of the creation and nature of fiction: and yet never loses its narrative fascination. Allende uses very little dialog, and the characters, Eva herself included, are more 'imaginary' than most novelists attempt: but believable and in the end quite moving.This was narrative at its most magical. It bore the signs of great art, at least for me: the resonance of other times and places, the sense of recognition...Eva Luna at first reminded me strongly of Fina Estampa by Caetano Veloso, so much so that I went looking for a song called Eva Luna on the CD which wasn't there.I read recently an exact parallel of the episode of the bald patrina in a story in Ihara Saikaku's Life of an Amorous Woman written in 17th century Japan (basis for Mizoguchi's Life of Oharu for those interested), which was odd."},{"Title":"Eva Luna","review":"I'm an editor, have a degree in English literature, and lived in Mexico and in the Southwest for 20 years. Latin American literature is often whimsical. Not necessarily magical, but definately more than factual. Allende does a really wonderful job of introducing readers to both the entertaining quirks and the political nightmares of life in South America, which has about as much in common with Spain as it has with South Phoenix. Not much. Isabelle Allende is a great writer. She conveys the terror and joys of life in a unique way that makes you see how one might learn to abide with them, yet without minimizing their horrible or wonderful impact.I can definately understand how one might not enjoy her work, as it's very different from mainstream fiction, but to say that she's not a good writer is less than intelligent."},{"Title":"Eva Luna","review":"When I finished the last page I started again at the beginning to read it a second time. It's breathtaking how Isabel Allende reveals the true fourth dimension of reality: fantasy, imagination, sensuality and lust for life... in a way only south american authors can do it. The story is told like music - don't miss this experience!"},{"Title":"Eva Luna","review":"Excellent book. Isabel Allende is a first class writer. who mixes history and entertainment for a very enjoyable reading experience."},{"Title":"Rough Translations","review":"Author Rick Moody once said of Amy Hempel's writing, \\"It's all about the sentences.\\" With Molly Giles I would say it's all about the characters. In these deep, quiet, and intensely moving stories the characters are complex, beautifully realized, and stunningly real. They are also unusual, odd, different. The word \\"quirky\\" comes to mind, but that's far too shallow and easy a word for the people (mostly women) in Giles's stories. Her characters are not shallow or easy or glib.A description of the plots of many of these stories would sound like typical \\"women's literary fiction\\" fare: women in failed and failing marriages, women trapped in unrewarding lives by the demands of child-raising and family life, women struggling to make a place for themselves in the world, uncertain of success, uncertain even of how to go about their struggling. But it's the characters that make these stories, and keep them from being anything approaching \\"typical.\\"There's a lot of humor in this collection, and a lot of pain. As in real life, the two things jostle against one another, sometimes wrestling for the upper hand, other times just living uneasily together in the same person, the same situation. On a scale of \\"upbeat\\" to \\"downbeat,\\" I'd say these stories rarely extend above \\"guardedly upbeat.\\" But never for an instant do any of them feel resolutely dark. There is hope and spirit and warmth even in the darkest of them.The final piece in the collection is the \\"Rough Translations\\" of the book's title. I think this is truly a remarkable short story, and one that should be far more recognized, lauded, and anthologized than it is. It's a crowning achievement, aDeath of Ivan Ilyichfor our times. As that comparison indicates, it's one of the most unhappy stories in the book, but (as with Tolstoy's story), it's rich with hope and vitality. It's a story that will stay with me forever, as will the whole of this collection."},{"Title":"Rough Translations","review":"I loved the story &quot;Chocolate Footballs.&quot; However, for the most part I felt a certain sameness throughout the stories, as though the characters were essentially reapeated, but the names had been changed. I felt a middle-class blandness throughout. Besides the tick in &quot;Chocolate Footballs,&quot; nothing memorable happens; no lasting impact. Still, it was a good read and I enjoyed the stories."},{"Title":"The Clue in the Embers (Hardy Boys, Book 35)","review":"When Tony Prito, a good friend of Frank and Joe Hardy, inherits a collection of bizarre curios from his uncle Roberto Prito, Tony discovers he has also inherited a cast of sinister characters that want Roberto Prito's collection for themselves. Tony asks Frank and Joe Hardy to help him, and almost immediately the boys run afoul of a gang that attempts to frighten them into selling the collection, and when that does not work, they try to steal the collection.As the mystery progresses, Frank and Joe quickly learn that the criminals are after a set of medallions that may hold a clue to a fabulous treasure located in Central America. Unfortunately, the boys do not have all the medallions and the lack may hamper their investigation. In order to investigate the mystery further the boys travel to Guatemala, where their enemies and Mother Nature strike. At one point in the story I wondered how the boys were going to escape lava. Later the boys along with Tony Prito and Chet Morton are about to be thrown into a hidden tomb to die.While this story could have been fleshed out better, I still enjoyed it. The action was nicely paced and I found myself speeding through the chapters to learn how the mystery ends. While Frank, Joe, Tony and Chet violate more than a few modern rules of archeology, and while it would be unthinkable to provide them with a souvenir of what they find, if you can ignore the fantasy that they boys would even be allowed to dig at an archeological site without getting in trouble then this story turns out to be a page turner. I consider this Hardy Boys story to be above average and I would recommend it to a first-time reader of the Hardy Boys series.The Hardy Boys series is recommended for ages 8 to 12 because the series is relatively tame for the previous target audience of ages 10 to 14. This particular book is a good fit for both age ranges. This book contains a number of problems regarding how the boys are so readily able to travel in certain areas of Guatemala and then excavate an archeological ruin. Today there are areas of Guatemala that are considered unsafe for foreigners, and I believe excavation of archeological ruins is very tightly regulated. However, in the fantasy world of Frank and Joe Hardy, who perpetually remain the same age, perhaps the actions they take are reasonable. Perhaps there should be a caution in the new editions: Do not try this in real life."},{"Title":"The Clue in the Embers (Hardy Boys, Book 35)","review":"VERY,VERY ACTION-PACKED!

The other reason is that it has so much action. In every single Hardy Boys book at least one person gets knocked out! READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Clue in the Embers (Hardy Boys, Book 35)","review":"While the older books in the Hardy Boys series are great adventure stories for adolescent boys, they are terrible in the area of multicultural accuracy. Their treatment of the people of other cultures is ridden with the absurd clich&eacute;s that were the norm in the mass entertainment of the times. In this case the story was originally published in 1955 and the Hardy Boys and their friends travel to Guatemala.It begins when their friend Tony Prito receives an unusual inheritance; a relative dies and leaves him the contents of a curio shop. Almost immediately Tony receives a mysterious offer from a man wanting to buy the contents for a small amount and when he refuses there is danger and several attempts at theft and intimidation. This does nothing to deter the Hardy Boys although in keeping with the characters, it does disturb Chet Morton. After discerning several clues, the Hardy Boys, Tony Prito and Chet Morton travel to Guatemala where they are looking for buried archeological treasure.I grew up devouring the Hardy Boys books, the incarnation that I read were those published before 1970. At that time, the caricatures of people in other groups were false, yet largely accepted. The adventures in this book are typical of the early Hardy Boys, they are regularly knocked senseless and everyone else speaks in a simplistic dialect. While modern readers will often object to the portrayals, there is something enduring about the adventures and the danger that appeals to the innate need of young human males to explore."},{"Title":"The Clue in the Embers (Hardy Boys, Book 35)","review":"This review concerns the original 1955 edition and the revised 1972 edition which is a shorter version of the original. Frank and Joe's friend Tony inherits a collection of curios and immediately a gang of thieves is interested in a couple of medallions that were apart of the inheritance. The mystery of the medallions takes Frank, Joe, Chet and Tony on a treasure hunt to Guatemala. Personally, I didn't find this book very good. I thought that it lacked much action and many of the chapter endings didn't entice me to read more right away. The plot of the book was rather weak and not very creative and it took the Hardys and their friends no time at all to find the treasure after arriving in Guatemala; although, that didn't happen until page 160. While some fans may like this book, it definately wasn't one of my favorites."},{"Title":"The Clue in the Embers (Hardy Boys, Book 35)","review":"The throbbing of the drums grew louder as the warroirs closed.

Spectacular description of Dow Theory. Uneven in more modern updates for indicators and such. Pattern descriptions second only to Schabacker's book.Many people consider this book to be a classic. I honestly think the book by Bruce Kamich, \\"How Technical Analysis Works\\" or John Murphy's \\"Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets\\" are better choices for the beginning student. This is largely because the treatment of indicators and more modern topics - added after the original authors wrote the book - are grafted on, and though the editor has tried very hard, these items belong in another volume we they can be treated in a more complete and modern manner."},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"This book has transformed the way that I think about markets more than any other. There are so many nuggets buried in this book, I read it twice and I'm currently working through some sections for a third time. The basic premise of the book is that human behavior never changes and can be discerned through careful analysis of the tape. After trading billions of dollars in energy commodities I can honestly say that I have found premise of the book to be absolutely true! For those of you in the San Francisco Bay Area, I encourage you to consider taking the summer class at Golden Gate University taught by Mr. Bassetti, which teaches students how to build trading systems around the concepts presented by Edwards and Magee."},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"If you ask any stock broker, investment banker, or financial advisor, for resources to learn about trading, its very likely that this renowned book would be on their list. More than six decades and nine editions later, Robert Edwards and John Magee's Technical Analysis of Stock Trends is still considered the gold standard of technical analysis based trading. The current 9th edition has been updated to stay relevant in the current environment.The editor starts off with an introduction on how he went about adapting this classic. However, it quickly jumps into a lot of theoretical trending information with very detailed coverage of the Dow Theory from the basic theory to specific examples in the past. The authors then discuss various trends including my favorite the Head and Shoulder trend line to help you predict which direction a stock will move based on past data. Several examples (over 200) are introduced to make sure the reader has understood this concept. I really liked that the editor pointed out the uncertainty with following such a trend system but at the same time promoting its benefits. The authors also outline the different strategies (options- either put or call) based on the predicted movement of a particular stock.The second half of the book is devoted to specific tactics that can be utilized during different market conditions. Essentially, the authors break up the different theories into ways that you can apply them. For example, if you are deciding to invest in an energy sector company during a bear market with a Triangular Trend pointing to an upwards movement in price, you can navigate through to figure out the various metrics you need to chart (P/E ratio, revenue, profits, etc) in order to determine the optimal time to invest and the investment tool (stock versus option). The authors also devote a short time to explaining similar trending patterns and tactics in the commodity market.Overall, I have mostly positive things to say about this book. However, this book is more useful as sort of an instructional manual when trading stocks. If this is your first time investing I would not recommend reading this book. Instead, get something like Stock Trading for Dummies, so that you can be familiar with all various investment terminology. Then, open an investment simulator account for free using Investopedia or a similar platform and as you start reading this book practice the tactics on your simulated investments. Keep referring to the book as you make decisions about your portfolio. The tactics in the book, although they might seem technical at first, are actually very easy to chart using Google Finance, Morningstar, or similar. So, hold on to this book as a reference so that you can finally start making data driven decisions instead of just trading based on a stock tip from your buddy!"},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"4 stars for the volume of thoroughly well researched examples and exhaustive coverage of basic patterns.This book is comprehensive but not complete. There is no information on some modern indicators or, for example, candlesticks or point and figure.I have the 8th edition.This book is good to have and I did learn valuable things from it but if you are only going to buy a few books, I would not recommend this as one of them.On the plus side, there are many many actual stock chart examples. That adds to the length in a good way.Writing style is very much early 20th century; leisurely rather than short and to the point.This book is geared toward stocks and commodities but not forex.

It explains every aspect of charting from basic principles to advanced trading techniques. I love this book.David CollettiFounderStockTradersHQ.com"},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"Originally published in 1948, this book is absolutely one of the greats on technical analysis (i.e., using price action, volume and time). The authors claim that all a trader really needs to know is found in the charts. Fundamentals can be tossed aside. You just need to know how to interpret what the chart is saying and then act by taking a position.But does this approach work? This will depend on the individual. For example, you and I can trade the same stock for 3 years applying technical analysis but the end result can very well be that one of us ends up with a big profit and the other a big loss. The reason is due to the following factors: which patterns to take, the spot where you get in, how far to let a position move against you, and where to take a profit. As you can see, technical analysis is somewhat subjective.You probably know that there are no guarantees in the trading game. And chart formations are NOT infallible. All the stuff taught in this book will short circuit at one time or another causing a loss. You could even fall into a losing streak. Thankfully, the authors give fair warning about the dangers involved. But despite the unpleasant prospects, this book remains one of the very best places to learn the theory of technical analysis of charts. I recommend going with the 4th or 5th edition, that is all you really need to capture the essence of the material, plus, you'll save yourself a few bucks."},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"If you're reading this then you're probably skimming the reviews of this book in order to figure out if you should buy this book. The answer is yes. From what I, as a beginner, can tell, this book seems to be exactly what the other reviewers are calling it, _the_ traders bible.As with any bible, if you are going to take short term trading seriously, (which you most certainly should), this book should not only be read, but carefully studied, and it's teachings analyzed and followed."},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"I believe serious students of the market's action should master this book in its edited form whether they intend to specialize in the technical action or not. Wealthy clients have been known to blow out from ignorance of basic technical action in the financial marketplace.The edited form (TAST 8) has information of value for the beginner as well as for an experienced practitioner. The present editor has provided an excellent review of Dow Theory in chap 5.1 and presents arguments for traders trying to resolve the identity dilemma in chap 18.1. Money management principles have also been included in the text which I think are the most critical aspect of the trading enterprise. Basing points are central to the method and the editor has included a discussion about their use.As a student & associate of the editor I can't recommend the 8th Edition enough and I think the dissenting views posted by \\"the reader without a name\\" should be ignored as unfounded and largely ignorant of the contributions from the present editor. An examination of several of that critic's other reviews shows this to be the case."},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"I read Edwards and McGee, Technical Analysis of Stock Market Trends with great enthusiasm. Here was a book that was originally written in the 1940's that is equally valid to anyone trying to play the stock market in the Twenty First Century. It also gave me insights into the wild times on Wall Street in the Roaring 20's, and taught me how the pros did stock manipulation and organized &quot;bear traps.&quot; Understanding Wall Street irrational exuberance in 1928 helps a smart investor understand the irrational exuberance in 1999. I started reading and then using Technical Analysis because I found I couldn't make money on the market just using the fundamental analysis that my accounting professors taught me in business school. I bought stocks based on detailed analysis of the firm's fundamentals and then could not understand why the prices of my &quot;smart&quot; investments immediately dropped like a rock. Technical analysis provides an investor with insights into the market forces (supply and demand) that affect the rise and fall of stock prices and give a rational investor understanding of the psychology of the herd of investors.Modern web technology available from Clearstation and E-trade take the drudgery out of the technical charting, and make it easy for an amateur investor to become an experienced technical chart reader. Edwards and McGee was the book that helped me develop this skill.

It gets you thinking for yourself about the movements of stocks. There is no way one can absorb all the information provided within the text. It is a guide and reference for those who want to devote time to stock analysis. I am now more educated on stock trends, but still require the book for periodic refreshers. If you're buying this book for casual reading, find another book. Although very good, this book is very intense and reading it will consume some time. Dedication is required to finish the book, but the potential for success is great, much greater than a lottery ticket."},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"The Greek philosopher Heraclitus once observed that it is impossible to step in the same river twice. By that statement he meant, seemingly, that everything is in a state of change. Hence, if Greg Louganis decided to jump off a diving board into the Mississippi River, he would never be able to plunge into the same water molecules more than once. By the time he attempted his second jump, the water which gave way during his first dive would be a long way down the river on its route toward the Gulf of Mexico. Accordingly, Heraclitus's analogy, one could argue, is applicable to the study of securities markets: although companies have traded their stock on exchanges for decades, even centuries, the stock markets themselves are always in flux because participants--investors, as well as the companies themselves--are constantly leaving and entering the game. Robert Edwards' and John Magee's classic TECHNICAL ANALYSIS OF STOCK TRENDS was written fifty years ago, long before such hallowed American companies as Microsoft, Dell, or Cisco Systems were in existence. Although the stock markets are indeed &quot;rivers of change,&quot; it is clear that this book remains the standard guide for investors and traders who believe that technical analysis is an effective approach to predicting the future behavior of stocks. Modern readers should be aware, however, that too many of the charts in the book are from obscure, even defunct, companies from the 1940's; the appendix &quot;Updated charts through 1996&quot; is helpful but out of place in the back of the book. These charts, rather, should be placed in the text of the book in order to illustrate the book's key principles. Those interested in applying technical analysis to the future markets should also consider Jack Schwager's recent guide to technical analysis. It would seem impossible, though, that those still interested in trading stocks technically could avoid reading Edwards's and Magee's useful volume, a guide that remains a constant in a world of change."},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"A lot of timeless insight and wisdom. If you are only looking for the latest and hottest indicator, this book is not for you. It does have a small chapter with definitions of some recent (i.e. less than 30 years old) oscillators, but it mostly discusses area patterns like gaps and head and shoulders (the first edition was written in late forties). On the other hand, it's amazing how timeless the simple (in a Zen sense) market wisdom and insight is. Like &quot;Reminiscenses of a Stock Operator&quot;, this book gives you more than a new spreadsheet formula -- it gives you deeper understanding of the nature of the Market.On the other hand, I think you shouldn't use this book as your first TA course -- you'll probably wish to learn as much as possible as quickly as possible. The book's subtle points will be lost on you, while you'll be angered and frustrated by anachronisms. On the other hand, if you know the TA basics and are looking for refining your understanding, the same old charts and anachronisms (i.e. calling Dow Jones Transportation Index &quot;Rails&quot;) can be a welcome way to gain some insight into the history of subject, while enjoying the timeless wisdom of the founding fathers of Technical Analysis."},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"The book is a reprint of a much older book.

The book contains two parts. In the first part you learn the theory of technical analysis such as price and volume action. In the second part you do practice. I know a lot of books that give you just fundamentals without saying how to apply those fundamentals in practice. This book is a perfect exception! Authors did a great job! Though a book has been written in 1940s, it still remains in print and contains valuable insights into how market really works. The only chapter that I would exclude from the book is chapter about trading in futures which has been added to this edition of the book. You can tell by reading this chapter that the language is different, more difficult to comprehend and tells a lot of different indicators that you don't even need to know. So, skip that chapter and enjoy the rest of the book!"},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends is considered to be the Bible of Technical Analysis. I would revise that to say that it's the Bible of chart pattern analysis, because it doesn't go into modern technical analysis methods (indicators etc.). At any rate, it's a comprehensive book on classical technical analysis (that being chart patterns).The main down sides to this book are that it's a dry read and it lacks an evidence-based approach. What I mean by that last part is that many times the authors simply say \\"in our opinion this is so\\" or \\"in our experience we find that this happens.\\" That really equates to a focus group of one and can be a recipe for causality errors/confusion. You're essentially left with having to take the authors word for it.At any rate, it's an in-depth, detailed review of chart patterns, thus a valuable resource for those interested in an in-depth study of TA. But, I wouldn't base my investment decisions based solely on this book and it's not the only book that I would use to study TA."},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"Written in the 20's, this book is at least five decades ahead of its time, discussing detailedly about Dow Theory, chart patterns, volume, support and resistance etc in the demand and supply context, at a time whilst most people focused solely on company/accounting data specific fundamental analysis. However, though market psychology doesnt change, technology and the speed and means of information distribution do, leading to shorter business cycles and thus trends, inevitably attacking the weakest link of the Dow Theory which is that confirmation of the primary and long term trend almost always come too late. The situation is even worse in that &quot;traps&quot; in trend following are so frequent in today's highly competitive market when power traders with the help of deteriatives fully exploit the stop loss orders of mass investors.I dont mean to undermine the value of this book. Nevertheless, considering the high price of the book and the long time to read it through, there are many alternatives that cover TA wider and deeper. This book can be a very exhaustive reference book in chart patterns. It just cannot provide a compeat course on TA. The new appendix of MACD, Stochastics etc is adequate but far from sufficient. Afterall, TA is just a tool for money making. There's no point not to take a more productive route to achieve the goal."},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"This book is simply indespensible, if one is serious about his trading. I have been trading for about 4yrs now. And only purchased the book because its a pre-requiste for CFT exams.I am amazed at how its has changed my prespectives towards trade managment.Again an absolute must if you want to commit funds trading in a relaxed & profitable manner.I am quite sure that the LORD, could have bestowed his Grace on Magee, and placed him in paradise because of it.GOD REST HIS SOUL."},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"I'd recommend this book to anyone wanting an introduction to technical analysis. It is written like a textbook with topics addressed in logical order. This book covers detailed descriptions and analysis of many traditional chart patterns and some attendant trading strategies. Numerous examples are given in annotated charts. Technical terms are defined and explained.In the ninth edition (2007), Appendix E contains a Turtle Trading System manual written by Curtis Faith (one of Richard Dennis' original Turtles) - a dated but nevertheless instructional description of a mechanical trading system.Though this book is a great educational tool, I feel it would be a mistake to take it all literally as a guide to trading. The original author, Magee, last updated the book in 1966. He goes out on a limb regularly in his advice on how certain patterns 'typically' resolve. The probabilities with which his rules apply to today's markets would undoubtedly vary from pre-1966 markets. William J. O'Neil, in his renowned How to Make Money in Stocks (2009, p.-146), said that many patterns discussed by Edwards & Magee such as triangles, coils and pennants have, in recent times, shown to be \\"unreliable and risky\\" patterns \\"without sufficient time or price correction to become proper bases.\\"I found the book a frustrating slog to get through because Magee uses a very formal, wordy and repetitive writing style. In the eighth and ninth editions professor Bassetti has added numerous editor's notes and extra chapters to the original, but frequently uses awkward, incomplete sentences to belabor the obvious. More annoying were Bassetti's repeated attempts to be clever, e.g. p.- 415: \\"The wild frontier of the Internet and of the gunslinger speculators. Amazon bucks on. Give us a slug of rotgut whiskey and get out the ruler\\", or \\"one might almost say awesome, if the word were not in such currency on \`Saturday Night Live' and the \`Comedy Channel'\\". This sort of running commentary gets tiring after 800 pages."},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"This is a technical analysis book, focus on price pattern. If you are looking for RSI, MACD, etc, look else where. This book covers topics such as Symmetric Triangle, Gaps, Resist/support, etc. They are very detailed and I definitely learn a lot from this book.If you want to buy this book, my advice is to buy an earlier edition (5th). The additional chatpers written by Bassetti simply doesn't match the quality of Edwards and Magee. For example, he uses internet stocks, such as Amazon or Cisco, to illustrate his point of dramatic/speculative crash. However, he uses charts which are unadjusted for split. If Amazon split 3-1, then there will be a big gap. The gap doesn't mean anything technically. He devotes an entire chatper to discuss false gaps like that! Very disturbing and unintelligent.The original writers aer superb though. I strongly recommand this book for people who wants to learn the price pattern/action. If John Murphy's book is like an encyclopedia of Technical Analysis, then this book focus mainly on the subject of price pattern."},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"If you want a copy of the original 1940s edition, that is what this is.

Magee and Edwards do an excellent job explaining Dow Theory and stock chart analysis. I bought the 5th edition because it was the last edition that was actually edited by the original authors. This book is the source of most modern technical analysis theory. It covers reversal patterns, gaps, support and resistance, consolidation patterns, trendlines and channels (by Edwards); and then goes into stock selection, stop orders, how to build a chart, and the practical application of those patterns and how to use them in your trading (by Magee). I read the book from cover to cover and refer back to it all the time in my technical analysis. It's an excellent resource!"},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"Few books in today's internet world devote the majority part fo the book to analysisng classical chart pattern like this book did.As a technical trader, I sincerely believe that learning to read chart pattern and what does the varies price bar is indicating is far more valuable then trying to figure out whether is the market over bought or over sold.For all those that wants to understand the market behaviour through chart reading, this book is a good place to start."},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"If you are interested in reading Edwards and Magee's classic book Technical Analysis of Stock Trends, I strongly encourage you to purchase a copy of an older edition which was not edited by W.H.C. Bassetti.Bassetti's main objective in his edits is to try to impress the reader with how intelligent he is - in particular how large his vocabulary is and how clever he can be in his writing. Unfortunately I did not buy this book to find out how intelligent, clever, and articulate the editor is. I bought this book to learn classic chart patterns as taught by Edwards and Magee. Bassetti's annoying and low value edits detract from this great work. Bassetti has truly mastered the art of saying in six sentences with fancy words and pointless historical references what could much more easily and effectively be said in one sentence with regular words. The contrast between Edwards and Magee's to the point writing style and Bassetti's grandiose rhetoric is remarkable.I hope the publisher reads this review and finds a better editor for the next edition. You will see other people making similar comments below. Also notice below that Bassetti reviews his own book and gives it five stars. Hmmm, an editor reviewing his own book - must be very objective.If it ain't broke don't fix it.

Initially, when I started learning technical analysis I had the question that whether these classical technical analysis method works in today's internet oriented market. To my surprise after reading Professor Bassetti's comments on last dot com bust, it made me realized that same techniques still works. Moreover, I think this book can only be understood by the experienced trader and not by the new traders. If you see other experienced trader's book recommendation list you will find this book in there. It takes time to get to a level when this book start to make real change in one's understanding/trading. That's what I make of it. Initially, I myself did not understand many concepts what this book talks about. Now as I am getting more and more experienced and it stats to add value to my trading. Recently I experienced up and down of google and aaple live in action. And if you refer to the book then it make sense how still market works in the same fashion as it worked a decades ago, even though most of the trading is done by computers these days. For a new readers of this book, I would suggest don't give up easily keep. Read it a number of times and get some real experience with live trade not the paper trading.As a student of Professor Bassetti, I have seen his experienced analysis at several occasion works perfectly live in action. Even though, I wasn't able to cash in as was in denial...but amazed how accurately it plays out every time.

Haven't you noticed in everyday life the most skillful people who have the most knowledge come from family generations who did the same business.You need to work at it to be just as skillful in any business since making profits in a stockmarket does not come easy at first.What you see is the same type of stock patterns that your Grandpa would have seen if he traded stocks. These price patterns are like road signs you should be able to visualize them on any chart regardless what time-frame. Not knowing stock patterns when they are completed is like driving through stop signs. After you have read this book you should be very skillful in drawing trend lines,channel lines, and identifying trends on any chart. Even today using a newer stock symbol you see the same old basic chart patterns occur as the old fashioned charts a century ago. No oscillators or momentum-based indicators are needed on your chart. Experience is your best teacher when you look at chart patterns and there are many more to identify that you discover on your own. In the market you must look at what is happening now then predict what is going to happen, not what has already happened to make money.

The assumption is that all of the fundamental information and current market opinions are already reflected in the current price and when viewed in conjunction with past prices often reveals recurring price and volume patterns that provide clues to potential future price movement.In the foreign exchange markets, its use may be more widespread than fundamental analysis. While some isolated studies have indicated that technical trading rules might lead to consistent returns in the period prior to 1987, most academic work has focused on the nature of the anomalous position of the foreign exchange market.It is speculated that this anomaly is due to central bank intervention."},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"Not comprehensive or outlined or organized.

For every chart that shows a meaningful pattern, there are 5 that show no pattern at all. The technician, out of necessity of his methodology, is forced to make meaning of a chart which is likely just a random collection of observations. Just because a price happened to bottom or top twice consecutively at the same point doesn't mean that there's 'support' or 'resistance' at that level. Sometimes there are legitimate support and resistance levels, but more often than not, those are illusory. Support or resistance levels evaporate and reset all the time.Fundamental analysis puts the investor in a much better position to actually succeed in my opinion. Earnings, price, book value, growth, forward earnings, debt levels, etc. are not subject to any interpretation. They are what they are. It might take any given stock a long time for it to align w/ its fundamental valuation, but the relative predictability that one sees in P/E levels for different types of businesses of varying sizes and growh prospects makes the fundamental school the more rational approach.Also, anyone who believes that markets are 'efficient' hasn't paid much attention to markets. Lacking a material event (earnings release, management shake-up, etc.) a company's price will largely be pulled around in lock-step w/ the broader market.These are known as the facts.

This question was foremost in my mind as I began reading this recently released version of a book I spent many hours with as I prepared for the CMT exams. After reading all 832 pages, I realized that in many ways, the financial markets, and technical analysis, are finally maturing to the point where we can fully grasp the significance of what was first written almost sixty years ago. With a focus on pragmatic portfolio theory, editor Charles Bassetti significantly contributes to the technical analysis body of knowledge especially related to tactics, and has created a book worth a space on every technician's bookshelf.In this edition, Bassetti delivers much more than an update - it's actually a new book. He focuses on strategies for increasing profits:* The basics of traditional chart analysis are clearly presented, just as Robert Edwards meant for them to be. In keeping with the practice of earlier editions, Bassetti retains the original charts showing examples of patterns from the 1940s and earlier. He also includes more than two dozen new charts, demonstrating that the same old patterns still work today. The detailed discussion of the market psychology that forms these patterns may stimulate modern analysts to program the patterns.* Adds a comprehensive explanation of Magee's \\"basing points\\" procedure for setting initial and trailing stops on any position. Bassetti adds a chapter and charts to clarify this powerful concept, which in itself is worth more than the cost of the book.* For what may be the first time, Bassetti provides an annotated chart of the Dow, combining an in-depth discussion of Dow Theory with a visual history of the signals. We've all seen tables showing the sell signal in Oct 1929 or the buy signal in late-1990 which lasted more than seven years, but the chart erases any doubt that Dow Theory is a valuable timing tool. Creating a comprehensive source on the Dow Theory, he also includes an overview of Robert Colby's method to automate the signals.* Provides a link to www.edwards-magee.com, which offers downloadable material that supplements the text. As one example, readers can download pdf files of the Dow Theory signals for closer examination.* Offers new perspectives on short-term and futures trading. The extensive new material on commodity trading, including a complete trading plan, was not addressed in previous editions.Bassetti also ensures the reader understands the similarities between Magee's Sensitivity Index and Modern Portfolio Theory's Beta; and the striking resemblance of Magee's Composite Leverage to the financial engineering concept of Value at Risk. Readers of previous editions may not have realized that Magee developed these concepts decades before Nobel Prize-winning work was undertaken in these areas. Magee wrote in the language of the trader (semi-log charts), rather than the academician and his ideas have been overlooked by economic theorists.A classic book is one that stands the test of time. No one can argue that Technical Analysis of Stock Trends fails in this regard. Patterns that worked a hundred years ago are still found in financial markets and they still work. The forecasting ability of patterns lies in their ability to document the history of human nature, which remains unchanged over many centuries.Another feature of classic works is a unique style. Edwards and Magee filled their work with examples - current at the time of publication. They wrote with clarity and ease of style not usually found in textbooks. Their text was a practical \\"how to\\" manual that explained the \\"study of the action of the market itself\\" in concrete terms. It appealed to those seeking the Holy Grail on Wall Street, and to those serious students of the markets seeking an edge. In this new edition, Bassetti retains all of their style and introduces his own, which in all ways is similar to the original, but with a modern edge.Bassetti believes that Magee's concept of basing points is worth a great deal of additional study. This is one of the most significant contributions he makes to the new edition, updating this section in the tactics to ensure that all traders understand this method of stop placement. His example is clear, and the reader can instantly implement this technique, which Bassetti thinks of as one of the most valuable in the book.Some question whether classical chart reading is still a valid discipline in an era defined by cheap data, powerful scanning and backtesting software, instantaneous execution and quantitative analysis. After reading this book, you'll be left with a deeper appreciation of the value of chart reading and will become an even stronger proponent of technical analysis in modern markets."},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"This is a review of the 9th edition. Please note that amazon has included this review for other editions as well. That is okay because I have something to say about them too, but you should be aware. The really old editions are probably out of copyright.I would not recommend this book unless you are into the \\"history of technical analysis\\". The focus of the book is classical patterns of bar charts. The book is absolutely not bad, but it's value is a bit dubious. Why read a book that have charts that are 1/2 century old? You can't be sure that things haven't changed, can you? So the newer editions also have more modern charts. However, this combination of old and new makes for a frustrating reading. Actually I would think most book deteriorate in quality after their 3rd edition.If you want a classic in your bookself I would really recommend you to buy a second-hand copy of the last edition written by Edwards & Magee alone. This would be the 5th edition. It has a very professional binding and clear white pages. The new edition is a very ugly and cheaply bound hardcover. This comment is only if you are into good looking books. You get the 5th edition for $5 at amazon, so it is a nobrainer!Addition in 2010: Edwards and Magee wrote a classic that has many editions. I bought one copy around 1984 and it was the first book in technical analysis that I read. I liked it a lot. With time other books have been written, but I still like this old book. Now mainly because it is a very pretty book. Expensive paper and a proper spine that will never break. It feels nice to touch. I value nice books if their content is classic. I bought the 9th edition just out of curiosity and I am displeased by it. There is a running commentary in sections by a new third author - the original authors long dead. The commentary is ridiculous. At one point he decides to call an upside down head-and-shoulder pattern for a kilroy patterns. Hello? We don't need comments on this level. The paper and binding is ugly (but not as bad as books from Wiley Finance - please use better paper in your expensive books!). So on all accounts a ** book.

It was the first comprehensive work on technical analysis, at a time when technical analysis was considered an abstract art rather than a true science. It is so complete in its descriptions of the markets and how to trade them, that it has survived the greatest test of the literary world - time. It is without peer when described as the Bible of Technical Analysis. Anyone who is interested in market history, or the history of technical analysis, should read this amazing work. And anyone who is considering studying technical analysis or actually trading using TA, is also highly encouraged to not just read, but devour, this book. Now, Darwin was known for describing the process of evolution, and his attention would have been greatly stimulated by the world of technical analysis. This book was the first, but by no means the last. Mr. Murphy's Technical Analysis of the Futures Market and Mr. Schwager's Complete Guide to the Futures Market are powerful additions to the rishness and wealth of information in the world of TA. But there can only be one original, one foundation, and that classic epic title belongs to Edwards &amp; Magee."},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"Do you want to know how everything started ?

Until I picked up this book I was completely clueless as where to start..

Analysis (but it 1st teaches you about the Dow Theory -- don't skip this).. It is technical but is definatly a good book for a begining tech like me.. So far I have a much better understanding of bull /bear markets, appying the dow theory to the general market, and how to apply tech. analysis to individual stocks (just reading that now in chap. 6).

People you thought you knew one day become total jerks the next. Maybe it's just part of growing up. Or maybe their body's been swapped with that of a fugitive alien.Ann is a quiet bookworm. Unlike most shoujo heroines, she's not an especially pretty or kind hearted. At the start of the book she seems to be content to go through life in an apathetic state, not taking much notice of the people around her (including her only and best friend Nikki). But then she notices Jem, a sweet guy who's a bit of a loner. Unfortunately, the most popular girl in school, Rae, also notices Jem around the same time as Ann, setting up an odd love triangle.Most of the book is spent building up the characters and their relationships. A difference between this book and many other high school set shoujo is that this is an OEL manga written by an American. Well it retains many of the sensibilities found in shoujo romances (especially in the art, which I'll get to in a moment) instead of Japanese teenage love it reflects the trials and tribulations of American high school. The characters talk and act in ways normal for American teens, giving a slight twist on the usual high school manga.And then there's the other twist on the genre, which is the sci-fi aspect thrown in 1/3 into the book. The sci-fi really throws everything for a loop (in a good way), and by the end of the book it's become impossible to figure out where the story will take us next (though it certainly isn't Earth).The art is one of the best I've ever seen for an OEL book. Elmer Damaso has what I think of as a great sense of balance. He knows when to use chibis, splash pages, or shoujo tricks like twirling flower petals in the background. He also does a good job of moving the story along at a pace that reflects the slice of life aspect of the first part of the book, and then speeding things up once the focus shifts to sci-fi.All in all, I think Unearthly is not only a great book, but an important OEL manga with its successful melding of genres. I have a few nit picks, like some over use of slang ('Twee'? Maybe I've been out of high school too long), but otherwise I think this is a great book for anyone who likes shoujo, sci-fi, or both."},{"Title":"Unearthly (Unearthly (Graphic Novel))","review":"First off I have to admit I havnt read all of this book, just what of it was on the gomanga website...But of what I have read... this is a great story! The artwork is beutiful, and the story line draws you in, so that you want to kick a certain character, or hug another... I HIGHLY recomend this book!"},{"Title":"Unearthly (Unearthly (Graphic Novel))","review":"No second volume has been produced, which is a shame. Unearthly ended as the story was getting good, but great dialogue alone can't carry an incomplete story into five stars.Basically, this is an Americanized version of shoujo manga with a science fiction back-drop. The characters start at a US high school, but setting gets strange quickly enough. Art style is high quality, story-boarding humorous, and characters feel distinct in their own identities. Characters are a quiet bookish girl, her snarky friend, the captain of the girl's volleyball team (popular), and mysterious yet sensitive guy both girls like.I can't recommend the buy, because remember, no Volume Two. I'm breaking my 'no-manga reviews' rule to warn you. The cliffhangery disappointment of never knowing what happens in the 'Unearthly' universe hit me hard."},{"Title":"What Are We Waiting for: A Commentary on Revelation","review":"This commentary is not for Amill or Post-mill persuasion. This commentary approaches the Book of Revelation from Pre-mill view point. This commentary is a very good book, because:1. It is short and concise. It is basically a passage by passage commentary, so Robert Mounce dwells on the main points of the passage. He does not go into too much detail, but he does address important issues. But if you want more detailed treatment of the subject you can always refer to his commentary on Revelation in NICNT series.2. It provides interesting insights. For example, I was impressed by his interpretation on Rev.3:15,16 -- concerning \\"you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold...\\" Mounce comments, \\"The basic fault of the Laodicea church is that is it lukewarm. This has been understood to mean that spiritually the church was neither hot nor cold, but had settled for an insipid lukewarmness. It is regularly noted that several miles to the north of Laodicea, the hot mineral water from springs in Hieropolis spills over the cliff above the Lycus River and covers the wide escarpment with a layer of white mineral. By the time the water reaches the spillway, it has become lukewarm and is nauseous to the taste. The problem with this interpretation is the difficulty in understanding why it is better to be spiritually cold than lukewarm. The real contrast appears to be between the medicinal waters of Hieropolis, which would provide healing, and the cool drinking water of Colossae, ten miles on up the Lycus glen, which would provide refreshment. The Laodiceans were lukewarm in the sense that their Christianity provided neither healing for the spiritually sick nor refreshment for those who were spiritually weary\\" (p. 17). And like this, he provides insights throughout the book.3. It is stimulating. While the book is short in length, its quality is not. He anticipates different views and addresses them and explains why his view is more reasonable.Overall, the book is great for beginners without being intimidated by the difficulty of Revelation. I recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"What Are We Waiting for: A Commentary on Revelation","review":"Okay if you're looking for an easy-to-read, very concise commentary on Revelation. I thought it would be a little meatier, and was surprised at how thin this was.

I would recommend this for someone just getting started in the Scriptures."},{"Title":"Cowboy Pup \\\\Furry Face (Furry Face Board Book)","review":"\\"Cowboy Pup\\" has been my 16-month-old son's favorite book since he started liking books eight months ago.

There are a few Cowboy Western slang words that younger children may not understand, but other than that the story; which describes the daily adventures of Cowboy Pup is easy to read and understand. Kids love this book, but it's not for the words. They love it for the furry puppy face that is pasted on the end, but through cleverly placed holes appears on every other page.

Wanda has to leave for Africa and when her plane crashes in Kenya, her life will never be the same. After the plane crash, Wanda wakes up with no memory of who she is or where she is from. While recovering on an African ranch, Wanda discovers a brand new world and finds herself falling for the owner Ahmed. Ahmed finds himself fighting his attraction to this mysterious woman who reminds him of his dead wife. Meanwhile, back at home, Wanda's husband Steven and her family and friends struggle to deal with her \\"death\\" and try to put their lives back together. Steven afraid of being alone decides to move on much to the dismay of Marie, Wanda's best friend and the woman Steven has been having an affair with.

Back in Africa, Wanda regains her memory and soon has to make the hardest decision of her life, does she stay and create a new life with Ahmed or return home to the life she had with Steven? Last Bride Standing is an outstanding book that you will not be able to put down until the shocking and explosive ending. The story draws you in as you find yourself shocked by the betrayal of Steven and Marie and touched by the growing passion between Wanda and Ahmed.

She convinces him this trip will secure her career and that she will be back before he misses her. But on the second leg of her flight, the plane crashes in Kenya and her body is not found. Steven appears devastated, but just days after the memorial service, Wanda's best friend offers him more than a comforting shoulder, and he takes it.Wanda survives the crash and is discovered days later, near an African ranch, she has suffered extensive injuries and has amnesia. Ahmed, the owner, who has been comfortably widowed for three years, does not want her in his house. He realizes this mystery woman could test his resolve, but his meddling aunt has other plans. Wanda is also very taken with him, and when the lush exotic countryside of Kenya captures her heart, so does Ahmed. With him she shares a passion she'd never experienced with Steven.In Los Angeles, a mere six months after the plane crash, Wanda's best friend and her husband are planning to marry. But, Wanda regains her memory before the scheduled wedding and returns to L.A. Since her life has changed dramatically, she must make decisions she never imagined having to make. What will she do about her marriage? And can she forget Ahmed?LAST BRIDE STANDING shares a crazy, twist of fate story about unplanned events that change your life. There are several secondary stories going on here and occasionally they slow the pace of the primary story. A plus to this story would have been more emotions for some of the characters and more depth to their personal drama. With that said this is still a story that will hold your interest.Reviewed by aNNof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Last Bride Standing","review":"THIS BOOK WAS SO GOOD, I READ IT IN A DAY AND A HALF.

I thought it was very well written, especially by a novice who died just prior to publication. The main character, David Harum, was likeable and could have easily been a Westerner instead of from upstate New York. He reminded me of Ben K. Green, an author who wrote about his life in the 1930's in a book called &#34;Horse Tradin'&#34; along with several other tales about his early life.I saw a reference to this book, &#34;David Harum&#34; in another older book (one of those public domain books formatted for e-reading just like this one) and this was why I searched for it on Kindle.The dialect used by the author for NY upstaters was a bit distracting as I don't know what it actually sounds like. But I am used to authors from that era using Western American dialects of which I am familiar so it didn't bother me much.I recommend the book for those interested in reading about life in America 115 years ago. I am a retired banker and horseman so I probably related to the main character more than another reviewer did.

There's even a long, drawn-out story of Harum telling a long, drawn-out story! I'm doubly damned. There's a secondary character of John Lennox.

My only twinge about this is that they don't spend much time on story panels and pages but there's enough to give you a decent idea of how they should go (though I suspect it's in the drawing basic's books). All in all I'm very satisfied with this book. If you want to learn about developing a story and a script then this is definiately the book for you."},{"Title":"Shoujo Manga Techniques: Writing Stories","review":"I really loved this book.

I'll definitely try some other books by this author."},{"Title":"The last trail: A story of early days in the Ohio Valley","review":"Zane Grey continues to be one of my favorite writers. His stories are descriptive, alive with adjectives and detail, and the narrative makes his tales come alive. This story is the third book in his Ohio Valley trilogy, and of course, has outlaws and marauding Indians who kidnapped a woman from Fort Henry. Although his dialogue is filled with idioms and slang, it is still interesting and faithful to the words of the day. A good read - I liked it."},{"Title":"The last trail: A story of early days in the Ohio Valley","review":"Nice read, the writer creates great visual images with words. I think if you like a little history of how things were in the midwest frontier this is a great fictional read."},{"Title":"The last trail: A story of early days in the Ohio Valley","review":"I initially thought this was going to be a fictional shoot 'em up story of the Old West. Turns out it was more of a historical, fictional, romance shoot 'em up. The historical context was educational and appears to have been based on real characters who inhabited Fort Henry in the late 1700s. At that time the fort was in a very remote part of the country, and even though the Revolutionary War was taking place \\"in the east\\", the Fort and its inhabitants were living lives independent of the struggle against the redcoats. The author at times lapses into an overly detailed horticultural description of the trees and bushes which gets a little tedious, but this is more than compensated for by his accurate, pulse-quickening descriptions of the bordermen and their hand-to-hand struggles with the redmen and the outlaws. For a good historical description of Fort Henry, I recommend a review of: [...](Looks like Amazon won't allow a URL in reviews - sorry!

It is easy to read and satifies the reader's thirst for romance in the old west along with mystery."},{"Title":"The last trail: A story of early days in the Ohio Valley","review":"This is more a frontier story than a western. In my opinion it is also one of Mr. Grey's more average works: more adventure story than literature. There were a few moments when the writing took me away, but for the most part the writing simply moved the story line forward not the reader to experience.Zane Grey is a great American writer (not a great western writer), but for me this work was just a story."},{"Title":"The last trail: A story of early days in the Ohio Valley","review":"I am not into westerns, and had never read one, but had heard of Zane Grey and thought I would give it a try (it was a free download, so if I didn't like it, I lose nothing anyway). I did end up liking it. I didn't love it, but I think if I read a couple more it would grow on me. I would say for someone who doesn't like Westerns, this would still be an enjoyable read, because its not all gun-slinging, tobacco spitting & horse riding. And I like the old fashioned language used, books today just aren't written the same."},{"Title":"The last trail: A story of early days in the Ohio Valley","review":"This book captures the spirit of the settlement of the frontier while also being a great romance and story of brotherhood that is less common these days."},{"Title":"The last trail: A story of early days in the Ohio Valley","review":"I read The Last Trail when I was a teenager over fifty years ago,the book was a pageturner then and it still is today.

This is a great book that you will remember always.So order and enjoy and it is also free."},{"Title":"The last trail: A story of early days in the Ohio Valley","review":"This is the last of a trilogy published in 1909 after \\"Betty Zane\\" (1903) and \\"Spirit of the Border\\" (1906). It's a historical novel set in the Ohio River Valley in the late 18th century shortly after The American Revolution. It focuses on two bordermen assigned to protect the settlement at Fort Henry. Bordermen are self-appointed protectors of the region and both are very capable. They set out on the trail to determine who the renegades are that are stealing Fort Henry horses and kidnapping the women. Also, there appears to be a traitor at Fort Henry helping the renegades. The love interest of one of the bordermen causes him to question whether to continue his duties on the trail or devote his life completely to Helen. Zane Grey paints a beautiful picture of the region."},{"Title":"The last trail: A story of early days in the Ohio Valley","review":"The third in the Ohio Valley trilogy (the first two are Betty Zane and Spirit of the Border), this book wrapped up a fun period of reconnecting with an old friend in Zane Gray. Had not read these three before. Surprisingly engaging stories for the straightforward action/adventure/romance genre. And the author writes as one who has studied the period and the setting. One nice thing about reading the older authors is that you don't have to deal with the trashy language -- and the story's just as good without it. I was inspired to read a couple of other Zane Gray novels."},{"Title":"The last trail: A story of early days in the Ohio Valley","review":"Zane Gray I believe is popular because he is able with his writing to give you a clear mental picture of the caricatures and there surroundings, for me I am able to read his books while it plays like a movie in my mind."},{"Title":"The last trail: A story of early days in the Ohio Valley","review":"I very much enjoyed this book. And reccomend it!! also, if you have not already read Betty Zane by Zane Grey than you should read that one before The Last Trail.."},{"Title":"The last trail: A story of early days in the Ohio Valley","review":"I am, and always have been, a fan of the western genre. I'm not sure if it is a result of my upbringing (grew up in Colorado in the 50's) or a hand me down from my father who always wanted to be a cowboy.That said, you don't have to be a rabid consumer of westerns to appreciate Zane Grey or this fantastic novel. Sure it has all the excitement of your standard page turner, but it also manages to develop the characters (all of them) to a degree that goes beyond the typical pulp fare that is usually associated with westerns (unfairly so, I would add). Zane Grey manages to flesh out the hero and his love interest in a way that makes them come alive, especially through the use of colorful colloquial language that feels like it could be authentic.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in a solid read that goes beyond a simple adventure story, but still delivers on excitement."},{"Title":"The last trail: A story of early days in the Ohio Valley","review":"The plot of this story is simple. A Virginian and his beautiful daughter come to the western frontier of Ft. Henry, in modern West Virginia, where she falls in love with the gallant borderman Jonathan Zane. The bordermen, like their Texas Ranger counterparts, make a living by killing Indians, chasing outlaws, and acting as the only arm of the law.Beautiful Helen is kidnapped by outlaws and Indians, then rescued by her flinty borderman, who, in the interim, has fallen hopelessly in love with her. After killing all the outlaws and the bad Indians, Jonathan forsakes his wild ways and settles down to respectable life as a farmer and father. Lots of 19th Century values are bandied about, the general superiority of white America is proven in word and deed, and the lawless frontier is beaten back to the wilds of Ohio. Residents of Cincinatti may feel at times that that's where it stayed.Grey's prose is outdated but easily read. Where he shines is in his descriptions of nature. He has a good eye for natural beauty and a gift for relating it. I bought this as part of a .99 cent Kindle 18-pack, so it was definitely worth the time and the expense."},{"Title":"The last trail: A story of early days in the Ohio Valley","review":"Zane Grey's first novels concerned his ancestors, the Zane family, and the Ohio frontier of the late 18th century.

He embodied all that was Russia and aspired too many of the things Russia would later become. As a young man he had learned much about Russia's long and storied history. As Tsar he embarked on unrelenting campaigns against all of Russia's neighbors and forged a modern empire.Massie's Biography of this seminal leader is the standard on the subject. It explored every facet of Peter's long life; his relations with family, his military genius, his ambitions, his fears, his obsessions and his weaknesses. Successive chapters detail the Northern war, the Wars with the Ottomans, the wars in Europe proper, and the final campaign along the coast of the Caspian.In his life Peter \`Piervui' redeemed the Russians at the battle of Poltava and thus set the foundations for the building of Peters \`window on Europe', the city on the Neva named after his saint, St. Petersburg. The brilliant writer, Massie, delivers a tour de force in describing the building of Peter's northern capital.Massie also looks into the dual personality of Peter, his obsession with Europe and his own inward struggles with his weak son. Massie examines relations with both the Ottoman east and the European West. Peter in his life looked forward to a vast Russian empire, one that would one day stretch the length of the continent and on which the \`sun would never set'. Peter dreamed of a world class navy operating from the Baltic to the Mediterranean. He dreamed of liberating the Christians of the Caucasus and Balkans and saw a role for Russia in Europe, all dreams that would be realized by successors like Catherine the Great.A brilliant book, an epic of detail and flavor!"},{"Title":"The Best Defense","review":"The third book by Sarah Gregory guides the reader through the legal maze of Texas, California, and federal laws as Sharon Hays represents a Hollywood starlet accusssed of murdering her boyfriend.Great Ending!!!"},{"Title":"The Best Defense","review":"Good legal thriller but poor research in non legal areas with unbelievable scenarios and dialog."},{"Title":"The Best Defense","review":"Darla Cowen and Sharon Hays were struggling performers in New York, who went down different paths. Darla became a famous erotic actress in Hollywood while Sharon became a Texas defense attorney. Sharon is also the mother of a thirteen-year old teen she conceived outside wedlock. TV star Rob Stanley sired the lass, whom he wants nothing to with. Rob's agent arranges for Sharon, her daughter, and some friends to attend the grand opening of Planet Hollywood to make up for the lateness of the child support check.Darla attends the gala also and the two former friends meet. Darla is escorted by her boy friend, an abusive boy toy, David, whom she plans to drop soon. Darla returns to her hotel room to pack and quickly leaves. David is found dead with the authorities believing that Darla killed him. She swears that she did not do it and retains Sharon to defend her. Sharon plans to obtain an acquittal even if it means going out and placing herself in danger as she seeks the real culprit.Although this novel is a serious legal procedural and an excellent work of psychological suspense, THE BEST DEFENSE is also a black comedy. People are more interested in getting parts in movies or obtaining roles for family members than in keepin the courtroom as a place where justice is served. These so-called spontaneous tryouts lead to humorous moments, but Sarah Gregory never loses sight of her story line. The ultimate strength in this book is the depth and compexity of the prime characters. The sub-plots within the tale make for a multi-layered plot. Ms. Gregory demonstrates that she is a superb storyteller, who is well worth reading.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The King","review":"Donald Barthelme's &quot;The King&quot; is the loudest laugh I've ever had from a book! It is the tale of Arthur and his knights fighting World War II, though the tale is told primarily through these characters' sad and outdated dialogue. I read this book almost non-stop through breakfast at a coffee shop, a trounce through my favorite bookstore and then dinner, all the while grabbing anyone close at hand to read passages to. Nasty looks and possibly even violent reactions would not assuage me, for the humor, joy and pure inventiveness of Barthelme's writing kept me as humble and courteous as a chivalrous knight"},{"Title":"The King","review":"\\"The King\\" is a tongue in cheek fable of King Arthur and his Round Table being transported to 1940 England.

Absolutely incredible. Will be one of the top five novels you've ever read"},{"Title":"The King","review":"I paid a dollar for this book. God Bless used bookstores who carry out-of-print titles on clearance. The King is probably flawless - I've read it 10 or 11 times now, and each time the language is always as fresh as the previous reading. Donald Barthelme is indisputably the Alpha and Omega of contemporary American short fiction, and this is his very best. If you're not familiar with his stuff, go grab one of the anthologies (60 or 40 Stories), find a good place to read, and become quietly enthralled. The fact that this book is out-of-print either testifies to the current lifeless state of the publishing industry, or the existence of a cold, malevolent trickster-god. If you have personal contact with ANYONE involved in the publishing industry, PLEASE encourage them to read The King, to reproduce it, to lavish it with praise and vigorous marketing, etc. D.B. has slipped out of the American literary consciousness - if that isn't an oxymoron - these last ten years, being instead cruelly relegated to the pomp and ineffectual circumstance of that icy ninth ring of hell, THE LAND OF GRADUATE STUDIES.

Patagonia is huge, empty, and stunningly beautiful. The people who live there are hardy and often very, very isolated. The author spends time getting to know the people, especially the women, who live a place with long, bitter cold winters, where their nearest neighbors can be 30 miles away down terrible, pitted roads, where trips to the grocery store may be once month at best, where they have many children not just to help with the ranch work but also to ease the intense loneliness on the estancias, and where the growing cities (even small ones) are slowly changing this way of life. She considers not just their daily existance and individual personalities, but the sociology of living such isolated lives. The author's descriptions are intense, warm, and beautiful. I gave away my only copy, and repurchased the book when I returned home."},{"Title":"Dusk on the Campo: A Journey in Patagonia","review":"This book recounts the 2 stints that the author and her husband spent in Patagonia as wildlife researchers. Her sociological account and fine descriptions vividly rendered portrayals of the local community, social relations amongst the locals in the isolated landscape, the sense of space and isolation and how it affected the sense of life and social fabric on the campo, the changing face of the demographic and overall harshness of living conditions. Altogether an admirable work that makes me want to experience it for myself."},{"Title":"Dusk on the Campo: A Journey in Patagonia","review":"A very descriptive view of daily life on the estancias of Patagonia. This could be the equivalent of Chatwin-in-the-north but written with even more of a personal touch than Chatwin and a degree of personal story-line. Its localized to living on the Peninsula Vald&eacute;s in contrast to passing thru in the way of Chatwin.Reviewers often use the word 'riveting'. Thats one word I would choose for this book.A friend of mine in Argentina recommended Chatwin to me. Apparently he is well known in the country and is required reading for bookies down there. Somehow, Sara Mansfield Taber never achieved equal acclaim but she is surely deserving of being on the same bookshelf in Argentina or elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Lure of the Edge: Scientific Passions, Religious Beliefs, and the Pursuit of UFO's","review":"Although we hear reference to the UFO &quot;controversy&quot; or &quot;debate&quot;, the situation more closely approximates an overall donnybrook, a sort of philosophical Star Wars over the relative roles that science, religion, and popular culture should play in defining our place in the Universe. Loosely aggregated camps of &quot;believers&quot; and &quot;skeptics&quot; wage a multifaceted battle on many fronts, and as in the case of a shooting war it is all but impossible for combatants to relate to the perspective of their opponents. The issue is not likely to be resolved soon. Like fifteenth century armies engaged in the Hundred Years War each side has enough resources to keep the fight going, but neither side has enough of an advantage to score a decisive victory. Despite the murky blend of reality and fantasy, the hodgepodge of ramshackle philosophical frameworks, the outrageous examples of gullibility and hermetically sealed minds, the overall fray may have some positive results. It allows people with many different perspectives to engage in dialogues that touch upon great existential issues: who we are, where we came from, our future beyond Earth, and intelligent life other than our own. Tomorrow's historians may interpret the chaotic mixture of materialism, spiritualism, empiricism and mysticism that at once entices and enrages so many people as just one small part of the intellectual effort and emotional turmoil that accompanied our coming of age in the cosmos.Brenda Denzler's &quot;The Lure of the Edge&quot; is a useful addition to the fray. This well organized and nicely written book is brief, and about a third of its pages are occupied by meticulous notes and a massive bibliography. Its brevity is deceptive. &quot;The Lure of the Edge&quot; invites slow, careful reading because it is richly textured, inspires contemplation and reverie, and offers numerous surprises. There is a certain amount of core material that is required to tell the UFO story, but Denzler's fresh examples, interesting details and steady pace should maintain the interest of many people who are already familiar with that story.&quot;The Lure of the Edge&quot; contains five chapters, an &quot;Afterword,&quot; and a substantial &quot;Appendix.&quot; The first two chapters give cogent histories of UFO and alien abduction phenomena. The third chapter grapples with the ambiguous and ever-shifting line between fact and fiction, and explores ideas that are defined by the opposing groups as falling at either the &quot;cutting edge&quot; or the &quot;fringe&quot; of science. In the fourth and fifth chapters Denzler looks at the interplay between science and religion and how these play out in people's thinking about UFOs. Her strong background in sociology and her Ph.D. in religious studies give Denzler an easy and in-depth familiarity with mysticism, spiritualism, transcendent experiences and the like, and allow her to develop better than average discussions of ideas that run counter to the basic tenets of science and skepticism. This means she deserves high marks for her discussions of paranormal and New Age ideas. Denzler reminds us that when we consider the influences of science and religion on UFO and other beliefs we should move beyond &quot;God talk&quot; and consider the systematic thinking of high quality, university-affiliated theologians.Denzler explores issues from multiple perspectives and generally succeeds in interpreting them within useful conceptual frameworks. She makes reference not only to the major UFOlogists such as Vallee, Keel, and Mack, but also skeptics including Shaeffer, Klass, Condon, and especially Menzel. She does her best to be even-handed and fair. Still, it is impossible for any author to walk an entirely straight line through such minefields, and when Denzler errs it is in a direction that would be favored by religious scholars such as Ian Barbour, Huston Smith and Ted Peters and faulted by thoughtful skeptics such as Paul Kurtz and Michael Shermer.The Afterword presents her final thoughts on science, religion, and UFOs. Although described as an &quot;Appendix&quot; the final section of &quot;The Lure of the Edge&quot; is a unique contribution. Here we find Denzler's own empirical studies of UFO affinity groups. This original research is based on participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and responses to written questionnaires. Although there are some acknowledged methodological limitations, the results paint an interesting picture of the demographic characteristics of the members of such groups, and provide partial tests of certain theories that bear on UFO beliefs. And, her findings remind us that while some people expect science to give them answers about UFOs, other people would prefer such answers to result from a personal quest."},{"Title":"The Lure of the Edge: Scientific Passions, Religious Beliefs, and the Pursuit of UFO's","review":"The book I was hoping this one was has yet to be written. Denzler doesn't tell us anything we didn't already know about why and how people believe in UFOs and aliens. Mainly what we have here is just compiling the history of reported sightings and abductions, as well as summaries of leading authors (Vallee, Keel). No analysis of the psychology or mass psychology of purported abductees. If you're a true believer, the book probably won't interest you, and if you're trying to understand the believers, it won't answer your questions.I know from my own experience that the author hasn't begun to scratch the surface of the current types of UFO beliefs. Her index doesn't even include Pleiades! There are lots of New Age types out there who believe that benevolent aliens, the Pleiadeans, are trying to help humanity evolve to higher consciousness. There are umpteen versions of this idea featuring other star systems. There are hostile as well as helpful aliens. In Sedona, Arizona, the New Age mecca (and elsewhere, I'm sure) you can purchase pamphlets mapping the alien bases underneath the Red Rock country, and describing the aerial warfare between the Good and Bad Aliens over the Arizona skies!I'm sure that there are people who sincerely believe in UFOs without any of this supernatural apparatus. Simple enough, it's fun to believe in the possibility of exciting things that might exist. Denzler discusses pseudo-science, and that is a different category from the New Age beliefs. But why and how do people believe in Pleiadeans, and create and embellish elaborate mythologies involving extraterrestrials as angels, demons and demigods? How do abduction beliefs spread in a population? There's a great book out there waiting to be written..."},{"Title":"The Lure of the Edge: Scientific Passions, Religious Beliefs, and the Pursuit of UFO's","review":"Brenda Denzler has produced a systematic and enlightening overview of the UFO phenomenon that encompasses scientific, religious, and cultural examinations. While it stands alone as a comprehensive work, it also serves as a rich trove of sources for further research by those interested in all aspects of the phenomenon. Neutral in tone, it allows readers to explore the topic without the bias of either a skeptical or proselytizing author."},{"Title":"Call It A Gift: (A Novel) (Western Literature Series)","review":"A gentle tale, with spirit and chutzpah, like its characters, Call it a Gift charms with its unlikely plot twists, details such as an octagenarian \\"escaping\\" down a bedroom ladder with her new boyfriend, and deep, honest emotion.The web of characters, some of whom you never meet, sparkles with believable middle-aged children, remembered friends and family. Though there is a strongly bitter-sweet flavor to much of the story, which centers around the protagonists coming to grips with loss, it is neither maudlin nor overly sentimental, and in fact shows a great deal of sensitive humor in the telling. A fine story, with memorable characters."},{"Title":"Slavery and the Evolution of Cherokee Society, 1540-1866","review":"Outstanding book that addresses for the first time (for me) the relationship the Cherokees had with whites and blacks in the early years.

I had been searching for something else to read by this author after reading the short story she did in \\"A Very Gothic Christmas\\".Professor Dexter Harrington, a sex scientist needs help. He has decided to go through with the arranged marriage, (his deceased parents set up when he was a child) however he's been told that he lacks passion and feels he needs to learn how to speak \\"love words\\" to a woman. His secretary/best friend, Cummings suggest he hire romance writer, Zoe Wilde aka Mallory Ginelli who has read her books as a guide to see what women want.Mallory always wanted to go to England and she also needs the $20,000 advance to pay for her sister's gambling debt and reluctantly agrees to go with her best friend, Freddie aka Freida Feldman. After discovering the type of research she was needed for, the 26 year old virgin becomes hysterical. Since the professor firmly assures her that there would be no hanky-panky, she is obligated to teach him ($20,000 worth of obligation that he uses to manipulate her into staying because he already knows how desperately her sister needed the funds). I was actually glad the author let us know what was causing Genie (her sister) to continually get arrested and create gambling debt she has no means of paying.What will be the professor's score in the mating game? Pick up this book to see, it's definitely a keeper."},{"Title":"The Mating Game (Zebra Contemporary Romance)","review":"NY romance writer agrees to go to attractive but staid sex scientist's Scotland castle to help him with research in return for $20K which she needs to bail her younger sister out again from trouble. Both are attracted to each other but certain challenges bar them from giving in to their attraction.I really liked George's other books (i.e., To Die For, Art of Seduction) but I did NOT like this book. It was a chore to read. Many things (dialogue, characters, scenarios) were too contrived. It didn't flow well, which made for a s-l-o-w read. The romance & sexual chemistry did not draw me either. This book didn't draw my emotions...except maybe feelings of irritation.Cautiously recommended."},{"Title":"The Mating Game (Zebra Contemporary Romance)","review":"I usually prefer historical romances and read something else just for a change of pace. I don't think this is as good as George's historicals.There were some funny moments and some good chemistry (although sometimes the romance between the lead couple's best friends was spicier than the main romance). The third & fourth romances were unbelieveable and unnecessary. Please! Some of the scenes were silly rather than funny, and yes, far too many cliches were tossed in there. The author also had the bad habit of repeating herself. But there were good moments.My advice is to borrow the book from the library rather than buying it."},{"Title":"The Mating Game (Zebra Contemporary Romance)","review":"I just finished reading \\"To Die For\\" and decided I must read more by this wonderful author. I won't recap what has already been said in previous reviews, other than to say this book was so humerous, I found myself laughing out loud quite often and loving every minute of it!

I read from other reviewers there is potential for a movie-I'm there! Keep up the great work. Although I'm not much up for the contemporary romance genre I decided to take a chance after reading Devil May Care. I was hooked. A wonderful blend of comedy, romance and erotic tension. My only compliant was there needed to be more Freddie. In a world of compliants remember the praise. I hope you do continue to write historicals-we need great new writers."},{"Title":"The Mating Game (Zebra Contemporary Romance)","review":"The humorous dialogue, which Ms. George has such a wonderful flair for, the memorable secondary characters and a touching hero and heroine make this book a true treasure.

She does not count on her geeky scientist actually being a hottie, nor his favored pet being a temperamental monkey. It does not take a rocket scientist to guess that Mallory will forsake her virginity and start rolling in the sheets with her \\"student.\\" I guess you could call it homework. But the two eventually fall in love, despite his promise to another.Though humorous at times, the story does get tedious and is riddled with cliches. The more engaging couple is Mallory's best friend, Freddie who trades cynical and witty barbs (and eventually more) with Dexter's butler, Cummins."},{"Title":"The Mating Game (Zebra Contemporary Romance)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I picked it up and read the whole thing in one night. It was funny, passionate, tender and loving. I liked how the author used the secondary characters to bring this book all together.This is the story of a struggling romance writter with big family problems and big money problems who accepts a all expense paid trip to England to help a sexy, bumbling PhD with his research on Human Sexuality. She goes there and finds herself helping a \\"Kevin Sorbo\\" look alike with his \\"problem\\" The fun is finding out what his \\"problem\\" is.Dexter, the PhD may look like a hunk but he's more like the nerdy professor. He knows all about sex and to make a woman feel pleasure but has no clue about what women really want from a man. He believes that Mallory can help him because she seems to know what women want in her racy, steamy romance books. This makes for some very funny and sexy scenes.I couldn't put this book down. I really enjoyed it and I look forward to others from this author."},{"Title":"The Mating Game (Zebra Contemporary Romance)","review":"Melanie George is indeed at the top of her game here. She delivers her impressive contemporary debut, THE MATING GAME after her success in the historical field mainly the Devil's series. It's a sheer bliss as she spins the comedy with a sparkling dose of wits and panache - narrating how romance novelist Zoe Wilde aka Mallory Ginelli strucks a deal with the reclusive British sex professor Dextor Harrington to participate in his research on love and emotions with a handsome payoff. Mallory needs the money to free her sister from her debtors; Dextor enlists her help to aid him in further knowing a woman when he is about to be married. It's a win-win situation but it all crumbles when the equation ineffably switches to love chemistry.It's an all-out riot with Ms. George's cynical characters manifested in Freddie, Mallory's Jewish best friend; Cummings - Dextor's friend ... assistant and a delightful ensemble of sub-characters. Yet it is the golden couple Mallory and Dextor who charms with their insecurities and vulnerablities. Mallory is resilient as a sister and Dextor is tied down by his traditons as an earl and his shame as a test-tube baby. Their relationship is tender faith and friendship maturing to passion and chemistry.It'a a laugh-aloud ritual with George's self-effacing characters in their cloak of thorns. It is funny as it is warm and gratifying as the characters weather their miseries through dark secrets like a sexual abuse and bridges torn relationship. The MATING GAME is certainly the spunkiest and most energetic contemporary so far with George's radiant pen. It's a blast."},{"Title":"The Mating Game (Zebra Contemporary Romance)","review":"Ok, I'll start off by saying that if you want to laugh, this is the book for you. For some people, there may be too much humor. But for me, I eat it up. If you liked the secondary character of Reggie in George's historical, Devil May Care, then you'll .love Freddie, the heroine's best friend. The zingers she comes out with had me on the floor! And if you think Dexter is a bit of a stuffed shirt in the beginning, hold on for the ride and see his transformation! Brava, Ms. George."},{"Title":"The Mating Game (Zebra Contemporary Romance)","review":"Courtesy of A Romance ReviewThe Mating Game is a romantic comedy full of humour and fun. Not only are the hero and heroine attractive characters but also the secondary characters, Freddie and Cummings, make the story more alive, interesting and full of laughter. These two always argue and fight verbally like cats and dogs - Freddie, in a too straightforward way and Cummings, with his dark humour. Frankly speaking, these two have more sparks throughout the stories than Mallory and Dexter."},{"Title":"The Mating Game (Zebra Contemporary Romance)","review":"It was an offer she couldn't refuse. When her agent first tells her of a British scientist's desire to hire her for a human sexuality project, romance author Mallory Ginelli scoffs at the bizarre offer. However, when her younger sister ends up owing the neighborhood bookie over $21,000, Mallory reluctantly accepts the offer to go to England. Accompanied by her best friend Freddie, Mallory expects to meet a dweeb in a tweed coat. Instead she finds a Hercules-lookalike with a pet monkey.Dexter Harrington, brilliant scientist and aristocratic earl, has a problem. Although he is an expert on female sexuality, he's not sure how to please a woman on an emotional level. After reading a love scene from one of his assistant's romance novels, he figures the best way to learn about women would be to learn from a woman. Better yet, why not hire the woman who wrote that love scene?Therein lies the rub. Steamy romance novelist Zoe Wilde, Mallory's pen name and alter ego, is a fraud. Mallory can write the love scenes, but it's all a product of her vivid imagination. She can't even talk to this irritating man without her palms growing clammy and her knees getting wobbly! Since giving Dexter back the advance is not an option, the virginal author proceeds to give lessons in seduction, only to find herself seduced as well. However, even as Dexter is slowly transformed into the hero of Mallory's dreams, he is keeping one last secret. A secret that will break Mallory's heart.Best known for her historicals, Melanie George's first contemporary novel is a romantic comedy that will leave you chuckling practically from page to page. THE MATING GAME is an effervescent tale filled with wicked clich&eacute;s and outstanding dialogue. Besides the hero and heroine, there is a cast of supporting characters that almost steals the show, including Cummings, the personal assistant with a penchant for hot, steamy romances, and his nemesis, smart-mouth Freddie. Their zingers alone will have readers in stitches. THE MATING GAME harkens back to the romantic comedies of the 1930's and 40's but has a very 21st century appeal.TheSchemer"},{"Title":"The Mating Game (Zebra Contemporary Romance)","review":"I don't understand all the rave reviews. This book was unoriginal and unimaginative. Not only was the plot absolutely stupid (a scientist, who is betrothed to someone out of family obligation, hires a semi-successful American romance novelist to teach him how to charm women? Huh?) Since Dexter and his intended, Lady Sarah, were childhood buddies who loved each other like friends, why the need to charm her? As if that weren't bad enough, the characters were all such stereotyped caricatures: the romance author who is secretly a virgin, the tough-talking New Yorker Jewish princess, the uptight, nerdy British lord (living in a castle, naturally) who is stereotypically stiff (there was actually a scene where Mallory teaches Dexter how to shake his hips, for heaven's sake!). The writing was also bad. Mallory actually refers to Dexter's job offer as an offer she &quot;could not refuse.&quot; And, just in case the readers were on Mars when the movie came out, the author felt the need to inform us that this was a line from &quot;The Godfather.&quot; Yikes. But, because I hate to start a book and not finish it, I plodded through it, only to run into the absolutely unnecessary, soap-opera-like plot twist that Mallory's dad left them because she found out he was molesting her younger sister Genie, and threatened to kill the dad if he ever touched Genie again. This revelation is followed by a tear-fest that was painful to read. Yuck. And, just to make sure she exhausted every romance novel/movie cliche, the book concludes with Dexter's supposed-to-be-dramatic race to catch Mallory before she boards a plane back to America. Wow. If this is all it takes to m ake millions writing books, I'm changing jobs tomorrow."},{"Title":"The Mating Game (Zebra Contemporary Romance)","review":"I first read Melanie George in 'To Die For' and I immediatley went to see if she had anymore contemporary novels in print.

My favorite part of the book was when he used 'dough' to describe her skin. I couldn't stop laughing!!!I never would have thought that I would have enjoyed a nerdy hero, but I really enjoyed Dexter. Mallory was very sweet also. It is definitley worth your time to pick up this book!!"},{"Title":"The Mating Game (Zebra Contemporary Romance)","review":"I never thought I'd find myself catching my breath over a nerdy sex scientist, but when you're built like Dexter Harrington, Earl of Braden, and boy genuis, you can't help but fall in love.

Yes, it's true. Gosh, this was a fun, funny and romantic story. You know how, every once in a great while, a romance novel character will say or do or feel something that causes a little hitch in your breathing, as if your heart suddenly trips over itself? Well, that happened three times while I read this novel and I haven't experienced that for a very long time. The steeped-in-tradition British hero is a little overdrawn in the beginning, but his development is well worth the extra effort required to suspend your disbelief early on. Honestly, I was in love with this guy. And if I were a man, I'd have fallen for the heroine, too, though I can't work up quite as much emotion over Casablanca as she does! The secondary characters are a real treat, as well. Give this a whirl and add your wishes to mine for Melanie George to give up the historical romance genre and treat us to more in contemporary romance. She's so good at it!"},{"Title":"Teach yourself trigonometry (Teach yourself series)","review":"This book is very well written and a lot of thought was given by the authors as to the presentation of the material and how much background to assume the reader has. I would give the book five stars based on the writing. However, the writers were not well served by the editor, as there are many typos, maybe as many as one every other page. It appears that the proof reading was done by someone without a math background, as many of the errors are obvious, such as an equal sign being omitted, turning an equality into a product. Or the length of the sides of a right triangle being given so that the hypotenuse is not the longest side. Sometimes the answers to questions are messed up, which is very frustrating.

The overview in Chapter 1 provided insights that eluded me in high school. Chapter 2 provided detailed knowledge of my pocket computer and knowledge of it's use to solve trig problems that I never realized before. The examples and solutions provide feedback that the lessons were learned and owned. The subsequent chapters methodically build consistent, solid, usable knowledge. Mr. Abbot continually enables you to compare table-based calculations with your calculator calculations, building your confidence in your ability to do both.

The reason being that it begins with a whole lot of personal history concerning both Shipman and earlier researchers of the 20th century. Readers will know that some \\"science\\" books are heavily oriented toward biography and I personally am not very interested in that genre. In the event, however, this book turned out to be very good.By the time I finished the book I had come to appreciate just how much the history of paleontology has influenced its current state. That and I've been reading similar books for five decades and this background plus the bi-monthly headlines about the NEWEST DISCOVERY in the popular press can really become an overload, especially as theories in the field are so changeable. So the first half of the book which deals, often from a biographically oriented perspective, with this history was very helpful. And Shipman himself is no dogmatist, treating all fairly as far as I could tell. Also the general theme of not forcing our current catagories (ape/monkey,in this case) onto the fossil record was very helpful.The second half of the book is more involved with the science itself. Ever wonder how a fragment of a jawbone can lead some researcher to identify the animal as an adolescent female member of the ape family? Read this book and wonder no more. It was just amazing to see how many general conclusions can be drawn from sometimes very limited fossil remains and if you don't already know I suggest you buy this book to find out. There's plenty of science in the last chapters and very manageably but not condescendingly served up.Oh, \\"ape in a tree\\": Proconsul: a)fossils found in a hollow tree trunk b)lived in or among trees c) is in our family tree.

But really only five European languages have flourished to become native tongues outside of their homelands: French, English, Spanish, Dutch and Portuguese.The histories of these linguistic developments are varied; some acorns fell farther from the tree than others. Differences in vocabulary and pronunciation are true in every case, and this is to be expected, given that these vary considerably within the mother countries too. But some have also altered grammatically and syntactically. Despite how Parisians may sniff at Canadian French, it really doesn't vary very much syntactically from the standard European variety; where it does, ironically, it is usually the Canadian version that has kept the more antique form while European French has changed. There are, of course, the various French-inpired island creoles, but these are generally not spoken by French who settled overseas, and the dynamic under which they were created is different.In the case of Spanish, with the exception of some small pockets (as in Aruba) it is amazing how little variation in educated usage there is throughout the world. Even English, despite the fun that Englishmen and Americans poke at each other, hasn't varied nearly as much as it could. It is true that you can discern noticeable differences in educated usage between London and New York, but leaving the USA aside, educated grammar and syntax are virtually identical for the rest of the English speaking world, whether you're in London, Capetown, Sydney, Auckland or (arguably) even Toronto.Dutch is at the other end of the spectrum; its South African stepchild, Afrikaans, departs so much from European usage that it is recognized as a separate language. Portuguese is not too far behind. The differences in even educated usage between Portugal and Brazil are so extensive that it sometimes amazes me that people from the two countries can understand each other at all. It affects usage of pronouns, verb tenses (the future tense virtually doesn't exist in Brazilian Portuguese), word order and a host of other things, in addition to the usual departures in pronunciation and vocabulary. The departure from the original, in this case, anyway, seems to be on the colony's side; Brazilian Protuguese has changed so much in this past century that even writings by Brazilian writers from 100 years ago sound archaic to modern Brazilian ears.This book is an attempt to tabulate those differences and present them to the student, and its content is extensive. However, the book is quite difficult to use in any way except as a bookshelf reference; unless you know exactly what you're looking for, you won't find it. The book is split into topics by different syntactical \\"phenomena\\", but the information you want could be anywhere.In the balance, I'm glad I have the book, but you can't use it as a study aid as I wished to, unless you want to memorize large numbers of sentences as usage models. It's probably more useful to the teacher than the student."},{"Title":"The Dragon's Egg","review":"As a child, I felt that this one of the greatest books ever written. Everything is described so well by the author that you feel like you're there. The story takes place in Toronto, Ontario, where I live so I was familiar with a lot of the places mentioned. Basically the book about a Chinese-Canadian girl who is fascinated with her culture. When she gets a stone from China for her birthday, it hatches in the middle of the night and a dragon is born. This is not your average fire-breathing, harmful dragon, this is a civilized dragon who is extremely intelligent, can talk, change their shapes, perform a lot of magic, and comes from the bottom of the Yangste river. The dragon helps the girl when she's having trouble at school with bullies, and also with homework. While taking care of him before he gets old enough to fly back to his home, she feeds him seafood and he disguises himself as goldfish and a dog so he could live in her house. Some of my favourite scenes in the book were when he made it rain outside, when he turned into a dog, and when he flew back to china with the girl also visiting. The descriptions are EXTREMELY well written, you feel like you're watching a movie when you read it. It's a blend of reality, fiction and fantasy. I enjoyed reading about dragons overall and couldn't help but wish I had my own dragon when I read this."},{"Title":"Are We Having Fun Yet?: The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Sex","review":"Not for everyone - but for the right ones. If you've read the sex columns in different magazines, they often focus on &quot;wild things&quot;. Sex in the air, at sea or on the road. This book changes all that. It deals directly with what's stopping us in bed, and deals with &quot;the male perspective&quot; on sex. Being a man myself, I found that this book revealed more than magazines could ever do. And doing so in a way that made me want to try it out, instead of feeling inadequate as a lover. I passed it on to my girlfriend - and she likes it too! To me it opened up to the fact that we're not supposed to change our partner to our own liking, but stop and think about the concept of &quot;pleasure&quot;. Why do anything in bed when it doesn't feel good? This book won't give you an orgasm as soon as you put it down. What it can do is take away the &quot;Cosmo&quot;-filter that's, frankly, not helping anyone. Why read about &quot;wild&quot; sexual confessions when we can't open up to the pleasure of giving and receiving good sex?Even though I've considered myself happy with my sex life, I've also had this nagging thought that everyone's doing it better, hotter, more daringly. Not anymore. The authors have given me a basic knowledge to work from, from a female perspective. And you know what? I like it."},{"Title":"Are We Having Fun Yet?: The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Sex","review":"This book lets women know the facts about orgasm. Intercourse is not the only way people have sex, but merely one of the many wonderful options. I have a teen and will make sure that she reads this book someday. Changing the way we look at sex will save many relationships. Great job! I hope to see more books and TV or radio appearances. Attention men: Read this book you will not be sorry."},{"Title":"Are We Having Fun Yet?: The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Sex","review":"As the other reviews show this is a fantastic book with a lot of good information, that is out of print.

The art work alone is worth the price of the book."},{"Title":"Are We Having Fun Yet?: The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Sex","review":"Excellent book. This book contains information not easily accessable and what most people do not want to discuss, even the family physician. If young women read this book before starting on their sexual journey it would prevent a lot of ignorance and pain, and if the advice is followed, bring them much pleasure. The author is supposed to be bringing out a book on sex for teens - I would love to hear when it will be out."},{"Title":"Are We Having Fun Yet?: The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Sex","review":"My sister made me buy this book (well, actually, she thought I should get one of those technique manuals but this one appealed to me more) when I complained that my sex life was less than exciting . It was probably the most useful book I've ever read in helping me understand and enjoy myself better. As a bonus, my husband (voluntarily) read the book and said that it opened his eyes to things that he had never thought of before and that I had been having a hard time articulating. I would highly recommend this book for couples since, let's face it, good sex really isn't something that comes naturally, especially in Western society-- there's always something to learn. The Douglass sisters are plain-spoken, straightforward and sensitive in their approach and make a good case for rearranging the way we look at sexual relationships."},{"Title":"Are We Having Fun Yet?: The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Sex","review":"When I first heard about this book, I thought\`-- Don't women already know this stuff? I read it at the suggestion of a friend and discovered that there was plenty I did't know. That, for example, doctors and anatomists don\`t agree on the shape and size of the clitoris.

I read every magazine article on orgasms but nothing helped me until I read this book!! I think both partners in a relationship should read this and understand what these two women are teching. The best thing about this book was that it didn't &quot;talk down&quot; to the reader - it really was made for intelligent women who have been mislead about what it takes for a woman to be truelly satisfied - both with herself and her partner."},{"Title":"Are We Having Fun Yet?: The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Sex","review":"The authors have a refreshing collective voice, and it's so great to finally be encouraged, rather than be told the usual statistic, 'only 30% of women have orgasms-- you should just be content as you are.'

This isn't just a recipe book. Marshall McLuhan once said, &quot;I don't know who it was that discovered water, but it certainly wasn't a fish.&quot; The Douglasses have stepped outside their world to look back at what our expectations are and how the male perspective has shaped them. Fortunately, we may leave the male perspective in its fish bowl and adventure into a world free of patriarchal dicta. Brava, mujeres, y muchas gracias!"},{"Title":"Are We Having Fun Yet?: The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Sex","review":"This book is simply marvelous. I will be sure to recommend to my own daughters when the time is right. I would hope it saves them the two decades my wife and I fumbled in the dark trying to perfect our physical relationship. My own take is that the women authors are saying things in a way that a man can understand. They use unambiguous language that I have hoped to hear from women for so long. I found validation of hard learned lessons as well as plenty of new insights. My wife and I are reading this together and it does promote even more open communication.The authors use many varied literary devices to communicate a point multiple times so that its meaning is clear. They also introduce new terminology for female anatomy and female experience which is meant to facilitate thought on the issues. If you do not have a word for something it is just simply harder to think about. This device may come off as a bit \\"corny\\" to some readers but is absolutely required in order for progress to be made.It is difficult to address the unbalanced sexual equation between men and women without condemning maleness. However the authors succeed in this task. They make clear how the still prevailing sexual attitudes that lower the quality of a woman's sexual life are detrimental to the man's as well. The most astounding and insightful idea advanced was the \\"unnaturalness\\" of sex for pleasure. Once admitted shackles are released. You just have to read this - especially if you are a man."},{"Title":"Are We Having Fun Yet?: The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Sex","review":"This is a terrible book. What little it does tell you, it repeats over and over and over and over... The tiny amount of information to be gleaned from this amateur attempt at insight into female sexuality could have been paraphrased in three sentences. 1) Don't be afraid of asking for what you want. 2) Sex is better when the woman has orgasmed first and 3) You deserve it!

The author of the book, Harrison E. Salsbury is a Pulitzer-Prize wining journalist who spent six decades writing for the New York Times. These people are all heroes for different reasons. Some people gave inspiration to others while some were leaders and still others risked their lives for strangers. We do not live in an age of heroes but the people written about in this book are unmistakable heroes. The stories of these heroes are unknown, uplifting, and inspirational.The heroes in this book are not always the top newsmakers of the day. Some are men and women who are just as important but seldom recognized in the public eye. An example is three Russian street poets known as The Three who wrote very good poems about Russian politics. The political leaders of the day did not like the poems, but The Three continued to write and recite poems anyway. They are heroes because, even though they were being scorned and yelled at by the Russian leaders, they continued with their poetry and gave inspiration to many people. Brigid Temple Keogh is an example of another obscure hero. Brigid was a teacher in China, but she wasn't like her other Chinese colleagues. &quot;She encouraged her students to argue with her (unthinkable for the solemn Chinese scholars)&quot; (5). She was fired but she didn't give up and eventually found a new job at Yanan University. Yanan University was a run-down school at the end of a road. With houses were merely grim caves carved out of hills. Brigid did not lose her faith, though. This shows heroism because she worked hard after her life got tougher, and she helped lots of people by building new things for their town like a Language center. All of these people were relatively unknown and all obviously heroes.The stories of these men and women are uplifting. Deng Pufang's story was particularly uplifting. Deng Pufang devoted his life to helping the disabled in China after he was tortured and then thrown out of a four story university window and left for dead. His fall left him paralyzed from the waist down. This shows extreme heroism because he could have spent the rest of his life feeling sorry for himself over all of the tragic things that happened to him but he didn't. Instead, he worked hard and got rights for the Chinese disabled, including equal rights in the work force and education. One other hero from the book whose story is uplifting is the story of Homer Bigart. Homer was one of the best newsmen of his day. What makes his story so special is he spent the majority of his life at war, constantly risking his life to let the rest of the world know what was happening. A lot of times, Homer took no more shelter or food then the troops. Homer showed his heroism by laying his life on the line for other people and not thinking of himself as above other people because he lived under same conditions as the soldiers. Both of these men's stories are examples of a heroes story being uplifting.A third trait the heroes have in common is that they are all inspirational. Roger Wilkins is an example of a role model. Roger was a leader for the blacks during the Civil Rights movement. Roger was almost killed twice, but he kept fighting even though his life was always in danger. Roger Wilking is a hero for two reasons. The first is that he kept working even though he was constantly being threatened to stop. He is also a hero and a role model because, as a kid, he had a very tough childhood he grew up in a poor black town, and both his parents had expensive drug habits. Roger overcame this, however, and grew up to become a leader and help thousands of people. A second example of these heroes as role models is Soong Chingling. She housed run away communists during the Cultural Revolution of China. She is considered a hero because she put her life in danger every time she took in another communist but she housed them anyway. As you can see, in both the stories of Soong Chingling and Roger Wilkins the hero is inspirational.In conclusion, the people portrayed in the book Heroes Of My Time are often unknown, uplifting, and are inspirational. All of these people are undoubtedly heroes. These are only some of the people addressed in the book there are many others whose stories are just as inspirational. The book is an outstanding piece of literature. It's very uplifting but you can also learn something about the worlds history from it."},{"Title":"Heroes of My Time","review":"Journalist Harrison Salisbury describes 25 people of courage whom he greatly admired. The book's revealing vignettes cover people from his native USA, plus China and Russia (Salisbury spent years in these countries), and they range from world statesmen to little known individuals. Deng Pufang devoted his life to helping the disabled after being left paralyzed during the excesses of the Cultural Revolution, while Soong Chingling took great risks to shelter \\"undesirables\\" during that same horrific event. Liu Binyan wrote prose that inspired many during his 22 years in Maoist prisons, while Solzhenitsyn angered the Kremlin with his writings about Soviet gulags. Among Americans honored are Bobby Kennedy, journalist Homer Bigart for risking his life at the front, and Roger Wilkins for overcoming a difficult youth and taking risks for civil rights. I question his choice of Nikita Khrushchev (for denouncing Stalin) and of Zhou En Lai (for moderating Mao's cruel excesses), and others may wonder why he neglected figures like Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, Gandhi, Martin Luther King, etc. Still, Salisbury has chosen many authentically heroic figures, describing their contributions in crisply readable detail.Harrison Salisbury (1908-1993) was one of the top journalists of the 20th Century, winner of the 1955 Pulitzer Prize, and the author of more than 30 books on Russia, China, and the USA.

The SAT prep book is very simple to understand and gives a lot of cofedence while reading it. The book is mainly divided into 12 different sections all containing to certain parts in the SAT including Math, English &amp; writing... which to me are the mainly important parts of the whole SAT. The reason for me picking out this book is for one reason, and that is to get into college. I saw my grades in the PSAT's and well they were horrible, I mean for me getting an 820, is not the highlight of my life. so I thought to myself... &quot;I got to get a higher grade on this test or no college will want me.&quot; Some of the material that I got from this book was helpful for example... in the writing part of the book there is a helpful part about some of the certain writing materials given to you. As well it gives you problems that you can look at that gives you the meaning or the definition of the words. And in the math part it gave you step by step instructions on as to how you do that specific problem. The most helpful use of the book though in my opinion would be the practice test in the back. But to wrap this up, My opinion on the matter is that if you do not have time and you are a simple minded person just trying to get the concept then yes this is the book to read."},{"Title":"Guide to Catskill Trails (The Forest Preserve Series : Vol 8)","review":"The guide book as some minor errors as any guidebook does; however, it give a good description of each trail and one knows exactly what to expect. It's easy to read the trail descriptions and to narrow the search down to the trail that meets your specific needs. The maps for the region, sold separately, are referenced in the book which makes find the exact locations on the map easy. The author does a nice job of pointing out things of interest on the trail or what makes the particular trail interesting without giving away too much and thus leaves the discovery part of hiking in tact. With or without the guide book and maps the trails in the region are well marked and are very easy to follow. With a map, the trails are a snap and easy to navigate because there are not that many junctions and when there are junctions they are mark with signs showing direction and distance to various points. Additionally, once having read the guide and looked at the map a rough mental picture of what is to come is easy to create. Getting lost in the area seems like a hard task. I wold imagine that most people could use just a map and do fine, but the guide provides a sense of trails, so it's easy to decide which one to do. The above reviewer seems to lack basic hiking skills, a.k.a. a map or common sense or both, and they seem to believe that this is the guidebooks responsibility.I've done several hikes in the area and have yet to have a single problem. Don't forget to purchase the maps of the region.The guide is well written, a few minor and noticeable mistakes aside, and is the one you will want to purchase if you are going hiking in the area. Good luck"},{"Title":"Guide to Catskill Trails (The Forest Preserve Series : Vol 8)","review":"Want to get horribly lost? Then get his book! The key to writing a useful guidebook is to put yourself in the shoes of the reader, something the authors of this book neglected to do. The misleading and incomplete directions in it got me lost both on the way to the trailhead and on the trail itself!The descriptions to the trailhead were vague and cryptic at best, with very few references to street names or landmarks. I had to depend on the kindness of strangers to get myself to the trailhead. And once on the trail, I had to depend on the park rangers to stay on the right track.While the book may make sense to the authors, it doesn't make sense to anyone who is new to the area (the very audience of this book). This book is in serious need of an outside editor who would have caught the many gaps in directions. I have no doubt that the authors know the region very well, but they did not do a good job communicating their knowledge."},{"Title":"Guide to Catskill Trails (The Forest Preserve Series : Vol 8)","review":"This book was very imcomplete. It skimmed the surface of the hiking and camping situation in the catskills and would be suitable for only the most casual of hikers. There was not nearly enough information on the the types of camp sites, whether there are fishable lakes and what the regulations are for the region."},{"Title":"Guide to Catskill Trails (The Forest Preserve Series : Vol 8)","review":"Except for &quot;definitive,&quot; I agree with most of the positives already mentioned. The negatives are really about local knowledge, something no print guide can ever cover, however user-friendly.Even the most current NYC Transit print guide cannot anticipate train delays, or happen to mention that no signs direct you through the construction to the LIRR from the R train at Atlantic Ave. Hopelessly lost is when you end up in Ronkonkoma instead of the Cloisters, or when you take a train to Canal St. and find yourself over the East River wondering why the sun is rising in the west.To minimize nasty surprises (you cannot eliminate them), talk to knowledgeable people with (very)recent experience of the area you plan to hike. (AMC's Mid-Hudson chapter is a good resource.) Post a question to an active discussion board. Take a shakedown hike. Get lost. Find your way back.

The first volume - his 'London Journal' starting in the year he met Johnson - is pure delight. Boswell always saw himself as a character acting in the drama of life, and he could be almost excruciatingly honest and objective about himself. His voluminous diaries record all the trivia, triumphs, and despairs of his own life, day by day and year by year.My own opinion is that Boswell is a far better diarist than Pepys, though not nearly as well known in this respect. There is a fascination about seeing his whole life recorded from youth to shortly before his death, with all the same force and liveliness that went into his Life of Johnson. His inner life is at least as entertaining as his outer life. He seems totally determined to write about himself as he wrote about Johnson - warts and all.It's this courage and honesty about himself that makes us respect Boswell even when he is at his most foolish or debauched. The diaries make it extremely clear that he was no idiot, and that the Life of Johnson was no fortuitous masterpiece. From his diaries he comes across as a deeply sensitive, romantic, self-conscious man. Charming, likeable, and often playing the clown to his acquaintances; but often filled with self-doubt, frustration, insecurity, and a deep depression that he concealed from all except his closest friends.We see Boswell puffed up with vanity at some silly social success, and the same Boswell quietly devoting large amounts of time and money that he could ill spare to helping people in trouble. We see Boswell in love again and again with totally unsuitable women, and eventually marrying the cousin who had always been a good, close friend rather than an object of wild romance. We see Boswell in his vibrant youth, and his tragic final years, as an alcoholic filled with bitter shame and despair, yet unable to reform.His diaries are certainly one of the great undiscovered treasures of literature. They deserve to be a lot better known than they are."},{"Title":"Boswell's London Journal, 1762-1763.","review":"James Boswell (author of the Life of Samuel Johnson) was about 22 when he arrived in London in 1762. His journal, even by today's standards, is remarkably uninhibited. Boswell loves describing everything--from his elicit love affair with an actress to the bout of venereal disease he contracted as a result; from his strained relationship with his father to his rather clingy relationship with Johnson. Oftentimes, I found myself a bit disenchanted with Boswell as a person(he seems to embody so many human weaknesses)--but he is a remarkable relator of events, characters, conversations, and situations."},{"Title":"Boswell's London Journal, 1762-1763.","review":"It has been quite awhile since I have read this book but and can remember few details. What sticks in the mind is the complete humanity displayed by its author. Frankly, Boswell is unlikable and hardly to be admired but his passion and candidness make this book very readable today. Not many tomes from this era can make this claim. It is a must read for both those interested in Johnson and those students of the human condition."},{"Title":"Boswell's London Journal, 1762-1763.","review":"Here's a Boswell diary entry. 'Good heavens, what a loose did we give to amorous dalliance! ...In a moment I felt myself animated with the strongest power of love, and, from my dearest creature's kindness, had a most luscious feast. Proud of my godlike vigour, I soon resumed the noble game. I was in full glow of health. Sobriety had preserved me from effeminacy and weakness, and my bounding blood beat quick and high alarms. A more voluptuous night I never enjoyed. Five times I was fairly lost in supreme rapture... Louisa had an exquisite mixture of delicacy and wantonness that made me enjoy her with more relish. Indeed I could not help roving in fancy to the embraces of some other ladies which my lively imagination strongly pictured. I don't know if that was altogether fair... I have painted this night as well as I could. The description is faint; but I surely may be styled a Man of Pleasure.' (12 January 1763) Indeed.

Writes lots of nasty things about various fifteen-minuters of his day and also meets a few bona fide intellectual lights like Johnson. This book is a salacious page-turner, beautifully written by a young man with an indiscriminate penis but a discerning eye for character.

The young Boswell's writing skills are on again/off again, but still the writer to come is evident. Boswell's London Journal outshines most any other journal you could read, and provides insight not only into the young (and maddeningly self-absorbed and trivial) Boswell, but also into a London culture that seems only remotely related to the 21st century western world.A must read for any Boswell fan, and a good read for anyone interested in late 18th century London society."},{"Title":"Boswell's London Journal, 1762-1763.","review":"A good book with very descriptive narratives of life in London back in the 18th century.

In a city called Grusinia, the Governor is executed in a coup and his wife flees for her life, abandoning their baby son Michael, who is picked up by a humble kitchen maid named Grusha. Having recently betrothed herself to a soldier named Simon who is away on duty, she sets out on a cross-country journey with the infant to get help from her brother, a farmer in a distant village.Lavrenti, her brother, suggests she get married immediately to avoid suspicion that the baby is hers out of wedlock, and the most available candidate is a local wretched peasant. After living with this man for a couple of years, Grusha is apprehended by soldiers who have come to take young Michael, the sole heir of the deposed Governor's estate, back to Grusinia. The case of Michael's custody, contested by the Governor's wife against Grusha, is brought to trial, where the judge, a drunk named Azdak whose unofficial appointment to this position is a farce, decrees that the boy will be placed inside a circle drawn with chalk on the courtroom floor, and that the woman who is able to pull him out of the circle is the real mother. (Study the judge's exact words when you read this.)Although the story is of medieval Chinese origin, Brecht's play is a sort of refashioning of the Biblical anecdote about Solomon and expands the idea by supplying a whole backstory to the women's argument. Solomon's judgment is accepted because his wisdom is universally considered to be impeccable, but what of a man like Azdak who functions on whim more than on wisdom? The ending is subtly brilliant in the sense that the outcome of the contest is subject to semantic debate (whether you think the judgment is fair or logical or contradictory depends on how closely you read the judge's words), but also in the question of irony or sincerity in the suggestion that true justice will be conferred by nature rather than by man."},{"Title":"The Caucasian Chalk Circle","review":"One of the master communist playwright Bertolt Brecht's strengths as an artist was the ability to set up a moral dilemma and work it out to a conclusion, not always a satisfactory one, by play's end. This is unusual in a seemingly orthodox follower of the old Stalinist' socialist realist' cultural program. This work nevertheless permitted Brecht to address an age-old question about the nature of property ownership, extending it from its natural and historic setting in land and chattels to the question of personal human ownership.The question posed here is whether a child abandoned by its natural mother then found and raised by another women should go to the former or that latter. Nice dilemma, right? But Brecht, as seem in Mother Courage and other parables, is not above cutting right to the bone on moral questions. What makes this work a cut above some of Brecht's more didactic plays is the way that he weaves the parable about the odd resolution of an ancient Chinese property dispute and places that \`wisdom' in context of a then current dispute between two Soviet-era communes.In the ancient dispute the judge who is called upon to render judgment, using the circle as a medium to resolve the dispute, seems to be Solomonic but is really a buffoon. This is pure Brechtian irony. This says as much about Brecht attitude toward property as it does about the old time Chinese justice system. The question of property rights as presented by Brecht and their value as a societal glue is also something the reader or viewer of this play should think about as well."},{"Title":"The Caucasian Chalk Circle","review":"It's popular now-a-days to call communism &quot;out of touch&quot; and socialism &quot;out of style.&quot; Brecht's question, then: Who should own anything? Should possession be nine-tenths of the law? Or should the laws of ownership remain an open-ended affair? -- could be called a foregone conclusion.Woe to the foregone conclusion, then. Its trial date is ever on the way.Laughably, the Helms-Burton bill, recently signed into law by Pres. Bill Clinton, is a giggle back to Brecht's discussion. And a silly one. One should think that were the United States to be in the business of giving back land &quot;once stolen,&quot; that the Navajo, Sioux, Chippewa, et. al. would be first in line.Not so!Apparently, Cuba's land belongs not to its current owners, but to its capitalists of 40 years hence. Oh, silliness. Oh, amusement.So ask Brecht's question, then, not as a socialist, a communist or a red. Ask it as a human being. To whom does anything belong? What is belonging? What is ownership? Who owns anything? When - and why - does ownership occasionally turn on its own head?"},{"Title":"The Caucasian Chalk Circle","review":"My son's theatre department is putting on this play.

This book covering Chic and the upcoming review of Sylvester's career are providing the information that many of us have been wading through old periodicals to find. The author of this Chic book has certainly done his homework. He tracked down virtually all of the Chic members who were living at the time, as well as relatives, business associates, and affiliated artists. He has put together an impressive amount of new material from interviews and research and he has assembled a wide sampling of the magazine articles from the 70s and afterwards. Kudos to Easley for his archiving and interviewing efforts.*Everybody Dance* gives a fairly complete accounting of the origins of the band and each member, the career of Chic and its off-shoot groups, its struggles after 1985, and how it negotiated the revival of interest in dance and disco musics. Easley has also included a number of photos from the four decades.The book reads compulsively in its first half, detailing the young Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards, to the extent possible. Rodgers' fairly haunting background comes as a surprise and explains much about his personality. The early chapters of the book grab the reader because the author captures the spirit of yearning and the trials of the nascent group to accomplish its goals. As a reader, I became absorbed in the story, some of which was already familiar to me from previous interviews with the band members.Unfortunately, Easley's agenda for incorporating the \\"Politics\\" of the subtitle is not well-integrated into the book, particularly after the first half dozen chapters or so. In fact, after Chapter 5 Easley gives up the introductory paragraph in which he recounts the current events of the day. It is not until Chapter 13 that he resumes this device, and with each succeeding chapter it is decreasingly successful in its attempt to set a context for the music. Rote citation of statistics about oil prices and presidential maneuvers is not enough to embed the social aspects of citizens and their entertainments. This is not a major flaw for the book necessarily, except that the subtitle IS \\"The Politics Of Disco.\\"Easley tries to punch up the dynamics of the group, apparently to create suspense in the portions of the tale covering the heyday of Chic. He stretches to do this, overstating the tensions and underplaying the accomplishments of the 80s in the effort to tell a tragic tale that is not, actually, all that tragic. There was great music created and much success during the 1980s for the group and its members.Overstatement is a weakness that better editing would have minimized. The author is fond of using superlatives in his reviews of the group's playing and the recordings-- to the extent that he ends up contradicting himself about which track is the \\"strongest use of strings\\" or the \\"best bass playing.\\" His fondness of using the term \\"arguably\\" arises several times in each chapter of the second half of the book. Proofreading would have caught this stylistic tic, as well the rampant grammatical errors such as missing apostrophes in possessives, misplaced commas, and unattributed quotes. The publisher let Easley down in the editing department.Despite the shortcomings, the book represents a much-needed resource about the group, and the author has clearly put much legwork into his look at Chic. His love of the music is apparent and his enthusiasms are often infectious. Although he was \\"preaching to the choir\\" with this reader, I nevertheless found much of interest in the book and recommend it."},{"Title":"Chic: Everybody Dance: The Politics of Disco","review":"As a lifelong fan of Nile Rodgers' & Bernard Edwards' prolific songwriting & production skills & musicianship, this book was long overdue for me but well worth the wait. This quality wordy tome has interviews from all the main people who knew & worked with Nile & Bernard. Using more recent interviews interspersed with archive ones, the reader is able to totally get a feel of the era from Chic's early days & beyond. You feel excited sharing the \\"Good Times\\" & feel despairingly sad when you \\"Flashback\\" to some of the episodes which led to broken friendships & the demise of Chic.You feel incredulous at the prejudice perpetuated by record company policy or radio programmers to their music, or even to the idea of them producing white artists like David Bowie.You feel immense pride when after being cruelly put down by so-called experts & critics for being a \\"disco act\\", they then become the most sought after producers throughout the 1980s. From producing Diana Ross to Madonna & ABC, via David Bowie, INXS, Robert Palmer & Rod Stewart to name just some. There's also a chapter on the now infamous \\"lost album\\" recorded with Johnny Mathis entitled \\"I Love My Lady\\".All the former band members conribute too-Karen Milne former violinist of the Chic Strings has contributions from her tour & recording dates diary which makes for fascinating reading.With a lot of pictures & memorabilia featured from my own collection also, the contributions from so many credible sources serve to mark this book with the desrved tag of, \\"The Chic Bible\\".

I thoroughly enjoyed both books. Will there be a third? I hope so."},{"Title":"Half A Rune","review":"Sword-wielding wayfarers riding fantastical creatures, an orphaned heir with a destiny to reclaim a throne lost to a wicked uncle, castles and demons, a feudal society struggling to emerge from the dark ages of a medieval existence... Read the first few pages of Half a Rune, and you might be forgiven for thinking this to be a mythical fantasy, on perhaps familiar territory where the hero must undertake a dangerous quest to reclaim his throne and fulfill his destiny. Races that are similar in some ways and different in others, including the mysterious Hynarkin and poorly understood demons, vie for control of a fractured kingdom, and the land is undergoing tumultuous changes that seem to reflect the turbulent times. A young queen-to-be has a heck of a problem on her hands, and wonders if she is up to the task of supporting her hero. There is excellent world-building here that should feel very familiar to fans of sword-and-sandal epics. But everything here is not as it seems, and the reader soon discovers that something strange is happening. In fact, Half a Rune is actually science fiction. Arthur C. Clarke's third law of prediction (any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic) is the subtext that drives this entertaining story by Cary A. Conder. Fans of genre-bending sci-fi/fantasy stories by the likes of Anne McCaffrey, Andre Norton, and Ursula K. Le Guin should enjoy this straightforward tale, because it follows in that same tradition. The hero, Hafrin, blossoms from a resentful youth with a special ability, and becomes a likeable young man, perceptive and resolute. His partner Nichole is certainly a believable character, full of worries and concerns for the future. But Nikki shares a special bond with Hafrin, and is just as brave and perceptive. Other characters like Hafrin's stern step-father Marrek, his fierce, remarkable pet Vrala, his ruthless uncle and enemy, Jikpryn, and Jikpryn's evil adviser Tolbun help to round out the story with solid performances, and the story proceeds to a satisfying conclusion. I enjoyed this story and took it for what it was intended to be: an entertaining 'what if' that portrays events, struggles and subterfuge somewhere far from Earth. The writing style is proficient and doesn't get in the way, with only a few minor glitches that shouldn't present any worries for the average reader. Really, the only complaint I have about the work is that it begs to be reworked as a full epic. I actually felt that a lot of the groundwork for that has already been put in place, with some elaborate world-building, the establishment of naming systems for geographic points, months, people, animals, etc. Some of the characters in the story could have been given more complete roles in the story arc, including Hafr&ouml;n, the 'magical' sword bearing the half-rune mentioned in the title. Really, Hafr&ouml;n is a character deserving more attention in its own right, and I think that readers will obviously be expecting more about this magnificent artefact in future stories. Complimenting the world-building already in place with more revealing conflicts and emotions from the characters, some further exploration of the scientific questions that are raised about evolution and climates on alien worlds, and shifting information from descriptive modes into action and dialogue would, I think, move the book to a more equal footing with the aforementioned authors. The story is stronger where it emphasizes action. Still, as it stands, Half a Rune is a pleasant find in a cross-genre area that not many authors explore; in a way, you get two stories for the price of one. Conder has set herself up well for any number of follow-on tales in her 'universe,' and I look forward to reading them."},{"Title":"UnderSurface","review":"This book freaked me out but in the best possible way. It was like reading a Cronenberg movie except it offered far more insight into the human side of the character than expected. On one level this is a groundbreaking novel exploring the complicated mentality of male sexuality and on another level it reads like a mystery but the outcome isn't as important as the journey. Dark stuff. Recommendeded with reservations, but it stuck in my head like few books have."},{"Title":"UnderSurface","review":"As unsettling as it is revealing, Undersurface is bold attempt at merging Hitchcockian mystery with social commentary. On one level it is a simple tale of mistaken identity, in which the protagonist finds himself living in sewage tunnels to escape capture for a crime he may or may not have committed; on another level it is a heartbreaking, sometimes surreal character study of a man losing his grip on reality. More than anything, it is the insight into the character's mind that drives this novel along. To say more could ruin the ending. I'll only add that this vivid, finely written book won't be for everyone, but for those who enjoy the melding of genres and well-envisioned plot twists it certainly won't be a disappointment."},{"Title":"UnderSurface","review":"I wanted to like this book, I truly did. But in the end, it left me completely unfulfilled.Here is my main problem with the book. Many novels, as does this one, start in the present and then flashback to the past to see how the protagonist actually made it to this current place. However, in order for this to work, a reader's attention must be grabbed at the very beginning to make us truly wonder and care about how things became the way they are. In this book, the present (as it starts out) is very bland and uneventful. The past, as we find out later, actually had some good twists and turns. However, by the time we get to the previous events, we really don't care about the main character or his predicament.While some of the descriptions are quite good and vivid, this short book will leave most readers completely unmoved."},{"Title":"Stairway to Hell: Rescuing Teens From Their Well-Planned Destruction","review":"It's a very easy read.

That is a long story in itself. If you check out my review on his book \\"Did the Catholic Church Give Us the Bible?\\" You will see why. I was once an avid reader and supporter of Jack Chick's materials. I used his tracts and books to evangelize the lost. Now I would be embarrassed to do so, and when I caught my daughter reading one of his booklets I still had lying around, I was mortified that my daughter might be infected with his historical lies and doctrinal distortions. Anyway, I read Stairway to Hell during that period of my life and reading all the negative reviews here, they sound eerily like the conclusions I have come to, even though I am an Evangelical Christian. Jack Chick has a certain mentality, and he published the books of authors who think like him. It is paranoid and fearful look at the world, which sees a demon behind wall, and lurking behind every bush. I do still believe in the supernatural, but my feeling is that Chick's version of it is wrong.So, the below review was written at that time. I still agree with the bulk of what I wrote here, though I have no knowledge of Dungeons and Dragons. I can only speak from my own experience and tell you that my mind had gone down a deep dungeon of immorality and wickedness before Christ shone His light on me.-------------------------Funny how people can look at facts and still say this book is rubbish! The stories are here. Another excellent resource is:They Sold Their Souls For Rock And Roll (Two Disc Set)They Sold Their Souls For Rock And Roll [DVD]I found this book both informative and disturbing. Coming from a background of drugs and heavy metal music, I know many of these stories to be true. From drug induced schizophrenia to deep bouts of depression aggravated by the evil music I fed my soul. From suicidal thoughts, to murderous, perverted and heinous thoughts. The spiritual diet young people are being fed is evil, pagan, anti-God and is truly leading them on a stairway to hell.However, and that's a big however, there is hope. We can choose to turn from these things which stink with the stench of death, and turn to Jesus who offers us hope, life and peace; through an obedient, love-faith relationship with Him.An excellent book on this topic is:One Heartbeat Away - Your Journey into Eternity by Mark CahillOne Heartbeat Away"},{"Title":"Stairway to Hell: Rescuing Teens From Their Well-Planned Destruction","review":"I bought this book some years ago so I could better understand the objections of the religious right with regards to role-playing games. I had heard all the usual distortions and misinformation that had been spewed by the right-wing church on the issue of RPG's (the most famous being Dungeons & Dragons, although to read this book D & D is the only RPG that exists) and I wanted to best argue against them by understanding exactly what the objection was and why.But having read through this book I find myself posing a simple question: Does Rick Jones represent the right-wing church in the main or is he an extremist even for them? I ask this as this book rather than answer my basic premise, added even more questions.To put it simply, Rick Jones has no clue what he is talking about. In his chapter on RPG's (he only ever mentions D & D) he deliberately misquotes and misrepresents the hobby in a fashion that, were it not for the possibility that his words may be viewed as very harmful and hurtful to others with his vitriol (to the point of it being slanderous even), might actually be seen as laughably inept. His \\"evidence\\" his nothing more than his opinion and when he produces his so-called \\"evidence\\" it is often a misquote or a distortion of what is actually there.But its not just his view of Role-Playing Games that is given this hilariously dangerous treatment. His views of non-Christian practitioners, Heavy Metal fans, homosexuals and drug users are dealt with in an equally sensationalist, disrespectful, slanderous and dangerously offensive manner. His \\"evidence\\" that a person who likes Heavy Metal is possessed by the devil is that if you try and take away their record collection they will get angry. I'm sure if you try and take someone's gospel music collection away they'd get angry to. This is the sort of argument he uses, missing the obvious, focusing on negatives (mostly those he sees himself that dont actually exist or negatives that exist as a constant like the above example over musical taste).There is nothing, absolutely nothing, even remotely positive that one can say about this book without being sarcastic or saying it with irony. Rick Jones in this book shows a scant disregard for humanity and common decency that quite frankly shocks me given that he supposedly is a children's counsellor.If you want a book that is hilariously misinformed, stunningly misrepresentative of the things it hates, and builds nonsensical arguments based on those misrepresentations, then this may be the book for you as you may find yourself chortling all the way through. But if you want a serious book that looks at the real problems that teens face and coming up with real solutions and positive outcomes, religious or otherwise, then this is most definitely not that book.If this book is a representation of Rick Jones' knowledge, then I cna say that when it comes to the subjects of homosexuality, heavy metal music, drugs, role-playing games and indeed teenagers and their problems in general, Rock Jones knows nothing of use and in fact what he knows, if he truly is in a postion of authority over children, could end up harming them far more."},{"Title":"Stairway to Hell: Rescuing Teens From Their Well-Planned Destruction","review":"This is very sad.

Elana, our main protagonist, is a half-trained anthropologist from a very advanced star-faring civilization. Georyn is a poor woodcutter's son from a primitive society, who quite naturally views Elana as an \\"enchantress\\" in possession of \\"magic\\". Our third viewpoint character is Jarel, a doctor serving with an aggressive and colonialist stellar empire that is much less advanced than Elana's people but plenty strong enough to oppress Georyn's.You will be astonished how smoothly the author mixes all the pieces together. From Georyn's perspective he is a traditional fantasy hero, a normal boy who accepts the guidance of a mysterious wizard so he can learn to fight the dragons and demons which threaten his land. His viewpoint is told in a suitably fairy-tale tone. Elana and Jarel are living the exact same events, of course, but each sees a completely different side to the story.There is a real depth here. The conflicts and differences between the three cultures are a constant backdrop, but in the end none of the three cultures are wholly good or wholly evil. Courage and excellence can arise in any culture, and the author was intentionally silent about which of these cultures represents us.Strongly recommended!"},{"Title":"Enchantress from the Stars","review":"Enchantress from the Stars proves one of the very best books of the genre. Combining mythic fantasy-like events with science fiction, Sylvia Engdahl weaves an incredible story that involves the reader on every level. The characters are fascinating, multifaceted, and engaging, and the events seize the reader and whirl them along on a desperate \\"What happens next??\\" ride.Best of all is the subtle theme the story provides, giving the reader a sense of hope and betterment of human civilization. This book expands the mind in ways previously never considered, and is a great read for anyone who picks it up."},{"Title":"Enchantress from the Stars","review":"This is a really amazing book, which, though it started out kind of slow, quickly picked up and was quite interesting. I'd say that Enchantress from the Stars is three parts science fiction, one part fantasy. It centers around three people on the planet Andrecia. One is Elana, a member of a very advanced interstellar civilization. She is on a mission to the \\"primitive\\" Andrecia to save it from a \\"Youngling\\" attack. Then there's Apprentice Medical Officer Jarel, a Youngling, who starts to have doubts about whether what his people are doing is right. And Georyn, the son of an Andrecian woodcutter. He only knows that there is a dragon on the other side of the Enchanted Forest, and he must defeat it. He believes that Elana is an enchantress from the stars who has come test him. That is sort of the fantasy element.The style of the book is really interesting. Jarel and Elana's sections are obviously science fiction, and are told in a science fiction style. But Georyn believes in magic, and his chapters are told in a style similar to an old fantasy tale.*You can read all of my reviews at my book blog, novareviews.blogspot.com*"},{"Title":"Enchantress from the Stars","review":"As a child I read Sylvia Engdahl's \\"Heritage of the Star\\" (published as \\"The Star Shall Abide\\" in the USA). This was one of my most memorable reads ever, and earlier this year I was glad to find her sequels to the books and to read them through. I also discovered this nook which received some awards and was republished in 2001.Having read the other books earlier this year, it was quite clear that this story exists in the same world as the others. It is in no way a sequel to \\"Heritage of the Star\\", but the galactic anthropological service is a key theme in the last book of that trilogy. The themes and ideas are all very similar.The idea of a clash of civilisations at different stages of development is an intelligent and interesting one, and this book explores those themes well. The author explicitly states that the book is not allegorical for our times, but readers will see similarities with the story of \\"avatar\\" and thus with the clash of civilisations when Europeans came to the Americas (particularly the USA).There are a few problems with this book though in my opinion. One is that having so recently read the other trilogy by this author, I was surprised and perhaps a little disappointed that it did not have more originality in setting. Add to this the galactic federation, and the multiple humanoid looking races, and this is a story that appears to be a product of the Star Trek age in which it was conceived. But that does not really detract from the ideas conveyed or the quality of the story."},{"Title":"Enchantress from the Stars","review":"Although originally published in 1970, Enchantress from the Stars has a surprisingly modern feel to it. Aside for the book cover, it would fit right in with today's books. Enchantress from the Stars is a unique mix of science fiction meets fantasy. Engdahl seamlessly combines a technologically advanced alien race with a world set in a medieval era while creating a story that is timeless and appealing to all ages.A destructive alien race called the Imperials have settled on the planet of Andrecia to exploit it's resources and displace it's less advanced people. This isn't the first time this race has invaded other planets and their actions have attracted the attention of another alien race even more advanced than they are. To stop the Imperials, a team of agents from this advanced race is sent to Andrecia to reverse the Imperials' invasion without harm to all sides. Only the team cannot stop the Imperials themselves, they have to work with the natives to stop save Andrecia. The book alternates perspectives giving you an understanding of all sides; Andrecian, Imperial, and the team of Agents.The main character and primary narrator is Elana, a current student at the Academy learning about Youngling planets. She naively stows away on a spaceship to be apart of her father's mission to save the planet of Andrecia. Her lack of training is a problem and against the rules but the team has to make the mission work with Elana. Along with her father and her boyfriend, Evrick, the team works together to find a native or natives suited for the job of stopping the Imperials.Georwyn, Terwyn, and their brothers are young native men walking through the enchanted forest on a mission to slay the dragon (which is actually an Imperial machine that mines the planet's resources). They seek the reward that the King offers in return for slaying the dragon. While hunting the dragon, they encounter an old man with magical abilities and an enchantress who offers advice in slaying the dragon. Of all the brothers, Georwyn proves himself to be wise beyond his years and well suited for the challenge of slaying the dragon.Jeral is a medic for the Imperials and after his coworkers kill and imprison natives, he starts to second guess his mission. He's been told that the natives of Andrecia are not really human and therefore their actions to take over the planet are justified. As the mission goes on, he sees more in more that the people of this planet are human and he no longer wants anything to do with the mission.Enchantress from the Stars is a well written, original, and heartwarming story. In addition, the audiobook narrator told this story beautifully. It's even a won a few awards. With that said, I have to say that I didn't love it but also I didn't hate it. It isn't a book that pulls you in and never lets you go but more so an enjoyable read that you can easily put down and pick up again later. Overall, I really to do recommend others give Enchantress from the Stars a try.Engdahl went on to write a second book featuring Elana called The Far Side of Evil, which takes places on a completely different planet and has a completely different feel."},{"Title":"Enchantress from the Stars","review":"I almost was almost deterred from reading this book after reading one of the reviews claiming Elana to be immoral and needing sense whacked into her. But since I already had the audiobook on my Ipod I decided to listen to it anyways. Though out the book I kept guarding myself from the moment when Elana would betray her fianc&eacute;. To me that never happened. The \\"ridiculousness\\" another reader is frustrated by is Elana's willingness to share honestly (in her narrative to her cousin) her thoughts, insecurities, and frustrations -- while the other characters' emotional weaknesses are more hidden from our view. All humans have emotional weaknesses, and the author showed us Alana's so we could see her as human -- rather than as the \\"supernatural enchantress\\" the native Andrecians believed her to be. She does not have condescending pity for her fianc&eacute;. The story and her father give her very little contact with her fianc&eacute;. She does come to develop a deep friendship/love for a native Adrecian man that she is required to spend a lot of time alone with teaching. But they never touch until a chaste farewell embrace when she departs. From the story it seems that Elana's engagement to Everek was arranged when she was younger. Elana continues to love her fianc&eacute; throughout the story and never once lets herself or the Adrecian Georyn think they would be physically intimate, have continued correspondence, or contact of any kind following the completion of the mission. Essentially, her father permits, and in ways fosters, Elana and Georyn's friendship because love is a much more powerful emotional stimulus than fear.What I most enjoyed about the book is how it makes you wonder where we Earthlings are in our cultural development and what our potential as a society and as individuals may be. It was fun to think about the fairytales we grow up with and imagining about how they could have been based on interstellar contact. But most of all it was fascinating to ponder the religious symbols that my personal faith clings to and wonder how very little I must know compared to greater intelligences I believe do oversee us and who have and still are working to help us become like them."},{"Title":"Enchantress from the Stars","review":"This book is a surprising gem.The one line review that I've been passing on to friends is \\"This is what Ursula K. Le Guin would write, if she did something light.\\"On the surface, it's light but well-written storylines woven together in a sci-fi/fantasy twist.But the book forces you to shift perspective, to move between different points of view, and to think.I picked it up because I figured anything that got a Newberry Honor medal was probably worth reading, and I wasn't disappointed."},{"Title":"Enchantress from the Stars","review":"This is a re-read from my youth and I am glad that it has been reissued. I love all of Engdahl's work and I only wish that she would write more after her long dry period. A well-writte intelligent and charming female protagonist learns and grows within a setting much like early (good) Andre Norton- reminiscent of Ice Crown, in fact."},{"Title":"Enchantress from the Stars","review":"fresh new approach to the age old questions about our own possible beginings, I was in awe of the simplicty of the idea and how this could indeed be how things began and history turns into legend"},{"Title":"Enchantress from the Stars","review":"A jewel among books, Engdahl indeed do a fantastic job while writing her story. She combined three different viewpoints with three completely different styles of writing a put it together in such a way that everything flowed perfectly together.This book, set on the planet Andrecia, tells about a girl who comes from a society more advanced than our own. She finds out a Youngling planet, one that is less advanced than our own, is in trouble and her father and best friend/eventual marriage partner is going down there to try and remedy the situation. She sneaks with them, discovers real love and the horrors that people experience everyday, and how to cope with them. It completely changes her view on life in such a realisitic amazing way.If you want to read a fantasy book that is not all fun and happiness, although the major portion of the book is, and is fantastic and marvellous and wonderful, I suggest you buy this book. Engdahl herself is very responsive. I wrote her a letter telling her how much I loved her book, and I had a response the next day.Trust me, buy it."},{"Title":"Enchantress from the Stars","review":"This book is so awesome. It has the 3 different viewpoints of 3 different cultures intertwined so that it automatically becomes your favorite book. And it is.

But as soon as I got past the first page, it was immediately apparent to me that I would be drawn into the worlds of Elena and Georyn. I am definitely not a sci-fi freak, but this book is so much more than that. The lessons it teaches are invaluable, and the story is so wonderfully told, it made me rush to find the sequel!"},{"Title":"Enchantress from the Stars","review":"Having read Sylvia Engdahl's excellent novel, The Far Side of Evil, several years ago, I approached this book with a positive outlook that it would be just as thought-provoking and well told. I wasn't disappointed, though this novel is indeed different in tone.The Enchantress of the title is Elana, whose exact age is never given but can be assumed to be in her late teens or early twenties. Elana, looking for adventure and real life experience, stows away on board a starship that is sent to Andrecia, a medieval planet that is currently being colonized by a more advanced society. Once her presence is known, her father and boyfriend decide that Elana can indeed help with the plan to oust the invaders, which will allow Andrecia to continue to develop at its own pace. Elana becomes the \\"Enchantress\\"; she befriends two locals who are off to fight the \\"Dragon\\" (a massive rock-chewing machine), and helps them by awakening their own skills so that their quest will be successful. In the process, Elana finds herself falling for the local known as Georgyn, and in her inexperience, putting them both in grave danger.This book moves seamlessly between points of view, which gives it a much more universal feel than had we only known Elana's side of the story. When Georyn's voice takes over, the story almost becomes a fairy tale; indeed, that is how he sees Elana and the invaders who have come to his world. Elana is, of course, young and inexperienced but desperate to do the right thing; and Jarel is the lone voice of the invaders, unsure of his world's plans but unable to do anything to stop them.I enjoyed this novel but did feel that at times it was a bit on the fantastic side. I felt the plans Elana's father made to dupe the invaders weren't necessarily believable, but I was able to keep in mind that this is indeed a fantasy. Elana could be infuriating in her lack of knowledge and her headstrong ways, and her poor boyfriend Evrek is relegated to the background while Elana forges ahead with a relationship with Georyn. Overall, however, this is a well-written novel and Engdahl has a gift for telling a tale that will pull you in from the first pages. Over thirty years since its debut, this thought-provoking novel holds up well and is just as relevant today. Recommended for lovers of fantasy."},{"Title":"Enchantress from the Stars","review":"When Elana's mission gets put in jeopardy she faces a lifetime of torture and imprisonment. Will she be able to save herself and the mission? Elana, the Enchantress, and her father were agents of the Federations Anthropological Center and it was their assignment to stop the Imperials from taking over the planet Andrecia. They led Georyn, a woodcutter's son, to believe that a stone was the source of his new magical powers; however, the truth was that they had taught him telekinesis and he wasn't even aware of it. Georyn was supposed to use his \\"magic\\" to defeat the dragon (a mechanical weapon used the Imperials). Elana and Georyn were on their way to the Imperials camp when natives captured them. The natives took them to the Imperials camp where they were locked in barracks. The Imperials planned to send them to a research center to be studied. Elana persuaded one of the guards, Jarel, to help them and he let Georyn out of his cell when no one was paying attention. When it appeared that the dragon was going to defeat Georyn, Elana decided to sacrifice herself to try to end the whole ordeal. As she ran and laid in front of the dragon, a flood of courage surged through Georyn. He used his magic powers to save her, stop the dragon, and scare away the Imperials. Georyn went to the king to announce that the dragon had been killed and to get his reward. He decided to explore the rest of the planet he lived on while he had the chance. Elana left Andrecia after accomplishing her goal and traveled back to her own planet. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone and everyone who enjoys reading a great book.This book is written with loads of details. Georyn was the youngest of four sons born to a poor woodcutter, who lived on the planet Andrecia. Elana was a young woman in the First Phase of her training to be an agent. Jarel was an Imperial medic who was determined to prove that his civilization was not right in trying to colonize Andrecia.Even though this is a science fiction book some of the things in it are realistic to our own world. The cool, green, peaceful planet, Andrecia is the third planet of a medium sized yellow sun. The Federation tried to prevent weaker nations from being taken over by stronger nations. Some types of people tend to be better at some things than others.This book will stretch the reader's imagination. The Imperials used a huge machine that resembled a dragon to clear an area on Andrecia for the colony they were planning to establish. Georyn was taught telekinesis on a subconscious level, therefore he didn't even know about it. The Federation was an organization meant to save weak planets from the more powerful ones trying to colonize.I recommend this book to everyone. It is a great read. It is very imaginative but some of the elements of the book seem somewhat realistic. Even if you are not a big fan of science fiction books this is a story that everyone should read.~V. Newberry"},{"Title":"Enchantress from the Stars","review":"I have always been an avid reader. When I was a young teenager I discovered an old copy of &quot;Enchantress From the Stars&quot; on a bookshelf in our house and devoured it within a few hours. I have since read it several times and just finished it again last week. I find it one of the finest, most well crafted, intriguing books I have read, and it occupies a place of honor on the shelves that house &quot;my favorite books.&quot; I love Science Fiction as well as Fantasy, and this book combines both of them in a fascinating, compelling way that makes the reader not want to put it down till it is done, and come back to it again later like an old friend. Ms. Engdahl intertwined the three viewpoints/cultures of Elana, Georyn, and Jarel in a highly talented, fascinating way that I have never come across in any other book. The plot is very original, exciting, and thought-provoking.Now that I am married and have a baby of my own, I am very excited to share this book with my own children and husband. I wish I knew why it isn't more widely circulated/well-known, and I think it should still be in print. Hats off to Ms. Engdahl. I hope she has great success with her work and I think it would be wonderful to see another book about Elana (the only other one I know about is &quot;The Far Side of Evil&quot;)."},{"Title":"Enchantress from the Stars","review":"This is an interesting book. I like the three different voices she uses to narrate the three different worlds, and the way the most advanced world, being the most self-aware, is done in first person.Interesting questions are raised and about truth, right/wrong, etc. I do not agree with everything the author seems to believe, but this book would be a good springboard for discussion of questions like, \\"What is truth?\\" and \\"What/who is God?\\" and \\"Is there anything beyond what we can see and study with traditional science?\\"There are a lot of other interesting questions that can be pondered that the book raises but does not answer. For instance, was Alana's father exploiting her young heart and propensity to fall in love in order to save the world of Andrecia and, if so, is that a morally defensible thing?Not the absolute best book I have ever read, but worth reading, and probably worth reading more than once."},{"Title":"Enchantress from the Stars","review":"I read this many years ago as a young teenager and am pleased that it has returned for a new generation.

Begin with the idea based from the much-talked-about alien, Ms. Engdahl turned it into a concept that what if the ancient things, such as magic, dragon, wizards, witch, beyond our capability to understand, was things from another planet, another world, with civilization higher than ours?This book really made me think and even helped me in someway to add to my understanding about human, life and alien. A deep thoughtful science fiction story about human civilization evolution."},{"Title":"Enchantress from the Stars","review":"A beautifully rendered novel with high intelligence, captivating character, and cosmic soul. In many ways, Sylvia Engdahl's writings are the logical successors to Heinlein's derring-do tales of gifted individuals making a difference in human exploration of other worlds. But Engdahl's pace is more leisurely, reflective, and the tapestry she weaves may well outlast Heinlein's. Here, she introduces Elana, with a very special mission.... (For further exploits of Elana, and a crucially important argument for the necessity of space exploration right now, see Engdahl's The Far Side of Evil...)Although Elana is young, this is a novel for adults of all ages."},{"Title":"Enchantress from the Stars","review":"Only a very few people are capable of combining science fiction and fantasy, and even fewer can make it something that captures you as this book does.The book starts off with a young woman on a planetary anthropological mission, on a world called Andrecia. Andrecia is medieval and primitive, and in no way capable of handling the knowledge that advanced, spacefaring societies exist beyond their world.But the heroine, Elana, soon becomes involved in a plot concerning the potential invasion of Andrecia. But it is near-impossible for her to save the Andrecians, superstitious and magic-believers, from an invasion.Nearby is also a medical guy, Jarel, who feels remorse at the intentions of the Exploration Corps. They do not consider the population of Andrecia to be sentient and worthy of their notice, and promise to bring destruction down on Andrecia. There is also the son of an Andrecian woodcutter named Georyn, who identifies Elana as the Enchantress of the Stars. He believes that she has come for the purpose of testing him, if he can defeat a fearsome dragon in the forests.This clash of the sophisticated and the simple is well-drawn and almost saddening at times. Georyn's faith in Elana's &quot;magic&quot; is truly touching, without making him appear ignorant or dumb. Elana is an excellent, intelligent heroine who captures your sympathy and does not let go. Her struggles with integrity and truth do not transcend the reader, but are ones that you feel as much as she does.Too often in books there is a clash between magic and science, but in this particular book there is no clash. Perhaps that is partly due to the writing style -- half the magic seems to be in the otherworldly descriptions, interspersed with more grounded prose in the right places. (And Engdahl definitely knows how to write a beginning that will suck you in) Though some things like &quot;Imperial Corps&quot; and &quot;Federation&quot; imply a pseudo-Star-Trekkian space opera, this is none of the kind. This is a thoughtful work, filled with intelligent questions that will stimulate as it entertains.This goes on the shelf beside Tolkien and the Riddlemaster trilogy."},{"Title":"Enchantress from the Stars","review":"Science fiction and fantasy rarely interact well with one another. A story that begins by uttering factual possibilities (as science fiction does) will not fare well in the face of fantastical elements. And then you read a miraculous story like, \\"Enchantress From the Stars\\" and it all goes higgledy-piddledy out the window. Sylvia Louise Engdahl's 1970 classic isn't just well written. It is also a deeply moving work that seeks to answer questions we may have about our own innate morality and future prospects.In this story we meet our heroine Alana. Alana spells out clearly the three phases of humanity. In the first phase, people are superstitious and primitive. In the second, they are scientific and logical. In the third (and this is the phase to which Alana belongs) people remember the spiritual side to life and enter onto an entirely different plane from that of their forebears. Those planets and people in the universe who have advanced to the third phase have joined together to save those in the first phase from those in the second. In this particular story, Alana joins both her father and her lover on a planet not too different from that of Earth. Their goal is to save the planet's fledgling civilization from a group of colonizers from another planet. To do so, Alana must enlist the help of a man living in an age of chivalry and a man living in an age of science. As these three worlds intersect, the book thoroughly examines where it is humanity is heading and what we have to look forward to. In short, it is a book about faith.How easy it would have been for author Engdahl to screw up while writing this. She could have made it too long (and it's not a quick read at that). The pace could have dragged. The characters (and jumps between different people's perspectives) could have rung false. Instead, the book is nearly perfect. Alana has sworn an oath to protect the secret of her advanced world's existence from the people she interacts with. At the same time, however, she wonders if it is proper to question the oath's policy. When she asks her father this question he responds as such:\\"We are sworn to carry out Federation policy, yes, just as a policeman is bound to uphold the law; but that doesn't mean we suspend our own ethical judgement\\".So Engdahl smoothly works in questions of ethics vs. morality as well. The book goes far beyond the normal sci-fi/fantasy literature it has been so unfortunately paired with. Rather, it is a deeply moving and deeply felt story that reaches for the Big Questions and, on top of that, is an enjoyable read. It is probably the most enjoyable philosophical book written for young adults that I have ever had the pleasure to read. A nearly forgotten, marvelous, wonderful book."},{"Title":"Enchantress from the Stars","review":"What do you do when you get a glowing recommendation for an obscure book by an unprolific author you've never heard of? Well, if you're like me, you react skeptically, yet with fascination. So I jumped at the chance to get &quot;Enchantress from the Stars&quot;, knowing it was rare. It's one thing to read a book *knowing* it will be good and it turns out so. It's something more special to go into a book with no expectations and to be totally blown away by it. That was what happened to me when reading this book. The lines of science fiction and fantasy blur here thanks to some very clever storytelling. It all takes place on the planet of Andrecia, the natives of which are analogous to those of Mediaeval Europe. Their planet is being invaded by a scientifically-oriented spacefaring culture. A small number of field agents from a culture further advanced than either of the aforementioned (and posessing psychic and telekinetic powers) arrives with intent to get the invaders to leave the planet to the natives. They go about this by telling a young native man named Georyn and his brother that they are sorcerers and that they will endow them with special powers that will make the invaders leave. The story goes beyond the standard &quot;good vs. evil&quot; plotlines in such stories, and posesses a refreshing sense of humanity that reminds me slightly of Ursula Le Guin. To say this is an excellent book doesn't begin to describe its majesty and emotional power."},{"Title":"Enchantress from the Stars","review":"In her novel Enchantress from the Stars, Sylvia Louise Engdahl combines science fiction and fantasy to weave together an intricate plot and tell an entertaining and interesting story. The time in which this story takes place is not clear. When the book begins, it seems as if Engdahl is writing of the future. As the story progresses, it seems as if she is writing of the past. In the end of the book, the two times intertwine so that it seems as if time does not exist at all.The plot is set on the planet of Andrecia, home to a poverty-stricken, primitive society in which the people live in small rural villages and are governed by a monarchy. In one of the poor Andrecian villages, at the edge of the dreaded Enchanted Forest, lives a woodcutter with his four sons, all of whom dream of better, brighter futures. While the three eldest brothers wish for power, gold, and treasure, the youngest, Georyn, wants only wisdom equal to that of his King. Thus, when word travels to them that the person who slays the dragon inhabiting the Enchanted Forest will receive from the King whatever reward he desires, all four brothers are eager to set out at once. However, the dragon is actually a giant machine, or rockchewer, built by a far more technologically-advanced society, the Imperials. The Imperials, who are planning to take over the planet, have created the rockchewer to clear the land so they can build a colony. As the Andrecians appear one by one to &Ograve;slay the dragon,&Oacute; they are paralyzed by the Imperials stun-guns, making them defenseless captives.Another society of people, even more advanced than the Imperials, is determined to stop them from taking over the planet. Elana and Evrek, two teenagers, and Elanas father journey to Andrecia to help the native Andrecians revolt against the Imperials and scare them off the planet. Elanas people have the unique ability to move objects with their minds and to communicate telepathically. As a result, Georyn and his brothers believe Elana to be an Enchantress. Through many tests and a developing friendship, she teaches Georyn how to control the movement of objects and prepares him for his face-off with the dragon.\\"Enchantress From the Stars\\" is an engrossing book that keeps the reader on their toes from the very first chapter.

I was a real bookworm as a child, devouring hundreds of books, but this one stuck with me. I had searched for it ever since my own children were old enough to read, and thoroughly enjoyed re-reading it as an adult.Who, ultimately, saved Andrecia from being conquered by the Imperials? Elana, her father, and Evrek, with their superior civilization? Georyn, with his amazing ability to use the power of the charm? Jarel, with his courageous decision to aid Elana and Georyn? Certainly, all these characters played a part.But, some higher force in the universe brought them all together. Some higher force arranged that Elana and Georgyn would fall in love, and that Jarel would both question his empire's conquest and have opportunity to meet and aid Elana. We are left to decide for ourselves just what that higher force could be. Coincidence is not an option.In the climactic scene of this novel, love truly conquers all to the astonishment of everyone present. Every character acts according to a plan, and every plan goes awry, yet the outcome is better than any of them could have imagined. They are all left humbled by a magic beyond their expectations. And, the reader is left enchanted by Engdahl's provacative science fiction-fairy tale."},{"Title":"Enchantress from the Stars","review":"This is surely one of the most rewarding stories I have ever read. On the surface it is an adventure tale about a would-be hero who sets out to slay a dragon and an almost-anthropologist who drops in from beyond the stars to help him. The interrelationships between three cultures at varying levels of advancement, are overlaid with the transcending relationships between individual people. At the same time it is a thoughtful essay on being human: on fear and courage and love. Most importantly, though, it is an affirmation of taith: faith in individuals and faith in the progressive improvements in societies. Dont worry. Somehow the theory and phillosophy NEVER overpower, or even hinder the plot or its people. These things are all mingled into a vibrant story.My father first read this book to me when I was very young and I loved it. I have come back to it many times, each time finding something new. I don't know whether I treasure it more for the quiet reassurance about belief in human destiny,"},{"Title":"Enchantress from the Stars","review":"When I picked up Enchantress From the Stars, I expected it to be a kind of old-fashioned fantasy book. The reason I picked it up was that it was a Newbery Honor winner. I was tired of old-fashioned fantasies.This wasn't tiring. In fact, it's one of my favorite books.It's about Elana - she isn't supposed to be on Andrecia, but she's on there. She's from a highly developed planet where they aren't supposed to show themselves to not yet developed planets. Andrecia is another planet, which is kind of like our past, when people believed in dragons and such, being invaded by a more developed society. Anyway, Elana pretends to be an Enchantress, her father Starwatcher, and Evrek an evil spirit. It changes views from Elana to Georyn to Jarel. I didn't quite agree with the ideas and was enraged when I found Elana and Georyn's relationship was simply being \\"used,\\" but it's still my favorite book. It's a science-fantasy viewpoint of legends and enchantresses."},{"Title":"Enchantress from the Stars","review":"Elana is part of a highly advanced society, but they keep themselves secret to all societies below them- at whatever cost.

Elana ends up working with her father and the boy she is to marry, as she helps try to perserve the planet with a native's help. What is science to Elana is \\"magic\\" to the people of this planet. We see things from Elana's viewpoint, the viewpoint of the invading society, and the viewpoint of the planet that is being invaded, who all have very different ways of thinking.

When I first picked it up, it seemed fascinating. But, once I got into it, it was slow.

While it was good, it certainly wasn't the best."},{"Title":"Enchantress from the Stars","review":"This book gave me alot to think about and to hope for. I am sixteen and just finished reading this book a few days ago. It is about four people from an advanced Federation, who travel to an inhabited \\"Youngling\\" planet that is being colonized by a different Youngling culture. The Federation hopes to frighten the invaders away without letting either culture know that their race is less advanced than another is. If a race learns that they have more advanced neighbors, they could lose faith in their own progress and wouldn't develop normally, depriving the universe of a unique race that might someday discover something that previous races had missed. There is a \\"My Teacher is an Alien\\" series of books by Bruce Coville that I enjoyed many aspects of, but in those books the more advanced races of the universe were contemplating destroying Earth because it was still fighting itself 3,000 years after all other known species had stopped fighting themselves. I like Sylvia Endgahl's take on humanities evolution better; unfair actions are a natural part of a culture's growth. A race may go through growing pains just as a person does. It is painful to know that so many innocent people have been hurt when unique cultures, unused to each other, first meet and subsequently try to adapt. People tend to be more thoughtful and considerate as they gain experience and become more aware of feelings. The Federation could easily have destroyed either or both cultures, but instead chose a few people to try to ease the cultures through some painful growing stages. They recognized that once a race is influenced too much or gone, you can never know what it might have accomplished."},{"Title":"Enchantress from the Stars","review":"This is a must read.

Turned out, my hunch was completely right! This isn't really the type of book you rave about (however I may rave--as that is what I do with books )it's more the variety that leaves you thinking and makes a lasting impression.The characters were well thought through. And though I felt Elana (main character) acted a little young for her age, by the end I could see clearly how she'd matured to view life in a better way. Georyn came through as the slightly wide-eyed innocent he was meant to be. And the interactions between them felt utterly natural.Characters: 5 StarsAnd what a wonder-full/mysterious plot! An interesting mix between Sci-Fi and Fantasy that Sylvia Engdahl pulled off marvelously! It was a cohesive story that represented a section in Elana's life. And I recognized that this was only a very small portion of something much bigger. The fate of a world did rest on her shoulders, but it was refreshing to read a story about growing better and fighting for what is right, even in the little things.Plot: 5 StarsSwitching between first-person POW with Elana and a classic rendition of Georyn's side of things, it was quite enjoyable to discover how they each viewed different phenomena--such as the giant machine that Georyn sees as a horrendous, fire-breathing dragon. Pushing Elana through difficulties she'd never before considered, and showing how those choices apply to life in general, was extremely thought-provoking and gave more hope for the future.Style: 5 StarsRating: 5 Stars"},{"Title":"Enchantress from the Stars","review":"I picked up \\"Enchantress From the Stars\\" in the library, in one of my routine sweeps of the childrens books. I'd never hear of it, or Sylvia Lousie Engdahl before, but it was an intriguing looking science fiction/fantasy, and even though I don't have much time for casual reading these days, I decided to try it.I'm so glad I did.Enchantress From the Stars is the story of three people from three civilizations at various points of development: Elana, from a futuristic society, part of an order that helps protect \\"Youngling\\" societies, as they call the cultures and civilizations far elow their level of development. Jarel, a medic for an Imperial colony that has come to take over the planet Andrecia for the Empire, even if it means neutralizing its \\"less than human\\" population, and Georyn, a native Andrecian, facing a danger that he knows only as \\"the Dragon\\".The book takes the point of view of each of these characters at various points, switching points of view and styles smoothly and easily, drawing the reader further into the minds of the three main characters. The story is engaging and compelling; Elana's development, and her team's struggle to protect Andrecia without violating thier version of something akin to Star Trek's Prime Directive pulls the reader in and doesn't let go, and Georyn's intelligence and yearnings for something greater make him a character you'll never forget.Enchantress From the Stars is a wonderful books that combines the best qualities of wonder of both science fiction and fantasy. You'll never forget it, or its characters; thier story, their coming of age, their insights, will hold your mind for a long, long time after you close the book."},{"Title":"Enchantress from the Stars","review":"Ms. Engdahl has a unique talent for presenting sympathetic characters who deal with life-changing ordeals and must make hard ethical choices. Enchantress from the Stars introduces us to Elana, a young girl from a highly advanced culture who has the opportunity to rescue a primitive culture from another somewhere in between. Set in a science fiction framework and filled with commentary on the nature of magic, the responsibilities of knowledge, and the joys and sorrows of love, this book will enthrall you from beginning to end. The sequel, The Far Side of Evil, is even better."},{"Title":"Enchantress from the Stars","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite books, science fiction or otherwise, along with its sequel, &quot;The Far Side of Evil.&quot;I always wished the author had written more books in the series on Elana. If it was her decision not to write any more, I wish she'd reconsider. If it was the publisher's decision to end the series, they are missing the boat."},{"Title":"Enchantress from the Stars","review":"I'm delighted to see how many others have been moved by this very special book! I was a 12 year-old sixth grader in 1977 when this exciting story and its wonderful heroine initiated me into several paradigm shifts.Elana is both girl and woman, and her integrity, intelligence and courage inspired me. She was the first literary heroine I truly took to my heart and cherished as a role model. She lived in a world previously unimaginable to me (this was my first science fiction book), but her challenges and the way she faced them were immediate and real. Like Noren, the central character of Engdahl's \\"Children of the Star\\" trilogy, she wrestles with issues of truth, integrity, courage, love, and responsibility, because she cares so very deeply about them.This was my first clue that science fiction could be about something besides ray guns and bug-eyed-monsters. Three cultures meet in this story, and the consequences of that impact held my attention and fired my imagination long after the last page. I'd always dreamed of adventures beyond the lovely but small town in which I was growing up. This book raised my eyes to the stars.Finally, \\"Enchantress\\" taught me that the way a person perceives life and truth are inexorably bound up with their life experiences and references. Three people from different worlds meet in this book, and each has a completely different understanding of what's going on. From then on, I knew that my own perspective was necessarily limited, and I could never assume that another person automatically shared my understanding.In the year 2001, I'm 36 years old, with a Masters Degree and a personal library of over 1000 volumes, and Elana and Georyn are still among my favorite characters of all time. \\"Enchantress from the Stars\\" stands among the few dozen on two special shelves of books that are set apart from the rest as being especially precious. When my now 5 year old daughter turns 12, I'm going to give her this book as a special gift.Do yourself a favor: get it for yourself. And think seriously about getting it for a young woman of your acquaintance. Elana is an exceptional heroine and role model. And it's a great story."},{"Title":"Enchantress from the Stars","review":"A friend of mine recomended this book to me, and since he is a sci-fi buff, I expected little. How wrong I was. Three worlds, all on different levels, colide on the small, earth-like planet of Andrecia. Elana, the main character, is from the highest ranking of the three. When she arrives on Andrecia, she doesn't expect much. But, like me, she is proved wrong. Sylvia Engdahl writes a dramatic play of characters all on different levels, but very much the same."},{"Title":"Enchantress from the Stars","review":"Elana is a member of an advanced interstellar civilization that studies and protects unadvanced \\"Youngling\\" civilizations. When space-faring Younglings called Imperials invade a medieval Youngling planet called Andrecia, Elana becomes involved in an attempt to rescue Andrecia--without endangering either culture, or revealing her own. Enchantress of the Stars is an ambitious book, but not always a successful one. There are three civiliazations, three points of view, two narrative styles, a wide-ranging plot and setting all couched within a framing narration, and with so much going on no one aspect is fully realized. Take for example the characters: Elana and her love interest Georgyn are admirable, realistically faulted, promising characters, but Elana's narration deadens her own character development by burdening it with excessive explanation; the interaction between these characters is satisfyingly complex--except for the crucial romantic element, which develops too easily and early, and shoulders too many plot points. These aspects are well-intended and the groundwork for their success is laid out in elements such as Elana's naivety and intelligence, Georyn's keen emotional insight, and the unique POVs which accompany each character, but they never quite come to life. This failure makes for an emotionally stunted novel--which is particularly regrettable in young adult literature.The plot has similar lofty goals and rocky execution. Its ambition and scope is what I loved best in the book, and it makes for a young adult novel that, rather than talking down to its audience, challenges them with difficult concepts of societal and personal maturation. The carefully constructed triple narrative also makes for some strong parallelism and clever plot developments, the sort of which would be unlikely in a traditionally narrated book. But the triple narrative also makes for unfortunate repetition, the plot's tension is destroyed by the framing narration, and in between the lovely parallels and plot points are some pinprick plot holes. Why, for example, do the Imperials consider colonized natives effectively nonhuman if they study--of all things!--their psychology, which is virtually identical to the Imperials's own? Because it makes for a convenient plot point later on, of course--but while such plot holes don't render things entirely improbable, they are enough to make the plot feel more like machination than natural progression, weakening its erstwhile strengths. I nitpick, of course, but that's just my point: I went through Enchantress from the Stars constantly distracted by nitpicking; I was never absorbed by characters or motivated by plot enough to overlook the various weaknesses. It's a laudably ambitious book, intriguing for its premise alone, and at times comes rewardingly close to its goals, but more often than not it made me wish, instead, that I were reading the book that it could have been. I recommend it only moderately, mostly on the basis of what it tries to be."},{"Title":"True Stories: Mystery","review":"Short stories in this book include the disappearance of Amelia Earhart, ghost stories, UFOs and other really strange things."},{"Title":"National Geographic Guide To Scenic Highways And Byways","review":"When I retired a friend gave me a copy of this book and we have been gratefull to him for introducing us to it.

What a great read. I read a review where someone said this book was a piece of trash. Obviously, the person knows little about the stylistic techniques that are weaved in works to make them deeper and more meaningful. I have just completed an in-depth project where I was required to choose a book, analyze every aspect of the story as I read, and present it to the class, pointing out literary techniques and my analysis of each technique. I chose The Handmaid's Tale because I had read it before and loved it, but I wanted to reread it very carefully and look at all of the hidden meanings. I had no idea what I was in for. The first time I read it, I loved it just for the story; the whole Gilead concept was just so intriguing. This time, I loved it for how deep the significance of every little thing in the book is, which is something I had missed the first time. Atwood has to be a genius to be able to coalesce all of the underlying meanings, images, allusions, and recondite symbolism that is waiting on every page. Things like reason for the red outfits are obvious, but before careful thinking and analysis I was unaware that such things as the flowers in Serena Joy's garden and the egg that Offred describes just before the Birthmobile arrives represent much intricate, deeper ideas and desires. This book should be appreciated if not for the plot, which is entertaining in itself, then for being an excellent example of a work that subtly weaves together an excellent &quot;Level III&quot; meaning that can only be appreciated by the most erudite and interested readers."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"It's been years since I've read this so please bear with me. I'm not here to debate the literary value of the book. Initially when i read the description on the back cover i was intrigued. However, I actually became so annoyed that I returned it to the store. For one thing, of the reviews that I've read people seem to keep forgetting that the very first and last chapters (or the epilogue and prologue....as I said it's been years since I've read it so i don't remember how they were labeled in the book....) are happening even further in the future and the story part of the book is supposed to be a recording of one particular woman's experiences in the past that a council is listening to. So technically for those people the story is part of their history. And so, my annoyance with the book began early:What initially happened to drive this part of the US to such extremism? (and since for some reason *eyeroll* there seems to be a weird debate on wether or not this is an anti-Christian book....for the record i'm agnostic and couldn't care if these extremists were christian, muslim, shinto, hindu or zoarastrians.....they were extremist nutcases pure and simple. Perhaps whatever caused the apocolypse in the first place screwed with their heads...) I'm assuming (since the council members discussing this \\"recording\\" hint at it) that there was some sort of nuclear war/bomb/whatever that plunged the country into chaos or a post apocolyptic state and somehow these extremists took over. It's mentioned numerous times that the women (ALL the women even the handmaidens....) are not necessarily assured of their fertility. The Aunts and wives of the commanders are too old or because of whatever happened have been determined that they are NOT able to have children. The handmaidens talk about when or if they do become pregnant whether or not the baby will become a \\"shredder.\\" What does this mean? What has to be wrong with the baby for it to be considered a \\"shredder?\\" and if it is a \\"shredder\\" what happens to it? (besides what i'm assuming is the obvious b/c of what they are called....) And since this aprticular handmaiden is able to remember her former life before all the chaos what would even compel her to just give in? It seems to me that this is just a small part of the US...and who are they fighting that this has become a military state?And, seriously, how in the world were these extremists able to convince these people that this way of life was the way to live? I would also think that some intelligent people amongst these extremists would try to consider the effect this type of \\"breeding\\" would have on the human gene pool? Why is it just the old men that are allowed to have sex with the handmaidens? I'd think the fact that there are still young men around would HELP because young men are supposed to be more virile.Just thinking about this book makes me wish I had never read it. Most of the time while reading this book I felt completely confused and found myself saying \\"wait? what? why is this happening again? what is the reasoning behind this again?\\" BLEH!!! I felt like there just wasn't enough background information about the time and place to get a good understanding about the story in and of itself. And why even bring in the epilogue and prologue if you aren't going to elaborate on the future...why are they even studying these \\"recordings?\\" I don't know if I would recommend this book to anyone which is why I decided to give it two stars. Perhaps others out there can see more into it than I can and would find the book interesting. But, if you're one of those people who need to know how and why like me, I doubt you'll like this book.Oh and since some people delight in pointing out others grammatical and spelling mistakes; I have two young kids and have had very little sleep over the past few weeks and find forming a coherent sentance and/or thought taxing. So, if I've spelled something wrong or I have a grammatical mistake or have forgotten to capitalize a pronoun....I DON'T CARE!!!! I also ramble...which is quite obvious now. :) Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaid's Tale is an ambitious work that deserves its place on the shelf next to 1984 and Brave New World. It is a personal story about a woman stripped of her human rights, torn from her family, and forced by the state to act as a surrogate to the wives of elite party officials.Atwood's novel differs from other classic novels about dystopias, in that it places its focus almost exclusively on the role of women in society. In fact, the world presented in The Handmaid's Tale is little more than a backdrop, enabling Atwood to explore societal attitudes about women, sexuality, and religion. The oppressive theocracy depicted in the novel isn't meant to be dissected and analyzed. Debating whether or not a Christian theocracy like this could ever rise to power in North America is missing the point. The question posed by the novel isn't \`could this happen here?', but rather, \`what if it did?'Unlike 1984, in which Orwell shined a harsh light on the machinery and inner workings of totalitarian governments, Atwood is intentionally vague about how Gilead comes into being and how it holds power. The handmaid in the novel, Offred, is not intimately aware of the workings of government, nor does she make any effort to sabotage it. She isn't a hero. She is simply trying to make it through another day. While she does take risks in the novel that place her in jeopardy, there is nothing altruistic about them. The risks she takes are purely selfish, but completely human.Atwood is an extraordinary talent and The Handmaid's Tale is perhaps her most accomplished work. This novel is insightful, provocative, and thought provoking. The novel's first-person narrative is filled with humour, irony, fear, regret, guilt, - but most of all - a deep underlying sadness. Despite living in a world where she is little more than a commodity, where her usefulness will inevitably be exhausted, Offred maintains her humanity - flaws and all. It isn't clear what happens to her at the end of the novel.Even her fate, it seems, is beyond her control."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"There are several well known dystopian works in recent fiction, yet I am aware of none that tackle the issue of sexuality and femininity as does the Handmaid's tale.Many of us who don't live in a theocracy have read about the plight of women in such places as Afghanistan or Saudi Arabia, and to most of us, I think, it feels as though it's a world away from our lives and the way we look at women and their freedoms. What Atwood does masterfully is create an utterly believable scenario for a totalitarian, religious regime to take power in the U.S. and completely undo the liberties of women in favor of \\"security\\" and \\"national interests.\\" In all, Atwood has westernized the story of the removal of womens' rights in Afghanistan, a country that at one time was relatively liberal in its treatment of women. Atwood shines a glaring light on the dark side of the politics of religious fanatacism in the U.S. particularly, and carries the ideas of biblical fundamentalists to a logical and terrifying extreme.Any work capable of doing this in novel form is an accomplishment. But, Atwood goes the distance to create an intensely readable text, sharp dialogue, incisive acumen on the part of the book's heroin, Offred, layers of imagery and symbolism, and in a few places, both humor and horror.My only gripe is minor. Sometimes, Offred rambles and I'm not sure what Atwood was trying to do when she wrote certain passages that drifted toward glibness. Once in a while, it felt as though she was trying too hard to play association games with language--like she was writing a poem rather than prose.Even so, this is a feminist work in top form, but its appeal absolutely doesn't stop there. This is one of those books that I think everyone should read. It's that good."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Started this late last year during banned books week, but gave it away before I finished reading it for BBW. A fellow bookcrosser sent me another copy.This is the story of a future dystopia where women are treated as second-rate citizens with no rights and a choosen few, the handmaids, are only valued because of their ability to conceive children. The women are separated into classes, but still the women in this story have been robbed of their voices and their rights.Women no longer have sovereignty over their bodies. They are no longer allowed to read, own property, money, anything. The story is told through the eyes of Offred, a handmaid, who can still remember the time before.The handmaid's job is to bear children for the Commanders and their Wives. They're seen as \\"valued assests\\" of their country, but it's obvious that most of the other women in the society, especially the wives see them as nothing more than whores.These women are brainwashed, led to believe that many things we see as an assault on women, such as rape, is really the women's fault. They wanted it. They deserved what they got. It's horrifying reading about these women being treated like animals.While the story is largely about the handmaids, Offred's observations of the other women in the society show you that they're really all trapped, regardless of status. They're all treated second-rate, yet instead of banding together, they buy into the propaganda that women should be seen and not heard.Offred doesn't just tell the story of the handmaids. She tells the story of her life before becoming a handmaid, how she became a handmaid, people she remembered in her life before, the way life was before. It's all intricately woven together in one tale.I haven't read a story in a long time that's haunted and chilled me like this story. I'm an avid horror reader, but the story of this society really disturbed me. It left me with a lot to think about, and the ending itself was haunting."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I dunno about you guys, but I'm moving to Canada.

The way I saw it, the guys had it just as bad as the women of Gilead. At any rate, there were more men hanging on the wall than women.

It's chilling because, unlike similar novels, such as Orwell's 1984, &quot;The Handmaid's Tale&quot; is not very far fetched. In fact, it's a very possible result if the current trends in America continue. We see the very dire consequences of anti-American trends such as &quot;The Patriot Act&quot; and the breaking down of the barriers between Church and State. The future described by Atwood here is the natural extension of these trends. Atwood wrote this novel 20 years ago, yet she was visionary enough to see the trends.Atwood slowly reveals the &quot;mystery&quot; about what is going on. This technique holds our attention and builds our sympathy for Offred (the handmaid) and the other oppressed women in Atwood's post-Ashcroft/Bush world. We see things from Offred's point-of-view. We also have access to her memories of a not-so-distant past when Americans still could enjoy such things as liberty, religious freedom, privacy and safety of life.The victimization of women; the dire consequences of destroying the environment to the extent that the very ability of the human race to procreate is jeopardized; the tearing down of the boundaries between religion and government -- the result is future that is dark for the individual. When life gives you lemons, make lemonade. Well, those in power take a bad situation (that they,themselves, created) and turn it to their advantage. They make lemonade for themselves and spit the pits back at the citizens, particularly at fertile women. Right-wing religious fundamentalists turn democracy into theocracy. The ironic result is a perversion of the very Christian values that, today, fundamentalists impose on people who may have different religious beliefs than they have.Part of the power of the narrative is the revelation that the events leading to this dark, dystopia are recent events. The characters have lived in a free America and remember it. The transformation happened, if not overnight, very quickly. &quot;Temporary&quot; laws are passed that limit certain freedoms but, not only are these &quot;temporary&quot; laws never repealed, they become increasingly totalitarian until even having thoughts about freedom and rights becomes a crime. (You are either on the side of those in power or you are evil, on the side of &quot;bad guys&quot; and do not deserve to live.) Although Atwood created this fictional world decades before the &quot;Patriot Act&quot;, she paints a world that is ruled by laws that, like the &quot;Patriot Act, are designed to eliminate liberties and put the quality of American lives at risk.We live in the times that preceded the changes remembered by &quot;Offred&quot; (the handmaid). Our children and grandchildren may very well live in the times that Offred and the other handmaids find themselves in.&quot;The Handmaid's Tale&quot; is a moving, gripping story, but also a very important story."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Many reviewers have said this can never happen in America.They have been disillusioned.

I only kept going, because the book has such a good reputation, I figured it must get better. I did have a hard time with the books writing style, however, the final chapter of the book, which masquerades as a \\"historical notes\\" appendix put everything into its proper perspective. I have seen a few people suggest that they didn't read this final section, and that is a huge shame. This final chapter is the thing that ties everything together. Suddenly, the book that I had felt was a little bit stilted came alive. In hindsight, it is an amazing read, and I have a feeling that I will give it another read through sometime in the future. Overall, a very interesting book, stylistically AND thematically."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Margaret Atwood's writing style reminds me a bit of Sharon Olds'. It's layered, intricate, full of metaphors, similes, and deeper meanings. Reading this felt like reading a really long poem. The language was gorgeous and the poet in me couldn't get enough of it.The emotional part of me loved this story; the logical part hated it. I don't know that I've ever read anything that I both loved and hated at the same time. The result was that it twisted me up, made me feel both hot and cold, hard and soft, strong and weak. Probably that's why I found it so disturbing.On the story telling end, the details were amazing. The descriptions of everyday life made me walk in the protagonist's shoes. Her feet were mine as they walked down the concrete sidewalks, pulled aside her curtains, sat on the window seat with the word \\"Faith\\" embroidered on its cover. Her confusion, her sadness and desperation made the whole thing feel very real. But on a logical level, I know that educated women are not so easily indoctrinated, that people in developed nations are not so easily controlled, and that in this day and age the people of the United States would never sit idly by and watch as over half the population is oppressed.There was much in here about \\"multiplying and replenishing the earth,\\" but for a society so hell bent on this goal there was a lot of forced sterilization, fruitful couples broken apart, and virile young men denied the chance to reproduce. For a society that preached the sanctity of life, there was an abundance of throwing it away: babies labeled unbabies, women labeled unwomen, and older women shipped to what can only be called \\"death camps.\\" I also had a hard time believing that the men in charge of this society would be so quick to face the economic implications of ousting all women from the work place.There was a lot of violence and outright brutality in this story, which I attributed to the author's view of the nature of men. I could be wrong about that as I have no window into the way the author lives her life. I do, however, have this paragraph from page 171 and 172: \\"Moira was always more logical than I am . . . she'd decided to prefer women, and as far as I could see she had no scruples about stealing them or borrowing them when she felt like it. She said it was different, because the balance of power was equal between women so sex was an even-steven transaction.\\"I used to hold to this kind of logic myself, that women are equal to each other and men see themselves as the superior gender. It explains a lot of domestic violence and why so many women are battered by boyfriends or husbands. It does not, however, explain the violence in homosexual relationships or the many situations where men are abused by women. I used to think these situations were few and far between. Then I met a battered husband and made friends with a woman who didn't have the strength to leave her abusive female partner. These people need a voice, and believing all power inequality is a direct result of gender inequality does not give them one.While I respect that there are many oppressive patriarchal societies still in existence today and that the story here is based in this type of society, there are also matriarchal societies in our human history: the Minangkabaeu, Mosuo, and Taureg to name a few. And I can't image that women are any less prone to abusing power than men. There was a lot of twisting around of scripture in this book, and use of positive things like \\"traditional values\\" or \\"family values\\" painted in the worst possible light. There was even mention of mothers not being appreciated as a reason for the men in charge of this society to force all women into a role of servitude. I found this seriously twisted.Again, a disturbing read. Recommended for anyone who loves poetic language."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"For me, reading about dystopian societies is no fun, but that's the point. It is disturbing, and gets you to think. I loved the author's style of relating the thoughts and memories of her character...it was very realistic in the \\"stream of consciousness\\" way things flow, which offered a lot to think about in the way people react to extreme situations. I read for a book club, and it is a good book club pick. As far as being hate literature against Christianity, I think that such a view misunderstands and misses the point of the story. Dystopian stories are meant to point out the potential disaster, folly, or weaknesses of any ideology carried to extremes, how any good thing can be warped. I don't think the author, or most readers, would view it as an \\"expose\\" of the real nature of Christianity... it is meant to be a grotesque mutilation, and the vileness of that mutilation is meant to get you to THINK. It is to help us understand and be vigilant against the real potential of ANY belief or ideology being turned to ugly ends. Human nature is to be blind to the potential follies or abuses of their own cherished beliefs...and that is where the potential for disaster lies. Those aware of potential follies and their ugliness, will be more vigilant against it, quicker to defend against it."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"\\"Male supremacy has kept woman down. It has not knocked her out.\\" - Clare Booth Luce\\"I'm sorry there is so much pain in this story. I'm sorry it's in fragments, like a body caught in crossfire or pulled apart by force. But there is nothing I can do to change it.\\" - Margaret Atwood \\"The Handmaids Tale\\"Margaret Atwood's 1985 satirical and shocking glimpse at a theocratic dystopia future where women are reduced to baby-making machines (among other things) definitely is thought-provoking and an overall absorbing read. Atwood paints a very grim, bleak future indeed, and while I found the plot to be a bit unrealistic, at least in today's Western world, overall I did enjoy the story and grasped most of her messages. Of course the main message being - watch out for that Fundamentalist, hard-core right side boys and girls or nightmares like this are bound to plague us in the future! The way Atwood relates this message is a bit extreme in my opinion, but sometimes we need a quick, stiff kick in the pants by extreme points of view to draw us back toward the center again (i.e. Ayn Rand, Karl Marx, Dr. Seuss, et al...).\\"Whatever will be silenced will clamor to be heard, though silently\\"This is my first stab at Atwood, it was between this and \\"Blind Assasin\\" (which I also heard wasn't too shabby). You really have to \`open up' your mind when reading this story, and anyone who is leaning too far right probably will either trash it or end up needing some Mylanta after they are through. She is not that sympathetic or that kind towards men, but since I enjoy such avant-garde writers such as Bukowski and Fante (who are many times overtly and crudely misogynistic) I would be quite a hypocrite if I were to fault her for that. However, when it is all said and done, although the subject matter shocked, confused, and annoyed me at times, I can't help but to admit that I really enjoy Atwood's poetic, powerful prose.Overall, I have no regrets reading this fragmented, funereal, futuristic fable. As I stated above, my thoughts were positively provoked! I guess I am living proof that you don't have to be a feminist (they wouldn't let me sign up no matter how I much I begged!) to enjoy this one. I also think it's safe to say that the story of Offred is an important one. Women may not live like this here in this country, but in other parts of the world... Hence, Ms. Atwood isn't that far off base, at least not far enough to get picked off the bag! For this nightmarish vision of hers isn't really that far-fetched when you consider how certain societies allow their religious/political beliefs to interfere with common sense, dignity, and justice.Another novel that I enjoyed a lot more than I expected to! But again, tread with caution, and open that mind up. After all, it beats reading Andrea Dworkin any day of the week!"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This novel was originally billed to me as a female version of 1984. I now know that serves a great injustice to A Handmaid's Tale, only because it stands alone in its own right.Margaret Atwood paints a chilling picture of a disutopic theocracy where women are confined to a few set roles, and the &quot;lucky ones&quot; become vessels for the rich to mate with. The plot revolves around Offred (&quot;of fred&quot;) a former revolutionary who is entrapped in a life as a handmaiden while her daughter is raised by strangers.Offred is a character that I felt I could relate well to, as she is a woman with great courage, intelligence, and defiance. Her ultimate uprising against the family and government that oppresses her is the epitome of heroism. Although the novel ends rather abruptly and ambiguously, I think that the ending works best as it gives the reader a sense of both realism and hope.The oppression reflected in this novel is quite plausible, despite its critics' claims to the contrary. Modern Islamic countries are already halfway to the state of oppression A Handmaid's Tale represents, and it is foolish to think that they may not go further in a totalitarian direction. This novel serves as a warning to both women and men to keep check on their own individual rights."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I've been wanting to read this book for many years but my to-read list is so long that, unfortunately, it kind of kept getting pushed further down the list. In a way, I'm glad that happened because I found it shockingly resonate, given the current political climate in this country. I would have enjoyed it and found it disturbing had I read it years ago, but it would have seemed a little unreal. I would have been a little too convinced that things had changed so much that its events would seem rather outrageously unlikely. Now, I'm not so sure. Warning: minor spoilers ahead.First off, it must be said that Atwood is an extremely literary writer. She weaves her tale with beautifully constructed prose. I could see how reader who prefer a more straightforward approach might find this a little frustrating, but for me it just provided an even more stark contrast with the harshness of the world in which Offred finds herself. I also thought it spoke of survival, of a human mind's determination to find loveliness in the most dire of situations, of the human struggle to live on even when death might seem more merciful. It also enhanced the inherent confusion of Offred's situation. She's in the same world she's always known and yet it isn't the world she's always known. I'm getting a sense of that right now, courtesy of modern American politics.I really enjoyed the world building in this novel because it just felt so feasible. In my view, a good dystopian is basically an analysis of the slippery slope, which is exactly what Atwood has done in this novel. She illustrates perfectly how one toe over the line seems okay, which then leads to new lines being drawn and, before you know it, you're at the bottom of the hill. I liked how Offred's recollections of the past were fragmented because they helped enhance the idea of a gradual breakdown. As Offred takes baby steps into her memory, the reader sees how the new regime took baby steps toward instituting their new religious police state.The characterization was also very rich. Atwood has not only created a whole universe, she has also created a mini-universe around Offred. In fact, the bulk of the novel centers around Offred and her experiences; rather than the world as a whole, the reader sees how the changes of Offred's world have affected her in particular. I found this to be a very nice device because it sets up a juxtaposition of the dehumanization of Offred's world against the very human character of Offred herself. This lends the novel even more impact. By letting the reader into Offred's psyche, it is possible to get a much better view of just what the changes mean.I also thought this made it much more apparent how the changes affected not only Offred, but her family as well. Certainly the injustices committed against Offred are very grave, but the injustices against Luke and other men like him are grave as well. The world is only a utopia for those in power and, really, isn't this always the case? In our current state of affairs, the privileged are far better off than the poor and the powerless, and the gap only continues to grow. Atwood has illustrated the idea of being careful what you wish for because you just might get it.My only real criticism of the novel was with the epilogue, which I didn't feel added much to the narrative. I think there was something to the idea that the United States lost its primacy and was little more than a footnote to the rest of the world, but I thought it took away from the impact of Offred's final scene. Still, I found the book so haunting, so alarming, and so masterful that this had little effect on my overall impression. This is an important work, one that is very significant not just for feminist scholars but also for anyone who is concerned with the impact of the erosion of civil rights."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The &quot;Handmaid's Tale&quot; offers much food for thought, especially if you read it post-911, with the knowledge that Margaret Atwood wrote it pre-911.On p.174, Atwood writes, ?It was after the catastrophe. . . They blamed it on the Islamic fanatics, at the time.? Then further down on the same page, she writes, ?That was when they suspended the Constitution. They said it would be temporary. There wasn't even any rioting in the streets. People stayed home at night, watching television, looking for some direction. There wasn't even an enemy you could put your finger on.?Atwood may or may not be a visionary. It's just that her ideas, ones that could once be dismissed out of hand, now ring true. It's for this reason that Atwood?s story has become timelier than ever in our post-911, increasingly totalitarian environment.The one genuine mark of a futuristic story is knowing the possibilities before they exist. Atwood convincingly applies her mark to &quot;The Handmaid's Tale.&quot;"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I had to submit a review here for my English class, be forewarned that there are spoilers.The 'Handmaid's Tale' was written by Margaret Atwood. It deals with themes of Dystopia's that were so popular in books such as '1984' and 'Fahrenheit 51'. It is labeled as science fiction, which surprised me as I read the novel. It is not at all like most Sci-Fi's you would read, with robots, time travel, aliens, or other such things. This book was labeled thusly because Sci-fi can also deal with social change, not just technological change. This book deals with what kind of occurrences could happen if the pollution problem sped completely out of control, and the human race became unsterile, with many birth defects as well. At the same time as this, an anti-feminism religious group takes over the government in a coup d'etat, and not only prevents the tide of feminist movements, but turns it back. Traditional attitudes about the status of women are enforced on penalty of death. Set slightly in the future (from the time the book was written) we are invited into a world where women are oppressed and degraded into mere objects to fulfill set purposes. To control other women, to clean and cook, and to breed. If unable to do any of these three things, they are labeled as \\"unwoman\\" and sent to the moon base to meet certain death while cleaning radioactive materials.The main character in this book is called Offred. It literally means \\"Of Fred\\". In this society she exists as a handmaid. Handmaids have one purpose in life, and that is to breed children for their \`Commanders'. Fred is the name of the man who holds her as property. Handmaids are only given to the ones known as 'Commanders', technically, they are the elite of this new society, the republic of Gilead. The Gilead is a totalitarian theocratic state, and has overthrown what was once known as the United States of America. The Commanders are the elite, so thus they are allowed Handmaids if their wives are unable to bear children for them. Since reproduction rates are very low due to radioactive levels, this practice was implemented. Once a month, when a handmaid is at the peak of their cycle (to have children) they must have intercourse with their commanders. During this time, the Commander's wife is also present, holding hands with the Handmaid while the Commander attempts to impregnate them. This sex is without feeling or love... in fact, passion is frowned upon, and intercourse is looked on as only a means to continue the species.I felt rather disgusted by this fact. That women could be used as mere things for reproduction was appalling. Margaret Atwood shows us what could happen if traditional views upon women are taken to extremes. The women are not only repressed in this way, but they are also under constant surveillance. In a subtle way, I believe that Margaret is trying to tell us with this fact that even though women could possibly be suppressed this way, they're spirits wouldn't die down for the need of freedom, thus they have to be watched constantly.The story is told through the eyes of Offred. She frequently slips into flashbacks, telling us of her past life and how events have led up to the point they are at the beginning of the novel. Offred used to be living with a man named Luke, and had a child with him. When their child was still young, the radicals who enforced traditional values took over America. Women were unable to work jobs, and slowly but surely all their rights were taken away from them. Those couples living together who were not married, or who had been divorced were separated. The Republic of Gilead saw such couples as immoral, and punished them accordingly.I felt rather sad, and found myself sympathizing with Offred as she told her story in a series of flashbacks throughout the novel. That she could be separated from the man she loved, and her darling daughter is cruel. Then to be subjected into the role of a Handmaid, I cannot fathom how she withstood such treatment. I feel that most women would have been like Moira (Offred's best friend, a feminist lesbian who escapes her role as a Handmaid). They would have at least attempted to escape. Perhaps I place overconfidence in the female sex, but I doubt truly that we would go down without a fight such as Atwood depicts in this novel. She describes how the women at her work were confused and scared when they were relieved of their jobs.The women of today give me the impression to be fighters. Surely, at least half the woman in the US would violently object to such treatment, and overthrow their would be suppressors, even with fear of punishment and death. Then again, this book was written when the feminist movement was just getting revved up. Perhaps Atwood feared that the Republic of Gilead could be Men and Traditionalists answer to women's calls for freedom.The Women in this novel deal with constant surveillance. They are always under the steady eye of a male, and even that of other females. Fear of punishment may drive women against one another if they show overt signs of being rebellious. Offred is constantly paranoid that someone may see suspicious behavior from her. She fears being declared an Unwoman, and being sent to certain death.Handmaids wear red clothing. I believe that this color was chosen for the Handmaids as it can symbolize fertility. Being Fertile is all that is important to this new state, as reproduction rates are very low. Also the color of red can be said to symbolize blood, or evil. Blood for the menstrual cycle, evil for the stigma attached to sexual relations by religious fanatics. The color on them immediately identifies them to the entire world, and their status in it. This is just another form of the oppression thrown upon women in this novel, as in fact they are sanctioned whores. Surely this makes each of them feel ashamed, as wearing the red habit reminds them everyday of something they assuredly wish to forget.All in all, I found this a very compelling novel. To think that such a thing is possible sends shivers of fright and disgust down my spine. Most likely, this is what Atwood was aiming for. She most likely feared that radical measures could be taken against females, and wrote a novel to voice her fears to the general public. I would recommend this book to all those interested in Dystopia and society's values on a whole. It makes you think and question \\"what if...\\". Is such a way of life preferable to the one we live now? Is society in such a sorry state that only a Republic such as Gilead could rectify the moral degradation we as humans have allowed ourselves to sink into? Frightening enough, there are people who think this, both men and women... Luckily, I believe that such a thing would never happen. First off, traditional values are slowly but surely going down the drain. As new generations come, their thinking changes. Years upon years ago, same sex marriages were not even thought of. In these days, states are passing laws even through much debate over the wrongness and how it is against all religious beliefs. In time, I feel that people won't even blink when they hear something like \\"Oh did you know, John got married to Fred\\". My belief is supported by the fact that sex is so freely thrown about now. Decades ago you were considered a wanton sinful person if you engaged in sexual intercourse before marriage. Now times, it is almost a given a girl or boy will lose their virginity long before they marry. As time goes on, beliefs change. That which was outrageous yesterday becomes commonplace today. Soon humans will have very little morals, but no one will remember the old ways and how wrong it is because of the subtle change in acceptance of these things over the years. And then again, women these days would never allow themselves to be treated thusly. Women each day are growing stronger as a sex and doing things which used to be classified as male only. We are on the front lines, defending our country... and beating a path to every job imaginable. Women have grown stronger over time, and we will continue to do so. I thank Margaret Atwood for making such a fine novel, and making me think."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I first read this book in college, and have reread it a number of times since then. The story is set in the newly-formed Republic of Gilead, what used to be the United States (and more specifically the story is set in and around Harvard Square in Cambridge, MA). Atwood incorporates a number of different and some might say disparate schools of political theory into this dytopia, including communism, Christian fundamentalism, and radical feminism, and shows what happens when normal citizens fail to educate themselves about ideas that may differ with their own. While many reader may consider this novel completely feminist or anti-Christian, a closer look reveals neither to be true. The Republic of Gilead twists Christianity considerably from its true message; in fact there is one passage where Baptists (who a lot of people think of as the &quot;most religious&quot; Christians) are being beseiged by the Gileadean army. And it makes a number of jabs at the goals currently held by some radical feminists, among them striving for a man-free &quot;women's culture&quot;. All in all, this is a book that gets off to a somewhat slow start but really grows on you after awhile, and by the time you get to the end, you want to pick it up and start all over again. The scariest but also most imspiring part was thinking about what we as a society can do to prevent this."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I read this book after a parent in my school asked for it to be removed from the shelves for \\"inapprppriate sexual content.\\" I was amazed that this book was originally published in 1986.

Other parts remind me of the goals of the Religious Right in our own country. The \\"sex scenes\\" are about power and control rather than the gratutious sex that so prevelent in movies, MTV and TV. I want by daughter to read this book!!!"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaid gives a glimpse into a dystopian world, where often backwardness takes precedent over common sense. Offred, who tells us her story, has had many of her freedoms taken away in the current society. Her role as one of the handmaids: to try to become pregnant to give Commander and Serena Joy a child. There's a \\"Ceremony\\" in which this attempt takes place each month. She tells us about the world of Gilead, narrating in a non-linear fashion from periods before, during and after the revolution that led to their dystopian society. Often thinking about her husband Luke and her child (and wondering about their fates), she, as well as others in a similar position, are being conditioned to \\"forget\\" what things used to be like. Those who breach rules are used as examples in the form of banishment, torture, or public executions. The roles of various members are set in a hierarchy of sorts, with the Aunts watching over the Handmaids. In this scary society, one must play their role, or suffer consequences. In a way, the human aspect of living has been taken away, and replaced with various \\"jobs\\" one must perform.This is my second read of Atwood and probably my last. She has an interesting premise (as she did in The Blind Assassin), but the way she goes about writing or achieving her point is a bit irritating. Reading Atwood, to me, is the equivalent of going over speed bumps. She uses stream of consciousness with flowery poetic description, often in the form of poetic contradictions (something like \\"it was the end, but also the beginning\\"), but somehow it just seems too cute, aimless and without depth. In The Handmaid's Tale, she also has a knack for pushing her philosophies in the narrative. Every author has an \\"agenda\\" to a certain degree, but I believe that the more entertaining authors are the ones who can successfully project their ideas in a subtle, nonintrusive way. Here, however, Atwood's Gilead is a bit too cartoonish and fanatical (using religion as her main catalyst). As a result, the story at points lacks realism or believability and seems to come across as agenda-driven. She tries to \\"wow\\" the reader with her style and creating a bizarre, cultish society, instead of giving more background to the whys. The Historical notes in the afterward shed some light on the society, but still.Not to say there aren't redeeming qualities to The Handmaid's Tale, or that there isn't a story to tell. From a dystopian perspective, it is cautionary tale about the dangers of having various freedoms and roles lessened or taken away all together. We see this when women lose their jobs and families, and suddenly the realization of a backwards society is upon them. Also, while I found the initial one hundred pages or so a struggle, eventually I became more invested and interested in Offred's fate, especially as the pieces of conflict came into play during the second half of the novel. Moira, Offred's rebellious friend, often criticizes Offred for being a \\"wimp\\", yet Offred does become bolder as she sees others, particularly those in higher status, bend the rules. So, in this sense, Offred became an interesting character one could readily identify with and follow. Some have complained about the apparently ambiguous ending, but I actually thought it was kind of clever, and seemed to be a perfect way to end the book.Still, if you are looking for dystopian novels, there are far better books out there (1984, Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451 are a few). Some have compared The Handmaid's Tale to 1984. While there are some similarities in their vision of the future, 1984 is in another league in my opinion."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This book appalled me- in a good way. I found the concept of a patriarchal dystopia where women are forced into inescapable castes so disturbing that this book still comes to my mind very often. Atwood did an amazing job portraying a society in which a woman's value is determined by her fertility, which leaves her with no access to education, career options, or personal goals. This book also portrays a great irony of the more zealous aspects of feminism; there is such a thing as being too protected from danger."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Margaret Atwood's book, A Handmaid's Tale, is one of the best examples of true contempory literature. Although the story is an excellent examination of the saga of one women's experience when placed in a society not only alien, but one in which she finds her worth dependent solely upon her \\"Viable ovaries\\", it also serves as a warning. Anyone who does not see the current worldwide cultural/quasi-religious fallback to not only an anachronistic view of religion, but a belief system teeming with an undercurrent of misogyny, should read this incredible book. However, in no way could one seriously argue that there is anything intrinsically radical, one-sided or irrationally paranoid in the book.A common complaint is that the book is demeaning to men. I cannot agree with that. Certainly, there are male characters which egregiously repulse ones sensibilities, but there are female characters that chill one to the bone. The protagonist of the book, known only by her present patronymic, Offred, never even personally blames men for the situation. If she judges, she sees both men and women as responsible. The fact that the only happiness she is able to find in her life amid what many feel is an egregiously horrible existence is her romantic/sexual relationship with the character of Nick, says much to discredit any alleged negative ideas concerning the author's attitude about men.Most importantly, the book is truly an awesome read. The beautiful prose flows seamlessly, carrying the reader much too swiftly to the end. This is one book that deserves multiple readings. Although I have read it easily six or seven times, I am always somewhat sad when I turn that final page."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I've many dystopian novels and this ranks up there with the finest.

While some of the content may be disturbing it is relevent to the plot."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This book has gotten less funny, and more scary, with every year as the world changes to come more in line with its \\"what if\\" scenario. It's a brilliant work, by far my favorite of Atwood's books.More than a commentary, it's populated with real people who seem to be living very real lives. It's easy to imagine yourself in this world as you read it. Wonderful/scary."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I can honestly say that The Handmaid's Tale was one of the most unique novels i have ever read. In the novel, Offred and all other women living under the Gilead society are restricted and must follow guidelines of what they can and cannot do. Atwood gives a vivid and moving depiction into the futuristic Republic of Gilead, in which women such as Offred served for the sole purpose to reproduction, due to the influx of diseases and toxics. Besides making it clear to the reader of the kind of helpless and hopeless life women like Offred are forced to lead, Atwood goes above and beyond: she digs deep into Offred's past in order to really get the full picture of the dramatic change and the vulgarity of such a society.I really haven't read a novel like this one for a long time: one that could move me and keep me turning the page long after my planned reading time. More importantly, it made me think. In many ways, Gilead is a glimpse of what our future could look like if we do not change our habits and learn to live with the consequences.This book really is a page turner. I couldn't get enough with the fluid, vivid language and Atwood so expertly incorporates. Often times, I actually felt as if I were in Gilead, witnessing the events in the book as if they happened right before my eyes. The novel is descriptive, but not wordy. It gives insight and perspective, but doesn't sound like a lecture hall. all in all, this novel has what every avid reader wants to read: an compelling and inspiring storyline matched with imaginative and vivid language that completes the story without sounding stiffy."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I usually don't care for these bleak, dystopian, post-apocalyptic novels because they just depress the hell out of me, but this book was outstanding. Although nothing much really happens in the first few chapters, the tension is palpable and conflict builds on every page, and there are smart little touches to Atwood's world that just add to the verisimilitude. I don't know if it's because I read Girl With a Pearl Earring first, but I was constantly reminded of that book because of the relationships between both girls, the respective masters of their houses, and the jealous and thwarted wives. This book is far superior however, and I understand how such a novel either made or cemented Atwood's reputation. On a side note, this book was banned in high schools in my area (I live in San Antonio) and students protested to have the book reinserted into the curriculum. I think this novel is far more valid as a cautionary tale these days than is 1984 or Brave New World, simply because of the religious fanaticism behind the new state, but it is sexually frank in a way that would make me a little uncomfortable with it being required as part of a reading list. Perhaps I am underestimating the maturity of high school students, however."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I'm in the middle of reading this book and have discovered a new respect for it. To explain, a number of people in our class were assigned this book several years ago when I was in high-school. Being a conservative evangelical Protestant at the time, I found the book both absurd and offensive to my Christian sensibilities. This is no longer the case.While I am still a conservative, albeit a Catholic now, the recent push in Canada and the United States among certain fundamentalist branches of Protestantism, Mormonism and Islam to legalize polygamy makes this book frightingly possible. Should anyone doubt this -- regardless of whether that individual be a liberal or a conservative -- I suggest he or she read this book alongside Andrea Moore-Emmett's \\"God's Brothel\\".The subtitle of this latter work could very well be the sub-title of \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\", namely, \\"The extortion of sex for salvation in contemporary Mormon and Christian fundamentalist polygamy and the stories of 18 women who escaped.\\"While Attwood's book is a work of fiction, the similarities between it and what Moore-Emmett has documented with regards to the mistreatment of women in fundamentalist-style polygamous societies are chilling."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"In the novel The Handmaid's Tale, by Margaret Atwood, the main character, Offred, struggles for independence as a woman, sexually and socially. She lives in a world in which the basic rights of women are taken away, and a power struggle over their sexuality quickly develops. Women have become objects of fertility whose worth is determined by the number of children they bare. It is a captivating story of not only the frightening possibilities of the future, but the feministic opinion about society.The book begins in the near future, when the world is in the midst of a war. The constitution has been suspended and women have become the property of their husbands. The book begins several years afterwards, when a handmaid named Offred moves into a new Commander's home to have his children. In the novel, handmaids are young, fertile women used solely for the purpose of having children for those wives who cannot. Confused in an asexual, male dominating world, Offred tells the reader two stories, one of her current situation, and one of her past. Atwood uses flashbacks and allusions from her past to emphasize the extreme division in Offred's two lives. The fact that Offred's real name from her past life remains a mystery is a constant reminder of how much of her true self she has lost because of her personal oppression. Offred lives for only one purpose, to procreate. \\"Each month I watch for blood, fearfully, for when it comes it means failure. I have failed to once again fulfill the expectations of others, which have become my own\\" (95). In a life without enjoyment, she yearns for her past, and begins breaking rules to live as herself. Regardless of the consequences, her goal is to break free and become the woman she once was again.Margaret Atwood's distopian story is a tale of the dehumanizing of women and sexuality. It provides commentary on the possibilities of the future, and the importance of standing up for one's rights. It makes one appreciate his or her personal freedoms and also makes one realize how quickly these freedoms could disappear. While the novel is enjoyable, it leaves the reader with several unanswered questions. Atwood does not directly tell the reader how and by whom the rights of women were taken away. It leaves us wondering whom Offred's frustrations are directed at. Perhaps Atwood purposely left out this information to prove the point that it is possible for anyone to take away a woman's rights.The story also leaves the reader questioning the characterization and motivation of men in the story. Their opinions on the situation are hardly recognized; the men seem to have no ideas of their own at all. Atwood portrays the Commander as a sleazy, sexually driven man who abuses his position and Nick as a sexual object for Offred. The reasoning behind the lack of the male characters' development is perhaps to illustrate the minimal amount of personality their society allows. Or possibly to emphasize the idea that men have become mere objects for Offred. None of them have much depth behind the outside faade, and we can only guess at the motivations for each.While Offred keeps the reader hoping she will overcome, it is apparent that she will never be able to totally stand up against authority. There are too many obstacles in her way and there seems to be no way out. \\"Ever night when I go to bed I think, in the morning I will wake up in my own house and things will be back the way they were. It hasn't happened this morning, either\\" (257). It is possible Atwood uses this hopeless pessimism to emphasize the fact that society's rules sometimes have no escape, except death. Or for instance the idea that it takes more than one person to challenge a system.The solemn yet minutely optimistic tone has any reader on the edge of their seat as he or she waits for Offred to break free as an individual and challenge the system in which she is a victim of. The two stories told at the same time, one of Offred's past life leading up to her \\"career\\" as a handmaid and the other of her present life is very effective. They convince the reader of the situation's injustice, especially since past her life and rights were taken away. Similar to George Orwell's 1984, The Handmaid's Tale takes us on a nerve-wracking, authority challenging journey in search of liberty from the social standards and rules the government imposes. Both stories use the idea that as hard as the authority figures try to eliminate the past, it will never go away. Any woman will be able to put herself in Offred's shoes and appreciate what they have, while at the same time sympathizing for Offred's situation. Atwood does an incredible job of making the reader feel frustrated and oppressed right along with Offred. If the story were told in a point of view other than first person through Offred, it would lose its personal nature and we may not be able to relate as well.Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale is a fascinating story of sexuality, feminism, and individuality. Her writing captivates us as we follow Offred, the handmaid, through her current life as an object of procreation. Atwood clearly makes a pointed statement about women's rights and sexuality as she fascinates us with the characterization of Offred. However, regardless of how enjoyable the read may be, the reader is left with unanswered questions. We can only guess at Atwood's purposes in her tale. The story, told through the combination of Offred's two lives, one in current day and one in memories, is effective to relate the story to the audience. Overall The Handmaid's Tale is a novel highly recommended to any reader willing to place themselves in Offred's shoes for a captivating journey toward independence."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I couldn't put this book down. Read it in 2 sittings, only interrupted by a night's sleep. The concepts are not so far fetched -- look at modern-day middle eastern fundamentalist countries -- and makes you think about liberties we all take for granted on a daily basis, and hope to God that our government and constitution can be upheld for all time to come.The stream of conscience narration style is fabulous. I found the writer's prose, as always, top notch. There are some truly beautiful passages, which I read again and again, just for the pleasure of them.A classic, must read book."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I have only read this once, so I can't give it a decent dissection. All I can give you are my reactions as a reader. I was disturbed by the things that happened in the book, which I think is great. I was upset by the emotional rollercoaster the character rode on, which I think shows how masterful the writer is. I was skeptical of the realisticness of the society created here, but I saw that it worked perfectly for the story the book was telling. I enjoyed the turn it took at the end, and how that put the entire book in a new perspective. I was disappointed that I did not get to find out certain things, and I recognize that disappointment as being intended by the author. She is a very skilled writer, and this is a fascinating, thought-provoking read. It is not an easy read, or escapist fiction. It is meat-and-pain reading."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This book was a thriller unlike anything I've ever read. Totally creepy and mysterious but unintentionally, it seemed. The author, Margaret Atwood, did a fantastic job of making the narrator somebody that anybody can identify with on a certain level. Well done. I won't forget The Handmaid's Tale."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this book. Honestly, from my friend's descriptions of the book I was expecting something completely different. I was expecting the world Offred lives in to be openly violent and brutal rather than one filled with subtle brutality, psychological warfare, and religious control. In my opinion, the world Margaret Atwood created is frighteningly believable.There were many subjects dealt with in this relatively small book, and I think they were all handled skillfully. The Handmaid's Tale deals with the power of religion, woman's place in society, man's place in society, and a struggle to reconcile personal freedom with the survival of people as a whole. It offers a lot of food for thought and, like I said, it's relatively small; a little over 300 pages, which is amazing, considering all the subjects covered.The best and most chilling part for me is that the narrator still remembers what it was like to live in the \\"old world,\\" where women could hold jobs, marry whomever they fell in love with, and be free. The flashbacks to her life as a free woman added a lot to the horror of how the world is now structured in the novel. My favorite part is \\"Historical Notes\\" added at the end (these are necessary to the novel -- read them, don't skip!), which gave the novel a hopeful tone. This, I appreciated, because it shows that humans are capable of rising above an overbearing, immoral government, no matter how hard they try to oppress people.Overall, I would recommend everybody to read The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood. I know quite a few people don't like it, but I really do think that it offers interesting subject matter told in an entertaining way. This is one dystopia I'm definitely glad to have read."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I'm normally a huge fan of dystopian novels. I read everyone I can find. This one I found merely average. There were a lot of things I would have liked to see, and even though it had an interesting concept, it just wasn't the best I've read.Offred is a Handmaid in the house of a Commander. Since the fall of the old government there are several new regulations. For instance, women can now only have a few roles. Wives, which are married to the Commanders and have the most power, although its minimal. Handmaids are the concubines whose only purpose is to produce children in a time where infertility is high. Martha's take care of the household. Aunts run things behind the scenes. And there is another group of lesser wives for poorer people. None of them have much freedom. For Offred she is on her final assignment and if she doesn't produce a baby horrible things will happen. But this assignment is an odd one. The Commander doesn't treat her as normal and the whole household has their own plans for her. Combine that with remembering her past when times were normal and it leaves her feeling depressed at the best of times. Her biggest worry is that she'll be caught doing something illegal, and there's plenty of that now to catch her on.For characters there were none I really connected with. Offred, despite being the narrator just doesn't pull you in to care about her. All the other characters are seen through her eyes and even her daughter from the past doesn't pull a lot of emotion.The prose in this was not to my taste. For having Offred being the narrator, it doesn't read like you would think someone would recount events as. The book moves fast too and focuses on uninteresting things when it could focus on more interesting things, like some of the other details about the new regime. I think that Atwood really limited herself when she chose to tell this story through only one character. There was so much more I would have liked to know. I felt the ending seemed incomplete as well.While I do like the idea I just don't think she executed it well. There definitely was room for improvement.The Handmaid's TaleCopyright 1986311 pages + Reader's CompanionReview by M.

The characters are deep and you get a fantastic sense of the mind of the narrator.

It is a true work of art that can stand on that merit alone."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I read this book because I've enjoyed some classic dystopian novels like 1984, Brave New World, We (Yevgeny Zamyatin), Fahrenheit 451; and thought this would be interesting for the same reasons. It was satisfying for the vision of dystopia it offers but it was more than just that. The narration, told from first-person perspective, was so strong in its power to paint the mood and thoughts of the heroine that I could feel her pain as a male reader. This is a vision of the future that is not made frightening by advances in surveillance or reproductive technology, but as a warning of what society can become power is seized by blind ideology gone mad. Perhaps it is the author's feminine touch that adds the unique viewpoint from which you will live the story. I am recommending this book especially to readers who are interested in political religion, feminism, dystopian literature."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Loved this book!

In this way, we come to know the world in which she lives now, and we also, through \\"echoes\\" from her past, in the form of flash memories, feel the poignancy of the losses she has suffered.Gilead is a republic in the northern areas of the former United States and is comprised of a society based on traditional values. Additionally, the residents have specific designated roles and functions. None can venture away from these roles/functions without severe reprisals. Gilead is structured as a punitive, restrictive, male-dominated society that also has a matriarchal component in the form of the \\"Wives\\" and the \\"Aunts.\\" The former control the households and the latter are the teachers, the ones who enforce the lessons.Throughout my reread of this novel, I felt even more horrified by the revelations of the narrator. Do I fear that some of what is revealed could come to pass? Do some current trends suggest a movement toward \\"fundamentalist\\" principles? Or has time itself wrought these kinds of fears, since nothing seems outside the realm of possibility?At the end of this tome, after the narrator has finished, there is a section entitled \\"Historical Notes on The Handmaid's Tale.\\" Narrated by a keynote speaker, in a symposium format, the tale is deconstructed and analyzed. I found this section quite intriguing, just as the whole novel fascinated (and frightened) me.I thoroughly enjoyed this reread of an important literary work, to which I award five stars!"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Women walk down the street in pairs, their vision and faces obscured by white wings, otherwise dressed from head to toe in red, speaking only to each other, and little more than idle greetings at that. They enter a store identified only by a picture on a sign, pay for their items with a token depicting exactly what it is then intend to purchase. They return home, passing through heavily guarded checkpoints where they must present identification. Once at their homes, they must face the jealousy, anger, and hatred of the Wives. They are the Handmaid's, women of childbearing years who have been confirmed to be fertile, valuable only for that fertility so that they may bear a child for the Commander's, the government officials who have charge of the Republic of Gilead, a mono-theocracy that exists within the boundaries of the former United States .I found this novel to be frightfully disturbing. At first what Atwood describes here seems to be an absurd, paranoid notion. But as you continue to read, the story told in alternating vignettes of the present and flashbacks to the time before the Reconstruction, she inserts just enough of reality to make you think that yes, it could happen. It was written in the mid-80s at a time when many second wave-feminists were worried about loosing all the rights for which they fought. Given that Gilead is controlled by an extremely fundamentalist sect of Christians, based upon the Biblical story of Rachel and Jacob, when infertile herself, she tells him to beget her a child upon her handmaiden, and the fact that there has been a recent upsurge in the political involvement of the Religious Right, this book seems to have gained a new relevance that had been previously lost. It is terrifying to think that anything like this could happen, but at the same time with the political environment of today and the complacency of many throughout the nation, there is just enough to make it seem possible."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I love this novel for its silent horror. Everything about it conveys the main character's lot in life. The story literally closes in on you the same way that her world has closed in on her. As with \\"The Penelopiad,\\" I feel like Atwood's story is needlessly relegated to feminist literature. It's so much more than that, both as a continually relevant social commentary and as a work of art. It'll never be the feel good read of your life, but the story never falls into hopelessness or preachiness, and that keeps it alive."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I LOVED this book!

The first time, I was in high school and found it on my parents' shelf. It manages to convey a deep, powerful message without being preachy. This happens through the development of a complex character and compelling story. It also draws enough parallels between the fictional world of The Handmaid's Tale and the rise of the religious right in the 1980s to make this world seem even more real."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This book is seen as a satire in my opinion and was labeled and instant classic. When I read it in 2000 it was in the classic section of the library. This is a topic about how a government can become too religious. It is good to separate church and state o prevent something like this from happening. This had adult topics in it about extra marital affairs, a married woman allowing her husband to impregnate another young woman and keep her as concubine. This reminds me of a cult or something which is a good example of what not to do and what the world would be like if we allowed fanatics to go too far."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaid's Tale presents a disturbing picture of where the world could go if controlled by zealots, but the style in which it is written held no appeal for me.Offred is a Handmaid, a fertile woman who is placed with a 'General' (Fred) and his 'Wife' until such time as she produces a child or is declared infertile and shipped off to work in the colonies where all useless individuals are sent following a coup of the US government by religious fanatics. Memories of her life prior to the takeover flash through her mind as she distances herself emotionally from her circumstances. Operatives of a secret underground railway contact her, making arrangements for her escape...or do they?The premise is interesting and unique, but the narrative style - where is the show, don't tell rule of storytelling? - made reading this story tedious. Atwood didn't even bother with formatting dialog to include quote marks, so at times you had to double check whether you were reading a thought or a statement. The pedantic descriptions got tedious, but I suppose I'm not the target audience for such literary work. I like my apocalypse/post-apocalypse to have some bang to it, instead I was reading a whimper."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Imagine the near future where power is overtaken by the religious right under the guise of protection from Islamic terrorism. Imagine the future where the roles of the women reduced to those assigned to them in Old Testament - they are no longer allowed to read, work, own property, or handle money. Imagine that due to the pollution and man-created viruses, the fertility rates are so low that the few fertile women (the Handmaids) are now a communal property and are moved from house to house to be inseminated by men of power under the watchful eye of their wives. Imagine the future where women can only be the Wives, domestics (the Marthas), sexual toys (the Jezebels), female prison guards (the Aunts), wombs (the Handmaids), or, if they are unsuited for any of these roles, Unwomen who are sent off to the Colonies where they harvest cotton if they are lucky or clean out radioactive waste if they aren't.Well, after you've imagined that, you can imagine very easily how much I was terrified by this book. As a modern woman, I am horrified by the notion that at some point in time I can become nothing more than a servant, a toy, a reproductive organ. The world created by Atwood seems too much of a stretch of imagination at a first glance, but if you just turn your gaze towards Middle East, how implausible this feminist dystopia really is?To say I am impressed by this novel is to say nothing, really. This book is one of those that stays in your brain and you keep coming back to it over and over again.Having said that, I have to note, that this is definitely not an easy read. Offred (the protagonist Handmaid) is in many ways a frustrating narrator: she is broken, she is passive, she is desperate and her only goal is to make it through another day. The ending is ambiguous. The narration is complex with constant switching from present to past and back. But it all worked perfectly for me.

Even though it was written over thirty years ago, the politics come through to me as very similar to some of the world's current governments. It is a hugely realistic fantasy book, one that has parts I can see coming true very soon. Margart Atwood's descriptions gave me a detailed picture of the hard, limited, and completely controlled world in which Offred lived in. The way she told her story made me think that she had so much spirit in her life before she became a handmaid, and to read the descriptions of her life made me think, \\"Oh yeah, I do that.\\" Or, \\"I dress like that all the time.\\" Things that we take for granted were things of the past in this book. The descriptions of places, however ordinary, were rich and detailed. I loved how towards the end of the book, the reader gets more of her story, and the whole thing gets involved and complicated, at least compared to Offred's life earlier in the book.I would recommend this book to people who like almost disturbingly real novels, suspense, or science fiction. This would also be a good book for people who enjoyed The Giver, but The Handmaid's Tale is much more advanced, and is probably not suitable for people under 12."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This book was wonderfully written, and lets your imagination take over, to create your own preception of Offred's future.

I have to agree with those who said it took a few chapters to finally put it all into context, BUT what is more frightening is how as far back as 1985 she forsaw the very events that have taken place. While at one point I wished for a larger overview of the future world she envisions, the very fact it is told from such a point of view however is more frightening when looked upon as how it might be for a person in such a horrific world.The Christian Taliban that currently exists in this country appears to be molded exactly from this book as though they took it to use as pointers when they begin to control the country. One can easily imagine trying to escape from America or as it is called in the book Gilead, to freedom in Great Britain or Canada. The worst of Nazi Germany being the best example when you see the SS officer walking slowly down the aisle of the train and demanding your papers.This book is an engrossing read and one would hope a better movie would be made of it than the one that was made 15 years ago.

Five years later, on a lunch-break trip to Borders to find something to follow Frederik Pohl's The Boy Who Would Live Forever, I saw it on a shelf, next to Stephen Chbosky's The Perks of Being a Wallflower. I grabbed both.For those unfamiliar with Handmaid's infamous plot, it follows Offred who is placed into servitude as a surrogate mother for legitimate wives when an act of terrorism disintegrates the American structure of government. The Republic of Gilead, a patriarchal theocracy, forms in its place, and all second marriages and relations outside of marriage are deemed adulterous and their female participants forced into physical or sexual slavery. Atwood's Gilead suggests that the resurrection of extreme religious fanaticism and its anti-feminist consequences are inevitable and inextricable.Reading the afterword to Handmaid is absolutely imperative to anyone wishing to understand its content. Atwood writes it as a diary reconstructed from audio tapes-a primary historical source discovered over a century after the end of the Gileadean era. For 20th and 21st century readers, Handmaid is meant as a warning. But labeling Offred's diary as a historical document serves other historiographical purposes as well. Atwood reminds us constantly that this is a reconstruction, that its contents are remembered and sometimes envisioned or dreamed. They may not have happened at all, and the way they happened (or will happen) is subject to debate. Atwood's awareness of issues and trends in historiography make Handmaid all the more compelling. It is a reconstruction of future events rather than a prediction. Interpretation informs events and vice-verse. In other words, we may already be living in the Republic of Gilead.Although Handmaid is a politically and historically charged critique, it is also a work of fiction. Style is at least as important as content. Because Handmaid is written as a reconstructed document, readers are often left wondering about the order of events. Atwood utilizes flashbacks and other temporal devices to infuse Handmaid with ambiguities and disrupt the continuity of Offred's story. While these add to its credibility as a \\"historical document,\\" they also detract from the story itself. Events that refuse to fit with any of the four primary timelines Atwood creates (one for Offred's \\"present,\\" one for the historians reviewing Handmaid, one for Offred's husband and daughter, and one for Offred's close friend Moira) become incomprehensible.Some readers might find Handmaid's moral and political overtones extremist or trite, but this should not deter them from appreciating the enormous effort, thought, and research that must have gone into its creation. Overall, The Handmaid's Tale is a compelling and quick read at 320 pages. 8/10."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"After finishing this book, I was surprised to learn that it was written 20 years ago because the overall tone and references to life before the Gilead regime are decidedly modern. I feel that the brilliance of this novel stems from the fact that Offred's existence prior to becoming enslaved as a handmaiden is eerily similar to that of many American women (educated, employed, a parent), trying to maintain balance between her emotional dependence on her relationship while remaining true to her feminist values instilled by her mother and best friend, yet so fragile everything is stripped in the blink of an eye. Additionally, her disbelief that her current circumstances are permanent, relying on the tiniest cues from others that not everyone is as indoctrinated as he or she appears.Atwood also portrays the underlying corruption of the pious (Commanders, Wives, Aunts) perfectly, which again mirrors certain aspects of our current society uncomfortably well. Furthermore, the hypocrisy of the elite where they predetermine the values of the (perceived) morally inferior lower class, yet behave as if they are beyond reproach. This ongoing theme in the book illustrates such an important parallel to the present day religious right. I was especially impressed by the ethical dilemma presented when Offred felt she way betraying the likely dead Luke by engaging in an emotional relationship with Nick.I could go on and on, but most importantly, this book is a must read for women and I highly recommend it to anyone concerned with the current state of affairs."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This was yet another book that was labeled challenging on a list that I found, so I read it this last weekend. I'm very glad I did, because it is another one of those eye-opening, cautionary tales--like Atlas Shrugged--about what can happen if you become apathetic to what is taking place in the world around you. It has been 20-years since this book was published and I am really starting to notice many of women's choices being taken away one by one, from giving pharmacists censorship over dispensing birth control, to overturning pro-choice laws and making it illegal to have abortions in many states. After reading this book, I realize that we, both men and women, need to do more to counter the religious fanatics of the extreme right. \\"Gilead\\" is taking place in different parts of the world right now, because people were/are cowed by others who had a power agenda and who decide(d) to interpret religious documents in obscure ways so as to prove religious precedence, hence justifying their actions."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"There is much to love about this book, and I'm going to bet that everything there is to love has been written about in any one of the previous 145 reviews.If there was one problem with The Handmaid's Tale, it was the ending, which left me disappointed. It seemed an easy out for Atwood...it lacked the same attention, love, and thought given to the rest of the book.Later, I'm still wondering what she thinks of her own ending. And I'm wondering if I'm supposed to not like it, if it was meant to make me wonder why it was done that way.That aside, I would - and will - certainly read it again!Homefront"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaid's Tale is the narration of a Handmaid in the Republic of Gilead, a dictatorial government not unlike that of Big Brother in George Orwell's 1984. Bit by bit, Offred (the narrator; we never find out her name) reveals to the reader the dire situation she is placed in, and as the story proceeds, more of the ugliness of human nature is revealed. In comparison to 1984, the Handmaid's Tale is more like the perspective of a common woman, who knows fairly little to nothing of the doings of the government. Unlike Winston Smith, Offred rarely, if ever, entertains thoughts of rebellion, but rather more often thoughts of suicide instead. Nevertheless, the pain and misery of her situation is evident to all.The novel is written beautifully, with a flowing style told in the first person point of view of Offred. She is an intellectual, and although lazy, is able to stay true to herself despite the crude treatment she receives from the Republic of Gilead. The characters in this novel are all very realistic, or as realistic as could be for people confined to a totalitarian government. Overall, this is an entertaining book to read and offers a different point of view than that of Winston from Orwell's 1984. It serves as a warning against the type of government presented in the story, as the common people can do nothing but suffer under the grips of the government."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"So this was an interesting book. This was my first exposure to Margaret Atwood. This book was good, but not in the \\"sweet story\\" kind of way, though. It was good because it gave me reason to think.The U.S. has undergone a military coup. The people who are now in charge want religion (their take on religion) to reign supreme. Women no longer have any rights and everyone is watched over by \\"The Eye\\". Each woman is assigned a role. There are Wives, Marthas, Econowives, Aunts, and Handmaids. A handmaid's job is to breed with the commanders, the Wives' husbands. This book is the story of Offred, a handmaid.This book is banned in some schools and obviously controversial. I feel it is reading meant for an older audience. This book really made me think about how any aspect of our beliefs can be taken to the extreme. In an interview, the author said that all happenings in the book were based on true events going on in our world. I found this comment both surprising and alarming, because the world in this book is definately the devil's plan. I guess we are not too far off in some cases. The 4 star rating is only because I found a few parts of the book a little slow and laborious.Overall, this is a thought provoking, if at times abrasive, good read."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Handmaids Tale is a bit like George Orwell's 1984. There's a place called the Republic of Gilead, where amrtial law is inforced. No one knows what happened to the U.S Government, all is chaos. Congress has been shot down, along with the president and vice president, and then martial law is inforced. Slowly, things start to change. There are no porno corners, no prostitutes, words are replaced by pictures and magazines and books are outlawed. Women are adudcted and taken to a school where they learn to become breeders. They are cut off from family and friends. A major theme in the book is gender roles being ephazied and freedoms being taken away. A women is on the bottom of the chain, while men hold high postitions in society. Because of polution of the future, sterility is caused in 99% of the population. The human race is diminishing, so women are assigned a man to get her pregnant. This is really unfair since most of them have Wifes and have to be present during the consumations. Women are only barren, not men. This is what the government teaches. Irony is expressed throughout the entire novel. The main character notices small things she misses, like soap, magazines, and love. Love is an espression not welcome in this society, to love is to be attached, and no one is allowed that. Especially not the Handmaids. Marthas are women who are servants, Handmaids are mistresses, and Wifes are there to share a household with the Husbands and help raise children, if any are born. Children are rare, and if a Handmaid has one, her life is saved. She is not sent to the colonies. Colonies are where the old women and feminists are sent, to pick up the toxic radiation and polution. You do not last long at the colonies. This book is hard sometimes to understand because it flits with flashbacks from the past to the future, but in all it's an okay read."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This novel involves woman's role in a society and how they can be altered in several ways depending on policies, issues, and how the society is run. The novel takes place in a society where the role of women is minute and their only purpose is to give birth or to get pregnant. The women are stripped stripped of their rights, such as:working, reading, or even going outside. They are taught by teachers to produce children and that this is their ultimate goal.

When I first read this book, I thought it provided a sort of modern and entertaining twist to dystopian fiction. It was well-written, seemed a little far-fetched, just far enough to seem really fantastic. Now that our president has signed an ammended spending bill that cuts off federal funds to states that enforce abortion-rights laws, it doesn't seem so fantastic anymore.

What puzzles me are the reviews by other readers who wonder about the meaning of the last chapter. Here's a clue: December 25, 1989.

It is extremely similar to George Owell's 1984, however it deals more with an an oppressed woman. The book follows the life of Offred (of Fred), a handmaid, which is a woman whose job is to live in the commander's house and hope to become pregnant. A handmaid's name changes depending on which house she lives. If her master's name is John for example, then her name would be Ofjohn. A handmaid gets three chances to become impregnated, if by the third time she does not conceive she is declared an Unwoman. She is deemed unable to conceive, the men are never questioned for their ability to impregnate, and so it is always the woman's fault. Throughout the novel, Offred talks about how her new life is, and also about her old life, her daughter, her husband, her job, her money, her books, etc. I rated this book with 5 stars because the seller gave me what I expected and the book itself was great. I really enjoy dystopian novels, so I'd recommend this book to anyone who does."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This is a science fiction book set in the near future, in the Republic of Gilead. Gilead is in the area once known as the US. It is a highly chauvinist society where women are oppressed, and all freedom is prohibited. The main character is Offred, a \\"handmaid\\" in the service of the Commander. If you read the book, you'll find out what handmaids' roles are. There was something about the feel of this book that I really liked, just the font and the way it felt in my hand. The story was also fairly good, though it was slightly confusing. There also flash backs, in which Offred remembers her past, when she had freedom, and a husband, and a child. The new society is supposed to be \\"better\\" for women, but it's run by hypocrites. Some high-class women are allowed to read, and though \\"sin\\" is supposedly abolished, the Commanders still go to brothels. It made me really angry, and this was a very sad book.

I don't always enjoy Atwood's style (The Blind Assassin was a brutal read, but the one novel she won the Booker Prize for; go figure), but Handmaid's Tale and Oryx and Crake are both excellent. They both do a great job of slowly revealing the intricacies of this future world and remain very believable. To tell the story, both use compelling characters who are isolated in their world and who have lived through the transition from the world we know to the dystopic one revealed early on in each novel. Having said that, they are very different from one another and explore completely different themes. Reading them back-to-back is not necessarily a bad thing: you won't have any sense of d&eacute;j&agrave;-vu!If you enjoy the dystopic novel, these two are truly original and can be placed on the same pedestal as the other classics (1984, Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World)."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The Religious Right has officially taken over and all women lose their rights. On top of that they are also facing a reproduction crisis due to all the toxins used. Because of this, any woman that is considered fertile (has given birth in the recent past) becomes high commodity and are \\"reprogrammed\\" by \\"Aunts\\" and sent to homes deemed worthy. The women are used by the man of the house in hopes of conceiving. The creepy way that it is required by the powers that be to conceive is hard to read because I just couldn't imagine human beings using another in such a way. Suffice it to say, the Handmaids (as they are called), are not well liked by the wives of the head of the household and they must tread lightly.The Handmaid's Tale is told from the POV of Offred and her life in the Republic of Gilead. After being \\"reprogrammed\\" she is sent to her new home. She, of course, remembers a time when she was had freedom and wore what she wanted and even had a job, a husband and a child. Now she is considered nothing more than a \\"womb\\". If she wanted to leave this service she would be stripped of her title and become unwoman and sent to the colonies to do manual labor. The way it was hinted at is that this is something you do not want. In fact, many a Handmaid has taken her life instead of facing the current future or the alternative.The Handmaid's Tale was a decent read and Atwood definitely built a scary world. I personally would have loved if there were some further explanations to the events that happened that caused the Religious Right to take over so quickly. I just wanted more from this novel. The whole time I was reading The Handmaid's Tale; it played out in my mind as an old black and white movie and I felt really disconnected from Offred. Worth a read if you like dystopian novels but wouldn't say it would be top priority."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Incredible! I was living in Cambridge, Massachusetts when I read this book. It's wonderful to walk around and picture the characters living their lives in their world and feel the difference walking in freedom.

The 'ending', is perhaps the most enigmatic conclusion to a novel I have ever encounted, and quite a bizarre method. However, call me old fashioned, but I find nothing more annoying then reading a novel, but not knowing what happened in the end.

Read this book twice, and you will be mesmerized by Atwood's incredible writing; the details suddenly jump out at you, and the mundane items of a domestic setting (a hard-boiled egg, a discarded needlepoint cushion) will take on new meanings, new shadings.

This woman has become a handmaid. A handmaid is a woman who is thought to be able to bear children. During this time, men and women are rarely able to reproduce due to the chemicals they were exposed to during the war.The handmaid lives almost as a slave in a Commander's house where she is required to consummate the arrangement on certain days of the month. This is a robotic act for both the handmaid and the Commander, but the Commander's wife is involved as well. The wife doesn't take the ceremony too well.The handmaid's lifestyle is still preferable to other woman, most of whom are sent to the \\"colonies\\" to linger until they die.The end of the book had a little twist, and the details were tied up nicely.

She is so gifted that she can turn a simple story into something that could potentially seem so real. In fact, in the 1980's, when this book was written, this same scenario could have happened. I believe that Atwood has written a precautionary tale for all of us who may not have as much of a clue as to everything going on. In the Republic of Gilead, a new form of government takes over, which is basically the combination of church and state. Over the years, since the Puritans came here, there has been an ongoing battle about whether God really has a place in our government or not. I really believe he does not, I am not an athiest in any way, I'm just saying his ideals should have no say in how we run our country. I believe that Margaret Atwood helped, in a miniscule way, to potentially stop this from happening to the United States in reality. Just think if we had handmaids, you yourself (if you're a woman) would probably be one, because I'm guessing if you're on this site you're probably not in your older years, looking for a child, and you probably aren't super well off in the financial department (I could be wrong), but still, just think for a moment, aren't you glad this story is around? I for one am, and I'm glad I chose to read it. Overall it is a great story. If you have any trouble understanding it or are just really interested, rent the movie, it helps, trust me!"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I was very excited to begin reading this book. I loved the premise and thought that it would be interesting, but as I began reading I was looking for answers that Atwood didn't seem to want to provide. I wanted to know how this society where women were allowed no freedoms and were torn from their families and friends came about. How America, once the land of the free became the land of the oppressed. Call me impatient but as I read every chapter that left these questions unanswered the more bored I grew with this book. Until Atwood began to slowly reveal the events that led up to the existence of such a society and it was almost like a punch in the stomach when she did. It is impossible not to compare the events in this book with the events of the last few years and how our world is slowly changing, not necessarily in this direction, but it definitely makes you see how anything is possible.I was only seven years old when this book was first published so I am not sure if Atwood was that prophetic or if the direction that this country was headed in was clear even then. I am sure the case is true more of the latter than the former. If you haven't read this book already I definitely suggest that you order a copy, it is worth the read. Personally I plan to pass my copy on to all of my friends and anyone else who may want to read it.

They took away most of the rights for women, like being able to have property or the ability to hold a job. Knowing this Offred and Luke fled with their daughter and attempted to cross the border into Canada. Stopped there, Offred never saw Luke or their daughter again. From there she would no longer be a person with feelings, just an object of pleasure, and the duty of a handmaid.The main character Offred meets Luke by having an affair with him. Luke divorces his wife and produces a child with Offred. They are caught trying to flee the country and separated. After being captured she was sent to the Re-education Center or the Red Center. This is where the women would be taught about the routine and duties of becoming a handmaid. When Offred finishes her training she is sent to the Commander's house. Weekly checkups are endured to make sure there are no diseases and after each checkup the handmaids go to the Ceremony. At the Ceremony the Commander reads to everyone from the bible. After this Offred and the Commander's wife, Serena go to the Commander's room. Offred has sex with the Commander while Serena sits up behind her and holds her hands. Offred is told by Nick, the Commander's gardener and chauffeur that the Commander wants to meet with her. They meet and Offred finds out that the Commander just wants to play scrabble with her. Time goes by and Offred has still not become pregnant. Serena wants Offred to have sex with Nick and just say that the baby is the Commander's. Offred and Nick begin to have sex on a regular basis. Offred travels secretly to a club called Jezebel's with the Commander. Serena finds out about this and she says she is going to punish her. Offred is waiting in her room when she sees a black van approaching the house. Nick comes into Offred's room and tells her that it is really Mayday members coming to save her. Mayday is a group that is trying to overthrow the Gilead. Offred leaves with the men and will never see the Commander again. At the close of the novel Offred says, \\"And so I step up, into the darkness within; or else the light.\\" Meaning, she does not know where her life will lead her from here.At the beginning of this novel this book seemed like it was just going to be about a woman that gave herself up for sex and continued to have flashbacks. It turned out to be about a woman that was transformed from a woman to an object fighting for survival. When I say she was transformed from a woman to an object I mean that she cared about life and Luke until she was turned to a handmaid. Since becoming a handmaid her life changes drastically. She now has a set routine of where she stays, what she eats and the tasks she is asked to perform. When Offred begins to develop a relationship with the Commander she is taking a huge risk. If she is caught by anyone, including Serena she could possibly be killed. Knowing this she still continues to go back. She is really in a predicament where she has no choice. If she goes and gets caught she is done for. If she doesn't go and goes against the Commander's request she will be punished. Either way it's a lose, lose situation. As the novel continues it seems like Serena senses that Offred is close with the Commander and tries to get her to sleep with Nick. Offred who has been longing to sleep with Nick abides by Serena's request. I call Offred an object because she has no say in anything she does. She must do as she is told or face the penalty. Just like a real life object she goes wherever she is taken does whatever she is told. This novel really keeps the reader interested because you find yourself always wondering, \\"What will happen next?\\""},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Of all of the novels about dystopia that I have read, The Handmaid's Tale is definitely one of the top few. There are very few that are written with a woman character as the first-person narrator, which heightens the sense of social commentary that leaks from each page. For years, women have been forced to identify with male first-person narrators and we've become quite good at it. I know that there are some otherwise intellectual people who have a hard time identifying with a main character unless he/she is of the same gender as the reader, and that may account for some of the negative reviews of this book."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I felt compelled to respond briefly after reading some of the other reviews here. It is a chilling and infuriating novel, due strictly to the society portrayed. The book itself, speaking in terms of quality and content, is wonderful. And altogether believeable. Allow me to paint you a picture...I'm reading the book on my commute to work in downtown Chicago. The story Offred the Handmaid, veiled, her life and movements utterly controlled by men. Women in her world are no longer permitted to read, express themselves, form voluntary relationships, or move about at will. It is a moving book, which creates such anger and indignation towards the dystopia portrayed. I look up at one point, and see a couple farther along the train car. The main appears Middle Eastern, well-dressed and looking stylish and appropriate for this country. The woman is draped in traditional clothing, with everything covered other than a narrow strip for her to see out of. Seeing her leads to me think about Afghanistan under the Taliban: women risk death by being seen uncovered. They can no longer attend school. Their every movement and action are controlled by the men in their lives, and a small slip-up could result in an awful punishment.The similarities between The Handmaid's Tale and real societies in our world are strong and disturbing. The premise of the book is all too plausible."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I just finished this novel, and I enjoyed it greatly. I read it, on my teacher's recommendation, for a term paper. The plot is engrossing, reavealed in bits and pieces. Read it slowly, like I did.

The story is interesting as a description of a alternative future, based socio-politico issues from yesteryear and continue today. I suppose some people might find the feminism issue thought provoking. As a woman of color, I am generally less struck by the feminism issue, experiencing the racial issue more profoundly anyway, and that society wants to have it all ways, is not surprising to me, as it seemed to be to the Handmaid and expect acceptance and cooperation from the oppressed. Nevertheless, as sci fi, it was an interesting read of a future history that one should beware."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

It is told in a first person narrative and by an admittedly unreliable narrator. This device lends genuineness as well as obscures details that might derail the story. Our narrator, Offred, is introspective and capricious. She is rebellious in her thoughts, but not her actions for much of the book. This gives us entry into the world she inhabits, allows for a building of empathy for her and a desire to see her escape from her situation. She also intersperses her tale, and it is noticeably a transcription of an oration, with meandering memories of \\"the time before,\\" giving more depth to the characters around her and informing us of how the world came to be the way it was. The most startling thing about it is that it's not too far-fetched. In fact, I think, today much more than the time it was written, you see (scarily large, disturbingly vocal) sectors of society clamoring for a return to the kind of values this fictional society enforces. It literally made me shudder. I'm pretty sure I'd kill myself if they took all my books away and told me I \\"couldn't\\" read (neither permitted to or capable of)."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Fear has been grasped in such a way, you want to hide but feel they'll find you no matter what.

From the very beginning there was nothing to really keep me going. I did not even completely understand what was happening for several chapters. I give credit to the author as she came up with a radical story idea but it was not the type of book for me. I did not enjoy reading about what Offred was forced to do with the commander. There were also so many questions of mine that did not get answered. What ever happened to her husband Luke? what about her daughter? The Handmaid's Tale is interesting in the fact that it all revolves around what used to be the United States. I think that the way it was written was another reason why i did not enjoy the novel. Some of the sentence structure and language confused me. Overall i think it was a good book but i did not enjoy reading it. I would recommend it for older people who are interested in politics."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Very disappointing after such epics as Life Before Man. The plot was complicated and character development was minimal. Disjointed prose made it difficult to read, as did the never ending time shifts. Atwood's ideas, although possibly relevant when the book was published, are now outdated in this post-feminist era.Surely the theme, although horrific, is not as bad as it seems? When their is a choice between sufferance of the living and the quality of life of future generations (and if there is to be one), surely this makes the issue undebatable.If you want to read the book, then good luck.

Half of pages are filled with one 'sentence' making it incredibly difficult to follow the unnecessarily long, winded descriptions of menial objects and detail.

What a waste of time - it was as boring and repetitive as anything I've ever read. I'm a woman and I suppose I should have identified more with the underlying message, but all I could see was the insult to my gender. I finished it ony because my daughter is taking a literature class in college, it was assigned reading for the class, and I promised her I would read all the books so we could discuss them. Had it not been for my promise, I would have stopped reading after the first 20 pages. Yuck! This is my first Margaret Atwood book, and if it's representative of her entire body of work, I'll never read another one."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"When I read this book for my English A level I was bored at best. The plot is contrived and without flavour, seemingly based on a Mills &amp; Boon novel about impossible love. The idea about Religions slugging it out for the control of the planet is entertaining, but not developed enough to hold my attention at least. The novel revolves around a boring character who constantly daydreams on dull incidents in the not so recent past and refuses to dwell on deeper topics. The logic of Offreds narrative is left to the reader to develop, so those who are ignorant to the feminist psyche are largely left in the dark, so all the fellas who even look at this book in their local library should read all books by Germaine Greer before turning the first page. Females seem to love the book as it represents all the trouble and strife that women fear the most, but men will see it as tripe. Much like Waiting for Godot, not much happens throughout the novel, infrequently peppered with observations on the savagery of those surrounding her. Overall, men will not like this as it is written for those who take opression of the masses as an immediate, serious threat to the reader. It is not a book which is to be read and feared, but rather to learn from and predict how one would feel in this scenario. An interesting portal into the female mind, a dark and vacuus pit."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I wouldnt read this intolerant tripe if it demonized the far left, or Muslims or the Tooth Fairy.Its one long poorly conceived political statement.

I'm startled by how bad this woman writes. I guess it's an interesting idea, and I'm sure it blows minds in a 10th grade English class, but my God what a terrible writer Atwood is. The prose is clunky, to say the least, and the dialogue is laughable. The symbolism is totally heavy-handed in the worst kind of way. It's also kind of dated, in that it's a Reagan-era work with an inteded audience of armchair feminists who get all up in arms any time a Republican gets into office.You could realistically write some depressing, apocalyptic dystopian novel about any social group if you wanted to; hey, what if China directed nuclear weapons at Canada and enslaved all Canadians? What if all Catholics had to wear scarlet letters and work the fields all day, by law? It's as theoretically possible as the right wing turning all women into \\"handmaids.\\" Hey, what's that you say, Margaret Atwood?? Far right-wingers are anti-feminist?? They're against equal rights?? Women already don't have equal rights as men?! NO WAY!!! I'm a moron, so I didn't know that! This book is like the People magazine version of feminism -- that means only idiots would take it seriously.In short, this book is for suckers, and I feel much stupider after having read it.

The far-fetched setting also has one reason for its creation - the same. Wherever the reader looks in this novel, he or she sees the uneffaced hand of the author, for this entire polemic exists exclusively as a pulpit for Margaret Atwood to pound out her bigotry against religious people.

I liked this book and when I first started reading it I didn't want to stop till I found out what was really going on in the book. I needed to know how the world came to be like this. It wasn't till later in the book that the author revealed how the change in the world took place. The way the book was written in a stream of consciousness way when it came to some of Offred's memories was interesting. In some ways it was intriguing but in other ways it left some details out of the book. Some things were hazy like what exactly happened when Offred tried to escape. I wish that the narrator could have presented these memories in not only an emotional way but in a clear, easy to deduct what was happening way as well. I liked the emotional tone of this book but I also wish the narrator was more involved or cared more. She seemed to let things happen to her rather than trying. When she started to learn about the underground I don't see why she didn't want to learn more or help more, for example.

Instantly I was hooked with in the first few pages, already brewing questions as to what exactly is going on and why things are as they are portrayed.

In fact I agree with Conor Cruise O'Brien's view from The Listener-'Moving, Vivid, Terriying, I only hope it's not prophetic'"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I had to read this book this summer for my advanced english class next year, and wasn't sure what to expect. I'm not a fan of Maragaret Atwood's writing style in this book, it doesn't fill in enough holes and the endings to some things leave you wanting a taste for more...which I guess is good writing but annoying anyways.The story is about a future life in which religion has taken over. All of lifes luxeries are taken away for the most part, especially for women. The narrarator of this story tells you about 3 different aspects of her life: Her past, including her childhood and her married life before the change... The time spent in a training type camp as she was groomed to be a Handmaiden... AND The current moving storyline...her present life. Basically she is enlisted as a Handmaiden, a woman that sleeps with an old powerful guy, in hopes she'll have his child as his wife is too old. She has a few chances to produce a child before she'll be killed. Her life is very restricted...no reading, writing, speaking freely, nothing that we have today would be hers really. ANyway she starts experiencing some luxeries...the old man she has to sleep for falls for her and starts giving her things, and taking her out. The wife of the old guy devises a plan with her to help her with the baby situation. Her shopping partner is an underground source. She even has a free affair with another man. Basically the story tells you about how the world changed from before, what the training for this life was like, and how horrible it is to live like this.If you are interested in taking a whole new look at that magnificent future you have planned out for you, read this book...however the ending left me most unsatisfied, and I wish more loose ends were tied up! I guess Atwood wants you to choose the final fate of Offred...oh yes I've figured out her actual name, it's June...there are 5 characters listed in the beginning and the only one not mentioned again as another person is &quot;June&quot;. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"I just finished reading Margaret Atwood's masterpiece 'The Handmaid's Tale.' The whole idea of a dystopian society is very unappealing to me. Of course after studying witch trials and learning about puritans, Atwood made this society where it is supposed to be the future, yet women are still being repressed by male dominated society. Theocracy should have been eliminated by this point in time. The color motif of different classes of women was very interesting, it made the female characters less flat. The satirical emphasis placed on government, religious right and women in general is difficult to comprehend.

Margaret Atwood's novel is exceedingly well written and the main character, Offred, is very compelling. I could hardly put it down even though it kind of made me sick.

Six stars for sure."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"When I read this story, I wondered what led the author to imagine this. It is placed in the future as a horror story but what it speaks to me is the unwed mother home and the nearly forced adoptions in the 50's and 60's in this country. I was there, I know.Substitute Sister for Aunt and you have the authority figures, described as childless or infertile, with a belief in \\"traditional values\\", possessing power over the other women, which is described as the best way to control the procreation of the women. They may not have had cattle prods, but they certainly had power. The outfits of the handmaids are actually described as \\"habits\\" and the headdresses look almost exactly the same as the Daughters of Charity headdresses, who managed many of the homes.What happened there? The handmaids were only allowed out two by two. Any girl that cried was considered a crybaby. Whose fault was all this? OUR fault, all of it 100%. The father didn't exist. Am I talking about the book or the home? Both. We were brainwashed with the nobility of \\"doing the right thing\\" by giving the child up. The adoptive parents were \\"saving us\\". All through the book is the religious and psychological propoganda they used to control the handmaids. When Offred's first child was taken away, they told her \\"She's in good hands, they said, with people who are fit. You are unfit, but you want the best for her. Don't you?\\" A phrase right out of the adoption agency.I was cowed too, until it was too late. Then I realized the truth. The rich adoptive parents paid money to the agency and the goal of the home was to take our children and give them to the adoptive parents. It was Commanders' families that had the power to inflict this on us. Any girl who refused was kicked out, a \\"bad example\\". I saw it happen. The girls were pitted against each other so you thought the problem was the other girl, when the real danger was being there at all.I read through most of the ratings on this book and I am surprised I didn't find anyone else who noticed this, because there are other birth mothers I know find this book traumatic. Maybe too traumatic to read."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Whatever one might else say about Margaret Atwood, there is no doubt she's a professional. She is a skillful, cunning manipulative writer. But whereas other writers use modernist techniques to reach a deeper insight, Atwood uses them to evade fundamental questions. Here are two examples. 1) At one point Offred has a meeting with the chauffeur who will impregnate her because Offred's master, Fred, is sterile. Atwood provides three versions of this meeting which introduces a note of fashionable uncertainty while hiding her inability to discuss real intimacy. 2) At the end of the book, Offred is being taken away from Fred's house. It is not clear whether she is being liberated or arrested, and the book concludes with a pompous academic conference that does not clarify the matter. The conference is obviously a joke on Atwood's part. The problem I have is that Offred could not have written the account that concludes her story until after the events took place, and where she would have a reasonable idea of what happened to her. Atwood may find it intriguing to leave the matter in doubt, but a real political prisoner would not play this sort of modernist game.In general, Atwood's dystopia plays on women's fears, but does not enlighten or elucidate them. She chose an easy target in attacking American fundamentalism, whose illiberalism, parochialism and paranoia make them fair game. But in her account of making women victims she is subtly stacking the deck. She uses analogies from Nazism and slavery which, on second glance, are quite tendentious. For example the regime comes about because Congress and the Cabinet have been assasinated and a military regime claims it was done by foreign terrorists. But are Americans really quite that naive? The imposition of a misogynist state supposedly happens step by step, sort of like the path towards the Holocaust. But it is one thing for Germans to fail to realize the fate of 1% of their countrymen and for Americans to fail to recognize the fate of 50% of their own families. Likewise, it is hard to imagine any modern state that would want to dramatically shrink the workforce and cut the literacy rate in half. In Atwood's Gilead, women are forbidden to read, an idea which Atwood obviously got from slave code prohibitions against literacy. But this ignores the fact that American Evangelicalism prides itself on bringing the bible to the masses. To prevent women from reading the bible goes against their fundamental principles. Indeed, renaming the country is another &quot;off&quot; thing, given the intense patriotism of American Fundamentalists. And why would they rename the country &quot;Gilead,&quot; as in &quot;there is no balm in&quot;? I can't help but note that Atwood does not take the demographic crisis Gilead faces with all due seriousness. After all, a 90%-95% sterility rate implies extinction. Most people would support conscription to fight off an enemy that would do that. Is conscripting women's wombs so really out of the question? It is at least an argument that should be taken more seriously. Finally Atwood does not deal with the fact that most churchgoers in Western countries are female. This brings in questions of complicity that Atwood simply ignores. Ultimately, this is middlebrow entertainment."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"This was a difficult book for me to get through. I felt like I had to read every page (waiting for something to happen that never did). I think it would have been great if it was a short story, but as a novel, it was just too longwinded. The descriptions of things just went on and on.I thought it would be more exciting. I have read numerous dystopian novels and enjoyed Hunger Games and Enclave. I think I was looking for something more like them, and this book is NOT. It is more like The Road but without anythign ever happening."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"The dystopian work, The Handmaid's Tale, written by Margaret Atwood displays many complex views and ideas of good and evil. Some characters in this work, although represented as evil, give food for thought, thought about our future on the earth and specifically in the U.S. Atwood deals with some of the modern ideas of misogyny, sex, and the possible future, by creating this dystopian work like her fellow dystopian novelist George Orwell.The first item of discussion from Atwood is that of misogyny. Although the role women play in society gives them no value whatsoever, women in this novel have a representation of the smarter more intelligent beings forced under the yoke of much slower less intelligent men. Men usually shown as dim witted and only lovers of sex and power ironically dominion over women. This example helps Atwood attain her goal of creating a feminist novel that dramatically exaggerate the way men and women already have \\"places\\" in society. This would create shock from the masses as they realize the potential for how the world could become.One way Atwood shocks her audience come through her explicit use of sex. Throughout the novel, Offred has multiple sexual encounters with several men, including a married man. This loose portrayal and approach to sexual intercourse does not seem unusual in the novel, in fact it seems expected. Offred's entire existence has its basis in sex. She works for the commander, or head of the household, as a handmaid. This consists of doing daily trivial tasks such as shopping and her main goal, to have children. Once a month, Offred must have sex or perform the \\"Ceremony\\" with the commander. These sexual encounters, specifically the first uses explicit language and detail.A dystopian novel has nothing new or unique about it in general. The idea has been replicated many times throughout history. Some dystopian, authors including George Orwell, H.G. Wells, Aldous, Huxley, and Ray Bradbury, all have good ideas, stories, themes, and plotlines. Compared to these authors Margaret Atwood does not particularly shine out. A well written novel in some places, effectively driving home her point. Atwood writes a convincing novel yet the unnecessary set in this novel somewhat diminishes the quality of the novel. Instead of creating this perfect, or rather not perfect, dystopian world, Atwood strays from the usual path to dwell on sex as the entire reason for this dystopia.One very effective method Atwood used to drive home her point lies in he darkness and despair in this novel. The utter hopelessness of the of The Handmaid's Tale and feeling of anguish shows the harsh reality of life or the possibility of life in the future.Overall The Handmaid's Tale qualifies as well written novel, but only well written as a despair, sex filled novel portraying a possible dystopian society. Although most dystopia works have some elements of these things in them. The Handmaids Tale emphasizes a few in particular. The misogyny of the novel has a sort of irony to it because although the view of women could be perceived as below and being controlled by men, the women actually have the intelligence and ingenuity. The novel adequately portrays a dystopian society. The good of this book does not outweigh the bad."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"While I found this book quite interesting, I have to say that for me, after all is said and done, it was also quite forgettable. Truly original and well written but not something I would read again or recommend to my friends. After reading the reviews for it I was expecting to be totally swept away and that never happened. Definately a chick book."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night","review":"Woah, I feel so emotionally \\"wrung-out\\" by this novel...this is probably not helped by the fact that I stayed up WAY too late each night this weekend because I couldn't put it down. I really knew very little about this story before reading it, and I was continually amazed at how eerily prescient (sp?) the premise is. I kept having to tell all of my roommates about it...and they kept asking \\"When was this book written again?\\" We were all continually suprised to see the copyright date as 1986. (I admit that I went back to verify that a few times). I mean, the way in which this religious fundamentalist takeover of the USA went down has SO MANY parallels to what has been happening in the US these past 5 years. A terrorist attack on the government that is blamed on islamic fundamentalists (in the novel this turns out to be not the case), people willingly \\"suspending\\" many of their rights as well as the CONSTITUTION in order to be \\"safer,\\" the army takes over due to martial law, next thing you know, women can't own property or have jobs, and then we're merely chattle. Eek!This was an excellent and chilling read. It was fun getting to discuss it with my mom afterwards. She read it when it first came out, and had thought it was this really freaky, crazy, impossible story. Now, as I recounted the plot, she said it was much more frightening because you can see examples of this type of oppressive-theocracy in several countries around the world, and you can see the seeds of possibility here in the USA.
