It will change the way I read forever.Two quibbles, however:1. Being someone who has a real job, sometimes I'm too tired to read well. I wish the book gave some advice on how to read when you're tired. Should you even bother? Or should you just forget about reading and go to sleep or watch television? What's worse: risking the sophomoric, or lapsing into the comfortable weekend reader who can't read syntopically because she doesn't have the time? The authors ignore people like me, except for a passing reference to the fact that being tired can make you a lazy reader, and &quot;that's not our fault.&quot;2. The authors devote an entire chapter to a wonderful reference called a &quot;Syntopicon,&quot; which has all the major classic works divided by subject and page number so that you look up a subject and then see what each work has to say about it. That sounds great, but darned if I can find where a Syntopicon is, or how to get one. Were they being facetious, or is that really what it's called? It's like getting a cookbook and all the recipes in it have this weird substance that no grocery store in your area sells or has even heard of."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"I hate to say this, but I think maybe I found this book too late. I majored in English as an undergrad, and had learned most of these strategies the hard way. I really was excited about this book and wanted to get into it, but I found myself employing the book's strategies while reading the book. I skimmed, I skipped sections that struck me as repetitive, and critically analyzed the book as I went along."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"The book necessitates concentration. It also demands multiple readings in order for the reader to get past the dense language. It can be a better book. The book needs illustrations. The book could benefit from illustrations of the following concepts: a term, good and bad propositions, good and bad premises, good and bad conclusions, good and bad arguments, and examples of inductive and deductive reasoning. Without these concepts, the reader has to go to extra-textual sources to understand the concepts. Of course, some would argue that these concepts are elementary. Maybe so. But this book could have used an index to clarify and expand on those concepts."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"This book has definitely helped me improve my reading skills. But I believe that the older edition should be studied after one is finished studying this edition. I suggest to look for the older 1940 edition or the revised 1966 edition which should be the same as the 1940 version. They are physically hard to find and might be expensive, but a little googling around should help you find a great pdf of the 1966 version (which I have).Why do I also suggest the older version?Well, I believe the older version makes the order of active reading more CLEAR. Many might read the Van Doren version and believe that the inspectional reading is something that should be done entirely separate from the analytical reading. Basically, some people (like me at first) assume that you must read two times. On the other hand, the older edition tells you that there are three distinct readings: structural, interpretative, and critical. These three readings correspond to the three stages of analytical reading and also to the first three questions one must ask during an active reading (the fourth question is asked after the first three are answered). The older edition basically tells you to jump straight to an analytical reading. Of course, the methods of inspectional reading should be applied to the first two analytical stages just how the methods of elementary reading must be applied to an inspectional reading. But like I said, look up the older edition and draw up your own conclusions. In the end, it's basically up to the reader on figuring out how he/she is comfortable in reading any text."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"The first book of my first doctoral class was about reading itself.

It is very convenient for me and I find what I need."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"I can understand Mortimer Adler's motivation for writing \\"How to Read a Book\\" in 1940. Absolutely dismayed by the quality of discussion in his university seminars and certain that his students either did not read the assigned books or did not know how to properly digest them Mr. Adler decided to write a book that spelled out in painstaking and often insulting detail how to read a book.Knowing the genre of the book and understanding the title are according to Mr. Adler that important first step. Reading the table of contents and skimming the index come next. Inspecting the book, and understanding the different constituent parts will permit readers to better grasp the author's viewpoint and how he constructs his arguments. Then there's the pinpointing and understanding of the author's key words and key sentences, which will permit the reader to better understand the author's reasoning. Once fully confident of the author's thinking may the reader begin to question his logic, reasoning, and completeness of thought -- and the very experienced readers will be able to compare and contrast with other books.It's a fine public service that Mr. Adler has mechanically systemized a reading process. Teachers and professors show either ignorance or indifference when they just assume that their students have understood the text, and do not do enough to actually pressure the students into comprehending the text. Seminar discussion, papers, and examination questions are too open-minded so as to allow students to bluff their way through, and the SAT is a test which can be coached and beaten. So it's good that finally comes an author, experienced in the tactics and strategies of college students to do the least work for the best grades, who demands that readers actually focus and concentrate on reading.Unfortunately, the co-authors Mortimer Adler and Charles Van Doren do it in the most pedantic and professorial, laborious and long-winded manner possible (that's why, I suppose, they didn't do a sequel to their best-seller and entitle it \\"How to Write a Book\\"). Consider the classic \\"Elements of Style\\" By William Strunk and E.B. White, and how with economy and wit they're able to distill the parts of writing into their most basic and most easily understood constituent parts. Running at 419 pages \\"How to Read a Book\\" could easily have just been 50 pages."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"Imagine me - there I was, for decades of my life, thinking I knew how to read a book. I'd advanced through elementary school and prep, into college and finally to graduate school when I discovered, to my horror, that I in fact did not know how to read! Perhaps that helps to explain my affinity to literacy programmes, with whom I will begin working again come this Wednesday.But no, perhaps I overstate the situation. What I actually mean to say is that it was not until my graduate school days that I happened across the most excellent work How to Read a Book: The Classic Guide to Intelligent Reading, by Mortimer J. Adler and Charles Van Doren. This staple had somehow eluded me; familiar as I was with both Adler and Van Doren, I had never encountered this text.This book was written in 1940, as World War II was beginning and the Great Depression ending; it was revised in the 60s and again in 70s, with the assistance of Charles Van Doren, another person who had had some difficult dealings with Columbia, due to his involvement in the quiz show scandals of the 1950s. Van Doren moved away from the East Coast and landed in Chicago, near Adler, at Britannica, also again near Adler, and has the kind of intellect and unconventional circumstance that Adler admired. Adler of course had his own unique academic career, failing to get an undergraduate degree due to a physical education requirement that went unmet.The book itself is divided into four main sections with two sizeable appendices.The Dimensions of ReadingIn this section, the authors look as types of reading and reading levels. They look at basic goals for reading, and discuss different types of learning. While they do not get into the theoretical complexities of learning styles as intricately as more recent educational theorists, they do make interesting and insightful distinctions between learning by instruction and learning by discovery.This section is, in fact, full of rules. Rules for notetaking, annotating (highlighting, underlining, summarising, etc.), skimming, comprehending, etc. are all presented in an almost overwhelming sequence. There is so much to remember while reading (and I remember how smug I felt at having discovered many, if not most, of the rules on my own). But the authors beg for the rules to be consistently applied so that they merge together to become simple habit. They use the analogy of learning to ski - the rules are important, each in and of itself, but successful skiing transcends a mere application of rules until they become a natural impulse. So it is with reading.Analytical ReadingThis is crucial for true benefit and comprehension of any book. The authors talk about analysis in stages:o Pigeonholing a booko X-raying a booko Coming to terms with an authoro Determining an author's messageo Criticising a book fairlyo Agreeing or disagreeing with an authoro Aids to readingApproaches to Different Kinds of Reading MatterIn this section, the authors look at critical differences between different styles of books. It is obvious to even the inexperienced reader that reading a technical manual is vastly different from reading plays, poems, or history texts. Even the most educated of people occasionally stumble when confronted with high-level material from outside fields, such as asking the social scientist to deal with mathematical and scientific texts, or asking the physicist to deal with history and psychology treatises. One might argue about their divisions, but within the chapters they cover a very broad area.The Ultimate Goals of ReadingWhy does anyone read in the first place? Here the authors talk about developing beyond individual books into fields of learning, introducing ideas of synoptic reading and understanding the importance for doing so. Again charting rules of engagement for multiple texts, the authors discuss the importance of reading for understanding and deeper comprehension.* * *The first appendix consists of a lengthy list of the great books identified by Adler, modified over time by the various people involved in great books curriculum development. This is an admittedly Western-dominated list.The list is certainly a long one. There are 137 authors, often with several works attached, recommended in this list. One can find this list in physical form in the Great Books series that is a companion to the Britannica. Itself only recently updated and revised, it consists of several linear feet of bookshelves, and even their recommended 10-year plan is ambition and doesn't cover the entirety of the series. The list is presented (as the book set is organized) in chronological order; this is not the best order in which to read the works.The second appendix is actually a series of reading exercises for self-examination or group consideration. These are designed to be used for different levels of readers and different intentions. The authors tackle the question of arbitrary and cultural bias in manners of testing, coming to the pragmatic conclusion that, so long as academic and society advancement is tied to these kinds of testing and evaluations, it makes sense to learn how to do them, and however biased they may be in form or content, they still do provide a good measure, if not the best possible measure, for reading comprehension and retention.One can tell that one's book has been successful when parody versions begin to appear. The year after the first edition of How to Read a Book appeared, there was the spoof How to Read Two Books; shortly thereafter there was a serious monograph by a Professor I.A. Richards entitled How to Read a Page.Happy reading!"},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"My reasons for reading this book are many. The initial one was curiosity, because the title intrigued me. Another reason, and a more important one, was the fact that I am now studying for a Doctor of Business Administration degree, which is purely based on my learning from reading. Being someone for whom English is a second language, it is my opinion that my skills can always be improved and it was in that spirit that I took this book into my daily life.In fairness, this is not the easiest book my hands have ever touched or my eyes have ever rested upon, but having spent the time to read it, my opinion is that it will make a significant difference to my reading and learning in the future.It is easy to fool oneself by thinking that one knows all or most of what there is to know about reading, since most people's reading starts at an early age. Some people is likely to have that kind of attitude and dismiss this book, however if they read it they would come to discover that there is so much to be learned by reading it. \\"How to Read a Book\\" is now amongst the books that I treasure. It is a joy to read as one learns the principles of reading from its pages, and then later applies them to reading the book itself as it will have to be read in more than one sitting. I now find that my reading has been improving and my understanding of what I am reading is growing thanks to applying what I am learning from it.I believe that anyone who reads can benefit from \\"How to Read a Book\\", even more so the ones who really need to learn from the books read, as the right techniques can make all the difference to the enjoyment as well as the benefits obtained from reading a book.The authors have written such a valuable work because not only do they describe how reading a book should be approached but also whether a book should be read at all, so at a minimum the reader would save time after reading it, if not improving their skills in reading; however I think they will achieve both things.I now find that my reading has been improving and my understanding of what I am reading is growing thanks to my usage of what I am learning from it, as I revisit it often. I believe that anyone who reads can benefit from \\"How to Read a Book\\", even more so the ones who really need to learn from the books read.Amongst the many things learned from the book is how to read the work of poets and philosophers, which have always attracted me. Not having English as my first language, I did not have an early exposure to the works of people like Shakespeare; therefore I am glad that now I will be able to do it the right way and therefore obtain maximum enjoyment from it.I am sure others can write a much better review than I did, so I will stop here and just say that this is a great read and I thoroughly recommend it to any reader, not matter now advanced they think they might be, because this book will make them better readers."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"1.1 R&eacute;sum&eacute; of the book\\"How to Read a Book: the classic guide to intelligent reading\\", is a practical guide for self-improvement that teach us the rules of reading any material, but especially analytical writing. They can be applied to reading the Great Books (primary knowledge) for understanding and pleasure but mainly to learn by reading the Great Books of the Western World.1.2 The different types of reading* Reading for informationWe have gained more facts but we have learned nothing.This method is used to read newspapers, magazines or anything that we understand totally by reading it once.* Reading for learning (for understanding more)Reading to understand more is to close the gap between the superiority of the author and the reader by learning through communication with the author.* Reading for enjoymentThis type of reading is the most common, as it is used to read fiction and other books for pleasure.1.3 The three different reading levels* Level one - Elementary readingThe first level covers the basic reading skills we learn in the first years of school; we recognize words but do not necessarily understand them.* Level two - Inspectional reading (preparation for Analytical and Syntopical reading)The level two skills are based on two steps named skimming (or pre-reading) and superficial reading.The different steps of skimming, which should take at least one hour for a book, are:o Look at the title and prefaceo Study the table of contents and understand the structure of the booko Check the index (to learn the most important words and where the important paragraphs are)o Read the publisher's blurbo Look now at the main chapters (or the summaries) and read them carefullyo Finally turn the pages and dip in here and there, reading some paragraphs or some pages in sequenceThe step of superficial reading is:o Read a difficult book through without stopping to read footnotes, comments and references. Do not even consult a dictionary (except for a brand new word that seems very important for the author) or encyclopedia* Level three - analytical reading (how to read a whole book well)Analytical reading is defined by Adler himself as: \\"With nothing else but the power of your mind, you operate on the symbols before you in such a way that you gradually lift yourself from the state of understanding less to one of understanding more.\\"Analytical reading is the method, which is explained in detail. For Adler, it is the most important level for learning by reading, especially by reading the Great Books.Analytical reading is split into three stages.Stage 1 or the first reading (finding out what the book is about, based on structural rules)o Pigeonholing a book* Classify the booko X-raying the book* State what the whole book is about* Enumerate its major parts in their order and relation and outline those parts* Define the problems the author has tried to solveStage 2 or second reading (rules of interpreting)o Coming to terms with an author* Come to terms in interpreting the key wordso Determining an author's message* Grasp the author's leading propositions by dealing with his/her important sentences* Know the author's arguments by finding them or constructing them out of sequences of sentences (stated in your own words)* Determine which of the problems the author has solved, and which he had failed to solve or ignoredStage 3 or third reading (rules for criticizing)o Answer to the author based on the rules of intellectual etiquette* Do not say \`I agree, disagree or suspend my judgment' until you can say \`I understand'* Do not disagree disputatiously or contentiously* Base your critical judgment on knowledge and not on personal opinion, and give reasonso Show how the author is uninformed, misinformed, illogical or his analysis is incompleteImportant note: use relevant experience, commentaries or reference books as aids to reading.* Level four - Syntoptical Reading (based on inspectional and analytical reading - how to read several books on the same subject)The different stages of syntopical reading are:* Preparations or first reading1. Find the sense of the subject to reduce the amount of material2. Inspect all the material to have a clear idea of the subject* Syntopical Reading or second reading1. Find the relevant paragraph2. Build a set of terms that help you to understand all the different authors3. Clarify the questions to which all the authors give an answer (\\"Look to all sides but take no sides\\").4. Define the answers (join and sort the different and perhaps controversial answers or views on the subject)5. Analyze the discussion to shine maximum light on the subjectHow the different views are ordered (from more general to less general) is the key point of the last step. Support the view or answers by citation of the authors1.4 The keys questions to answer* What is the book about as a whole?The author suggests the reader should discover the leading theme of the book and how it is ordered in sub-themes.* What is being said in detail and how?Here we will have to discover the author's main propositions, arguments and ideas.* Is it true (in whole or in part)?Understand the book first, then give your opinion* What of it?We must ask about the significance of the book, for the author and for us.Inspectional reading will solve the first two questions...Analytical reading will not have been completed until all four questions have been answered.The last question is the most important one in syntopical reading.2 Key lessons from \\"How to Read a Book\\"* Preparations1. Find the main sense of the subject to reduce the amount of material2. Inspect all the material to have a clear idea of the subject* Key lessons1. Find the relevant arguments and propositions2. Build a common platform for communication3. Get the questions clear, so everybody can give an answer4. Define the answers5. Analyze the discussion to shed maximum light on the subjectThe most important step is to analyze the different opinions and to be able to defend them. If a solution cannot be found, the analysis will clarify the problem, so someone can solve it later on (see sample of the author on progress)."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"This book is indispensable in helping a reader develop critical-thinking skills, in sharpening the mechanics of reading, and in revealing the widely scoped canon of Western literature that's freely available to anyone who wants to educate him/herself.I'd especially recommend this book to home schoolers at any level beyond elementary and students preparing for college/university.

How to Read a Book has given me a sound approach and blueprint to follow as I read these technical documents.This book is truly a MUST have for everyone of all disciplines."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"\\"How to Read a Book\\" stands as a must-read text for students in middle and high school. If you didn't read the book during this time, it's not too late to pick up a copy, as I decided to see if it had anything for me as I seek my first masters degree. It is still useful for people later in the educational process, but most of the lesson taught will already be implanted in the minds of most who pick this up later.The authors outline four ways of reading:Elementary - basic literacyInspectional - pigeon- holing a book/getting a brief overview through systematic inspectionAnalytical - interacting with the author and his ideasSynoptical - interacting with multiple volumes that discuss the same topicEach of the levels builds upon one another, and each has a set of rules or techniques associated with them. The overview of each technique is summarized at the end of each section. The rules of analytical and synoptic reading can benefit those going back to school or reading larger amounts of material for higher education.After dealing with analytical reading, the authors discuss reading techniques and concepts associated with different genres, such as history, poetry, social science, theology and mathematic reading.For synoptic reading, the authors discuss bulding a bibliography and how to determine which books to spend time on.Critiques - despite this being such a foundational book, I do have two critiques that could help future versions.The book does not discuss a technique I use that other readers may find useful. Namely, topic sentence reading when pigeon-holing a book. The book discusses many aspects of the process of pigeon-holing, but it leaves out the topic sentence idea. Granted, the idea only works when the author writes in a way that supports this process (uses topic sentences).The text seems to repeat itself or not say things as succinctly as possible. This led me to jump to the summaries on several occasions, rather than reading the text of the main chapter.Overall, the book really can help readers develop good reading habits and guides incorporation of techniques to cut down on reading time and increase comprehension. I recommend this book especially to middle-school/high school freshman English classes, but suggest anyone that has not read the text to give it a look for possible techniques they missed o ut on that could help with higher education."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"I picked up this book in a state of vexed frustration. I had forgotten how to read. At least, if felt like that. It was becoming an increasingly difficult practice for me to finish novels; this I rightly ascribed to one of my most damaging shortcomings: perfectionism. I kept telling myself that I had stopped reading books PROPERLY, or that I was being lazy - in a word, that I wasn't assimilating as much as I should be. My standards, though, were unattainable: I seemed almost to expect that, after one reading, I should be able to recite every word, without fail. It is ludicrous, peurile, yet I couldn't seem to disentangle myself from it. I even considered investing in a punchbag, because there was no one in proximal distance upon whom I could feasibly unleash my anger.I finished this book today, and already I can assert that it was a successful panacea to my reading woes.The most important thing that I took from the book - the remedy, if you will - concerns first readings. Rather than attempt to absorb everything, rather than constantly consulting the dictionary - one should just immerse oneself in the novel, ideally in a single sitting. If one keeps stopping, then one is apt to forget, or even lose interest. Then, if one wishes, one can reread the novel with an analytical eye. More than one too many ones in that paragraph.Adler's insistence that you should read the most challenging books, ones that will stretch your imagination, rather than reading exclusively for mere entertainment - is also admirable. I agree with other reviewers that this book should be compulsory for high-school children (not to mention high school children).I gave it four stars because most of the book is devoted to the art of reading NON-fiction, and only some of the advice is applicable to imaginative fiction. That is just a minor personal criticism, though.The name of the book is appalling. Not that this had any bearing on my rating, but the title is deceptively simplistic, and you might want to cover it when in public, lest one be mistaken for an illiterate oaf."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"A reading of the highly instructive \\"How to Read a Book\\" would show that after 70-plus years, the book still applies to an e-reading world. It was first published by Mortimer J. Adler in 1940 and was last revised with Charles Van Doren in 1972, which seems like ancient history, especially in light of the reading revolution. Yet as we click on links and skim through headings of text in our iPads, Kindles, and Nooks, the four levels of reading and the various stages within those levels described in the book still reflect the reading experience. The truth be told, most adults still need instruction in how to read critically, and this book shows us how.In \\"How to Read a Book,\\" Adler and Van Doren begin with the notion that reading is far from the passive activity many educators claim it is. They lay out in great detail the four levels of reading as elementary (word, sentence, and paragraph recognition, vocabulary development), inspectional (learning the basis and content of the book), analytical (interpreting and critiquing the author's viewpoint), and synoptical (finding the relevance of the book, clarifying questions, defining issues, discovering relevant bibliographies). Most readers need not worry about the synoptical level if they read for quick information or pure entertainment. However, an awareness of the inspectional level, when the Adler and Van Doren say we should perform a structured skimming through the book, would save us a lot of reading time if done systematically. This book details such a system.The authors employ a recursive approach, restating their earlier major premises in relation to new ones as the book advances through the four levels. They also provide in-depth guidance for reading practical, literary, historical, scientific, philosophical, and social science books. Readers and reading instructors will find most useful the four basic questions to answer at the heart of active reading: What is the book about? What is the author saying? Are the author's ideas true? What can we make of the ideas in the book? The authors even detail what they consider to be three kinds of notes one can take during inspectional reading: structural, to understand the content; conceptual, to consider the author's concepts in concert with one's own; and dialectical, to merge related ideas from other books.Those who choose to disagree for its own sake (think Washington, D.C.) would do well to practice the three conditions of general criticism outlined in \\"How to Read a Book\\": first, understand before criticizing; second, criticize without being contentious; third, disagree on items that are remediable. Once readers are prepared to disagree, they would find helpful the conditions to satisfy for well-conducted controversy (pages 154-155) and the four remarks to make in disagreeing with the author (page 156).In any Mortimer Adler book one will find many side benefits as well. His trenchant observations about his subject matter and his highly quotable style are among them. Here is one of this comments that stuck with me: \\"Common experience is available to all men and women just because they are alive. Special experience must be actively sought and is available only to those who go to the trouble of acquiring it.\\" It's simple, clear, and corroborated observations like these that make \\"How to Read a Book\\" a reading pleasure."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"I finished reading this book three years ago, but because of my poor written english I did not dare to write review.Mortimer J. Adler (1902-2001) was an American philosopher and writer. Charles Van Doren (1926) is an American intellectual, writer and editor. For it is linked to a scandal in the TV quiz show of the fifties of last century. Robert Redford was filmed and a successful movie about it: Quiz Show (1994). Van Doren and starred Ralph Fiennes. The film was screened several times on our television.Books are read from the following reasons:- for fun- to obtain new information,- for understanding the world we live in and ourselvesThe third reason is the subject of the book How to Read a Book.This book mentions four levels of reading. Every next level includes the previous level of reading - as Russian Babushka dolls:)I. Level: Elementary ReadingII. level: Inspectional ReadingIII. level: Analytical ReadingIV. level: Syntopical ReadingSo, the last level of reading, syntopical reading contains the last three levels of reading. That basically means that we will not be able to apply analytical reading, if you have not mastered the elementary and inspectional reading.Elementary reading is what you usually think all of us. That's what we learned to read in elementary school, ... and there stopped. We were learning letters, words, sentences ... And no one has taught us how to read above that level.The first real level of reading is inspectional reading. This is what we read when a time is limited of say 30 minutes, to decide whether we will read the book or will not. This level is characterized by superficial reading. At this stage, is not necessary to understand everything in the book. Studying the book, its index, preface - it all belongs to the inspectional reading. From time to time to read the passages that seems interesting, and sometimes several pages in a row.The third level of reading is analytical reading. This is a systematic reading. At this stage we find out what kind of book you read belongs. We discover a whole and the parts of the book and how these parts are as a whole. Through the words writer uses, we find the terms that are important in his book. This is the highest level of reading and the most explained in the book. What I learned here is this: before you say that you like the book or not, you have to first say that you understood it.The highest and most complex level of reading is syntopical reading. It means that we read from multiple sources simultaneously, to connect, we make our own conclusions. Finally we come almost to a discovery of their own, which we can use for a \\"our book\\" we would have written.This book specifically deals with how to read and practical books, fiction, novels, theater plays, part epic, tragedy, poetry, on history, biographies and autobiographies, to read about current events, summaries (digests), books on science and mathematics, philosophy of social science.At the end of the book is Recommended Reading List: a list of 137 books worth reading (in their opinion).All in all, I think this book helped me a lot. It seems to me that in future reading I would browse through each subsequent book in a different way than before (inspectional reading) I decide to read it."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"If I had read this book before I started college I would have gotten so much more out of my classes and studies.

At worst you lose some time and gain knowledge but most likely you will be re-inspired to take on the Great Books of The Western World. Life is short, read fast."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"A classic. This book is practical, and surprisingly, a joy to read. The authors' intent is to teach the reader the techniques for systematically and reliably extracting information AND meaning from books, particularly great books (defined as those books that cannot be fully grasped through a superficial reading, but must be \\"chewed and slowly digested\\" in order to be understood). Such books must be read analytically, a technique described in detail by the authors.To be widely read is not synonomous with being well read. This is a book designed to teach you how to mine a book for all its treasures; you will learn to approach a book with the intent and means of gaining the wisdom of its writer. You will experience an uncommon joy when you learn how to read not only for pleasure, but also to gain understanding and wisdom that you can apply to your own life and to the myriad problems that beset all mankind.This book is an investment in yourself, in your children, in your world. Buy it. Consider it carefully. Apply its methods.

In fact, I was so good that no one bothered to find out what exactly I was doing when I read and give me helpful suggestions for improvement. If you think of yourself as an educated, thoughtful person, and still you find that you often finish a book and are unable to articulate much about it six months later, get this book. I read more slowly now but I know what I'm reading. You might also try Susan Wise Bauer's The Well Educated Mind. I would check out both from the library and then select one to buy as a reference.

It's all common sense stuff, but maybe it takes being written down in a well-organized book to really penetrate the minds of people like me. Those who know what they should do, but are naturally lazy.. As noted in the book(pg.338-339), some books do deserve the effort of all the suggestions Adler and Van Doren make while others can be spared the extensive analysis. But this piece gives you a good place to start and is just as handy to keep around as other reference materials. I also highly recommend Adler's companion piece, &quot;How to Speak, How to Listen.&quot;"},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"My friend sent me, a YouTube video of a Mortimer Adler interview, in which Mortimer explained the power of reading a book properly for understanding. So, to find out more, I purchased his book.The book provided me with useful insights, even on some topics that weren't of particular interest to me, i.e. the chapter on Imaginative Literature (my interests lie with Science). In my opinion, it is well worth the read; for those that need a practical guide for their reading or to get rid of bad habits.OUTLINE OF BOOK ([...])Adler, Mortimer J. and Van Doren, Charles. How to Read a Book: The ClassicGuide to Intelligent Reading, rev. ed. (New York: Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, 1972)Part 1: The Dimensions of ReadingChapter 1- The Activity and Art of ReadingA. Two types of reading:1. For information (more data: the \`what')2. For understanding (more discernment: the \`why')B. Two types of learning:1. By instruction (more passive: to know what)2. By discovery (more active: to know why)C. Goal of this book:1. Learning to learn by discovery, for understanding2. Learning how to learn from \\"one who is absent\\" (author)3. Learning \\"how to make books teach us well\\"Chapter 2- The Levels of ReadingA. Elementary: \\"What does the sentence/book say?\\"B. Inspectional: \\"What is the book about? What kind of book is it?\\"C. Analytical: \\"What does the book mean?\\"D. Syntopical: \\"How does it compare with other books?\\"Chapter 3- Elementary ReadingA. Four basic stages1. \`reading readiness' (early physical development)2. simple reading (small vocabulary; simple skills)3. expanded reading (large vocabulary; diverse subjects; enjoyment)4. refined reading (understand concepts; compare different views)B. Need for remedial instruction in elementary reading1. at the high school level2. at the college levelChapter 4- Inspectional ReadingA. Systematic skimming or pre-reading1. Look at the title page and preface: try to pigeonhole type of book2. Study table of contents: look for structure/road map for trip3. Check index: estimate range of terms and topics; look up somepassages that seem crucial4. Check the dust jacket: read the publisher's blurb5. Look for chapters which seem most pivotal: read opening and/orclosing passages/pages carefully6. Thumb through entire book, reading a few paragraphs and/or pageshere and there, esp. at the end, looking for the main argument(s)B. Superficial reading1. Read through \\"without ever stopping to look up or ponder the thingsyou do not understand right away\\"2. \\"Go right on [until] you come to things you do understand. Concentrateon these. Keep on in this way.\\" (e.g. \\"reading Shakespeare\\"! : )C. On reading speeds1. Learn to read at different speedsa. \\"many books are hardly worth even skimming;\\"b. \\"some should be read quickly;\\"c. \\"a few should be read... quite slow...allow[ing] for complete comprehension\\"2. Even difficult books have some material which can be read quicklyD. Fixations and regressions:1. The mind can grasp a sentence or even a paragraph at a glance2. For faster reading try sweeping your thumb and first two fingerslike a \\"pointer\\" across the line forcing your eyes to keep upE. Problem of comprehension1. Speed isn't enough; speed alone doesn't bring comprehension2. This book seeks to improve comprehensionF. Summary of inspectional reading1. \\"Race through even the hardest book\\" the first time through.2. \\"You will then be prepared to read it well the second time.\\"Chapter 5- How to be a Demanding ReaderA. Four basic questions a reader asks:THE FOUR STAGES OF ANALYTICAL READING:1. \\"What is the book about as a whole?\\" (Subject/Classification)2. \\"What is being said in detail, and how?\\" (Terms/Interpretation)3. \\"Is the book true, in whole or part?\\" (Truth/Evaluation)4. \\"What of it?\\" (Significance/Response)B. How to make a book your own:1. Underlining key sentences2. Vertical lines to mark key sections3. Marginal doodads likes asterisks and stars4. Numbers of other pages in the margin5. Circling key words or phrases6. Writing in margins, or top and bottomC. Three kinds of note-making1. Structural- about the content of the subject2. Conceptual- about the truth and significance3. Dialectical- about the shape of the argument in the larger discussionof other people's ideasPart 2: The Third Level of Reading: Analytical ReadingTHE FIRST STAGE OF ANALYTICAL READINGChapter 6- Pigeonholing a BookRULE 1. CLASSIFY THE BOOK: \\"YOU MUST KNOW WHAT KIND OF BOOK YOUARE READING, AND YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS AS EARLY IN THE PROCESS ASPOSSIBLE, PREFERABLY BEFORE YOU BEGIN TO READ.\\"Chapter 7- X-Raying a BookRULE 2. RE-STATE THE POINT OF THE BOOK IN YOUR OWN WORDS:\\"STATE THE UNITY OF THE WHOLE BOOK IN A SINGLE SENTENCE, OR AT MOST AFEW SENTENCES.\\"\\"Every book has a skeleton hidden between its covers.Your job as an analytical reader is to find it.\\"RULE 3. OUTLINE THE BOOK: \\"SET FORTH THE MAJOR PARTS OF THE BOOK,AND SHOW HOW THESE ARE ORGANIZED INTO A WHOLE, BY BEING ORDEREDTO ONE ANOTHER AND TO THE UNITY OF THE WHOLE.\\"The art of outlining a book: \\"A piece of writing should haveunity, clarity, and coherence... we must find it.\\"RULE 4. DETERMINE THE AUTHOR'S GOAL: \\"FIND OUT WHAT THEAUTHOR'S PROBLEMS WERE.\\" [WHAT QUESTION IS HE TRYING TO ANSWER?]THE SECOND STAGE OF ANALYTICAL READINGChapter 8- Coming to Terms with an AuthorRULE 5. INTERPRET KEY WORDS: \\"FIND THE IMPORTANT WORDS ANDTHROUGH THEM COME TO TERMS WITH THE AUTHOR.\\"1. Find the key words (words which are emphasized, repeated,defined, and/or italicized; \`fighting' words)2. Find the meanings of those words from the context, like\\"putting a jigsaw puzzle together\\"Chapter 9- Determining an Author's MessageRULE 6. GRASP THE MAIN PROPOSITIONS: \\"MARK THE MOST IMPORTANTSENTENCES IN A BOOK AND DISCOVER THE PROPOSITIONS THEY CONTAIN.\\"Propositions are the author's judgments about what is true or false. They are alsothe author's answers to questions, his or her major affirmations and denials.These are the heart of his/her communication. They are the most importantthings the author has to say. Unless these propositions are supported by reasons,they are nothing but expressions of personal opinion.RULE 7. FIND THE MAIN ARGUMENTS: \\"LOCATE OR CONSTRUCT THE BASICARGUMENTS IN A BOOK BY FINDING THEM IN THE CONNECTION OF SENTENCES.\\"Arguments are statements which offer the grounds or reasonsfor the author's judgments and conclusions.How to find the key sentences and propositions:1. Look for signs: underlining; italics; location2. Look where you seem \\"to be perplexed\\"3. Look for statements containing key terms4. Look for a sequence in the argument(s)5. Separate complicated sentences into more than one proposition6. See if you can state the author's argument in your own words7. See if you can give your own example to make the same pointRULE 8. DETERMINE THE AUTHOR'S SUCCESS/FAILURE: \\"FIND OUTWHAT THE AUTHOR'S SOLUTIONS ARE.\\"THE THIRD STAGE OF ANALYTICAL READINGChapter 10- Criticizing a Book FairlyRULE 9. COMPLETE YOUR READING FIRST: \\"YOU MUST BE ABLE TO SAY,WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY, \`I UNDERSTAND,' BEFORE YOU CAN SAY ANYONE OF THE FOLLOWING THINGS: \`I AGREE,' OR \`I DISAGREE,' OR \`I SUSPENDJUDGMENT.'\\"1. Recognize your \\"responsibility of taking a position\\" in responseto the propositions you have now read. \\"Reading a book is a kindof conversation...The author has had his say, and then it is thereader's turn.\\"2. Recognize the \\"role of rhetoric\\" in this process, i.e. the attemptin all communication \\"to convince or persuade.\\" This attemptis \\"the ultimate end in view... rhetorical skill is knowing how toreact to anyone who tries to convince or persuade us.\\"RULE 10. CONTROL YOURSELF: \\"WHEN YOU DISAGREE, DO SOREASONABLY, AND NOT DISPUTATIOUSLY OR CONTENTIOUSLY.\\"RULE 11. PRESENT GOOD REASONS: \\"RESPECT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEENKNOWLEDGE AND MERE PERSONAL OPINION, BY GIVING REASONS FOR ANYCRITICAL JUDGMENT YOU MAKE.\\"Chapter 11- Agreeing or Disagreeing with an AuthorA. Three ideal conditions for a well-conducted disagreement:1. Acknowledge your emotions2. Make your own assumptions explicit3. Make an attempt at impartialityB. Four practical ways to criticize a book negatively1. \\"You are uninformed\\"2. \\"You are misinformed\\"3. \\"You are illogical\\"4. \\"Your analysis is incomplete\\"Chapter 12- Aids to ReadingA. The Importance of Context1. Intrinsic reading- the context within the book itself2. Extrinsic reading- the context of sources outside the bookB. Using other books as Extrinsic Aids1. The \`Great Books'- a \\"prolonged conversation\\" in Western civilizationwhich \\"provide[s] an even larger context that helps you to interpret thebook you are reading.\\"2. Commentaries- should be \\"used wisely, which is to say sparingly,\\" sincethey \\"are not always right\\" and \\"may not be exhaustive.\\" So: \\"you shouldnot read a commentary by someone else until after you have read the book.\\"3.

Who needs a book about how to read a book? Well, as more books like The Dumbest Generation emerge, it becomes clear we all need this book.In it Adler teaches practical steps in critical reading and thinking skills. It is one that I go back to over and over. While most of us read only superficially, Adler gives rules for tearing a book apart--analyzing the text, seeing how the parts relate to the whole and each other, how to find the structure, the main ideas, the support of those ideas, how to evaluate what is being said, synthesizing what is said in one text with others, and rules of etiquette when agreeing or disagreeing with an author. (There is a lot here that reminds one of SQ3R, the old study technique to boost reading comprehension, but this book is much more thorough.) Adler and Van Doren also show how active reading can be done in different fields of knowledge--history, science, philosophy, literature, etc.It's a great guide to thinking critically about books, and it would make a good gift for a high school or college student who wants to increase reading comprehension and analytical skills in general. Adler was a champion of the Great Books of the Western World program, and this book is a natural segue into reading and understanding the classics and joining in The Great Conversation as he called it."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"Every person who is seriously spending time on books should consider to buy this book.The book is amazing in my opinion because it explain the different ways of reading."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"No matter who you are or what you want to achieve.

It was very helpful. It made me realize that it was OK to re-read texts,and that I wasn't mentally slow, if I didn't get all the meaning on my first reading. It gave me an overview of reading, and was much superior to what I was getting in HS English classes, which focused only on grammar.I recommend this book to people, in particular, who want to improve their reading comprehension, and writing skills. Let Dr. Adler be your tutor. He was the editor of the Encyclopedia Brittanica, and the editor of the Great Books, pub by the U. of Chicago. He wrote during a time when education itself was valued, not just education to pass tests or get a good job. This book could help you build a solid foundation in reading comprehension."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"I am an engineer by training, and since I have been out of grad school for a few years now, I enjoy reading books in order to occupy my mind. However, I was what Adler and Van Doren would call a &quot;widely-read&quot; person, which is to say that I should have been pitied rather than respected. This book really changed my perception of reading from being a casual hobby to a lifelong process of self-education, and so I am currently undergoing my conversion to being a well-read reader, or a person who reads for understanding not just information.Others might scoff at my literary ignorance, but I was really impressed by Adler and Van Doren's suggestion that the Great Books should be read chronologically, in order to take part in this &quot;Great Conversation&quot; that has been going on since man learned how to write. Previously, I had regarded the Great Books as so many individual stars in a literary universe, with absolutely no rhyme or reason on where to begin reading. However, now, I am approaching these classics in a more disciplined way by following a chronological reading list, and this has added a dimension of understanding to my reading that I really had not encountered before.Adler and Van Doren say a lot in this book that I agree with, and previous reviewers have done a good job of summarizing the levels of reading, and the activities associated with them. However, I felt that the authors' suggestions for reading fiction were a bit vague and insufficient. For example, Adler and Van Doren say that the &quot;truth&quot; of a work of fiction is determined by its beauty to the reader, and the reader should be able to point out in the book the source of this beauty. Such a suggestion leaves a lot of things left unsaid and I felt that the authors could have commented a little more on how the reader could go about analyzing imaginative literature.Nevertheless, this book is a classic. If you consider yourself a serious reader, but have never been formally instructed in how to engage books, then I highly, wholeheartedly, and absolutely recommend that you read this book."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"The information contained within How to Read a Book justifies its price, yet it is apparent that Mortimer Adler may need to read a book entitled How to Write a Book.

This is flaw this excellent book has. The content is superlative, yet it took me several reads to get through his desultory style of writing. But I feel the time invested has raked in 200% returns, and I am definately indebted to How to Read a Book for giving me more enjoyment out of the books I read.

He draws on and on giving example after example, which becomes useless. Anyone who has graduated from high school, perhaps even those who are just freshmen in high school, will have already developed the strategies presented in this book. The book basically tells you to be more competent by examining all aspects of the book. I.E. Title, index, table of contents, chapter titles, bold words, italics, underline, etc. The author tells you to find words not used in common language in order to find out what is important in the chapters, and to basically, form your own opinion of the book.I cannot help but feel this book could have been narrowed down to 20 pages. The author gives way to many examples, and draws on and on about useless topics. Quite literally, you could just read the last few paragraphs of every chapter, and the intro paragraph to every chapter, and come out with an understanding as if you read the entire book.I would not recommend this product to anyone unless you wish to bore them.

Since you are interested in this book, I will assume that you read a lot of text and are primarily looking for something that will :1) Increase your Speed2) Increase your comprehension.This is not the book for your goal.The book starts with the Goals of Reading and quickly moves on to different levels of reading (Elementary, Inspectional, Analytical and Syntopical).In a nutshell all that Mortimer wants to communicate is that there are 2 types of reading, one that you do for entertainment and one for aquiring information or understanding. In both cases, it pays to be an active reader (more in 2nd than in first). To become an active reader, you have to follow these simple rules:1) Look for the theme, crux of the book2) Look for outline, structure or organization of the book3) Understand what author is trying to say4) Understand why author is saying that5) What arguments he gives to support himself6) Arguments against what he wants to disprove7) Terms and language he usesThat's it! This is pretty much the summary of the book. He takes examples of Homer and Hamlet but all that Mortimer does is to add lots and lots of padding and useless words to drive his point across. It took me an hour to go through first 50 pages as I was really trying to give this book enough time. However, once I realized that there is little meaningful text hidden between tons of useless babble, I started speed reading and found that it was enough to read just the title of each paragraph and a line or 2 in caps. I raced through rest of the 300 pages in another hour and I haven't missed anything!CONCLUSION: This book may be a good gift for your child (10 to 13 years old) if she has any interest in reading. It could teach him some basic rules and tricks.But if you are looking for speed reading book, this is not the one."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"I recieved this book from treasurehopper in acceptable condition.

I am currently working on the book. it is enlightening. the title was a horrible marketing scheme, but maybe the author was not so worried about this. if you read for more than an average of 10 minutes a day, if you read any books at all, this is the book to read. I'm sorry, but your own damn college professors need to read this. In fact, I have found no other even closely imitable work. It is head and shoulders above. If you question your profs. There is good reason to. It is a tragedy that this book is not taught in freshman year in college, or highschool... in fact, all of highschool lit. should just teach this work alone. One cannot accurately read without it. I know i sound over the top, and, it is just a matter of opinion that you won't be able to read like a champ w/o this, however, i stand by this firmly. If you wonder why you can't think truly creatively, if you wonder how others spend a lifetime reading, then this is worth skimming. If you are truly motivated to read this book, don't be taken a back by its demands. It is exhaustive. It will take a lot of time to consume and understand. However, that process will add to all your reading latter to it.The only problems with the book are with it's structure and lack of prefacing its inclination towards reading expository works. It doesn't address the difference of books early enough in my own opinion. For one may be a literature reader before reading and take his rules towards expository works towards lit. and be confused in the end.If you read it, apply his own damn rules of reading to his own book, otherwise you will short change yourself. i will say again, it is exhausting, but your mind will grow.It will change your mind on intelligence being mostly nature, for, nuture definatly has a factor.I'd give it 4.5 if i could, because it is not a 'perfect' book for reasons mentioned above. however, it deserves five just as well."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"I bought this bood based on a recommendation for a friend who was having trouble with comprehension of college level reading materials.

The authors stress that reading must be active, and the best reading you can do is Analytical Reading, where you ask book questions (questions that has to do with the structure of the book, what the contents are etc.) and only when you have mastered this level are you ready to move on to Syntopical Reading, where you read several books about a specific topic.The book is complete and logically organized, and you can't really find any faults in it; if you read the book carefully, chances are that you will become a good reader in the long run. At the end, the authors presents a book list that consists of some of the finest books ever written by authors such as Charles Darwin, Immanuel Kant, and Arthur Schopenhauer.If you want to become a better reader, you must read this book, which is well-written, precise, and full of important advice."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"While there are many reviews on this particular title, perhaps only a handful reveal other handy aspects of this book. To be sure, the book as a whole contains a very complete instruction on how to get the most out of a book based on the reader's objectives. However, additional insights include how to argue, rather, debate a particular point of view.Adler & Van Doren guide the reader through ways to respectfully disagree with another's point of view without resorting to the bickering that we, as a society, have come to expect from an exchange of differing ideas. This, beyond the mere instructions on \\"how to read\\" is what has stuck with me more than just about any other portion of the book.Secondly, in reviewing the authors' guidance on what to look for while reading a book, the reader himself may come to find such guidelines helpful when writing as well. Afterall, writing and reading go hand in hand.Adler and VanDoren describe some somewhat archane titles as examples throughout the book. This should not put off the reader; however, and may serve as a springboard as to where to look for good reading material in the future. Clearly this was a portion of the authors' intent as they have included a bibliography appendix of classic fiction and non-fiction at the end of the book.For anyone wishing to go beyond a high school reading level, START WITH THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"First, I didn't know what to expect from this book, its titled seemed a little bit too academic. But after briefly browsing its pages and reading short passages, I decided to buy it. I am happy I did because very soon this book introduced me to concepts that no teacher ever taught me in school, or that I could have easily discovered or figured out by myself about reading books.To begin with there are four different levels of reading a book, the first level is the most basic level and is the way we learn how to read word by word and the fourth level is a way of reading several books about a specific subject at the same time. There are many types of books and it is essential to understand what kind of book you are going to read before you read it. One reason for this is that sometimes it is not the book that we are looking for and another reason is because different books are read in different ways. Basically we have to understand the different categories to make better decisions about how to read it.I found truly interesting the concept of coming into agreements with the author, understanding how he or she defines a specific word that might have many definitions. This is key to fully comprehending the author's idea. One must not judge a book before one is done reading it; doing this is actually disrespectful. It is like interrupting someone while he or she is talking.You must create a dialog with the author, by asking questions and reading actively. Not two people understand a book the same way and this in many ways has to do with the \\"dialog\\" that we create with the author.We must write on the books, underline, circle, mark, use the white pages to take notes, all of these are important to keep the reading active and the brain thinking. Also this is a sign of ownership. You must make that book your own.The authors use the word reading as a way of using books to help us grow as human beings, of learning about life, as life changing experiences.Of course the books is full of useful information and this is just a brief outline. It is very enjoyable to read, it reiterates important information to make things very clear and to connect previous ideas with new ideas.I recommend this book to people that like reading all kinds of subjects. People that believe that books can change lives and see them as living objects. Also, this should be required reading for writers and students. Probably anyone interested in knowledge and learning in general will get something valuable from this book."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"This is a book about reading well. The authors point to four methods of reading: elementary, inspectional, analytical, and syntopical. Each method has its place, depending upon the work that one is reading. This book should probably be required reading in junior high or high school, but definitely by the time one gets to college. The authors even have a series of \\"tests\\" at the end of the book to see how good you are at each type of reading skill. The tests are somewhat arbitrary, but nevertheless, helpful. In my opinion, the first twelve chapters and chapter 20 are the most useful chapters to read. The other chapters are interesting, but didn't add much value. There is also an appendix with a list of 137 books which the authors consider the most useful books to be read with care. While I agree with some of them, there are others on the list that I would never subject myself or recommend to others."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"How to Read a Book provides valuable techniques and principles on how to read non-fiction effectively and deeply.Although this was written in the 1940's and then updated in the 1970's, much of the advice given is indispensable and timeless.The authors discuss the increasing expertise required in academic reading, as new fields emerge and as knowledge is increasingly specialised. This has continued happening since the book was written, and so you may want to keep this historical change in mind as you read."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"How to Read a Book provides a good overview of, well, how to read a book! The book itself is built around the four levels of reading, with the author providing explanations about each level, and tips and techniques for moving to the higher levels. However, in my own case, having picked up Adler's book after I had already completed a master's degree, I didn't find many new tidbits. Rather, it served to confirm the lessons I had learned inductively over the past several years. From this perspective, I think the book would be an ideal instructional tool for high school and college students, but not much more than a reference or \\"friendly reminder\\" for people with more advanced education under their belts.However, I did find several things handy in Part Three: APPROACHES TO DIFFERENT KINDS OF READING MATTER. Since much of my own reading has been specialized over the past 5-10 years due to my studies, I can't say that I have as much experience reading some other genres of literature. Adler provides a nice, short guide about how to approach each genre, which I think would help anyone who, like myself, has had his reading list constrained by syllabus requirements for far too long.Finally, Appendix A: A Recommended Reading List is by itself worth the price of the book. Unlike so many present-day \\"must-read\\" lists one comes across, Adler provides well over 100 books and authors, all of which are worthwhile, edifying and important culturally and historically. Anyone would be well-served to read even a few books on this list."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"Thinking back on my English classes, I felt very deprived after reading this book. I have graduated highschool and just started college and have not learned the things in this book already. This book has really helped me to become a better book reader. A better reader...period. I do feel that some of the parts were boring. The start of the third section of the book put me to sleep once, but I knew I was gaining knowledge so I kept with it. The authors' writing style takes some getting used to. There isn't a sentence in the book that isn't broken up with commas and semicolons and dashes. It's still a good book, and I am happy that I read it."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"&quot;Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested&quot; (Francis Bacon). This is one of those books.How to Read a Book is a classic guide to intelligent reading and my opinion is that it should be standard reading, particularly for the college-bound student. Don't let the title fool you. This book is not a simplistic review of what you learned in the second grade. The book is divided into four parts.Part one includes what Adler calls the first two levels of reading: elementary and inspectional reading. In total he sets forth four levels of reading: elementary reading, inspectional reading, analytical reading and synoptical reading. He proceeds to tell us that reading is an active process since the teacher is not available to deliberate. In keeping with this activity we are told how to read faster while comprehending more, how to find answers to our questions from within the book and how to make the right kind of notes in the book.Part two contains the third level of reading: analytical reading. &quot;Reading a book analytically is chewing and digesting it&quot; (p.19). We now learn how to determine the type of literature we are reading, what type of structure it has and we learn that we must come to grasp with the author's vocabulary. The point of all this is to understand the message of the author. If we are unable to state the author's message concisely in our own terms, we have learned nothing. Only after we first understand what the author is saying, can we begin criticize him fairly. Once we have read analytically, we can agree with the author, disagree with him or we can postpone judgment until we have learned more if we wish. Adler suggests that we do not consult other study helps until we first have read the book analytically. This will deaden our ability to read and think for ourselves as well as confuse the message of the author.Part three tells us how to read different types of literature including practical books, imaginative literature, stories, plays, poems, history, philosophy, science, mathematics and social science. Each type of literature has it's own vocabulary, propositions, arguments, and questions that must be asked of it. This section is particularly helpful in applying the basic rules of reading to the type of literature that is to be read.The final part of the book is dedicated to the ultimate goals of reading. The first goal is the fourth and final level of reading: synoptical reading. Synoptical reading is the reading of different works on the same subject with a view to constituting a general view on the subject. The idea is to read a number of books on a given subject, as objectively as possible, and withhold judgment and criticism of all the books until you understand the different perspectives. This is the bread and butter of research and is the best way to understand any given subject matter, which is why this book is vital to the college student as well as anyone with academic pursuits. This is also the way to become educated as opposed to being indoctrinated. The last of the two ultimate goals of reading is to expand your mind for further understanding. Your mind is like a rubber band in that when it is stretched, it never fully returns to its original shape.I found this book to be highly organized and thoroughly outlined. The back even contains two appendices with a list of recommended books and exercises at the four levels of reading. It is essentially a &quot;how to&quot; book therefore it's contents are very practical and immediately helpful."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"As a book reviewer for the past 20 years, with hundreds of reviews in print and electronic media, I think I know a little about reading books. I was fascinated to find that Adler and Van Doren have, in HOW TO READ A BOOK, clearly articulated what I had discovered on my own.Most people read at an elementary level. Common print media -- newspapers, magazines -- are geared to this first level, that of eighth or ninth grade. Reading at this level is simple and unsophisticated. It is a fairly simple procedure. As someone once said, &quot;You just pick up a book and look at every word until you've seen them all.&quot;The second level of reading is inspectional. Two steps are performed simultaneously. The reader skims, or pre-reads, by studying the title page, preface, table of contents, index, dust jacket and a chapter or two. He thumbs through the book, reading a bit here and there. Then he reads the entire book superficially without bothering whether he understands it or not. I might argue that if you don't understand what you're reading, you're not reading at all. However, this is the kind of reading I do when I'm selecting a book to review. It is just the beginning.Adler and Van Doren argue that this kind of superficial reading can prepare a reader for enjoying more difficult works. &quot;The tremendous pleasure that can come from reading Shakespeare, for example, was spoiled for generations of high school students who were forced to go through 'Julius Caesar,''As You Like It,' or 'Hamlet' scene by scene, looking up all the strange words in a glossary and studying all the footnotes,&quot; write the authors. &quot;As a result, the never read a Shakespeare play. By the time they reached the end, they had forgotten the beginning and lost sight of the whole...They should have been encouraged to read the play at one sitting and discuss what they got out of that first quick reading. Only then would they have been ready to study the play carefully and closely because then they would have understood enough of it to learn more.&quot;The book describes how to be an active reader. A clue for the average reader: Active readers don't go to sleep over books. The third level of reading is analytical reading, which is what book reviewers do. The reader classifies the book, reads it carefully, determines the author's message and evaluates how well it's presented and compares it to comparable works.Adler and Van Doren cover subjects like classifying books, x-raying them, determining the author's message, how to criticize a book fairly, and the role of relevant experience in reading. They then go on to describe the different approaches to various kinds of reading -- practical books, imaginative literature, plays, stories, poems, history, science, mathematics, social sciences, and philosophy.The highest level of reading, synoptical reading, is the reading of several books on a particular subject. They describe how to select a bibliography (which I found truly useful), how to narrow the subject, how to inspect the material. The five steps of synoptical reading are included in this chapter.Reading is a search for truth, and truth can be found only through thoughtful comparison and discussion. &quot;The truth then, insofar as it can be found -- the solution to the problem, insofar as that is available to us -- consists rather in the ordered discussion itself than in any set of propositions or assertions about it...thus, in order to present this truth to our minds -- and to the minds of others -- we have to do more than merely ask and answer the questions. We have to ask them in a certain order, and be able to defend that order.&quot;Sunnye Tiedemann (aka Ruth F. Tiedemann)"},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"Now in my last year of law school, I found myself extremely angry upon completing this book.

If you think many books are too difficult for you, this book will explain that that is exactly why you must read it. If you want to learn how to form your own opinions on important works of literature in any field, this book teaches you the art of critique. However, I applaud this book not only because it is good instruction for those who want to become better readers. It also explains *why* we must become better readers.

A friend of mine recommended this book during my first year of college. I had been struggling through my literature and history classes, bogged down with reading. In the book Mr. Adler taught me what it means to really read and listen and to extract meaning from a work. I have applied my reading skills not only to books but also my relationships.

It outlines a series of steps that if practiced will lead to a greater understanding of a book's meaning than the methods usually taught in today's schools. I wish it hadn't taken me as long as it did to find this book. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to increase their ability to learn and understand any subject at all."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"This book is a must read for anyone who is serious about his/her reading. The authors offer some perceptive tips, suggestions and ideas that are aimed at helping the average person imporve his/her reading skill. This is a book for graduate students who need the best 'how to' techniques to help them get the most out of their reading. This is also a book for the serious reader who is not content with turning page after page - going through the mechanical motions of reading. This is a book for anyone who believes that reading a book is a small life-changing exercise.The authors begin by distinguishing between 4 levels of reading and provide techniques and examples for each level. What I found to be especially interesting are the chapters on how to read the different subjects: The authors introduce a single methodolgy for effective reading and then proceed to customize it for reading books on the sciences, philosophy, literature, fiction, etc.Even if you consider yourself an effective reader, you'll be surprised at some of the insights that you will receive from this book. This is an excellent book, well written and well researched and it should be on every reader's shelf."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"Adler does exactly what he promises in the title. He tells you how to read a book. I read this book for a high school rhetoric class and though we read it in three weeks, I was so impacted by it that I have tried to apply his many suggestions.He covers reading very thoroughly. Ideally, when we read a book, we first grasp what the author is saying (the who's and what's), then what he means, then how that relates to our life. These three steps fit into the first three levels of reading. The first asks 'What is the book saying?,' the second 'What type of book is it?,' and the third 'What does the book mean?.' There is another level which basically is a topical study- reading books to find what various authors say about a given topic.Adler recognizes that we often don't get much from a book because we don't know how to read well. (He covers the relationship between reader and writer and their responsibilities toward each other)So for each level he gives rules and suggestions for how to read on that level. Often these are in the form of questions to ask that book.Another thing Adler recognizes is that not all books are equal. Many books only need to be read on the first level, some on the second, and a few on the third. This also affects how fast one reads. The speed should match the difficulty, importance, and quality of the reading- even within the same book.In addition to covering the four reading levels, Adler takes different types of books and gives specific applications of his suggestions to these books. You would not ask the same questions of a history book that you would of a play.Oh and Adler provides exercises and a very good reading list to get you started on the road to good reading.So Adler is very thorough and logical in his presentation and the reading is very enjoyable. His style is easy to understand and interesting at the same time. He covers some other topics here and there like reading education and the great books. This is an excellent book for both students (life long learners included) and those who just want to learn and enjoy books more."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"It's a common misconception that a person who has read a large number of books is therefore \\"well read\\". To be in fact well read according to this book's author, would be indicated not by the amount of books read, but by how well the books were read. Reading well is what \\"How To Read A Book\\" is all about.This book is a course on the anatomy of a book, the peeling of its contents in exposing the central theme or message of its author. This is accomplished by the structured, methodical autopsy performed by the reader, who, in extracting the central contents, is rewarded with a much deeper and increased understanding.Reading is looked upon by the author as an art. The reading of a good book, one that stretches you mentally, takes a high degree of skill and is a major exertion. It is very active. The reader, armed with pen in hand, is taking notes, underlining principle ideas, noting structure, asking questions of the author, thinking, concentrating. It is by no means passive.This book comes highly recommended and is a real treasure. It will be with you for life (I am currently on my second copy, the first having been retired and permanently shelved following much use). One final word of note- It is the authors' goal to present the \\"Ideal\\" form of reading, however it is also the authors' understanding that not many readers have the time nor the desire to read every book in this manner (given the unlimited amount of time in both analytical and syntopical readings described in the book, it could take years of study if a person elected to do so). It is the authors' assertion that \\"you are a good reader to the degree in which you approximate it\\"."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"How To Read A Book by Mortimer J. Adler and Charles Van Doren is a very useful book for anyone wishing to give their books a more thoughtful, in-depth reading.The book does have an agenda to push. That agenda is to see more people go beyond high school reading levels. The authors begin by reviewing how America got to the point where almost everyone could read, but very few people could read well. They offer the techniques in this book as a path from this superficial knowledge of reading to a deeper understanding of how to read more effectively and more deeply.The book breaks down the levels of reading. They present four levels of reading: Elementary, Inspectional, Analytical, and Syntopical.The most time and attention is given to Analytical writing. The authors present ways to read more analytically. They also lay out rules for giving a book a fair analytical reading. I found this part very helpful personally.The other three levels of reading are treated in much less detail. Each is more presented than taught. The authors demonstrate how each level is dependent on the one preceding it.This book is very well put together and nicely laid out. One can tell that this was a labor of love by the authors. A feature that I found particularly interesting was the suggested reading list in the back of the book.How To Read A Book will be helpful to any reader who desires to learn how to read more deeply. I recommend it."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"Tuesday, 6 December 2011About 130 years ago, Gustave Flaubert (Author of Madam Bovary) made the following remark,\\"What a scholar one might be if one knew well only some half a dozen books.\\"To be a good reader has always been the aspiration of all great minds.I realised very acutely the deficiencies in my reading skills when I found that my comprehension of some of the great books had been really low .By a stroke of chance , I reread some of these great books very slowly and analytically , and realised my mistakes.I am an ambitious reader but the time to read great books is just not enough , due to other demands on my time .You cannot buy time as you can buy books.This left me with the only option : To revisit the way I read books .I have realised that rapid reading need not be good reading .Also , wide reading need not be good reading. I also read Nabakov's \\"Lectures on Literature.\\"I also understood with Nabakov(Author of Lolita) that to understand and appreciate a master writer or a master artist , the reader should have and use imagination, intelligence and energy.The reader has to be deserving.I am aware that in the era of Kindle and e-books , printed books are fast losing the race, but even to comprehend and appreciate a creative work on the cyber space , you need a similar skills- set, similar mind and similar imagination.Mortimer J. Adler wrote this book in 1940 , but it is needed more now than when he wrote it . This book is a living classic.It is long , with 426 pages , and is a serious work about proper reading .It has been translated into five languages,French,Swedish,German , Spanish ,Italian.What really makes a good reader? Vladimir Nabakov answers this question as follows:\\"A good reader is one who has imagination, memory , a dictionary and some artistic sense. .. .\\"He also says that the best temperament for a reader to have , or to develop, is a combination of the artistic and the scientific one.This applies to the reader of fiction as well as science.The boundary between the work of fiction and work of science is not as clear as is generally believed.In fact , a good novel has the \\"merging of the precision of poetry and the intuition of science.\\".While there is a case of improving ourselves as a person , there is always a scope to improve in the art of reading .As Nabakov says , one cannot read a book:one can only reread it .A good reader , an active reader is a re- reader.When we read a book , the very process of learning stands between us and artistic appreciation.It is only on second or subsequent readings that we appreciate the book .\\"How to read a book\\" describes the four levels of reading:1.Elementary reading2Inspectional reading3.Analytical reading4.Syntopical readingReading is an art.Our goal is to acquire higher levels of skill in this art.Reading skill is taught and learnt in the schools in the first six grades.But at that age and stage, we do not reach the limit of efficiency in reading .Often , we remain poor and incompetent readers.The authors make it clear that good reading is not speed reading .The main purpose of good reading is to gain understanding and appreciation of the book .These rules of reading can be applied not only to books but also to newspapers,magazines , articles,pamphlets, and even advertisements.Reading is active.It is less like receiving a blow and more like catching the ball in a game of baseball.Reading requires us to be alert and awake .We must not daydream while reading.Books can be categorised into practical or theoretical books,imaginative literature(poetry,novels, plays, stories) or history, science or mathematics, Social sciences , philosophy, reference books , journalism and advertising.While the general rules of good reading remain the same , there are some differences when you read a fiction or non-fiction .Fiction satisfies many conscious as well as unconscious needs of a reader.When you read the work of fiction, you have the experience that the author tried to produce for you by working on your imagination and emotions.There is magic as well as sensual imagery.\\"The logic of expository writing aims at an ideal of unambiguous explicitness.Nothing should be left between the lines.Everything that is relevant and statable should be said as explicitly and clearly as possible.In contrast,imaginative writing relies as much upon what is implied as upon what is said.The multiplication of metaphors puts almost more content between the lines than in the words that compose them.The whole poem or story says something that none of its words say or can say.\\"You do not look for terms, propositions and arguments in imaginative literature.It is necessary to read more than one account of the history of an event or period if we want to understand it.Similarly , in case of philosophy books , sometimes it takes years to read , and many reading and re-readings.Reading has three purposes:1.Entertainment2.Information3.Understanding /appreciatingUnderstanding and appreciating is the most important purpose.Our continuous education depends on books and reading them with understanding. To be widely read is not the same thing as to be well read.A person who reads too widely but not well is Literate ignoramus.He is at par with an ignorant person .Reading is similar to listening .It is an active process.It is never effortless.Thinking as well as imagination is a part of reading.Inspectional reading is also called skimming systematically .You allow yourself a fixed time(say one hour) and within that time , you complete the book or part of the book .You can then answer the question'\\"What is this book about?\\"The main aim of inspectional reading is to discover whether the book needs a more careful reading.Some important steps in inspectional reading are as below:1.Look at the title page and the preface .Read these quickly.2.Study carefully the table of contents.3.Check the index , the kind of books , authors and crucial terms appearing in the index.4.Read the publisher's blurb on the jacket.5.Look at the chapters that seem pivotal to its argument.6.Thumb through the book .Read a paragraph or two , sometimes several pages in sequence.read the last few pages .Done in this way , inspectional reading can give a value for a reader.Analytical reading is thorough and complete.In Bacon's words, it means \\"chewing and digesting \\" a book .In syntopical reading , you read many books on the same subject and compare them.After comparing , you create an analysis of the subject , which may not be in any of the books.Syntopical reading is is the most active and most effortful reading.We are expected to master our elementary reading in our primary and junior high school .If we have done so , we should begin a book with inspectional reading .A good inspectional reading will help us to decide whether we should go for thorough analytical reading .Finally , analytical reading of one book will help us to decide whether we should go for reading synoptically a number of other books on the same subject .The preparation for an examination requires a synoptical reading on the chosen subject .We need to institute courses in analytical and synoptical reading in high schools and colleges.Only the we can hope to become a nation of competent readers.As the literacy spreads , we need more and more people to be trained in higher levels of reading .Inspectional reading is done twice.First stage is systematic skimming.The second stage is superficial reading.In this , you read the book through at least once , before you do analytical reading ,pay attention to what you can understand and do not be stopped by what you can not immediately grasp.Concentrate on what you do understand.Superficial reading is the first necessary step in the interpretation of a book 's contentsNormally , inspectional reading is faster than analytical reading However , there is every need to read faster , depending on the material we are reading .One effective way to increase the speed is this;\\"Place your thumb and first two fingers together and sweep this pointer across a line of type, a little faster than is comfortable for your eyes to move Force yourself to keep up with your hand.You will soon be able to read the words as you follow your hand.Keep practising this, and keep increasing the speed at which your hand moves, and before you know, it will have doubled or trebled your reading speed.\\"Concentration in reading means not day dreaming, and not letting the mind wander.Speed reading achieves concentration.But concentration alone does not lead to comprehension or understanding.Sometimes comprehension requires days, or weeks, or even years.Speed reading therefore, need not improve our comprehension and need not be given too much importance.It is generally desirable to skim or do inspectional reading of even a book that we intend to read carefully, to get some idea of its form and structure.The four questions a good reader must ask are :1.What is the leading theme of the book ?2.What are the main assertions and arguments?3.What does your own mind say about what the book says?Is what the book says true?4.Is the book important to know?Will you seek what follows or is further implied or suggested?Marking a book is an expression of your differences or your agreements with the author.Marking a book gives you intellectual ownership of the book.Seven devices for marking a book are :1.Underlining,circling key words or phrases, vertical lines at the margin.2.Star or asterisk at the margin to mark the most important passages.3.Numbers to indicate the sequence of points.4.Numbers of other pages which make the same points or contradict them.5.Notes in the margin, at the top, bottom and in the end papers at the back of the book.6.The front end papers for a record of your thinking.7.You can make notes during Inspectional reading also, not only during analytical reading.There are three kinds of note making:1.Structural notes at the time of inspectional reading .2.Conceptual notes at the time of analytical and synoptical reading.3.Dialectical notes at the time of synoptical reading.The title of the book as well as the chapter headings need to be read carefully.Analytical reading has 15 rules :1.Classify the book according to kind and subject matter.2.State what the whole book is about in a single sentence, or at most a few sentences(a short paragraph).3Enumerate the major parts of the book in their order and relation, and outline these parts as you have outlined the whole.4.Find out and define the problem or problems the author is trying to solve.5.Find the important /key words and through them , come to terms with the author.6.Mark the most important sentences in a book and discover the leading propositions that the author is making .7.Locate or construct the basic arguments in the book by finding them in the connection of sentences.In other words , find if you can the paragraphs in a book that state its important arguments.But if the arguments are not thus expressed, your task is to construct them by taking a sentence from this paragraph ,and one from that, until you have gathered together the sequence of sentences that state the propositions that compose the author's arguments.8.Find out what the author's solutions are.Determine which of his problems the author has solved and which he has not;and as to the latter, decide which the author knew he had failed to solve.9.Do not begin to talk back until you have listened carefully and are sure you understand.You must be able to say with reasonable certainty,\\"I understand\\" before you can say any of the following things;\\"I agree\\", or \\"I disagree\\"., or \\"I suspend my judgement\\".10.When you disagree, do so reasonably and not disputatiously or contentiously.11.Respect the difference between knowledge and mere personal opinion, by giving reasons for any critical judgement you make.12.Show wherein the author is uninformed.13.Show wherein the author is misinformed.14.Show wherein the author is illogical .15.Show wherein the author's analysis or account is incomplete.You should not read any commentary by someone else until after you have read the book .Both inspectional and analytical reading can be considered as preparation for syntopical reading.The seven steps in syntopical reading are as below:1.Create a tentative bibliography of your subject by recourse to library catalogues, advisers and bibliographies in books.2.Inspect all the books on the tentative bibliography to ascertain which are germane to your subject and also to acquire a clearer idea of the subject.3.Inspect the books already identified above in order to find the most relevant passages.4.Bring the authors to terms by constructing a mental terminology of the subject that all, or the great majority of the authors can be interpreted as employing, whether they actually employ the words or not.5.Establish a set of neutral propositions for all the authors by framing a set of questions to which all or most of the authors can be interpreted as giving answers, whether they actually treat the questions explicitly or not.6.Define the issues, both major or minor ones, by ranging the opposing answers of authors to the various questions on one side of an issue or another.You should remember that an issue does not always exist explicitly between or among authors, but that it sometimes has to be constructed by interpretation of the authors' views on matters that may not have been their primary concern .7.Analyse the discussion by ordering the questions and issues in such a way as to throw maximum light on the subject.More general issues should precede less general ones, and relations among issues should e clearly indicated.Syntopical reading pose the following paradox\\"Unless you know what books to read , you cannot read syntopically, but unless you can read syntopically, you do not know what to read\\".8"},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"I just finished reading Mortimer J.

It will continue to be that way. Currently, I am also a prolific & voracious reader. Amazon, followed by Alibris & Abebooks, plus Kinokuniya Bookweb, are currently my active sources of books.Towards the end of 1991, as part of my journey through mid-life transition, I actually established a small retail store to deal exclusively in learning, thinking & creativity books & other resources, in conjunction with the formation of my own strategy consulting business. Since then (& till mid-2004 when I decided to withdraw from all retail operations), the store gave me abundant access to a lot of great books & other useful resources. At the same time, it fueled & bankrolled my relentless reading pursuits.One of the first few books I have read & eventually sold in my own store was \`How to Read a Book' by Mortimer Adler.It was also the first book that set the ball rolling in my continuing search for better understanding of the reading faster/better comprehension equation. This book introduced me to the four specific levels of reading & reading comprehension, each requiring a specific set of reading strategies:- elementary reading;- inspectional reading;- analytical reading;- syntopical reading;In addition, for more effective performance in the academic environment, there are subject-specific reading strategies to follow. All these reading strategies are systematically covered by the authors.The most productive personal learning experiences I got out of this wonderful book are the syntopical reading techniques, which allow me to digest several books in the same genre simultaneously. I absolutely love syntopical reading!Hence, I have no hesitation at all in considering Mortimer Adler's book, despite the fact that it was originally published in the 1940s, the best & unparalleled in the genre. I strongly recommend this book to anyone, who wants to read faster & comprehend better, to get hold of & read this book in the first instance.During the ensuing years, I came across a few other books which have influenced & helped in expanding my personal repertoire of high-performance reading skills & techniques:- Super Reading Secrets, by Howard Berg;- Breakthrough Rapid Reading, by Peter Kump;- PhotoReading, by Paul Scheele;I will review each of them separately & share with readers what I have learned specifically."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"A book with great ideas IF you're attempting to tackle the \\"great classics\\".

You can only make a photocopy of a photocopy so many times.You'll find this book useful if you see yourself tackling difficult material in the near future. This means anything written by one of the \\"greats\\" (culturally significant) or any sort of difficult college-level-and-up literature.He bemoans that in our times, not enough people are reading /critically/, and even less are looking at the \\"classics\\". Therefore about 1/3 of the book is dedicated to railing against the Western education system. Lots of stuff about how magazines and newspapers are toxic to society. An interesting read, but takes far too long to get to the crux of the matter.Essentially, this book is a plea for readers to care about books, and to think critically while reading books. When he finally gets to specific tactics (outlining, summarizing, reading other titles in the genre), there is no a-ha eureka lightbulb moment, just a series of semi-obvious ideas that you find yourself nodding along with in agreement.The author says something near the start of the book that captures his general idea: Give books the same mental energy you would to a love letter, or a car manual when your auto breaks down on the highway in the middle of the night.

Most of the bulk of the book is taken by the \\"rules\\" of Analytical Reading. That level is also divided into certain \\"stages\\", and I can't help objecting to how those stages are introduced in this book.By page 94 the book has covered the first four rules of Analytical Reading, and then you are suddenly told that those four rules belong to a so called \\"first stage\\" of Analytical Reading. The book goes on with further chapters and further rules, but you aren't told in advance how many rules or how many stages Analytical Reading will involve in total. And pages go on and on, and rules keep coming, and still you are not told. Only by page 163 (roughtly at half the book) you are finally shown the list of all rules (FIFTEEN in total) of all THREE stages of Analytical Reading, which were being covered in this sort of blind way (for the reader) since page 59. This sort of bottom-up approach, at least for me, was seriously exasperating. Why the authors didn't simply start showing such list of stages and rules to be covered, I really can't say. Maybe they thought the \\"mystery\\" would keep the interest of some readers (?). I don't know, but for me that approach was a poor choice; it was annoying and infuriating. It took me a while to read this book just because of that.The above can give you an idea of how the method is presented in the book: with lots of embedded lists and enumerations of rules, and stages, and steps. In other words, with lots of structure. Seems organized, but presented in the chosen bottom-up approach I described might appear to be not as clear, or too detailed or overstructured at first.In spite of that rant, the book is a great read, and the recommended method (in spite of how it is presented) is definitely worth adopting.One of the recommended rules is to always read the book through at least once, even if not understanding some points in it. Just as in a movie. A first viewing of a movie might not let you understand everything, but you have to watch it fully that first time, without interruptions. Same with a book. And in particular, I think the same applies to this very book on how to read.The book states that reading and listening are basically the same art -the art of being taught. I definitely agree with that.All in all, a highly recommended read."},{"Title":"How to Read a Book","review":"That book is right here on my shelf beside my desk, and there is a reason for it.

Like Dante, they lived in a mental world which is now remote and foreign. No matter how universal Shakespeare, or Ben Jonson, or Christopher Marlowe, may seem, it is easy to miss the points of their statements, take the commonplace for the original, the new for the ordinary, and generally impose our own thoughts on their words.This was in fact the common practice in the eighteenth and nineteenth century (with some honorable exceptions), but some of the great scholars of the Victorian Age began to try to restore the intellectual context of an epoch that was no longer entirely medieval, but not really modern. Their approach gradually filtered down to students through articles and commentaries. Or, as in this case, an independent introduction to the subject.For over half of the twentieth century, E.M.W. Tillyard's handy summary of \\"The Elizabethan World Picture\\" gave countless undergraduates, and many curious readers, a short introduction to an often unfamiliar world. A world in which your health rested on a proper balance of humours, which were not your reaction to jokes, but substances flowing through your body. A world in which the Four Elements (Earth, Air, Fire, and Water) were part of a hierarchy beginning with God, and including all the ranks of human beings. A world which was beginning to crumble, as the Eternal Truths of Christianity became contingent on political events, and which needed reassurance, even in popular entertainment.Tillyard was an interesting critic (he had a famous debate on critical theory with C.S. Lewis, published as \\"The Personal Heresy\\"). His major works include a full study of Shakespeare's History Plays, in which he worked out in detail their relation to Elizabethan political theory. It is a little ironic that he may be best known for this short textbook, in which he did not set out to say anything particularly new or original. There are longer, more comprehensive, and far better documented books on the subjects he covers in \\"The Elizabethan World Picture,\\" but it would be hard to find so convenient and focussed an entrance into this particular lost world of the imagination."},{"Title":"The Elizabethan world picture","review":"I don't know enough about the Elizabethan time to know what this book may have left out, but I found it utterly fascinating.People today seem so proud of their own scientific views and look down on older ones as so obviously out of date, but they fail to recognize that given what the people of the time had access to, their worldview was just as consistent with the then known facts as 'ours' is today.Some day the prevalent worldview may become blatantly wrong according to new facts, and maybe some day people will read about it and be as fascinated by 'our'worldview as I am by the Elizabethan.This book does a wonderful job of describing the fantastically interconnected parts that make up the Elizabethan worldview, and I find it something worth using to understand and read things written at the time and to remember as metaphor for today."},{"Title":"The Elizabethan world picture","review":"Although this book is short and readable, it contains a lot of general information about the Elizabethan world picture. The book doesn't get bogged down in scholarly details, and can be read and understood at the junior high level and above. You needn't be interested in Shakespeare to read this; however, any reading of him, or his contemporaries, will be a fuller reading after looking at this book."},{"Title":"The Elizabethan world picture","review":"When I was a student some four decades ago this book was often regarded as having proved unequivocally that the simplistic hierarchical view of the world presented by Tillyard as Elizabethan was indeed that; that all Elizabethans, without question, fully held the beliefs he imputed to them.What is clear is that a number of Elizabethans did hold such beliefs, and that Tillyard does prove as much. But anyone reading e.g. Shakespeare's *Richard II* with Tillyard's book in mind could see that it did not &quot;work&quot;: that Shakepeare is divided in his response to events. Richard may see himself as protected by &quot;divine right&quot; - by God himself - but the play leaves one in doubt whether he actually is. Yet Bolingbroke's actions - although Richard gives him the throne too readily - can easily be seen to be those of a usurper. Such complexities cannot be resolved by an appeal to Tillyard's book, and shows its very severe limits: an intelligent Elizabethan like Shakespeare could obviously see beyond Tillyard's &quot;model&quot;!However, the influence of Tillyard's book been enormous, and much modern (or should that be &quot;post-modern&quot;?) nonsense that would see Shakespeare as purely &quot;subversive&quot; or providing &quot;Shakespearean texts&quot; which serve as a &quot;site&quot; for &quot;conflict&quot; within his society can either be refuted by knowledge of Tillyard's model or be seen as nothing other than a modification of it, whereby the model remains structurally intact but has different values assigned to it (along the lines of &quot;we all know that the Elizabethans thought hierarchically, but you - a right-winger - approve of such a view whereas I, as a left-winger, don't&quot;).Readers interested in the Reniassance who don't own a copy should get one, as this remains a very important text to refer to, containing much valuable and unreplaced information. - Joost Daalder, Professor of English, Flinders University, South Australia"},{"Title":"The Elizabethan world picture","review":"My high school principal told me to read this book.

But unless you read this book, you really have no hope of understanding Shakespeare. First published more than half a century ago, Tillyard to this day is utterly readable and dead-on correct about the way the Elizabethans viewed the world. What almost everybody misses about Shakespeare is that he was essentially a conservative, dedicated to supporting the government which allowed his plays to be performed; this book explains why all of Shakespeare's plays support the established order, and crush anyone who would defy that order -- even in the comedies, the order of the world is restored to where it belongs. Tillyard's book should be mandatory for anyone who thinks they understand Shakespeare -- or who wants to understand Shakespeare."},{"Title":"The Elizabethan world picture","review":"This work gives a picture of the Elizabethean (1580-1605) world- view which Tillyard underlies the work of Shakespeare and the Elizabethan dramatists, Milton and Donne.

The fundamental idea of an ordered Chain of Being transformed by Renaissance thought is at the heart of the work.I do not know enough about Elizabethan history to say how accurate the picture Tillyard draws is. But he gives a fascinating picture of the underlying belief- system of one of the great literary ages of all times."},{"Title":"The Elizabethan world picture","review":"I must agree with the South Australian with the review entitled: \\"Onesided and simplistic but enduringly useful.\\" This little volume, along with Lovejoy's more ambitious \\"The Chain of Being,\\" did wonders in helping me crank out Shakespeare term papers as an undergraduate and graduate student. But now that I've left such training wheels behind, I'm perhaps in a better position to issue a few cautionaries. It's not just Richard III who represents a contradiction that violates Tillyard's blueprint but Henry V who, far from representing the exemplary Shakespearean king, becomes a ruthless imperialist invader and sadistic despot, sacrificing innocent women and children simply to make a point. Moreover, the very spokesperson for the stable Elizabethan world picture, Ulysses (\\"Troilus and Cressida\\"), proves a vulgar, hypocritical antithesis to his own rosy view.Regard Tillyard's representation as, at best, a \\"freeze frame\\" of the action occurring in Shakespeare's actual language. Approach it as a useful template, or mere starter, for opening a discussion on Shakespeare's churning, rapidly changing meanings, but resist the temptation to interpret the text through the template (unless you don't mind having your head handed back to you). In fact, the scheme's usefulness may be that it served the poet as an organizing tool or convenient metaphor, an alloy to be disposed of once the text was in place, inviting the reader's participation in the life of the language. At that point, we need to jettison the framework, lest it obscure and even distort our view of a character as non-categorizable, life-like and inexhaustible as Falstaff."},{"Title":"The Elizabethan world picture","review":"A must-read book. Anyone who is starting or have been studying Shakespeare have to read this book, and then, come back to the plays.Easy to read, small, but doesn't contain too many notes about the works that are used (what isn't good).I had a very nice time reading it many times.One last thing, if you want to read the history plays, this is the very stating point. No doubt about it!"},{"Title":"The Elizabethan world picture","review":"This compilation of Renaissance historical tidbits ( dress, manners, etc) is just what is needed if one hopes to navigate the waters of the period."},{"Title":"The Elizabethan world picture","review":"Another voice in the chorus of those who appreciate this little book. Small in heft yet pregnant with wisdom.That sounds a little Shakespearean, yes?"},{"Title":"The Elizabethan world picture","review":"I bought this book for a class. It's very informing if you are interested in the themes of Shakespearean works. Otherwise, it's pretty boring. But it was short and in very good condition. I still don't know what I made in the class so I don't know how I did on the summary of the book I had to write but it was fairly easy to understand."},{"Title":"The Elizabethan world picture","review":"In response to &quot;Doc's&quot; review: how can anyone say you cannot understand Shakespeare if you haven't read this book? How silly! Do you not get that Shakespeare is timeless? Shakespeare's play are not documentaries. And this idea to label him &quot;conservative&quot; is silly and irrelevant. Shakespeare's work still lives because it speaks to something human that transcends world views, politics, and years. These are relationships playing out their lives in the imagination of an artist, not elitist agendas that normal people with active imaginations may or may not understand."},{"Title":"The Secret of Secrets (Golden Palm Series)","review":"This book is a great introduction to the mystical thought of Ash-Sheikh Aj-Jilani. Anyone who has any interest in finding the true, simple meaning of life, or seeks self purification should start with this book. Keep in mind, if you haven't read about mysticism/sufism before, you need to keep an open mind as to his wording and his actions. He does mention things in a way that the average person would deem, arrogant or self centered, but this man was beyond anything even closely related to that. This translation is better than others found, however the English, in terms of grammar and usage, can be unusual. But I find it a more closer translation in terms of Arabic usage. I hope anyone who reads this will be as enlightened as I was."},{"Title":"The Secret of Secrets (Golden Palm Series)","review":"This is one of those rare books which, no matter how many superlatives one uses, one cannot fathom its reality. The language is wonderfully lucid, clear and yet still poetic and enchanting. Indeed, Shaykh Abd al Qadir al Jilani, who by concensus is regarded as THE greatest Saint in Islam amongst the latter generations (i.e. exluding the Prophet's generation and the two generations after him), and whose honorific title is &quot;Al-Ghawth al 'Azam&quot; (The Greatest Helper) to reflect his unparalleled rank in the spiritual heirarchy of Saints, is THE Perfect Guide to all those on the Sufi path or those interested in the mystical way. This book is unique in that anyone at any level can read it and he or she will no doubt benefit but in reality it is a book which contains in it the secrets of Existence itself except that one has to be on a high spiritual station oneself to truly understand the great wisdoms and oceans of spiritual knowledge contained herein. Each chapter is short and succint yet contains an ocean of hidden meanings. Each person takes from it according to his level. Though I cannot say how accurate this intepretation is to the original as I dont know Arabic, I can voachsafe that for all English speaking Muslims (and non-Muslims interested in Islamic mysticism or in the Way to God) this book is a must-have and truly unique and the English language employed is wonderful to read. (It will be interesting to compare it to Muhtar Holland's translation of the same work by Al-Baz Publications). This is poetic prose if you will containing hidden secrets!The lengthy and beautiful introduction by Shaykh Tosun is a brilliant synopsis of the life and works of His Excelleny Shaykh of Shaykhs, Shaykh Abd al Qadir al Jilani (may Allah be pleased with him and with us for his sake!) and a great introduction to this greatest of Muslim Saints. It gives a glimpse of the exalted status and spirituality of this amazing human being.A must read!"},{"Title":"The Secret of Secrets (Golden Palm Series)","review":"Abd al-Qadir al-Jilani is the least known of the three poles of Sufism, which are: knowledge - El-Arabi; love - Rumi and power - al-Jilani.After I read The Secret of Secrets, I also read al-Jilani's Ghunyat al-Talibin in an English translation, in which I found very little of interest. This raises the question of the importance of finding the right translation and at the same time makes clear that there is no way of knowing how good the translation is without knowing the original language, in this case Arabic.At least in the English version this book is full of power!The Secret of Secrets repeats the secret so many times that it is no more a secret! The book is full of wisdom and deep insight into the workings of the Ego and the Unity with the Absolute, also called Allah.Al-Jilani has a fairly peculiar view on seclusion and solitude, which I found hilarious; he says that those who withdraw from life do it to save people in the world from his undesirable character and existence. Something to reflect upon!"},{"Title":"The Secret of Secrets (Golden Palm Series)","review":"There are chapters in here that can speak to the 21st century seeker like they are written today and yet it is from over 600 years ago.

First, there were no maps to guide one along as to his whereabouts and second, Chapter 2 (and the first few pages of Chapter 3) was so long and monotonous I almost put it down. I'm glad I did continue reading though, as this was one heck of a book! George Frederick Ruxton was a restless young man from England who traveled to Spain (the boring chapter), Ireland, Africa, Canada, Mexico and finally to the American West in the 1840's. His writing is so vivid, descriptive and lifelike as to what it was like in those days, it's as if you were traveling right along next to him suffering from the intense, bitter cold of a Rocky Mountain winter, to shooting buffalo, deer and big horn sheep for food, getting his mules across frozen rivers, dodging Indians and renegade Mexicans, descibing geological landforms, along with the flora, fauna and local people he encounters. It is sad that he died at such a young age, his name may have been amongst the literary giants. His &quot;Life in the Far West&quot; and &quot;Adventures in Mexico and the Rocky Mountains&quot; are classics now. I enjoyed the book. A page turner (after chapter 2)!"},{"Title":"The Real You: Become the Person You Were Meant to Be","review":"I don't usually read self-knowledge/self-help books, and even more rarely finish them. The genre tends to suffer from poor writing, overuse of jargon, academic axe-grinding, and the smug tendency of the authors to try and jam you into their pet, pigeon-holed theories. (I wonder how many of those authors are first-borns, and if that's part of the problem for this last-born son?) I found &quot;The Real You&quot; to be mercifully free of all the flaws listed above, as well as a highly illuminating and pleasurable read. In fact, I not only finished &quot;The Real You&quot;, I read it twice! (And so did two of the people I subsequently gave it to!) Dr. Leman presents four different methods of looking into your personality, and manages to do so without being either superficial or unwieldy. His acknowledged specialty is birth order, but the other sections are excellent too; the birth order part is also remarkably handy for starting party conversations that aren't banal. More importantly, this book may enable you to have some of the conversations you've never gotten around to with your loved ones. In summary, if you were to read only one self-knowledge book in a decade, I'd recommend &quot;The Real You.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Real You: Become the Person You Were Meant to Be","review":"The book provides a good basis for thinking about who you are and what you are looking for in life. Starting with personality theory, the author talks about the core personality traits of the 4 main personalities choleric, sanguine, melancholy, phlegmatic. Then moving to birth order, he talks about how we are influenced by our family, specifically the ways we learn to get attention. Then discussing childhood memories, he makes the point that our earliest memories are the story of who we are that has the most meaning to us - memories that we've subconsciouslly selected, perhaps even editted, that represent us and how we relate to the world. Lastly, Leman discusses love languages - how to understand what makes you feel loved, and how to let the people you love know you love them, in a way that means the most to them. So once you understand yourself, and know the kind of person to look for in a mate, you can keep the person you find!This is a pretty good book. There are gaps, details that get missed, and some of the subjects he talks about really just give you enough information to get the gist of it, without too much detail. There are lots of examples to explain more what he means, but I found myself with a lot of questions. Yet, I would still recommend the book, and rated it 4 stars, because it covers the ideas it does present in a clear, understandable, readable way. The different parts of the book blend together well, and I found myself with a much stronger idea of who I am after reading this book and thinking about what it had to say."},{"Title":"The Real You: Become the Person You Were Meant to Be","review":"I found this book in the mark down bin at the local books store and am so glad I brought it home. Dr. Leman touches on how birth order, early childhood memories and even your parents' style of parenting affects the development of your personality. This book provides lots of insight on things I never even thought about before. Also, his writing style is a pleasure to read, as he uses personal anecdotes to illustrate his points."},{"Title":"The Real You: Become the Person You Were Meant to Be","review":"If you are already familiar with the basic four personality types, birth order, the affect of childhood memories and love languages then this book will BORE you. However, if you are not familiar with these areas, this is a nice, INTRODUCTORY book, hence two stars instead of one. If you like reading books with lots of stories then this would be a good book for you because his points are supported by lots of stories. Personally for me, I didn't get out of it what I was looking for."},{"Title":"The Real You: Become the Person You Were Meant to Be","review":"This book is amazing.While there are some things that have been discussed in other books, the reiteration is not boring...I actually didn't even skip over any of it, because of the wonderful stories Dr. Leman uses to illustrate his points. Typically, if I've read a book before (I'm re-reading it now), I skip the boring parts. THERE ARE NO BORING PARTS!!Dr. Leman is by far my favorite Christian author. I own more books by him than any other author. His wonderful sense of humor and his ability to explain things in a way that everyone can understand are just two ways that he has reached me. I absolutely love this author. :)"},{"Title":"The Real You: Become the Person You Were Meant to Be","review":"This is a very eye opening look at what can make you tick. I had some ideas based on other personality tests, methods, etc. but Dr. Leman really illuminates the subject of birth order and it's so prevalent in day to day life that it becomes second nature to notice how birth order affects just about everything."},{"Title":"The Real You: Become the Person You Were Meant to Be","review":"I think I've liked everything Dr. Leman has written and this is no exception. It's an overview of the studies of personality types, birth order, childhood memories and love languages.

Save your money and go with his other prominent books."},{"Title":"Coaching the Matchup Press: Aggressive Defensive Principles for Winning Basketball","review":"I enjoyed this book, there was alot of very helpful ideas in the book. He goes into great detail about his 2-1-2 press and how there are only three types of press breakers and how to combat each one of these out of his press. He also talks about his run and jump part of the press, but he does not go into as much detail as the 2-1-2. This book would have gotten a 5 rating if it would have had more information on the run and jump."},{"Title":"The dove in the eagle's nest","review":"A very moving story. It traces the life of a woman who lives in a mountain castle outside of Ulm from a young girl to old age. The book also traces the lives and moral struggles of her husband and sons and so was very interesting for both our Middle School/High School son and daughter as well as ourselves. Set in the period before the Protestant Reformation, it provides an interesting portrait of the Emperor Maximilian 1459-1519 and the problem of Moslem corsairs. However, the story itself is fictional and illustrates a period rather than a course of historical events. We have enjoyed a number of Charlotte Yonge books and despite the lack of strong historical content consider this one of her best as an edifying story."},{"Title":"The dove in the eagle's nest","review":"I am taking a chance that this is a book I read when a child, in the 40s.

The book opens with her journey up the mountain, in fear and trepidation."},{"Title":"Connecticut","review":"State historian Albert E.

I think I don't have to tell you anything about the story - see the reviews of the English version for details (besides: who wants to read more about the content of such a book than the back page offers - it would spoil some of the fun since the Potter books are in part a crime story!).The translation is - judging from my reading experience - well done and worth reading. The language is not too complicated so the book qualifies as reading stuff for a foreigner wishing to practice his German reading skills. I didn't find any translation mistakes - the language sounded genuine German and was vivid and fun to read. The names (always a problem when translating) are not altered, so some of the flair that comes with the nicely selected names of the original is lost to the non-English reader. But this second book shows that this is the right way to go: there is a name-letter-puzzle which plays a key role in this book and translating that one would have been a very hard task indeed.So the translation receives 5 stars, all well earned for the content as for the translation.My final note goes to the discussion if this book is for adults as well as teenagers or not: anyone waiting for deep insights into the society, mankind and the world we live in will be disappointed when reading this book. But it is by far the best youth book I ever read, 350 fast pacing pages and I never regretted that I bought it. Nobody whants to read Joyce all the time. And when I turn too light reading stuff, I expect quality as well. Here is where this book has its place in the adult market."},{"Title":"Harry Potter und die Kammer des Schreckens","review":"I needed a book in German that would motivate me to keep at it, so that I could increase my understanding and use of German.

This is how I learned as a child, and it's still a good way to learn."},{"Title":"Harry Potter und die Kammer des Schreckens","review":"Bought as a gift for a Secret Santa thing.

This story has everything you look for in romantic suspense, plenty of romance with love scenes and suspense that will both have you waiting to exhale.The plot and storyline is so well written that in the end I was feeling sorry for Yusef and Salah and wishing them a happy ending. Maybe Ms. Sims will see fit to give them at least an honourable mention in the next installment, hint hint (I certainly hope there is one in the making). :-)Be sure if you are one of the few who haven't read ALL THE RIGHT REASONS to pick it up along with A SECOND CHANCE AT LOVE and get caught up in a ride you will not want to end.Another good read by this author is THE KEYS TO MY HEART in the A VERY SPECIAL LOVE anthology."},{"Title":"A Second Chance At Love (Arabesque)","review":"Can a woman trust a man after he has committed the crime of turning his back on her - leaving her to bear and raise his child all alone?

The heroine Toni Shaw an accomplished author is a divorced single parent with grown twin daughters.

Vannie(~.~)"},{"Title":"A Second Chance At Love (Arabesque)","review":"Janice Sims has written a story of love, family togetherness, and kidnapping underscored with action and a subplot involving mysticism surrounding seven fertility gods and goddesses. In A Second Chance at Love, the author's writing is articulate, sensitive, and tender. In this sequel to All the Right Reasons, Sims chronicles the lives of main characters Toni Shaw and Charles \\"Chuck\\" Edward Waters, along with their twin daughters Georgie and Bree and their significant others. The story unfolds in the cities of New Orleans, Boston, and San Francisco and in several locations in Africa. Before her transformation from social activist to single mother of twin daughters, she now is , at fiftysomething, Toni Shaw the noted author. She had gotten pregnant her freshman year at Berkeley and given birth to Georgie and Bree, who are an attorney and actress, respectively. The twin sisters are 33 years-old. Chuck abandoned Toni when she was pregnant because of his fear of reprisal from his elitist parents. Now, three decades-plus later, he is back in Toni's life, wooing her as he'd more relentlessly done in their youth. He's a changed man after realizing some years ago the error of his ways. He's out to prove to Toni he's changed. But can Toni believe him? For one thing, Toni is afraid of what her family and friends will think of her if she allows Chuck to steal her heart once again, especially after vowing to stay away from Chuck under all circumstances. Trust, of course, is at the core of her wavering, and she wonders if she should dare trust him after the callous manner in which he behaved years ago. As they are gradually mending bridges that separate them, Toni finds herself succumbing to his charm until he pops the question: \\"Will you marry me?\\" Toni throws herself into her work and flees to research who's behind stealing the fertility gods and goddesses in different locations around the world. Her first stopover is in Miami and eventually to Africa. Chuck knows she is trying to avoid giving him an answer. So the question has him in a quandary thinking, should he follow her or wait for her to return to his arms? Then Toni is notified that Bree has been kidnapped on location where she is shooting a film. How the villains associate Toni and Bree is somewhat of a stretch of plausibility. Nonetheless, at this point, everything else takes a back burner. However, at the same time, the author speeds up the action.

The writing was flowing and made you want to read further.He is a black homeless man ( troubled renowned painter who is missing in action). She is a white and recently jilted (left in financial problems by her former fiance) and runs a restoration business, restoring old houses to their former glory. She ends up hiring him to help her paint such a house. This is suppose to help get back on her feet financially, as well as restore some of her pride by winning a local restoration competitionI had some major problem with the plot. She asked him to move into her aparment, where he has to go through her bedroom to get to the bathroom. Say what?? Some recently homeless stranger she does not know, living in such close proximity. Say what?? She finds out he was a drug addict and promiscuous and she sleeps with him without protection and then hopes she does not get AIDS. Say what?? I fail to see how this book can be classified as romance. So Libby came off as someone who has some questionable judgement.Painter comes off as a selfish individual. After they have spent time fixing the house ( which was entered in some competion). He paints a personal message on the house, declaring his love for her, but with no regard as to how this will affect others ( 1:not his property, 2:because this gets the house disqualified from the competition which they worked so for 3: as an artist he himself would not like anyone to at their personal touch to his work, so why do it to others?? )"},{"Title":"I'll Paint The Sun (Love Spectrum Romance)","review":"An attraction that eventually leads to love can be revealed in a most unsuspecting way. Is it true that love is in the eye of the beholder and love can conquer all? I'LL PAINT A SUN by A.J. Garrotto integrates the above myths into a story that transcends all boundaries when two people become attracted to each other.Libby O'Neill, part owner of Liberty Restorations, comes home to find her partner and husband-to-be has run off with all the money that belongs to their business. She faces possible bankruptcy until another business opportunity offers Libby a way out of her financial dilemma. She anxiously accepts the contract to renovate the exterior of a beautiful Victorian home owned by a charismatic individual.While working with her best friend in the church soup kitchen, she shares her good news, and also reveals that she needs a helper. Her friend suggests that she ask one of the homeless people to give them an opportunity to work and help them make a change in their lives. She recommends a man who frequents the kitchen daily wearing a painter's cap and goes by the name of Painter. Libby is very hesitant at first, but makes the move to ask if he would be interested in working.Painter, who chose to become homeless and wander the streets to punish himself, reluctantly accepts Libby's offer of work. He holds tight the secret of his true identity and former career along with several burdens he carries on his shoulders. As Libby and Painter begin working together, a mutual attraction develops. Although Painter has much to hide from Libby, will their intimate feelings with each other be enough for him to be truthful with her? Is Libby using Painter as a rebound because of her failed relationship with her ex-fianc&eacute;?The beginning of the book started out good and kept my full attention as I continued reading page after page. However, what started out as a great storyline gradually became a little weak in substance because some of the scenarios in regards to her business partner/ex-fianc&eacute; and the owner of the home she was renovating left you hanging. There was no follow through and it really threw the storyline off leaving me wondering, is that it? What did stand out is how the author went into descriptive detail of architecture designs of exquisite old homes that really gave the reader a nice visual concept what the character Libby was doing.I'LL PAINT A SUN by A.J.

The one thing that all of these reviews have in common is that they are all positive...a fitting tribute to these books.My fourth grade teacher (Miss Roediger) read these books to us...one of my classmates was a subsriber to the series, and would bring them to class. To Beatrice and Miss Roediger, thank you!At my insistence, my parents bought me these books in the early-to-mid 60's...a tough time in my life due to my father's absence (courtesy of Uncle Sam and Vietnam). We lived in Glasgow Air Force Base, Montana, and later in Gainesville, Texas.Each time a book would arrive, I would tear the box open and have the book read within a few hours. We moved around a lot back then...but the constants in my life were my family and my extended family...Pete, Pam, Ricky, Holly, Sue, Zip, White Nose, Dave Mead, Ann Hunter, and even Joey Brill and Will Wilson. Shoreham was a gret place to escape to, and I did...many times. The times were simpler, and the reading more enjoyable.I am nearly 44 now. I have been a police officer for 21 years, and I teach at a local community college...and yet I continue to read and re-read, re-living my childhood...long gone, but never forgotten! I can recall each mystery and the outcome.There are still books around....I have the entire series...check used book stores and garage sales...and pass this rich heritage on to your children.

I now have children who would benefit from reading these great wholesome story books. (Myself, too! again.) I have looked everywhere for the series of books and haven't found a one. So I am looking for any and all books I can find. If you're reading just one book for the first time, you will want to read all of them.

On the way to their new home, they meet a boy named Joey Brill who tells them, &quot;We don't need any more kids in Shoreham. You'll be sorry if you move there.&quot; Thus, the Happy Hollisters are presented with their first mystery. Who is this boy, and why is he so mean? Next, they find out that the moving van that contained their toys is missing! The missing van also contains one of their father's inventions. Not only that, but something strange and mysterious is going on at their new house. Not only do neighbors say that their new house is haunted, but they also say that there's a treasure!Pete, Pam, Ricky, Holly and Sue must solve these mysteries, and many more. They have the help of their parents and their faithful Collie dog named Zip. In the midst of meeting new friends and exploring their new home, the Happy Hollisters find themselves in the middle of one adventure after another. In the process of solving these mysteries, they explore their town, meet neighbors, find new friends and discover clues that help them solve the many mysteries. The brave Hollisters must also face many new dangers in their new home. The family's adventures will keep you turning the page and it will be difficult to put the book down.If your children are not yet acquainted with the books, The Happy Hollisters is a good book to introduce the series. While the series can be picked up with nearly any of the books, the first one introduces the characters and gives a lot of details that will make reading the other books more enjoyable.

I'm determined to have the whole collection eventually!!"},{"Title":"The Happy Hollisters (The Happy Hollisters, No. 1)","review":"It is increasingly difficult to find The Happy Hollisters series of books. There were 33 books in the series, written between approximately 1953 and 1970. This particular edition is book #32 in the series.The Happy Hollisters are somewhat of a relic of an era gone by. The family consists of five children, Pete, Pam (Pamela), Ricky, Holly, and Sue, and their parents Mr. and Mrs. Hollister. There are also Zip, a collie, and White Nose, a cat, who also had five kittens in the first book. Mr. Hollister owns a store called The Trading Post, that sounds similar to general stores in days gone by.Throughout the series the children solve mysteries, usually as a family, including mom and dad. In this book the children find a mysterious looking little man looking in their basement window, and soon discover a host of other mysterious individuals in their home town of Shoreham. Mixed into this stew of mysterious individuals is the appearance of a flying saucer, and rumors of a monster at a nearby lake.As the story unfolds constant nemesis Joey Brill is implicated in at least one portion of the mystery, while misbehaving as he normally does.Ultimately the children discover a mystery that begins in a foreign land, only to end up practically in their back yard. The children are able to not only help solve the mystery, but show a sort of ecologicaly awareness. Note, however, that their awareness is slightly skewed as they discuss ownership of an endangered species.The Happy Hollisters series remains a reasonably good, if somewhat outdated, read for younger children, perhaps from ages 4 to 9. I suspect that by age 9 most children will be more entranced by relatively more modern pursuits. Also, many children may consider families of five children to be somewhat unusual and that may take some explaining. These books may be an excellent way to introduce children to the changes that have taken place in our society over the past half century.One last word of caution. These books are becoming very difficult to find, and thus their price varies substantially. If you are interested in reading this series you may find editions without covers that sell for less than editions with covers.I hope you enjoy The Happy Hollisters.

Mr. Hollister does not believe the children, but after Pete gets a picture of a strange man with a red hat in their basement, Mr. Hollister gets the police involved.We also meet mean Joey Brill in this book. Joey is a recurring character in this series. Joey is a bully and is generally obnoxious. As one example, Joey puts White Nose and her kittens on a plank in a lake. Rest assured that someone nearly always thwarts Joey in his attempts to be a bad kid.The story finally arrives at an exciting chase between boats and a mysterious discovery in the Hollister's new house.

She, sensing my interest in books, directed me to a shelf containing the library's collection of Happy Hollisters. I wasn't too interested at first, but with her encouragement I agreed to try one.

Uncle Russ purchased the lighthouse at Sea Gull Beach and soon the Hollister family is off to visit Uncle Russ.When the children get to Sea Gull Beach they learn that a pirate ship called the Mystery disappeared during a storm somewhere near Sea Gull Beach, and treasure hunters had been searching for the ship ever since. The children soon encounter Homer Ruffly and his father, who is mean and is leading a treasure hunting expedition for the Mystery.Though the children are not actually searching for the pirate ship, they seem to encounter items from the ship at every turn. Homer Ruffly follows them around and does mean things to the children constantly, accusing them of stealing things that Homer claims rightfully belong to his father, when in fact the items belong to the Hollisters.The Hollister children do have a lot of fun on their trip. They take boat rides on the ocean, enter a kite flying contest, and fly in a helicopter, along with hunting for the pirate ship Mystery.

The books have been lost in the shuffle of movings, and I have not a single one left. I would love to see them reprinted, and obviously there are others out here that would like this as well.

I remember perching on the arm of my Dads recliner listening intently. I read the adventures now with my children. There is a character for every child to identify with. I would love to see these rereleased, maybe updated, but it's interesting to discuss with your children the changes that have come about in the last 40 years!

Even though I am 14 and these are a nice break from the heavy reading which I have to do. I enjoy every one thoroughly. The mystery and suspense is great and the plots are very creative. Sometimes the goody-goodieness of the kids makes me sick, but thats all part of the fun of it."},{"Title":"The Happy Hollisters (The Happy Hollisters, No. 1)","review":"I was reluctant to submit a review as there's little I can add to the warm and wonderful praise already found here, but I've no qualms in writing what amounts to a love letter to these books and their creators. I first encountered these books in the mid-1960's --- an unexpected birthday gift subscription to the Happy Hollisters (Doubleday) Book Club. To this tough little Brooklyn tyke, who much preferred 'Famous Monsters' magazine at the time, the titles of the various volumes intrigued me enough to dip into one after simply shelving and avoiding them once they arrived, and I was soon hooked! True, there were far greater thrills to be found on television or the aforementioned monster magazines, but in retrospect I think the allure to a city kid without siblings was the decidely exotic notion of a large family living in a beautiful suburb in a rambling (to use West's description!) old house set upon a lakeshore who then had the audacity to leave this perfect world on an alarmingly regular basis --- to seek out adventure! Could life really be so wonderful? West's books convinced me it could be, and surely sparked my interest in travel to far flung places quite beyond the crowded city streets that composed my world at the time.Another reader boldly declared the sensory pleasures of these books --- and how right he was! They had a unique scent all their own, and I still vividly recall the feel of the deckled page ends and the pebble texture of the bright red covers beneath the jacket too. (I always removed the covers while reading the books to keep them neat and clean --- a habit which surprised my Mom to no end.)It's all so long ago --- but small fragments of the books come to me easily while thinking about them now: The hateful neighborhood bully Jerry Brill, Mr. Hollister's American-Indian employee (who's name I can't recall, sadly) at his store, 'The Trading Post,' the Hollister's wide and varied assortment of relatives who's visit invariably heralded the start of an adventure, White Nose and her kittens (who remained kittens for the entire run of the series as far as I know) --- oh, I could go on and on. Who can forget the Hollisters arriving in NYC in a helicopter during a storm and landing atop the roof of what turned out to be their hotel? Or the hapless boy who's life was in such turmoil that he took to the Shoreham river in a rickety boat, prompting a massive seach? Well, to go on is pointless --- I know anyone who reads this can add their own memories to this list.A year or so into reading the books, I wrote a fan letter to Mr. West that couldn't have amounted to more than gibberish, but wouldn't you know --- he took the time to type out a very personal reply on special stationary emblazoned with illustrations of the Hollister kids, to thank me for writing to him and (I still find this curious but lovely) to urge me to explore other books and authors as well. A gracious author and gentleman in every sense of the word.The world has indeed moved on since then in dangerous and unexpected directions, but if one >can&lt; go home again --- albeit briefly, I know I'll enjoy visiting that rambling home on the shore of lake. Another time, another place --- but forever \\"home\\" in more ways than one."},{"Title":"The Happy Hollisters (The Happy Hollisters, No. 1)","review":"I loved these books growing up and unfortunatly they were left in the shed outside and mildewed.

I was also quite lonely. I read this book after finding it in my grandparents' attic (a treasure trove, as everyone knows). The series is about a family of sleuths ranging from ages 14 to 5.With Pete, Pam, Ricky, Holly and Sue Hollister, I was transported to a world of lighthearted mystery adventures. I traveled with the Hollister family to Switzerland, Denmark, Holland and even Cape Canaveral, Florida joining in on their adventures.These were the friends I had as a child.

I have to admit they seem so goody-too-shoes it's a bit thick at times. It just shows you how much of our and our childrens innocence has been replaced with more mature material. The Hollister's were very real to me as a child. I could lose myself in these stories for hours and hours, wondering if these kids were real and if I could ever meet them. If these stories were updated, they would make great reading for todays young readers."},{"Title":"The Happy Hollisters (The Happy Hollisters, No. 1)","review":"I picked up a copy of this at the suggestion of an Amazon reviewer. It is exceedingly difficult to find good books, especially a series of books, for a very discerning six-year old boy (now seven). A book published in the 1950's -- I figured it's stood the test of time.My son would not read the book past the first 3 or 4 pages. But it was a little advanced for a six-year old so I suggested that I read the book and he listen. No go. He couldn't even sit through the first chapter. He never did read or listen to the story.So I decided to read it myself instead. I was pretty excited to find a children's classic. And having read it, I can say that it is a good, idealized snapshot of the 50's family life. Pretty much, the back cover says it all: \\"Mrs. Hollister is always ready to meet any sudden need -- for a surprise picnic or a helping hand. [Mr. Hollister] is never too busy to play ball.\\"But the writing itself is fairly mediocre and stuff of pulp fiction. There are lots of energetic adjectives (e.g. \\"peppy\\" collie, \\"sparkling\\" blue eyes, \\"lively\\" salesmen) and exclamation points. The story itself isn't terribly interesting but everyone cries out, exclaims, gasps, shouts, etc. to create the feeling of excitement. I liken it to canned laughter on TV sitcoms. The plot is somewhat thin. In one instance, Pete just so happens to sell the most expensive canoe in his father's shop while filling in for his dad. And as it happens, the man also turns up at the river when Pete and the gang find themselves in trouble. After rescuing them, the canoe man disappears for good from the story, having served his purpose.Also, the characters are rather one-dimensional. Joey Brill, the antagonist, is consistently and inexplicably bad. He smashes store merchandise and releases the brakes on an incline-parked car for no apparent reason but to be a menace. In the latter incident Joey, in an attempt to avoid punishment, convinces his parents that he is ill and forces them to return home early from their holiday. And even the motel owner tells Pete that he is happy to see Joey go. It just doesn't make for an interesting story with complex characters.So, to new readers to the series, I would not recommend it. Others who remember it from their childhood, it's probably a nice trip down memory lane."},{"Title":"The Happy Hollisters (The Happy Hollisters, No. 1)","review":"This is a wonderful reproduction of the classic 1950's book.

Will be especially enjoyed by homeschooling families."},{"Title":"The Happy Hollisters (The Happy Hollisters, No. 1)","review":"I wrote my original review for this book back in the September 2005. At the time of my review, it was somewhat difficult to obtain to obtain books in this series. Since then, Andrew E. Svenson III and other family members have been working to re-release the Happy Hollister series for new generations. Andrew E. Svenson III is the grandson of the author.This particular book was the third in the series. The reprint has the illustrations and text of the original hardback books. Even better, the reprint is available as a Kindle book.The Happy Hollisters are somewhat of a relic of an era gone by. The family consists of five children, Pete, Pam (Pamela), Ricky, Holly, and Sue, and their parents Mr. and Mrs. Hollister. The family pets include Zip, a collie, and White Nose, a cat, who has five kittens in this book. Mr. Hollister purchases a store called The Trading Post, which sounds similar to general stores in days gone by.Throughout the series the children solve mysteries, usually as a family. In this book the children receive a ceramic lighthouse from their Uncle Russ. Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, their collie Zip accidentally knocks the lighthouse to the floor, breaking it. When the children examine the broken lighthouse, they discover a genuine emerald. Uncle Russ purchased the lighthouse at Sea Gull Beach and soon the Hollister family is off to visit Uncle Russ.When the children get to Sea Gull Beach they learn that a pirate ship called the Mystery disappeared during a storm somewhere near Sea Gull Beach, and treasure hunters had been searching for the ship ever since. The children soon encounter Homer Ruffly and his father, who is mean and is leading a treasure hunting expedition for the Mystery.Though the children are not actually searching for the pirate ship, they seem to encounter items from the ship at every turn. Homer Ruffly follows them around and does mean things to the children constantly, accusing them of stealing things that Homer claims rightfully belong to his father, when in fact the items belong to the Hollisters.The Hollister children do have a lot of fun on their trip. They take boat rides on the ocean, enter a kite flying contest, and fly in a helicopter, along with hunting for the pirate ship Mystery. The pirate theme of this Hollister book is all in good fun and younger children should be amused by the story.The Happy Hollisters series remains a reasonably good, if somewhat outdated, read for younger children, perhaps from ages 4 to 9. I suspect that by age 9 most children are entranced by more modern pursuits. Also, many children may consider families of five children to be somewhat unusual and that may take some explaining. These books may be an excellent way to introduce children to the changes that have taken place in our society over the past half century.While the original hardback books have become somewhat difficult to find, as I noted above, this edition is available once again as a paperback and a Kindle edition. With continued interest, perhaps the Svenson family will be able to reprint the entire series and entertain another generation or two of children. Even if my grandchildren do not find these books interesting, I still love them!I hope you enjoy The Happy Hollisters. They are a reminder of a simpler age.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Happy Hollisters (The Happy Hollisters, No. 1)","review":"I just have to say that as a kid, I loved these books. I still do.

Now she is being approached for one of the biggest book deals in history: Write a sequel to the historical/romance/fantasy epic &quot;Naked on the Ice&quot;--and yes, that is the real title. The author of &quot;Naked,&quot; the cult figure Kathleen Darcy, is supposedly dead by suicide, having vanished into the wilderness seven years back, despite being a bestselling millionaire.Jacqueline gains the book deal, but must now deal with the rising specter of murder. She suspects strongly that Kathleen Darcy was being targeted for death via &quot;accidents.&quot; Among her suspects are Kathleen's toad-like half-brother, St. John Darcy; Kathleen's ex-lover; the hack historical-romance writer Brunnhilde; the violent male rival; the married hunk whom &quot;Naked&quot;'s hero was physically based on; the deformed woman who has an almost obsessive fascination with Kathleen; and a sprinkling of other former friends, enemies, and relations...What happened to Kathleen? Did she really commit suicide, or was she murdered? Is she alive, possibly? And what possible reason would anyone have to want her dead--money, love, revenge? Jacqueline intends to find the truth -- but what if she gets in the murderer's way?Jacqueline is still the same effervescently vivid character as before. With her slightly eccentric nature and keen mind (not to mention her flamboyant clothing--it's a treat just to visualize her) she is an instantly likeable detective. Yet she doesn't show everything on the surface: when she meets with her new agent, she has a wry cynical edge that is very appealing.You will thoroughly loathe such characters as St. John Darcy, Tom and Brunnhilde, the overweight historical hack. More appealing is Paul, whose turbulent feelings and quick thinking make him a nice if blunt guy.Aside from the excellent descriptive writing and wonderful situations (St. John attempting to kiss Jacqueline; Jacqueline showing what Sarah looks like) you also get little pokes and jabs at the book industry. Agents, contracts, those little fifteen-percent paychecks, &quot;lit-ra-choor&quot; and bestselling authors are all lampooned slyly by Ms. Peters. (And if you have ever tried to be published as I have tried and am trying, it's doubly amusing)One slightly inaccurate thing in this book is that the person doing the cover art obviously didn't read the book. (No nude typing--the &quot;naked&quot; is a joke...) Aside from this, this is a witty, classic mystery that you'll read again and again...Ms. Peters, write more about Jacqueline Kirby!"},{"Title":"Naked Once More","review":"Seven years before this novel opens, Kathleen Darcy, a novelist famous for her one book, __Naked in the Ice__, disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Although no body was ever found and the only evidence was her abandoned car, which yielded no clues, her disappearance was officially ruled to be a suicide. Many of her friends, family, and fans question this conclusion and believe that she was either murdered or is still alive.In the present, our protagonist Jacqueline (don't dare to call her Jackie!) Kirby, a successful novelist in her own right, wins a competition and is chosen to write a sequel to Ms. Darcy's novel. Upset by this decision are some fans who believe that no sequel should ever be written, and at least two of the other authors who lost out to her in the competition. These two rather unsavory characters are the aptly (self)named Brunhilde, and the bullying Jack Carter. How Jacqueline \\"destroys\\" these two through public humiliation is almost a case study in \\"coolness.\\"Jacqueline is a bit of an amateur detective whose instincts tell her that something is really amiss. There are a lot of people who might have had motives to get rid of Kathleen Darcy, and maybe Jacqueline, too.She therefore makes it her business to determine:(A): If Kathleen Darcy was murdered, or(B): She committed suicide, or(C): She is still alive, and(D): If murder, who is responsible, or(E): If she committed suicide, why, or(F): If she is still alive, where is she, and(G): Who murdered the owner of a local bookstore, a fanatical fan of Darcy, and why, and finally(H): Who is setting up \\"accidents\\" that threaten Jacqueline's life, and why do they mirror a series of so-called accidents that happened to Darcy shortly before her disappearance?Whew! That's a lot. Now let's throw in a sleazy lawyer, Kathleen's most unappealing half-brother, a handsome chef, a handsome neighbor, a dishonest agent, a couple of Kathleen's sisters, the two losing authors already mentioned, and one or two others, all with seeming motives, and all with something to hide.It's Jacqueline's self-assigned job to sort through all of these people and possibilities while protecting herself, and o find the solution to this \\"who-dunnit.\\"How well does she do? You'll have to make it your job to find out."},{"Title":"Naked Once More","review":"I didn't think this book was as good as \\"Die for Love,\\" which I thought was hilarious. It lacked the humor and outrageousness of that book, but I still enjoyed the mystery and \\"unveiling,\\" which came as a surprise. I LOVE JACQUELINE KIRBY! As a longtime fan of Elizabeth Peters/Barbara Michaels, I only wish that she would write more books with this wonderful lady as her central heroine!"},{"Title":"Naked Once More","review":"This, the fourth and thus far last installment of the Jacqueline Kirby series, reaches the greatness promised in the first stallment, but left largely unfulfilled by the second and third books. A challenging mystery, a hint of romance, and a more thoughtful, less mean-spirited Jacqueline. Too bad Ms. Peters stopped here. Enjoyable romp."},{"Title":"Naked Once More","review":"Jaqueline Kirby is a wonderful character, not as unusual as Ms. Peters' more popular sleuth Amelia Peabody (a hilarious Lady Egyptologist of the last century), but equally delightful to spend time with. The fourth Kirby book isn't as funny as the earlier &quot;Die For Love&quot; (set at a Romance Novel convention), but it's more absorbing and even haunting. This could be called Peter's &quot;Gaudy Night&quot;, it accomplishes the rare feat of having an established lighthearted character show more feeling and depth than the reader expected, and doing it well.Kirby has gone from being an outrageously outspoken librarian to an outrageous &quot;eccentric&quot; bestselling author, and wins the chance to write a sequel to one of the best-selling books of the decade, whose young author disappeared seven years ago. She goes to the home town of the author, intending to do research, but is naturally caught up in the mystery of the disappearance. She finds a somehow haunted town, populated with people unable to go on with their lives, to accept the loss, obsessed with her, needing more from her, living in the past. Where could a strong-willed, outspoken, brilliant amateur sleuth be needed more?One of Peters' most moving and naturalistic books, I must have read this one ten times."},{"Title":"Naked Once More","review":"When writer Kathleen Darcy mysteriously disappeared seven years ago after publishing a hugely successful historical novel, \`Naked in the Ice', it was determined that suicide was the likely outcome although her body was never found. Now that she has been declared legally dead, her heirs, agent and publisher are launching a search for someone to write the much-anticipated sequel. Author Jacqueline Kirby, the series protagonist Peters first introduced to us in The Seventh Sinner, easily lands the job.Jacqueline, sardonic and bitingly charming as ever (think of an alligator in a pink dress, maybe) temporarily relocates to Kathleen's rural digs - the center of her writing life as well as the site of her disappearance - and finds a lot more than she bargained for after moving into Kathleen's cozy cottage. Not only do Kathleen's mooching siblings and half-crazy mother (who all live in a grand estate paid for by Kathleen's earnings) present an unexpected obstacle, but local characters in town seem to have a vested interest in how the final chapter of Kathleen's life plays out. Right from the beginning Jacqueline finds herself drawn deeply into the real-life mystery of Kathleen Darcy herself and what really happened to her - which, oddly enough, no one else seems to be all that interested in.I've read this a couple of times over the years, so I listened to it on audiobook this time. Most of Peters/Michaels' books are narrated by one particular actress, Barbara Rosenblatt, who embodies the voices so well that I've come to think of her as Peters/Michaels herself. Peters only wrote five Kirby books, which is unfortunate because they're among her best. It seems very obvious to me that the character of Jacqueline Kirby is at least a partial self-portrait of Peters/Michaels/Mertz (she even refers to herself at one point, when going through a mental list of authors who were cat fanciers: \`Mark Twain, Louisa May Alcott, Barbara Michaels...', which made me smile. Her intelligent humor and excellently fleshed-out characters make these books genuine pleasures to read (or listen to) over and over again."},{"Title":"Naked Once More","review":"The final Jacqueline Kirby novel, this book finds Jacqueline as the chosen novelist to write the sequel to another novelist's famous novel.

Jacqueline and the author spend so much time sending up the romance genre that the inside jokes become tedious after a while.

Still, if you like the novels featuring this surprising heroine, you will be glad you read it."},{"Title":"Naked Once More","review":"The late Charlotte MacLeod described Elizabeth Peters as \\"sneaky\\" and when she is at her best she excels in sneakiness.Long before Martha Grimes took swings at the publishing industry Elizabeth Peters penned NAKED ONCE MORE for a delightful caper.Jacqueline Kirby is a ex-librarian turned author who has the offer of a life-time to write a sequel to cult author Kathleen Darcy's 'Naked In Ice.'

They are funny stories that I remember, and I want to make up my own. Mulo silwam spectat. Mulum silwa spectat. That means the mule watches the woods. The woods watches the mule. The mule is a fun character, afraid of the woods, who doesn't like to carry all the bags and food, who doesn't like horses who get to play all the time and never work. It's a fun story that builds. The book alone is fun.The CD is great. I have searched amazon and see no other spoken latin for beginners. This is it. The stories are told by drama actors who do the voices well. Apparently Sharpley also produces plays in Latin, and it shows. Ihave seen a website where you can buy or stream dramatic videos in Latin. I hope Sharpley continues to make audio like this.I hope makers of other language programs would tell fun stories rather than Birgit and Hans always saying \\"do you want to drink a beer?\\" \\"No, I want wine.\\" .."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Beginner's Latin (With Audio)","review":"This book has a way of describing the ways of the language that no other book has. Although I have used other books like Wheelock and Oxford Latin, I find that this book is the best for the beggining Latin student because of its simple, yet extremely effective way of teaching the reader word endings with comparisons to other words at the same time.This books increased my Latin vocabulary considerably, because it uses not only classical Latin vocabulary, but ecclesiastical and medieval vocabulary as well."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Beginner's Latin (With Audio)","review":"Came upon this book after following Sharpley's other course, Essential Latin, which was taught to us by a teacher.

As was repeatedly explained to me in my two undergraduate years in Latin courses, Latin as spoken (aside from ecclesiastical Latin) is a dead language. Debates range on as to how it actually sounded in daily use. My point? It's not a language to learn for conversation, but for literary translation. If you're looking for a conversational language, learn one that's still being spoken in the world today: French, Spanish, Italian, etc. If you want to translate Classical texts, then learn Latin, and don't worry over your pronunciation.

It claims to be both Classical and Medieval, but I could not really find much classical latin inside except some scant quotes that they throw at you which you can't read even after you complete this book!! There seems to be some religious bias here, too. The readings are about some monks somewhere in Europe, and most of the dialogue makes fun of the classical \`pagans\`.Then, using it solely as a grammer review, I quickly noticed there were almost no examples of the grammer.Don't waste your money on this book.

Anyone who wants a fun introduction to latin I suggest Cambridge Latin Course or Oxford's Latin; far and above this book."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Beginner's Latin (With Audio)","review":"I bought this book for the audio tapes. I wanted to get as much exposure to the vocabulary and inflections of the pronunciation as possible. Unfortunately, the audio quality of the tapes made them useless.The speakers, and there are several which provide a wide range of ages and both sexes, sound like they gathered together in a large room and spoke into a single microphone placed somewhere in the room. The level of the audio varied greatly from speaker to speaker, and there was the same emphasis on low frequencies in the audio as you get when taping the audio from a television show on an [inexpensive] cassette recorder using a microphone placed in front of the television speaker.In summary, the audio was unusable for me. Maybe your ears are better than mine, and maybe I just got a bad tape, but my hearing isn't really that bad, and there were a couple of voices who seemed close to the microphone, so I have to blame the recording process.If I'd known that the tape was this quality, I wouldn't have bought the set.

I really like amazon giving everyone a chance to have a say, but the reviewer John Moore who titles himself \`the historian' should read the book before he puts people off it. Or even just a few pages of it. There's no religious bias like he claims. If you are a table-thumping bigot, either pro- or anti-Christian (I suspect like my fellow-reviewer) then you may not dig the humour or impartial tone this writer adopts in treating the subject in his story. The pagan stuff is fascinating and the Christians are included with warts and all. And it's fun. I've just finished the course and never thought Latin could be so lively. And yes, it fixes on European history, not American, not Japanese. But Latin was an old European language, wasn't it? And grammar ? Well, that is where this coursebook steals a march on its rivals. Just brilliant. Only criticism - could be more exercises. But overall a delightful book and a must for anyone like me new to Latin."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Beginner's Latin (With Audio)","review":"This book is an excellent fun introduction to Latin. The stories about Paulus, mulus, Lucia, and Benedictus turn an otherwise boring book into a fun, hugely comical introductory approach. The illustrations are light-hearted and humorous. After about a week of reading this book and having a prior knowledge of Spanish, I found myself able to roughly decode the Latin Vulgate Bible.The Living Latin excerpts are also highly motivational for people who want ot be able to read Latin classics after going through this book. Also, Roman and medieval cultures are also explained very well in this book. The glossary and declension charts in the back of the book are also hugely helpful.My only complaint about this book is that its binding is a bit too tight, causing it to be a bit hard to keep open for underlining.For a more complete or advanced book about Latin, I would recommend \\"Teach Yourself Latin.\\" The Collin Gems Latin dictionary is also very helpful for Latin beginners. For those who would want to read more basic Latin texts outside of this book, I would recommend the New Testament Gospels in the Latin Vulgate Bible."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Beginner's Latin (With Audio)","review":"As a major in Latin and then one day going for masters in Latin: Oral Proficiency, it disturbs me that many, at least in the USA, feel that Latin is dead. If it was dead, as they say, there would not be any interest in the language or as many books composed in Latin, either from Antiquity or in Neo-Latin.The glory of this language is that it is \\"dead\\" in the sense that is doesn't change. The grammar is solid and so is its syntax. Thus, once you can handle the grammar and learn some vocabulary, a great conversationalist you can become in this language. Go! Teach others in this language. We owe it to our future generations.Remember, Latin was an oral language before it became written. And like English or any other language, Latin too had dialects. Think of it through the eyes of the Hispanics. There are many different forms of Spanish throughout the globe, but anyone of these speakers can understand each other, even if there are differences in spelling and pronunciation. I do not think that they are calling Spanish dead? So, feel free to pronounce the language as you see fit. Want to pronounce \\"ae\\" as \\"ay\\", go for it; why not. Or, do you feel like \\"vidi\\" to sound like \\"veedee\\" instead of \\"weedee\\", no problem. Or, do you want to use a \\"j\\" instead of the consonantal \\"I\\", as in \\"Jesus\\" vs. \\"Iesus\\"? Sure, you can do that. It is in these \\"gray areas\\" that the language is as alive as English or any other \\"modern/alive\\" language is today. However, I must warn you, there are other gray areas in the language, but what language doesn't? That is where the fun lies in learning a new language.Never let anyone say that Latin is dead. It received this bad rap during the Cold War because Latin wasn't going to get any American to the moon or defeat Communism. Ergo, Latin is not dead; it just became begotten. It just faded away, but is not dead. No, it is as powerful and enriching, as it was when it was first created some 3000 years ago. In sum, learn it; speak it; cherish it!As for the book, this is a great beginners book for a person from 5th grade to age 92. The story is quite creative and grows in difficulty as you learn more and progress further in the book. There could be more exercises, but there are more advanced Latin textbooks that can do that for you once you learn a firm foundation, which this book provides when you finish it."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Beginner's Latin (With Audio)","review":"Despite another reviewer's statement here, this book's grammar is based on Classical latin. I tried buying \\"learn Latin\\" by Peter Jones, but it was incomprehensible and boring. For some reason, there are many people who learn latin in school and then decide that they have the ability to teach it to others. You end up with grammar treatises that are unsuitable for the beginner. This book is an exception; it is designed for normal human beings to learn latin and a measured pace, in a suitable manner that alows them to learn without being discouraged.The author was very astute in how he laid out his lesson plan, leading the learner to feel like he is accomplishing the language even from the first lesson. That being said, I cannot say his method is flawless. Latin has a very complex grammar compared to most modern western languages. I could have used a tad bit more explanation (or examples) in some of his lessons, although I appreciate he was trying to keep the size of the book down. I also was not into the story he uses for translation exercise, which takes place in the Christianzed dark ages, and is more suitable to Catholics learning rather than those more interested in classical latin. His story is a bit ridiculous, and he could have expanded the glossary of latin terms to include more of the words he uses in the story.His lack of macron use is the biggest mistake; macrons are part of every major latin textbook in the last 150 years, as they are important in determining the meaning of homophones such as Liber & Liber (can't tell the difference without them, can you?) Having beginners study without macrons to guide them can create bad habits, and inhibits learning since long vowels are best learned through example, which in turn requires enough exposure to them. For an academic instructor as the author is, I'm not sure why he let them publish this book without the macrons."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Beginner's Latin (With Audio)","review":"This book offers and easy and fun way to learn the basics of Latin.

The continuing story through which the reader learns new vocabulary is extremely amusing. It is worth noting that the vocabulary words are not conversational. (Although not many people have conversations in Latin.) For example, the first few words the reader learns are woods, mule, watches (verb), scared, and slow. Or something similar to that.I bought the book with two audio tapes, which don't appear to be offered here. The tapes were the short stories being read.One thing about this book that could be improved is the number of practice exercises. I could definitely have used more of them. Also, it would have been nice if the book had had more straightforward grammar explanations. For example, instead of giving examples of verb endings they could have come right out with a chart telling all the endings for the different categories of verbs. However, the grammar explanations were mostly very clear and easy to learn.I had not taken any Latin classes before reading this book, and did not have difficulty understanding anything. I reccommend this book highly for anyone interested in learning Latin."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Beginner's Latin (With Audio)","review":"This is an excellent book which provides the reader with a very user-friendly approach to learning latin. Nota Bene, however that the book focuses on Medieval (ecclesiastical) Latin, not Classical Latin (although it does mention it occasionally)"},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Beginner's Latin (With Audio)","review":"This is one of the least painful introductions to Latin that I have seen. It doesn't assume any knowledge of grammar terms, and it doesn't dump whole declensions in your lap in the first lesson (unlike most of the other Latin textbooks lining my shelves). If you ever thought that Latin looked too frightening to tackle, this is probably the book you want."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Beginner's Latin (With Audio)","review":"This book is a brilliant introduction to the Latin language. I first bought this when I was fourteen and worked my way through it, and I then followed it up with the textbook Wheelock's Latin: the two together got me admission to Oxford University's Latin and Greek program, into the same advanced stream as British students who had studied the language from childhood and had full A-levels (about an AP in the US) in Latin.Sharpley's book works for two major points: 1) it provides a gradual exposition of grammatical concepts in a manner that is easy and straightforward to understand, and 2) it does so in a way that stresses that grammar is a natural part of language, and even languages that are 'dead' today were living and spoken at one point in time.The book works by guiding the reader through a story which is set in a mediaeval monastery in Northern Europe. This does not, however, mean that the book teaches Mediaeval or Ecclesiastical Latin instead of Classical Latin; the forms used and taught are, in fact, the Classical ones that would have been familiar to Cicero and Vergil. (To be honest, the book really does not delve into areas sophisticated enough for the differences between Classical and Mediaeval versions of the language to be felt.) It introduces grammatical concepts a little at a time; there are few prohibitive complete verb or noun tables in the first sections of the book until the reader is able to develop a firm grasp on concepts of case, tense, and so on. Vocabulary is given in similarly small doses, and the language is presented in as accessable a way as possible. Every chapter also includes selections from 'real' Latin literature (with translations) that are not meant to be fully understood, but rather to be absorbed by the reader.One deficiency with the book is that it does not mark the difference between long and short vowels; while in some ways this makes it easier to 'get a gist' of the language, vowel length will have to be learned in a later textbook because it is central to understanding Latin (even when it is not printed in literature, it must be known). The book does not adequately equip its reader, either in terms of grammar and syntax or vocabulary, to read with fluency either Classical or Mediaeval literature; what it does do, however, is provide a solid introduction to grammar concepts for the student working without a teacher. It also presents an excellent idea of the way the language works, as well as a taste of the richness of Classical (and even Mediaeval) Latin literature.By the end of this course, you should know whether or not you want to go on to study Latin more thoroughly, and be able to understand the grammatical explanations of more difficult and more complete textbooks of the language. It will make the first few chapters of most standard textbooks feel like review, and will give you a sense of power as grammatical concepts lie within your understanding. The book, moreover, will give a real internal grasp of the rhythm and feel of the language. (The cassettes are not really necessary for this; I never had them, and didn't really miss them!)I would recommend following this book on with either Wheelock's Latin (the standard North American first year college textbook, but difficult to understand without a teacher or a good background in grammar, as Sharpley provides) or the JACT Reading Latin course (which is more common in British universities). In either case, Sharpley's 'Beginner's Latin' will provide an excellent and useful gateway to the Latin language."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Beginner's Latin (With Audio)","review":"I must rave about this book. It does what many haughty titles in this category fail to do, and that is teach Latin clearly and effectively. So deftly does this book lubricate the brain to gently accept this grand language, that I hardly noticed how much it assisted me in learning OTHER languages completely unrelated to Latin. By describing grammar in terms of anticipation - i.e., that our brains anticipate language and whether what we hear makes sense is directly related to our process of anticipation - Sharpley breaks the mold for language teachers. How else to help an english speaker understand the many noun/verb/adjective tense agreements that are so common to world languages, but non-existent in english to any great extent. His pithy insight not only had me understanding Latin from the first pages, but also what to expect in my journey to learn Latin. There are no tricks, and there are no easy answers. However as teachers go, I agree with the vast majority or reviewers here who appreciate the sheer talent of the author to bring Latin to life, one bite at a time. I never felt like this language was difficult or complex, but that is was logical and quite understandable. You cannot go wrong with this book, and once the basics are under your belt (and this book offers more than basics with a quite extensive explanation of grammar and a hefty vocabulary) other books such as Wheelock's will be much easier to conquer."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Beginner's Latin (With Audio)","review":"This book is EXCELLENT! I was using Baumeister's &quot;New Missal Latin&quot;, but found it to be rather dry (good for ecclesiastical latin vocabulary though). On the other hand, this book is very easy to read and I have made more progress on my latin in the last few days than I had made in the previous months of studying with other books! This book is very well laid out. The rules of sentence structure are given up front, the conjugations are taught in a common sense manner, and the reading exercises are great! Before you know it you'll be reading latin! I would have gladly given this book a higher rating, but five stars is the max you can give! I can't recommend this book highly enough!"},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Beginner's Latin (With Audio)","review":"I am a law student. Prior to law school I went through Wheelock's Latin to aquire a basis for the language. Wheelock's is an excellent introduction to the language which I recommend going through before purchasing this book. The beauty of the Teach Yourself book is that it is so engaging, fun, and concise. It is an excellent supplement to Wheelock's because it cements together everything you have already covered and provides a worktape by which you can check your pronunciation. It would be difficult to come away from this book and not have a very solid basis for the language.There is another review here whereby a person claims to have mastered Latin through this course and Wheelock's to such an extent that it got him into Oxford. Having gone through both these texts myself, I have no doubt that this is true. I cannot overemphasize the quality of this course and the extent to which it brought the language alive for me."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Beginner's Latin (With Audio)","review":"We are using Sharpley's this year for homeschool, and after Latin Primer 1 and Minimus we found this book a bit of a challenge, but well worth the effort. Yes, you do have to study whereas we found our previous courses very easy without additional work, we are actually progressing at a rapid pace with Sharpley's. We are reading and translating in a way I think would have taken several years had we used the standard homeschool products out there. I would recommend using Minimus first for the beginner, but Sharpley's is where your actual progress will begin. It's very exciting. The book is the main part of the study. The tape is only to check to make sure you are reading the story with the correct pronounciation, which in actuality, no one is sure of anyway. My daughter is 7th grade adn some of the extra inserts about the history of the Latin language can be a difficult for her to read, but the actual text is clear for her. She likes the cartoon story and we found a written translation on his website, http://.../She also likes having a teacher with an English accent! Right from the start, Sharpley teaches you how to read Latin using the endings of a word, and you progress into long sentences almost immediately. There is a lot of vocabulary and I really like the way he gives definitions that are not absolute, so you translate more with reasoning than with memorization. Instead of 'you sit', you learn 'sits' and you learn teacher can also mean master, etc. Those are simple explanations, but I think you get the point. I find this to be an excellent course for those who don't want to spend years learning Latin and don't want to spend a fortune on some of the less academic Latin curriculum offered in the homeschool community. This course is more fun, too!"},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Beginner's Latin (With Audio)","review":"Sharpley's approach to teaching the reader Latin is very clear, and lighthearted.

One of the most dreadful things I have ever been forced to read."},{"Title":"The book of the courtier (The Penguin Classics)","review":"Whether or not this work can be considered relevant in today's society is not a factor here. As a testimony to fifteenth century Italian Court Life it is unparalleled.This delightful four-part book at the social nobility of the Italian Renaissance opens with an apology by Baldesar on the quality of his writing. Something that was clearly debated after Petrarch, Dante and Boccaccio as there is somewhat of a lengthier side discussion on the merits of using the vernacular in written speech partway through the first \`book'.The \`handbook' opens with the matriarchal Duchess ordering that a game be played and that signora Emilia decide the nature of it. It is first set to Count Lodovico to describe those qualities best attributed to a courtier with the rest of the \`players' questioning or discussing his points further.The Count states that a good courtier should possess charm, be handsome, be of noble birth, modest, physically fit, be good at sports, should both observe and imitate those good qualities of other courtiers, be a good dancer, have an appreciation of music, letters and art, not be affectatious, be an above average scholar in the humanities and that his first and truest profession be that of arms. Quite a long section is taken with a development on the theory of writing and letters which has many references to the desired quality of those in the ancient world. Indeed, Castiglione holds up those practices of the ancient world in high esteem as being worthy of the perfect courtier.The second book is to be continued by Duke Federico as to how and when the courtier should put the desired courtier qualities into practice. Castiglione prefaces the second book with a justification of why old people see the future as a depraved version of their golden era - almost a youth's retort to the aged question of rebelliousness.Federico opens by stating he believes the courtier should be considered, virtuous and adhere to certain rules. Above all else he must have good judgment. The second book is frequently \`territorial' in nature, particularly in the section espoused by Bernardo Bibbiena on the three types of pleasantries. Namely: long and amusing narrative ; spontaneous thrust of a cutting remark (including puns) ; practical jokes. It is in the latter, which includes tales, that the poking of fun at inhabitants of various cities (for example, Sienans, Fiorentines, Brescians) occurs. Federico earlier makes mention that no young man should attempt wisdom and that no courtier should socialize overly with those beneath his station taking care in choosing your associates. The second \`book' is effectively in two parts - Duke Federico's discussion on the rules of courtiership, Bernardo's discussion of the three types of pleasantries with many anecdotes to prove his points and then finishes with a epilogue discussing those practical jokes played by women after Gaspare denounces the practice.This proves a neat lead in to the third book for the Magnifico Giuliano to discuss fashioning a Court lady. As signora Emilia puts it: \\"To prove it, consider that virtue is feminine whereas vice is masculine.\\"The third book is prefaced by Castiglione with short discourse on the superiority of the Court of Urbino to all the other Courts of Italy. The Magnifico then addresses the Duchess directly stating that a woman must not \\"resemble a man as regards her ways, manners, words, gestures and bearing.\\" and must be beyond reproach or suspicion. He draw many parallels with the perfect courtier, then espouses excellence in subject knowledge, discretion, prudence purity, magnanimity, and appearance. The Magnifico then gives us many stories about great women, ancient stories from Camma to Argentina, from Roma toTheodolina, Theodora and Mathilda, medieval queens such as Eleanora of Aragon, Isabella of Naples, Tomyris of Scythia and many more. He continues with examples of continence, before finally ending his discussion by stating the greatest thing a Court Lady must know, is how to conduct a discussion on love.The fourth book is prefaced with a lament for several of those parties at the discussion who are now dead. The fourth book is mainly a discussion by Ottaviano giving an end to the perfect courtier. Namely that he be able to please his Prince and how to liaise with and deal with him It ends more as discussion on the nature of Princes. What Castiglione seems to be intimating is that the perfection of a courtier is determined by his Prince rather than by a standard set of rules. The discussion sidetracks into a discourse on the nature of evil and how to recognize and act on it. It links the concepts of agism and vanity to this discussion with several interjections from the oldest member of the group, Morello. The fourth book ends with a move towards discussion of divine love and there it ends. Whether Castiglione meant to continue or not is uncertain.Two things leap out about this courtier handbook:The first is how often Castiglione chooses to address the side issue of semantics, rhetoric and grammar. It was clearly an important topic of the age and more time is spent on that single theme that any other.The second is the constant reference to the ancient world an an ideal to be lived to. Particularly classical figures such as Alexander. This is not surprising given Jacob Bruckhardt's later 1860 essay on the Civilisation of Renaissance Italy, also refers to the \\"Revival of Antiquity' of the time.What does comes across very clearly in this book is George Bull's refined translation keeps in mind the nature of the subject matter and in itself espouses courtiership. It is precise yet fluid in its translating and can be considered the best english rendering of this great Italian Renaissance work to date. This work is a must-read for any serious student of Renaissance Italy."},{"Title":"The book of the courtier (The Penguin Classics)","review":"Wouldn't it be great if several people had gathered together in one of the 16th century Italian states to hash out exactly what was proper behavior for a gentle person at that time and place?

It might suffice to say that he was in some way the Emily Post of his era however, it seems that this work was more far reaching than this. The Courtier is a fascinating book that is actually more useful in studying the renaissance than Machiavelli's \\"The Prince\\" (which I do recommend as well) since its detail on why people should act as proscribed is directly taken from real events and people and it is less a work of philosophy and more a work centered about real action in living. I recommend this work highly to everyone wishing to learn more about this age. This version is far better than the one I first read and it offers decent commentary to help elucidate the reader.Castiglione was extraordinarily fond of Federigo the duke of Urbino with whom he fictitiously converses in this work. I am inclined to believe, though possibly naively, that the fictitious conversations outlined in this work, though not actual, may have been a summation of actual conversations that Castiglione and Federigo actually had. We should remember that Federigo was a model duke and Urbino was the model court of renaissance Italy. Federigo was a lover of learning and the arts and an able ruler willing to give audience to any of his subjects. He also was a more than able military commander who was just in to his men and equally just to those whom he fought against. In short he was the finest example of a renaissance prince. Urbino, though far smaller than Florence, Venice, Genoa or Rome was a very well organized and lovely court that was a favorite place, not only for Castiglione, but also for many artists including Leonardo Da Vinci. Putting all of this in context it is understandable why it made sense for Castiglione to use Federigo as his model in writing this book and it also explains one reason why it was such an immediate success among all of the Italian nobility. Naturally they read it for different reasons than you will but this book had lasting appeal and should be regarded as a classic work.One reason this book is so interesting is that it is the outline of protocol for courtiers of the Italian Renaissance. Pondering this one might ask the question \\"why did Castiglione feel he had to write this work?\\" I can assure you his aims were quite different from those of the handbag maven Kate Spade who has recently issued a series of books along the same vein as The Courtier for today's yuppie elite and their \\"wannabee\\" counterparts. I surmise simply that this book needed to be written because their was an essential break in culture of the nobles of the Renaissance and those of the Middle Ages. However this break was by no means sudden and the crudeness and bad manners of the Middle ages did not die quickly especially among the rural nobility. Even so Castiglione saw a benefit from everyone \\"working off of the same page\\" and thus he wrote that page.If you are studying the Renaissance it is probable that you will read some short excerpt of this book. While enlightening as that small cut may be it pales in comparison to the entire work. Sociologists, historians, scholars, and interested people will all get something out of reading this book. It is not imposing and dry as it may appear. Though the language may be dense at times Castiglione is kind to his readers by making the work enjoyable and easy to read. Modeling the work after conversations naturally lightens the work and it really is not that long of a work anyway. I rate this version as the best I have seen and think that you will do a great service to yourself in reading this.-- Ted Murena"},{"Title":"The book of the courtier (The Penguin Classics)","review":"There really was a Camelot. But it was in Italy. Urbino in northern Italy to be exact, in the 1500s. Perched on top of a couple of hills in the region Le Marche, Urbino was ruled by the Montefeltro family. From 1444 to 1482 Federigo de Montefeltro skillfully steered his tiny domain through the rough storms of Italian Renaissance realpolitik. Federigo was a successful soldier of fortune yet maintained one of the largest libraries in Italy, spoke Latin, read Aristotle, helped orphans and in general earned the love of his people. He built a beautiful fairy-tale palace and had Paolo Uccello and Piero della Francesca decorate it.His less fortunate son Guidobaldo inherited this charming and well-run dukedom. Guidobaldo married the cultivated Elisabetta of the Gonzaga family from Mantua. He was an invalid and not made of his father's stern military stuff. A victim of the brilliant military campaigns of Cesare Borgia that so enchanted Machiavelli, Guidobaldo was temporarily deposed. When the Borgias (Cesare and his father Pope Alexander VI) died, the people of Urbino rose up, drove out Borgia's soldiers and cheered Guidobaldo and Elisabetta upon their return.For the next few years the court of Elisabetta and Guidobaldo was the most beautiful, enlightened, genteel place on earth. They attracted musicians, scholars and artists. Conversation was honed into a fine art. Into this paradise strode our Lancelot, Baldassare Castiglione, a diplomat descended from minor Italian nobility. He loved Elisabetta, but as far as we know the devotion remained platonicIt is because of Castiglione that we believe we have a sense of what the court of Montefeltro was like, or at least how they would have like to have been remembered. His \\"The Book of the Courtier\\" (Il Cortigiano) painstakingly analyzes the attributes of a gentleman through conversations (probably highly idealized) of refined visitors to Urbino.It's a long, slow, but thoroughly enjoyable book. It is a window into the renaissance mind. It does not describe how the Italians of the sixteenth century were, Machiavelli and Cellini are probably more useful there. But it tells how they wanted to be. The book was read and studied by nobility all over Europe.It's also how I wanted them to be. Urbino is one of my favorite places. It's a crowded student city now. But on a quiet morning when only a few people are about and the sun has made its way over the hills from the Adriatic, I can imagine that I can see the ghosts of Elisabetta and Guidobaldo walking on the cobbled streets outside their beautiful palace. Fussy, snobbish, yet kind and gentle Castiglione and his wonderful book help make that fantasy more real.Oh, and for you bike people, Castiglione married Ippolita Torelli.- Bill McGann, author of \\"The Story of the Tour de France\\""},{"Title":"The book of the courtier (The Penguin Classics)","review":"Castiglione's &quot;The Courtier&quot;, a landmark in Renaissance literature, is a treatise presented in dialogue form, offering hints on how the courtier ought to act, to win the favours of ladies, to comport himself and - to fight. Contrary to my first expectations, it is no less practical and realistic than Machiavelli's &quot;Prince&quot;; Castiglione may seem somehow unfashionable to the modern reader, with his stress on decorum, honour and the importance of birthright, but has precepts endure, and can be just as readily applied in a court of the sixteenth century as in the present..."},{"Title":"The book of the courtier (The Penguin Classics)","review":"Well, contemporary for Niccolo Machiavelli. But this book has enduring relevance for anyone who has to spend time among those courting the politically powerful. It would be easy to dismiss this as without current relevance, but that would be a clear indication of either naivet&eacute; about political life or intellectual laziness (or both). The book is formatted as a series of fictional or fictionalized discussions among the influential. This was a common style for non-fiction, from the Renaissance through the nineteenth century, but does feel a little odd to many modern readers.Over the course of several evenings, the topic is \\"What makes the perfect courtier?\\" That is to say, the perfect flunky in the company of the politically powerful. Many attributes an behaviors are discussed as appropriate for a courtier, and two things jumped out at me. First, that this could be a textbook for a political intern or a climber in the business world. Second, how shallow the desired traits were. Social graces, from a good family, a good dancer, a good athlete, but never a skilled planner, a thoughtful or reflective nature, and definitely not someone who will tell the boss the ugly news. There is also great deal of discussion of how to backstab with grace and style.Reading this was something of a secret and dirty pleasure; the conformation that so little in human behavior has changed in five centuries, the underhanded social techniques, the unbridled ambition of the players.If you are headed for an entry level position in the political arena, read this, but do it in private and wash your hands afterwards.E.

They have done so by creating the illusion that there is a genuine debate by scientists as to whether global warming is taking place. Probably the most valuable part of the book is the appendix in which Gelbspan reproduces statements from leading climate scientists demolishing some of the most common arguments of the so-called &quot;greenhouse skeptics&quot; Patrick Michaels, Robert Balling and S.

I was an offical representative for NCAR and saw it in all its glory...and all its mud (PS I don't say anything bad about NCAR and never will. Like any institution, it has its characters and its humans just being human). I respect NCAR and what it does.Okay, Ross Gelbspan is not a climate scientist and in my opinon does not \\"nail\\" everything down like a publishing climate scientist would... but that being said, he hits climate change science in an amazingly understandable and accurate way in my opinion.

I'm not quite sure why she never caught on in the USA. Her books are full of gritty social commentary usually with a romance and a mystery attached.

This book is no exception and is one of my favorites. I got hooked on her books by watching the DVDs first. They are all extremely well done with excellent acting.Ten year old Millicent Forester has been raised in an upper class environment. Her mother was a lady's maid who has fallen on hard times. Expelled from her position through the disgrace of her husband she is now trying to make a living as an independent prostitute. When Millie's mother is picked up by the police, Millie is grudgingly taken in by \\"Raggie Aggie\\" the local rag seller. Aggie has in her employ a young man of unknown ancestry who started out life on the street and who goes by the name of Ben Smith, Jones, or Robinson. The local pimp, Boswell, pays the bail of Millie's mother, and feels \\"cheated\\" when she won't \\"preform\\" and when he threatens to send her to the sailors, commits suicide. Boswell notices Millie and wants to regain the price of her mother's bail by attempting to pick up Millie to serve as a child prostitute for his gentlemen customers. Aggie and Ben decide its best to put Millie in a convent school. In the convent Millie makes a friend through whom she later gets a position as a nanny/governess. Millie is invited to the estate next door to a party for the servants in honor of the Mistress's half-brother, Mr. Bernard Thompson.

Millie is the daughter of two shady people: her mother was forced to turn to prostitution, and her father murdered somebody (he claims in her mother's defense, which is revealed to be a falsehood.) She is adopted by Aggie, the rag woman and grows up with her and Ben, a friend of Aggie's. This is her story. Millie loves Aggie a lot, but unfortunately for her, Millie is very pretty. Too pretty. And a lot of people are interested in her. Aggie and Ben are trying to protect her. They send her to a Catholic school at one point, and then she becomes a nursemaid to a family of six children.I learned a lot about this period in England, and the way that the middle and lower class fared. This portrayal seemed pretty realistic to me, and I didn't know that all these shady things went on, even though there were (some) laws against it. But there were always plenty of loopholes too. I enjoyed all the characters too; from Aggie to Ben to the not-so-nice characters; they were portrayed pretty well.

This information is from the Buddhist point of view but I believe some of it applies to other forms of meditation.Eleven forms of meditation (paths) are described.

It was good to have a discussion of this variety of approaches in one bookI appreciated the chapter that described the essential unity among all of the paths of meditation.In the chapter on the psychology of meditation, Goleman describes Eastern and Western psychological constructs and their meaning for meditation practices.While the book is not inspirational literature, information presented on the benefits of meditation inspired me to look further into the subject.Goleman cites his sources of information and this creates a valuable list for further reading.The only regret that I have about the book is that it was published in 1988 and some of the material hasn't been updated for research since twenty years ago. Still, it is the best introduction to meditation that I know of.If you are looking for reading that will help you solve problems in life, I suggest the books by Albert Ellis such as A Guide to Rational Living."},{"Title":"The Meditative Mind: The Varieties of Meditative Experience","review":"I have read many books on meditation. This is the best. Dan Goleman gives an excellent review of the literature relavent to this subject without religious bias. Superb work. A must read."},{"Title":"The Meditative Mind: The Varieties of Meditative Experience","review":"On many accounts, this book is recommended to meditators of various traditions. As pointed out in other reviews, the description of the contrast between concentration and mindfulness, mainly based on Visuddhimagga (Buddhist commentary, the fifth century A.D.), must be helpful. The discussion of various different types of meditation must be helpful as well. Although the summary of meditation-related research is by now dated, it is still quite interesting. However, as this little book oversimplifies certain points, I would like to comment on them below.First, following Visuddhimagga, Goleman points out that the state of full absorption (\\"jhana\\") and mindfulness cannot coexist. But the situation is more complicated. In fact, understanding of the interaction between concentration and mindfulness seems to be a key to deepening our meditation practice. Contrary to Goleman, some teachers argue that jhana involves mindfulness. Catherine is one of them, although she too respects Visuddhimagga (Wisdom Wide and Deep: A Practical Handbook for Mastering Jhana and Vipassana). Gunaratana's position is stronger; he writes deep concentration without mindfulness is even dangerous (Beyond Mindfulness in Plain English: An Introductory guide to Deeper States of Meditation). Shankman points out that the notion of jhana differs between Visuddhimagga and the Pali Canon (oral compilation of the Buddha's words, the fifth century BCE) and among modern meditation teachers (The Experience of Samadhi: An In-depth Exploration of Buddhist Meditation). Thus, it would be good to begin with Goleman's simplified account of concentration and mindfulness, but it would be better to proceed to a more refined understanding of the topic. As hinted in the above-mentioned books and pointed out more explicitly by Analayo, it would be helpful to recognize the \\"concentration\\" and \\"mindfulness\\" ASPECTS in both the so-called \\"concentration\\" and \\"mindfulness\\" PRACTICES (Satipatthana: The Direct Path to Realization, p. 89).Second, Goleman's description of different traditions of meditation is oversimplified too. For example, while Yoga traditions are presented as purely concentration meditation, the situation is more complicated. Although the goal of Yoga meditation (practice) may well be considered more concentration-oriented (e.g., the unity of self and God as inTheravada Meditation: The Buddhist Transformation of Yoga), the aspect of mindfulness seems to be present. This is the case especially for those who follow the Yoga Sutra, written well after the Buddha's life and influenced by Buddhists' mindfulness. Some modern Yoga teachers explicitly discuss that mindfulness is present (relevant discussion inFreeing the Body, Freeing the Mind: Writings on the Connections between Yoga and Buddhism, esp. Ch. 1, Ch. 9). Goleman's classification of Kurishnamurti's meditation purely as mindfulness is, again, oversimplified. While Kurishnamurti's goal may well be mindfulness, his practice appears to involve the concentration aspect as well (Total Freedom: The Essential Krishnamurti, e.g., p. 287). So, Goleman's brief descriptions are helpful as a first approximation, but we should not stop there."},{"Title":"The Meditative Mind: The Varieties of Meditative Experience","review":"Abosuletly fantastic book. Gives a map of the stages or levels you go through in meditation, and explains in simple and concise terms the real differences between the various meditation systems of the world. If you want to know what happens to your head when you meditate, this book is for you. Its also a great help for those interested in starting meditation but don't know which direction to go in or what style would suit them best."},{"Title":"The Meditative Mind: The Varieties of Meditative Experience","review":"First published in 1977 under the title The Varieties of Meditative Experience, Goleman's book is a clear and straightforward presentation of various meditative disciplines organized around the map of consciousness explicated in Buddhaghosa's Visuddhimagga. Part I details this map, describing the paths of serenity (samadhi) and insight (vipassana). The various jhanas (meditative absorptions) are described, as are the insight knowledges. The tone throughout is professional, understanding and clear, though lacking the feel of a first-hand account. Two notable mistakes are made in this section, one being the consistent misspelling of pa&ntilde;&ntilde;a as pu&ntilde;&ntilde;a (I get a little worried when an author misspells key terms), the second being the placement of nirodha-samapatti (\\"cessation of feeling and perception\\") as above, or superior to, that of nibbana. There is no justification for this given the evidence of the Pali Suttas, where n-s is described rather as a kind of \\"super jhana\\" attainable only by anagamis and arhats. It is not, in itself, liberative.Part II is a survey of meditation paths--Hindu, Jewish, Christian, Muslim, and many things in between. Even Gurdjieff and Krishnamurti show up here. While at times illuminating--it's certainly a good, quick cross-section of the many traditions available--the underlying assumption of the discussion is in line with the old saying that \\"all paths lead to the mountain top,\\" something this reader, at least, is not convinced of. (This position is explicitly affirmed in part III, entitled \\"Meditation Paths: Their Essential Unity.\\")Why I am not convinced of this can perhaps be illustrated by a passage from the section on Jewish mysticism. \\"The end of the Kabbalist's path,\\" Goleman writes, \\"is devekut, in which the seeker's soul cleaves to God\\" (p. 52). And in the paragraph below that, in a passage quoted from Gershom Scholem, devekut is defined as a state of mind wherein \\"You constantly remember God and his love, nor do you remove your thought from Him...to the point when such a person speaks with someone else, his heart is not with them at all but is still before God.\\" Now this is fine as far as it goes, but it in no way approximates the view of things that result from the attainment of nibbana as described by the Buddha and his disciples in the Pali Suttas, and which the Visuddhimagga seeks to elaborate. Consider this from Samyutta Nikaya 22.58(6): \\"A bhikkhu liberated by wisdom, liberated by nonclinging through revulsion towards form [feeling, perception, volitional formations, consciousness], through its fading away and cessation, is called one liberated by wisdom\\" (from The Connected Discourses of the Buddha, translated by Bhikkhu Bodhi, pp. 900-1). In other words, enlightenment consists not of being attached to something (to a god or gods real or imagined), but rather through the cessation of all attachments.In other words, there is no reason to believe the Jewish holy man--the zaddik--or the Christian saint or the Muslim sufi attains what the Buddha attained. In fact, the experiences of the Kabbalistic meditators are examples not of nibbana (nirvana) but of the higher jhanas--equivalent, according to Golem, to the Sufi fana--and Goleman seems to admit this much when on page 62 he says that Sufi practice \\"culminates in baqa, abiding in some degree of fana [jhana] consciousness while in the middle of ordinary activity.\\" This is precisely what the Hindus call sahaj samadhi, \\"open eyed samadhi,\\" and though a high attainment, it is not the equivalent of the Buddhist nibbana. In fact, as the suttas make clear time and again, contemplatives before the Buddha were prone to believing in their own enlightenment specifically as a result of their attainment of those sorts of states. Goleman's book, however, does nothing to illuminate this problem; it merely perpetuates the popular and fatuous notion that all religions are, at their heart, one and the same.If I seem overly critical in the above passages, I don't want to give the impression that the book is in any way a failure. Its positives far outweigh its negatives, and even considering my critique of Part III, Goleman is right in asserting correspondences between meditative traditions. They are certainly there, and they need to be understood and appreciated; there is much that contemplatives from different cultures can share with and learn from one another.For many people, Part IV will prove the most interesting, where Goleman looks at the psychology of meditation. Here he is in his element (he is, after all, a psychologist), and he offers a good introductory survey of the Western attempt to come to grips with issues of mind and consciousness. A number of scientific studies of meditation are discussed, though one is left with the overwhelming feeling that so much more can--and should--be done. However, if one remembers that the book is almost a quarter century old, one can rest assured that since its publication much has indeed been done."},{"Title":"The Meditative Mind: The Varieties of Meditative Experience","review":"This early Dan Goleman book is one of his true gems. It is one of the most clear and concise catalogues and comparisons of meditation techniques from throughout the ages I've ever come across. It also, near the end, describes parts of the Abbidhama and Vissudumagga and illustrates the differing approach of psychology, a very old science in the East, to our relatively very new science of psychology in the West. Very informative, very clear, as concise as one could make these concepts, and for ANY meditators, I would expect it to be an enlightening look at your current practice. I highly recommend this book. (I'll also highly recommend Social Intelligence, another great Dan Goleman.)"},{"Title":"The Meditative Mind: The Varieties of Meditative Experience","review":"This is my third copy of this book.

I think every one of his fans longed for the day when he might compile a book of this sort, a dedicated anthology to his incredible renditions of the female figure. Depending on where you draw the line between artist and illustrator, between artwork and drawing, one would be hard-pressed to deny the sheer talent he possesses. Clearly, he cares about his subject greatly, and it shows in each of his offerings.A word of warning: as might be expected, some of the images are a bit risqu&eacute;, though I would imagine most would expect this in the description alone. Still, if you are made uncomfortable by nudity, be forewarned, there is not an exceeding amount, but there is some all the same.If you're a Frank Cho or Liberty Meadows fan, and you've always admired his work for the lines, the beauty, and the heart therein, you need to add this one to your collection."},{"Title":"Frank Cho Women: Selected Drawings And Illustrations","review":"In this book you will see many of Frank Cho's clean line art and pencil illustrations.

It consists of figure studies, some nudes and a number of comic book covers.

He is a master at drawing the female form.If you are an artist, you'll be able to appreciate his understanding of anatomy. His drawings use unique proportions (especially in the hips and legs). The surface anatomy correctly indicates the structure beneath it. The way he draws a knee amazes me. No, I'm not a sicko. Knees are amoung the most neglected and most difficult body parts to draw.

It is a trading niche book. It is not about day trading, nor momentum trading, but a unique subset of short term trading called \\"swing trading\\". If you do not know the difference, this book is not for you. It is not earth shattering. But, it is written by traders who have done it for a living for decades. Thus, it is worth knowing how they think, and how they have earned a living. And, yes, you mostly only make a few hundred bucks at a time, if you are good. Not riches, but \\"a living\\".The price is high, but this is a small niche market. They will sell few copies. Linda Raschke has done this technique of swing trading and earned a living at it for decades. I would not expect her to take time off to write about it for chump change. If it were a mass market, a lower price would be in order, but this book is good for very few people.I give it four stars only because of the terse format. BUT, they are traders not literary artists. I cannot fault them for not writing War and Peace.If you are an experienced trader, and expect nothing more than a few hundred bucks when a trade goes well, and protection from loss when it does not, this book will either confirm what you know, which is helpful, or add a trick or two that you did not know, which is more helpful. Traders are successful who earn a living, a few hundred dollars at a time, several times a day, day after boring day. It is not a book for others at all, and not a book to start with. If you magically expect more money than this, buy another book. And, nothing in short term trading is really new over time. This is not a breakthrough book of new and novel ideas. The first idea, \\"Turtle Soup\\" came from the Turtles which have been around many decades. It is nice to read that this pattern has not yet worn itself out, and is still used. I am happy to have it in my library. I am happy to know that old tricks still work for old dogs."},{"Title":"Street Smarts: High Probability Short-Term Trading Strategies","review":"First of all, I noticed many other reviews written that slagged the book badly. Perhaps they had high expectations in terms of what riches this book could bring them. However, it's clear those readers have the wrong idea.There is no holy grail or single book that can get you rich. The authors of this book repeatedly say that the strategies are not meant to be mechanical - suggesting that they require flexibility, and the ideas are there to incorporate into your own trading.I personally would not place much weight on whether this book will make you money or not simply by following the proposed trading 'systems'. Traders are supposed to grow and develop, not copy off some book robotically and become rich.The book exhibits excellent common sense and simplicity which sometimes traders forget. It will offer you some clarity if you become confused or frustrated with trading. It will also offer the more experienced traders some alternative perspective.There is probably nothing new in this book that you cannot find elsewhere - but this is probably true for all other trading books.I do think this book is a bit overpriced - hence 4 stars. On the other hand, I do believe this book is an excellent book in terms of clearing the bunch of mess that is out there with respect to trader education.

On one of those days I had the book open on my desk and realized that one of the patterns from the book was forming! I waited till the right moment and took the trade on 2 year treasuries. Exited the trade about a minute later with a $225 profit. That paid for the book on a single trade.I realize I could have also lost $225 on that trade, then the cost of the book would have been around $350. I was now happy with the purchase of the book. I looked for more trades, but did not find any that week. Then the book got pushed aside and forgotten about. I found the book again last week because I heard someone mentioning it. I pulled it out and reread it.I think the book has something to offer. Is it too expensive? That is hard to say. For me it became free after one trade. Was I just lucky? I don't think so because I can scroll through charts and see a lot of the set-ups in hindsight. So the trades are there, its just a matter of being there to pull the trigger as they happen.I hope to get more out of the book from this second reading. One thing I have noticed is that many times I read a book and get something. Then upon rereading it I pick up many thoughts that I did not see or understand during the first reading.

The rules and the opportunities are the same, so either youre going to make money or you are going to lose it in favor of the more seasoned ones.As a day trader your homework is all about studying and testing different market strategies that will help you take advantage of stocks and at the same time protect your investments. Just always keep in mind that a good strategy is SIMPLE and practical.Frankly the worst thing that can happen to a beginner day trader is to get information overload. Complicated technical systems will always make you SLOW in your decision making process or confuse you from the start.There are some very good sites on the web where you can access practical trading strategies that are easy to implement.

I had been familiar with Linda's trading style and market philosophy (a trader's trader, so to speak), so picking up this book was a no-brainer. The book looks simplistic, almost threadbare in it's layout. There is little discussion regarding the particular methods described, but that does not detract from the methods themselves. In this case, less really is more. The authors do not waste time on frivolous topics or other nonsense that most books are overly laden with. They get to the point. If you are like me, you don't have time to sift through 300 pages of miscellany to get to the meat of a strategy. That said, it requires a certain amount of confidence from the individual trader to trade the methods as they are presented. But again, I was very familiar with the author's history, so it was not too great a leap of faith.I have been trading three of the methods from the text, wolfe waves, turtle soup+1, and holy grail for three months now, and each has proved profitable on a net basis, and have paid for the book 10 times over. I wanted to write this review for actual traders that have experience in the market. These methods require undivided attention, and most will not have the time nor the inclination to monitor their trades, or flip through charts throughout the day to find enough setups to make it worth your effort. You will more than likely do more harm than good to your account if you \\"dabble\\" in the methods presented herein. If you are an active trader, however, you will find this book more than worth the price paid. Best of luck to you.*There is an omission made by the authors pertaining to the Wolfe Wave rules, and is a pretty significant one. The 1-3 and 2-4 lines must meet (this pattern is so successful because it contains the highly predictive \\"wedge\\" pattern; without the intersection of the 1-3, 2-4 lines, you do not have a \\"wedge\\", and thus the pattern loses it's predictive characteristics).

If you are like that, you have no business trading because you are too greedy and a coward.Secondely, when you are making a comment about someone, it is really important to REALLY be sure that what you are saying is acccurate. The implication that Linda does not make money trading is just ridiculous. The woman is a bloody Market Wizard, for God's sake!

Quit believing that and pick the ones that work under different market conditions.If you can't, it is your fault, not the book's.If you watch Linda trading, you will see her using those setups under the right conditions.

Linda Bradford Raschke and Laurence Connors share some of the best contrarian trading strategies that you will ever lay your eyes on. Of particular interest are the Turtle Soup Plus One and the Turtle Soup strategies that key on false breakouts. These strategies can be applied both intra-day and on a position trading basis and are guaranteed to make you money. Read this book. It is no frills, just excellent trading strategies from two pros."},{"Title":"Street Smarts: High Probability Short-Term Trading Strategies","review":"Trading does not have to be complex nor do the tools used to make money in the markets have to be perplexing. This book clearly demonstrates simple set-ups which occur frequently in the markets and carry a very high probability of success. I believe these methods could be taught to a bright 5th grader and that person will make consistant money. I have used some of these set-ups for years and they are consistantly profitable. Each set-up has a simply defined stop loss placement,for although these set-ups have a very high degree of success,they are not sure things. Of course noone has a sure thing. In trading all you can do is look to trade the most probable outcome,and street smarts certainly gives that format in numerous ,simple and brilliant set-ups. One can make a living off just a few of the set-ups in this book. Some complain about the price, but i feel that if this book is read properly and you use simple profit objectives the book is worth its weight in gold."},{"Title":"Street Smarts: High Probability Short-Term Trading Strategies","review":"Be skeptical of books with large print and a small number of pages. Traders love to see simple patterns for easy entry, but the fact is that most of these strategies don't hold up to scrutiny under backtesting."},{"Title":"Street Smarts: High Probability Short-Term Trading Strategies","review":"This book at first read- reads as if it was written by gradeschoolers. The format is unprofessional. The chart patterns referred to are rare patterns. The cost of this book is extremely high given the unprofessional presentation and content."},{"Title":"Street Smarts: High Probability Short-Term Trading Strategies","review":"Street Smarts is one of the better trading books out there. However, as another reviewer rightly bemoans, the explanations are too short. The main problem with a lot of these patterns is that most require a heavy amount of filtering. The Turtle Soup strategy will kill you in a trending market, it needs filtering even in non-trending markets. It seems to have some promise in a high ADX environment only when used as a continuation signal and not a reversal. I tried it on the 5 minute S&amp;P's. Trust me, I had to do a lot to make this pattern work. So much that I discarded the idea of using it. Also beware, some time frames are very bad for the anti technique. I know this is not how it is supposed to work, but from what I have seen there are certain intraday timeframes in the S&amp;P which are just horrible for technical indicators. Play around, you'll see. The range contraction patterns have promise, however the authors neglect to tell you that most should be traded in the direction of the trend. I like the statistical studies in the back of the book. LBR is not a mechanical trader, she has mechanical patterns but she decides when to implement them. Do not trade these patterns mechanically unless you want to get ripped to shreds. Hence I refer back to what I have said from the start, the patterns in this book need much filtering!"},{"Title":"Street Smarts: High Probability Short-Term Trading Strategies","review":"This ridiculously expensive book (booklet?), mostly outdated and primitive-looking charts with oversized text and plenty of useless appendices to fill more pages contains a collection of multi-day (aka \\"swing\\" trading) entry and exit recipes that are claimed by the authors to work well not only with futures --as most charts in the book are from futures-- but intraday and with stocks. You can find formulaic trading recipes and advice like this here and there and in other books without having to pay [item price]. When you learn how to trade, you will find that no one needs any magical recipes to go in or out of trades and that in the end anything works as well as anything else if you know how to do it appropriately. But if they told you this, you wouldn't buy the book. Each chapter contains a small description of a trading recipe and a set of ilustrations of the recipe, each one filling a whole page with three sentences and a chart that looks like it was taken from a snapshot of a computer screen in the early 1980's. Then, at the end of the charts sections, there are a few comments in dialog form.Linda Raschke's comments on some of the magic formulas are more interesting and more believable than Connors'. She claims to be a daily scalper in the futures markets. Some of the materials in her old Web site were interesting too, though she seems to be spending a lot of time working the trading fair educational circuit. Is she making a great deal of money trading all of these finger-counting strategies, entering after 20 bars here and there and puting a stop just above yesterday's high when the ADX is under 20% and the S&P; are in an inside day combining historical volatility with Tony Crabel's NR7, etc, etc, or does she need to supplement her income teaching seminars for $1500 an evening? As for the other author, the real \\"advanced\\" strategy Larry Connors knows well is how to make money out of the miriads of hopeful wannabes that overpay for his expensive books and for his TradingMarkets.com web site, which costs more than a thousand dollars per year and is just a hook to get the members to buy more overpriced \\"trading services\\", $5,000.00 tutorials, \\"ultimate\\" courses, fantastic techniques, videotapes, etc., etc. Just think of this before you dish out your money to this guy: if he knew any \\"advanced\\" trading strategies to make real money he wouldn't be peddling his overpriced merchandise for a living. Wouldn't it be nicer to live as a rich trader, trading from your yatch your great advanced strategies for millions, instead of busting your rear running a Web site in downtown LA to trap yet another fool who thinks that perhaps this new advisory service will \\"make him\\" money? Let Connors first show that he can make millions trading before he calls his strategies \\"advanced\\". Obviously, they are just not advanced enough to make him rich --though he will be soon, if you pay him [item price] for this mostly charts collection of unfocused advice. If you still feel you have to learn the basics from the popular self-appointed \\"gurus\\", do it at least with a minimal expense."},{"Title":"Street Smarts: High Probability Short-Term Trading Strategies","review":"First of all let me state that you must already have a certain concept of trading and trading terminology to benefit from this book. You must also understand and believe the importance of chart reading as a trader to fully understand what the authors are saying. I believe some of the negativity written about this books is because the readers didnt understand trading concepts as applied to chart reading or disregard chart reading altogether as a valid tool to trading.With this said, I have to say that the book was beneficial for me as a short term trader. It helped me find patterns that I would've otherwise overlooked before reading this book. Let me also add that the turtle soup and turtle soup plus one does not really apply 100%, per say, to the fast momentum stocks I screen for. However, reading those strategies helped fine tune my entry and exit strategies when I enter a trade. It did so by helping me look for intraday swings and the probabilities of possible price action for next day trading based on what happened to the price at the close. If anything, the book helped me alot because it opened my mind to other trading possibilities and thus form ideas for myself.Like another reader said, the authors are not mechanical traders. Thus these patterns and strategies should not be taken mechanically. Instead one should trade cautiously using discretionary stops. The book will only teach you about patterns in the market that have a high probable outcome. It's up to the individual to trade the patterns and use protective stops in the case the anticipated move goes wrong."},{"Title":"Street Smarts: High Probability Short-Term Trading Strategies","review":"I read the book and basically confirmed some of the patterns that I've been trading for years. Everyone has it's own name for the setups, but regardless of the name, the patterns describe in the book, do work!Everyone has their own twist to these patterns. I notice one reviewer had mentioned that he profited on the exact opposite strategy that the book had described. Selling new lows and buying new highs. Personally I think this is more dangerous than the strategy in the book(Buying new lows and Selling new highs). That is what swing trading is about. I do the same exact strategy as they mention in the book, and make money from it frequently. But I am also aware of the fact, that new lows/highs are set for strong fundamental reasons, so instead of using regular stops, I use Stop and Reversal(SAR)type orders. These order give me the best of both worlds. If my estimate is correct, I get an early fill as the market decelerates in one direction and accelerates in the opposite. If the trend continues, my SAR order gets me out, and fills me in the direction of the momentum. Price, Momentum, Time and Volatiliy and how you react to them, is the key to swing trading.It's not set in stone that these patterns work everytime, but as the title mentions, it's the probabilities of the markets reaction when these patterns form. Like any other method in trading, nothing works everytime, but as years go by, you find out what works best for your trading style and what doesn't. This book didn't teach me anything that I already have found out through experience, but for traders interested in swing trading, it's a fantastic starter book and worth the investment if purchased. It excerises the mind's of traders on how to anticipate the market, thereby always thinking one step ahead of it. And when your anticipation is wrong, get out!One other important factor. Rashke was a former successful floor trader and Connors was a hedge fund manager. These people know how to trade professionally. They know how other floor traders trade on the floor, and how institutional giants such as ADM,Refco and Rosenthal Collins play their cards and make money. In other words, their livelyhood depended on their attention to detail in the area of trading. They aren't like most us that trade, that have a job to fall back on. This is their job and main source of income! My point is, don't just learn their techniques,setups and strategies, but more importantly, learn their mindset, and what they do when the market moves in favor or against them. Determine how they react to such conditions and take notes! Through time and experience, you'll soon notice that you will be able to react with percision and timing as these professionals do, without doubt but with full confidence!"},{"Title":"Street Smarts: High Probability Short-Term Trading Strategies","review":"Six years ago I decided that I wanted to get into the listed derivatives field and have since that time devoured a great many trading texts whilst at the same time being employed in the industry. One of the great difficulties faced by the trader looking to build on his/her knowledge base is the glut of books in recent years and therefore which to choose. However, having built up a quite considerable library, this is the book that I place above all others. Until reading Street Smarts I was a breakout follower, familiar with all the standard charting patterns but relatively unfamiliar with the concept of swing trading. The benefits are twofold in that stops become tighter and secondly profitable trades become more so than previously because they are entered into earlier. Linda is one of the most successful independent traders in the US and fortunately fothtcoming with practical trading strategies, something that is hard to glean from the other 'market wizards.' It's an excellent education for a comparatively small cost."},{"Title":"Street Smarts: High Probability Short-Term Trading Strategies","review":"In my daily work as a Stock Broker in Sweden I encounter questions about good trading books all the time. Customers feel that most trading books are quite expensive, and a good way to avoid overpriced, worthless items is by asking an experienced professional.While I truly do not feel that the mystery of the markets can be revealed in a book, I can honestly say that this book is well worth its price. Above all, it gives the open-minded reader insights in highly effective approaches, concepts of trading which I have used successfully for many years. In fact, strikingly similar methods to the methods in this book have been &quot;discovered&quot; and used by investors, brokers, and traders that I know, even before this book was published. In my mind, this is another good indication that many of the patterns presented are valid in real-life trading.While I do not use the patterns in this book in the exact same manner as they are presented, the concepts and the insights are the same. Time spent studying these concepts will be time well spent. I consider Street Smarts to be among the best trading books I've read, and I certainly feel that it is the best book out there concerning Swing Trading. It contains no hype, just precise and sound swing trading techniques. I recommend it highly to all market participants, novices and professionals alike.Some of the other books that I consider to be among the best are:Market Wizards 1 &amp; 2, Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, Trading Systems and Methods, How to make money in Stocks, Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets, Investment Secrets of a Hedge Fund Manager, Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques, Secrets of Profiting in Bull and Bear Markets, Technical Analysis of Stock Trends, Trading by the Book, Exceptional Trading.Of the hundreds of trading books I have in my personal library and the thousands which I have access to in my professional life, Street Smarts still remains a personal favourite.I rank it as one of the 5 best books on trading I have ever read..."},{"Title":"Street Smarts: High Probability Short-Term Trading Strategies","review":"I want to start out by saying I have read lots of trading books and I am a full time commodity trader. So when I bought this book years ago I was interested in running some tests on the computer in order to really tell if the systems, there are aproximately 10 - 12, recomended in this book were profitable or not. Most of the systems in this book are tough to trade without a computer. I actually paid for the systems in the book and ran tests through my trading software and found out they were indeed profitable. But the average profits were very small, from what I remember under $100 a trade.Also they were just around 50% accurate. Most people have a hard time trading something that will only make money 50% of the time. I know I do. But the real kicker is the low profits. Trading for less then $100 is not what I would call worth risking my money for. If you are hoping to find some good trading systems in this book to use you now know what to expect. You might be able to get some ideas from this book to use in some other systems, I don't know. I personally didn't find it very useful. I also didn't like that there were no published tests in the book to show whether or not the systems in the book were profitable, kind of buyer beware. Before doing any trading you have to know whether or not your system is going to make money otherwise it is just a shot in the dark and that is not what trading is about. I don't know whether the other reviewers actually spent money running tests on the systems in this book or not. All I know is that I did and can only make a judgement by what the computer told me. I am only writing this to be of benefit to others who like me are wanting to find value in what they read. There are much better books out there in my opinion that will help traders a lot more for a lot less money. Linda Raschke is a supertrader and definitely knows what she is doing. But I think the general population would have a hard time making profits from this book. Go to Linda Raschke's website and take a look at the books she recommends before you buy this one, I think you will find it interesting. My advice, keep looking because if I had of known then what I know now I would not have bought this book."},{"Title":"Street Smarts: High Probability Short-Term Trading Strategies","review":"I have read a number of the other reviews and like to add my thoughts.First of all the book at full price is a very expensive, but if you look around long enough you can pick one up at a considerable discount either here at Amazon or Half.com/Ebay.Second, I feel this book is not for beginners.The strategies described in the book and the patterns offered as examples are in their purest form. If you don't take other market conditions into consideration, i.e. trending vs. range bound or are aware where support/resistance lies and volume, then these patterns could betray you. One example is the Turtle Soup and Turtle Soup Plus work best on low volume breakouts and markets in a trading range.You also have be familiar with and market indicators such as ROC and RSI to name a few. I would recommend you first read a book on technical analysis which discusses these indicators. If I may suggest, Trading for a Living: Psychology, Trading Tactics, Money Management by Alexander Elder, I found to be veery usefull.Additionally you will need to be using charting software that is customizable to the specs given in the book.Having said that I will say that I do think this is a very well written book. The wording is easy to read which makes for fast learning. The experienced trader can incorporate these strategies with his/her existing ones to increase his/her success. The book kept my interest.I recommend this book to traders already familiar with technical indicators, has good discipline and risk management skills."},{"Title":"Street Smarts: High Probability Short-Term Trading Strategies","review":"I began trading futures at the advent of the internet in the household back in 96. Charts and real time feeds were virtually unavailable except for the brokerage houses willing to pay the expense. I relied on my broker, a fax machine to get the charts, and voice mail to follow the real time price quotes.I wish I would have known about Linda's book from the start and about 7 years later now that real time charts are right at our finger tips and inexpensive. I then could have made my own decisions rather relying on others. Word of advice here - don't ever rely on your brokers to know better than you.Although this book written some years ago may seem outdated, it still follows the true elementary path of technical trading, is easy to understand, and involves probably the slightest risk possible. I read at least 30 books on this subject, (including Larry Williams, Jake Bernstein and Jack Schwager, (who are very dry and hard to follow) and Ken &quot;what's his name&quot; requiring you to enter these contracts for several months. What trader could do that without several hundred thousand dollars of capital?So trust me when I say, although seemingly overpriced, the book is immeasurable in education as well as exciting and fun. Linda encorporates a lot of the ideas of others (giving them full credit) but gives it her own personal flair.Swing trades are the way to go with the least risk and least capital AND without keeping your nose on the computer all day. This is the first book any wanna be trader should read before setting up an account and trying it for real.

There are great diagrams and the steps are numbered 1,2,3 etc. But there are such big gaps in their explanations.

This book is about how this came to be. I didn't realize before that the United States military funded much linguistic research in the 1950s, in hope of producing natural language interfaces to computer-based command-and-control systems; Newmeyer quotes somebody who says that Chomsky's linguistics is no more tainted by the association with the Pentagon than Marx's economics is by the association with the Reading Room of the British Museum, a product of British imperialism.

The author, with brilliant style, takes us not only into the story of Lincoln's famous address at Cooper Union delivered in early 1860, but also carries us, with remarkable narrative style, into the complexities of the political situation at the start of the 1860 presidential campaign and the eve of the Civil War. In addition, with a technique that rivals that of many a good novelist, he paints a wonderful picture of life at that time, with beautiful vignettes of personalities, the streets of New York, grueling train trips (and those of us stuck in airports think we have it bad!) and above all else the subtle persona of Lincoln on the edge of greatness.I teach a college level course on the American Civil War and like so many others, have neglected the pivotal role of the Cooper Union speech in favor of the 1858 debates, the Gettysburg Address (and Garry Wills fabulous book on that subject) and of course the poetic, biblical sounding Second Inaugural. Holzer's book will be a standard text in my class from now on and it is a book I know my students will gain from and read with enthusiasm.As a I professor of history I am dazzled by the depth of Holzer's research. Hundreds of footnotes, which I know to the average reader might be boring, but are a wealth of references to explore and demonstrate, as well, the dedication of Holzer to get the story down right.I would recommend this work to students of Lincoln and the Civil War, but also to the general reading public.Congratulations Dr. Holzer, you stand forth as a scholar and writer of unsurpassed skill."},{"Title":"Lincoln at Cooper Union : The Speech That Made Abraham Lincoln President","review":"A treat for any Lincoln fan.

The author is well suited to the task of unraveling this important Lincoln speech."},{"Title":"Lincoln at Cooper Union : The Speech That Made Abraham Lincoln President","review":"The most fascinating thing about \\"Lincoln at Cooper Union\\" is the revelation that, in 1860, Presidential candidates did not campaign for office. Once they secured their party's nomination, they rested on their prior record -- lest they accidentally contradict a prior statement in the middle of a final-month stump speech. How things have changed in 110 years!Harold Holzer, who I suspect has a single 679 million-page book about Lincoln at home that he releases 300,000 words at a time, here examines a particular moment in history. As 1859 drew to a close, Abraham Lincoln was a political curiosity, a failed Senate candidate who'd served just a single term in the U.S. House of Representatives, and belonged to the anti-slavery Republican Party -- a truly fringe political figure. And yet, through the course of a single 90-minute speech offered in New York nine months before election day, Lincoln turned himself into President of the United States. Holzer writes that no other speech so swiftly changed the course of a Presidential campaign -- although, to be fair, he wrote that sentence before another local Illinois politician, Barack Obama, took to the stage in support of Senator John Kerry in July 2004.In terms of being historically vivid, \\"Lincoln at Cooper Union\\" made me thirsty. I can't really think of a better compliment I can pay to Holzer's ability to create a world -- specifically, lower Manhattan in February of 1860. After following Lincoln through a series of debilitating train rides all the way across the country from Illinois, Holzer then puts his main character through a 90-minute speech in an non-air-conditioned 19th-century lecture hall without the benefit of any bottled water.World-buliding aside, Holzer closely analyzes not only the speech that he argues catapulted Lincoln from local curiosity to President. In a surprisingly short amount of space, he brings Lincoln from the aftermath of the failed 1858 Senate bid, through the invitation to appear before a Republican party symposium in Brooklyn, across the country, and into an alien world where Lincoln's freakish height, strange accent (he pronounced \\"chairman\\" as \\"cheerman\\"), and unimpressive travel-stained wardrobe, somehow managed to capture a political establishment and change the course of history.The details Holzer reveals are remarkable. From the inside of Matthew Brady's studio, to a study of byzantine 19th-century train timetables, to Manhattan's lower Broadway in 1860 -- not to mention a very close reading of the speech in question -- the author leaves no stone unturned.The speech itself still rewards after close reading. Meant to rebut Senator Douglas's notion that \\"popular sovereignty\\" allowed the spread of slavery into the Territories, meant to warn the Southern states against secession, and meant to prevent the speaker (and his Party) from appearing as John Brown-style abolition radicals, Lincoln presents a compelling, logical argument in support of his position, full of painstaking research that took literally months away from his law practice. The speech itself was a stunning achievement, made even more impressive by the unique confluence of historical circumstances that allowed it to happen, as well as by the strenuous effort it took Lincoln to get to -- and through -- New York in the first place."},{"Title":"Lincoln at Cooper Union : The Speech That Made Abraham Lincoln President","review":"Lincoln at Cooper Union: The Speech That Made Abraham Lincoln President (Simon & Schuster Lincoln Library)The book does a good job of documenting the impact of the speech and provides a copy of it. I consider the book to have given me thoughtful insights to Lincoln that are incidental to the speech but greatly enhance my understanding of him as a human being. It is very elegantly written. I appreciate the author's truely first rate descriptive abilities."},{"Title":"Lincoln at Cooper Union : The Speech That Made Abraham Lincoln President","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely and now look forward to reading more from Holzer about this period. It answered so many questions I had about the messy circumstances surrounding slavery and the formation of the country. What I had always thought of as such hypocrisy was, as I now understand it, an incredible lesson in the human tension between reality and ideals -- such a Christian tension and so true to life, and on such a grand and significant scale. Rather than merely acknowledging the \\"stain\\", as indeed it was, the focus today should be on the triumph of overcoming it.In his highly detailed telling, Holzer over and over exposes Linclon myths surrounding the event and that are, in themselves so revealing of human tendencies. While deflating so many of these myths, in the doing he does so much to explain the likely origins -- often humourous, sometimes self serving, but always understandable and enriching to his story.And not just myths. One I found particularly poignant was repeated on occasion by son Robert who was at Exeter at the time of the speech. While it had been only about 4 months since they had seen each other, a visit to Robert was one of Lincoln's excuses for taking the time and incurring the expense of going East to speak. Lincoln ultimately made about 10 subsequent stops to speak in New England on his return trip to and from Exeter before heading home. While these speeches laid the foundation for his calculating father's ultimate nomination and election, Robert steadfastly maintained the purpose of the trip was to see him. I found that very touching -- it's one thing to be a father to your country, but still another to be so to your son.At the heart of it all was the speech itself and the eager ears, eventually eyes, which took it in. While Lincoln's personality was a factor, the power of his words was what carried he day. I found this revealing and a tonic to today's politics -- an altogether different America then.This was democracy at its best. There is clearly, to me at least, no ideal political system, as all can be manipulated. Now with Hamas the victors in Palestine, I guess even the current administration might be thinking this.I could go on, but won't other than to quote the following recollection attributed to Lincoln and which might best be read with the thought of current schooling in mind:I remember how, when a mere child, I used to get irritated when any body talked to me in a way I could not understand. I don't think I ever got angry at anything else in my life . . . I can remember going to my little bedroom, after hearing the neighbors talk of an evening with my father, and spending no small part of the night walking up and down, and trying to make out what was the exact meaning of some of their, to me, dark sayings. I could not sleep, though I often tried to, when I got on such a hunt after an idea, until I had caught it; and when I thought I had got it, I was not satisfied until I had repeated it over and over, until I had put it in language plain enough, as I thought, for any boy I knew to comprehend. This was a kind of passion with me, and it has stuck by me; for I am never easy now, when I am handling a thought, till I have bounded it North, and bounded it South, and bounded it East, and bounded it West. Perhaps that accounts for the characteristic you observe in my speeches, though I never put the two things together before.PS As a graduate of Cooper Union, I did find Holzer's account of Cooper's amazing building a bit thin. Plans and photos are available on the web. The stage is on the West, not the North as Holzer says, and there are 18 obstructing columns, not 16. These inaccuracies have not altered my faith in his account. I have inserted a plan of the hall in my copy."},{"Title":"Lincoln at Cooper Union : The Speech That Made Abraham Lincoln President","review":"Harold Holzer is by far one of my favorite Lincoln scholars (he's even my friend on Facebook!). With that said, I don't always agree with his conclusions. However, in this book I do. This is a must read for any Lincoln admirer or scholar.Holzer argues that the speech Lincoln gave at Cooper Union was \\"the speech that made him President.\\" In very clear and effective detail, Holzer gives the context of the speech both before and after it was given. Along the way, he clarifies Lincoln myths about the speech--such as the one that Robert Lincoln, his son, was the reason he went to Cooper Union in the first place (I kind of like Robert's story), as well as others such as an invitation to become the lawyer of a large Railroad company afterwards.The book is also amazing in the sentence-by-sentence expository interpretation of the speech. Holzer's excellent details of each sentence Lincoln made in the speech provide the reader with a great insight into the speech. Furthermore, the speech itself became the very campaign that Lincoln did not run in 1860, as is evidenced by the many speeches he made after Cooper Union, many times simply re-telling the speech in New England.Overall this is an excellent book, and easy read, and a very informative part of Lincoln historiography. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to really understand why Lincoln was a master statesman. The ability of Lincoln to reach all kinds of people--from the west to the east to the rich and the poor is perfectly presented by Holzer. This is a must in any Lincoln library."},{"Title":"Lincoln at Cooper Union : The Speech That Made Abraham Lincoln President","review":"Harold Holzer has put forward a masterpiece into the study of the mind set of Abraham Lincoln. I am not to be regarded as a Civil War expert. I do not read everything on the happenings of the American Civil War. My understanding of these times of American History reside at the College Survey level.I learned much of the mind set of Mr. Lincoln in his speech in New York City on February, 1860. Lincoln was truly a great politician. His speech at Cooper Union was the ultimate sitting on the fence appeasement speech. Neville Chamberlain should be ashamed! At this time in American history, this is what America wanted. Being the shrewd politician that he was he continued this process and ultimately won the Presidential election.One thing I took from this book is that Lincoln wrote all his speeches. He was very careful in the words he crafted. As the years went by he carefully changed his position on Slavery and the meanings of a unified government. In all Lincoln got what both he and the majority of Americans wanted. That being a United States of America. Good read!! Five Stars!!!"},{"Title":"Lincoln at Cooper Union : The Speech That Made Abraham Lincoln President","review":"Mr. Holzer wrote a gem of a book. Like many a good read its starts out slow, but eventually builds up momentum until the wave of the speech - and its impact - overcomes you.The author convinces beyond doubt, especially how critical Cooper Union was in Lincoln's testing whether he should pursue the president elect for his party. There is something almost miraculous in his life and development as a leader. There is also something \\"miraculous\\" in the survival of the Union. Both developed in tandem: the free society provided the conditions for the emergence of gifted, timely, and skilled leadership in trying times."},{"Title":"Lincoln at Cooper Union : The Speech That Made Abraham Lincoln President","review":"One would think the book's subtitle \\"The speech that made Abraham Lincoln President,\\" would set up an unattainable expectation of greatness. After all, how could a book hold a candle to a great speech? Or perhaps the speech wasn't so great after all and the author merely wanted to sell more books. And yet, I was wonderfully surprised to see that this really was an exceptional book about an exceptional speech.Harold Holzer is a world renowned expert on Abraham Lincoln and the Civil War. He has won several awards for the numerous books he has authored, co-authored, edited or co-edited on this the most widely studied President in our history. Holzer takes us back to February 1860, a few months before the convention that would nominate Abraham Lincoln on the Republican ticket for President. He examines the opportunity given to Lincoln to speak in New York City, where powerful men like Horace Greeley are looking to put forth an alternative to New York's favorite son, William Seward. Through the negotiations of when and where - and the ultimate surprise upon arrival to find the location had been moved from Brooklyn to Manhattan - Holzer shows a remarkable ability to build tension and anticipation leading to the actual speech itself. He gives us a taste of a time, that in the days before movies and television and 24-hour internet, men were drawn to great speakers, especially of the political variety.And a great speech it was. With several chapters leading up to the speech, Holzer helps us see the intricate research and effort Lincoln exerted over several months to preparing what he felt, presciently so, was to be the most important speech in his life. One chapter is assigned the duty of parsing the intricate language of this 90-minute magnum opus. As Holzer so captivatingly relates, the speech consists of three main sections: the first a historical accounting of the founder's beliefs regarding slavery. Lincoln takes a line from a speech given by his long-time rival from Illinois, Senator Stephen Douglas, in which he says \\"Our fathers, when they framed the Government under which we live, understood this question just as well, and even better, than we do now.\\" With these words repeated over and over in his speech at Cooper Union, Lincoln cleverly recounts the votes that in toto demonstrate convincingly that the founders of our country believed that the federal government did, in fact, have the right and the obligation to restrict the spread of slavery into the new territories. In the second section, Lincoln addresses himself directly to \\"the Southern people,\\" whom he knows will not hear his speech, all while cleverly speaking to northern Republicans whose support he needs. The third, and shortest section, asserts that Republicans cannot relinquish their principle that slavery is wrong just to placate the South, and ends with his now famous line: \\"Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith, let us, to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand it.\\"I read the full speech in the appendix before reading the rest of the book, then again - this time out loud, as if giving it myself - after finishing the chapter explaining its significance. While the speech as read is superb in itself, it is when spoken out loud as an oration that it gains its ultimate power. Holzer has captured this masterpiece with his own masterpiece. This book is a must read for anyone interested in Abraham Lincoln, history, or simply the power of a well prepared speech."},{"Title":"Lincoln at Cooper Union : The Speech That Made Abraham Lincoln President","review":"Well written and easy to read. strong support for this as the speech that made Lincoln President.Thought provoking."},{"Title":"Lincoln at Cooper Union : The Speech That Made Abraham Lincoln President","review":"Essential reading on Abraham Lincoln's February 27, 1860, speech at Cooper Union in New York City. Harold Holzer haswritten a magnificently researched and synthesized work that is almost spellbinding in its ability to bring the reader into Lincoln's world and perhaps mind as he delivers one of the most important speeches of his life just prior to the Republican National Convention of May 1860 and his election to the presidency in November 1860. In the Cooper Union speech, Lincoln masterfully presents his views on the extension of slavery into U.S. Territories in relation to the U.S. Constitution and the intention of the original 39 signers of the Constitution, his views on the &#34;peculiar institution&#34; so fiercely defended by the South, and the position of the Republican Party regarding slavery as of early 1860. A tour de force by Lincoln, a speech that no doubt made him president, and a tour de force by Harold Holzer. Importantly, the book includes as an appendix the complete Nott-Brainerd version of the speech as it was published in September 1860, with their footnotes."},{"Title":"Lincoln at Cooper Union : The Speech That Made Abraham Lincoln President","review":"This book details the effort that Lincoln put into his Cooper Union speech. This speech propelled him into the position of Republican Party nominee for President in 1860 and ultimately into the White House. The book also makes clear that Lincoln actively sought the nomination for President and did not just beome his party's nominee for President by accident."},{"Title":"Lincoln at Cooper Union : The Speech That Made Abraham Lincoln President","review":"The author clearly shows that it is no exaggeration to claim that the momentum generated by Lincoln's visit to NYC and New England at the end of Feb 1860, lasting a little over two weeks, highlighted by his enormously well received speech at the Cooper Union, directly led to his candidacy on the Republican ticket and subsequent election to the Presidency. The author thoroughly dissects the speech in the context of the political landscape of the times, and, in addition, covers numerous details of Lincoln's trip: his mode of travel, descriptions of his destinations, the wide range of people that he met, and the huge reception that he encountered throughout his trip.Lincoln was not unknown to Easterners, certainly not after the Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858. Their interest in Lincoln was fueled by the perceived radicalism of favorite-son William Seward; they felt that only a moderate such as Lincoln could be elected. The ever politically astute Lincoln knew that he could not squander this invitation to speak to the Republican establishment. He shrewdly moved the speech from November to February to have maximum effect on the Republican convention to be held in May, 1860, in Chicago.The most controversial political issue of the day was the spread of slavery to US territories. Sen Stephen Douglas claimed that local residents should vote to permit slavery in any territory (popular sovereignty), while Lincoln claimed that the Federal government had the right to control slavery in territories. The author points out that in that era political speech-making was very important, and Lincoln had few equals on the campaign trail. But this speech was a bit of a departure. His address at Cooper Union was not a campaign stump speech: the tone was serious without his typical injections of anecdotes and wry humor. Lincoln spent months researching US founding documents to arrive at a sound legal defense of his positions.Lincoln also had the immense task of making people comfortable with his entire persona. At first glance, his great height, awkwardness, homely looks, and rumpled appearance made him only a figure of amusement. But within minutes of listening, audiences were generally captivated with his obvious intelligence and ability to connect with them. And so it was at Cooper Union. It was recognized that never before had such a well-reasoned speech been delivered on the subject. The speech was printed in most of the leading newspapers of the day and pamphlets, some of them including the famous Matthew Brady photograph of Lincoln taken during this trip, were produced. He was immediately besieged with speech requests of which he accepted about ten in an exhausting, whirlwind tour that took him to Conn, RI, and NH. In those times, it was expected that official candidates for offices would not campaign, so Lincoln's trip actually served as a successful campaign tour not unlike what is done today.The author is surely correct to emphasize the pivotal nature of Lincoln's Cooper Union address in US history: \\"it brought Abraham Lincoln to the center stage of American politics at precisely the right time and place, and with precisely the right message: that slavery was wrong, and ought to be confined to the areas where it already existed, and placed on the \`course of ultimate extinction'; that the Union was sacred, and could never be rightfully destroyed by sectional discord.\\" It is quite safe to say that US history would have played out somewhat differently if Lincoln had not made such a profound impression at Cooper Union and projected himself into the Presidency.The book is really a quite interesting account of how a somewhat unknown, Western country lawyer/politician was transformed in the public's mind by a mesmerizing speech delivered at the right time and place followed by a triumphant tour of New England in a span of only a couple of weeks. The author does not suggest that the Cooper Union speech has the drama and eloquence of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address and his Second Inaugural Address, which are considered by most to be Lincoln's greatest speeches. But given the occasion, this speech by far is Lincoln's most effective political speech, perhaps the best political speech ever delivered in US political history."},{"Title":"Lincoln at Cooper Union : The Speech That Made Abraham Lincoln President","review":"This book is so well written, that of the books written on Lincoln, it's the best.

But, since it wasn't, 2 stars is the best I can give it."},{"Title":"Lincoln at Cooper Union : The Speech That Made Abraham Lincoln President","review":"Harold Holzer's excellent analysis of the Cooper Union speech is a model of historical and rhetorical scholarship. Written with clarity and unpretentiousness, it offers a wonderful view of the political world of 1859-1860, of Lincoln as a would-be candidate for president seeking to make his first big venture in the East, of the turbulent and anti-Republican metropolis of New York City, of the ordeal of railroad travel, of the growing power of photographic images in politics, and of the interactions of newspapers and politics. Holzer more than proves his case that the Cooper Union speech was vital to making Lincoln President, and that it was one of his greatest and most intellectually formidable speeches. Highly recommended as a book that belongs with Garry Wills's LINCOLN AT GETTYSBURG and Ronald White's LINCOLN'S GREATEST SPEECH: THE SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS. Now if Holzer would only tackle Lincoln's First Inaugural Address and his 1838 Young Men's Lyceum speech in the same way...."},{"Title":"Lincoln at Cooper Union : The Speech That Made Abraham Lincoln President","review":"Of all of Lincoln's pre-Presidential speeches, the one he gave at New York City's Cooper Union in February 1860 stands out as the most historically significant: it made him president; it compelled the South to secede; and it saved the Union. And, yet, as Professor Holzer points out, this speech, while mentioned in history books, is rarely given the recognition it deserves. His comprehensive and readable \\"Lincoln at Cooper Union: The Speech that Made Abraham Lincoln President\\", rectifies this terrible oversight.This is not a step-by-step examination of Lincoln's references in, and the rhetorical craftsmanship of, the speech, although those are explored thoroughly. The book also explores the heretofore unacknowledged campaigning savvy that Lincoln possessed. He knew he had to come to Gotham to convince the Eastern Republicans of his credibility. He knew the importance of the local newspaper printers, like Bryant and Greeley. He understood the importance of having a visual aid, like a Matthew Brady photograph. But, most important, as Professor Holzer takes great pains to reveal, Lincoln did not want to appear to be an abolitionist. That would border on radicalism which would be a guarantee of defeat.As a bonus, \\"Lincoln at Cooper Union: The Speech that Made Abraham Lincoln President\\", presents us with a unique view of 1860 New York: the thieves at the docks; the \\"mass transit\\" of the age; the hunger for entertainment, of which political speeches were a significant part; the elegance and extravagance of the rich; and the desperation of the Five Points poor.\\"Lincoln at Cooper Union: The Speech That Made Abraham Lincoln President\\" is a wonderful book that will please anyone interested in American History, New York City, or oratory. And Professor Holzer deserves our thanks for making it so fascinating. It only reflects his own passion for the subject.Rocco Dormarunno, author of THE FIVE POINTS"},{"Title":"Lincoln at Cooper Union : The Speech That Made Abraham Lincoln President","review":"Harold Holzer's new book further cements Lincoln's reputation as the United States' greatest president. Lincoln's speech at Cooper Union in New York City early in 1860 was designed as a rebuttal to Stephen A. Douglas's doctrine of Popular Sovereignty, which would have allowed the spread of slavery into the territories. It was also meant to define the Republican Party and, by extension, Lincoln himself, countering the South's contention that the Republicans were nothing more than a sectional party. Holzer does a masterful job in relating Lincoln's research in crafting the Cooper Union speech, the long, tiring journey from Illinois to New York, his performance, and the long, winding trip back to Springfield. Holzer's book will stand for quite some time as the definitive study of &quot;The Speech that Made Lincoln President&quot;."},{"Title":"Lincoln at Cooper Union : The Speech That Made Abraham Lincoln President","review":"Harold Holzer's book on Abraham Lincoln's speech at Cooper Union gives a clarity to the importance of that speech and how it affected Lincoln as a speaker, politican and future candidate for his Republican Party. While Lincoln was well known among the western states, he wasn't that well regarded along the northeastern seaboard. One of the most important things about the book was how the author explained how this speech gave Lincoln so much creditability among the easterners and how that speech firmly put Lincoln on the political map national wide. This helped pave the way for Lincoln's nomination when others were looking for alternative choices beside William Seward who was at that time, the leading Republican front runner.The book proves to be quite informative. Abraham Lincoln is obviously one person you cannot judge by your first impression. The author throughly explained the mannerism of Lincoln's speech skills and the way it contrast to his physical appearances which often led to initial misgiving by the audience before they roared in their approval at the end of the speech.Its pretty clear that Mr. Holzer have complete command of his subject matter which is reflected on the superb writing and ease of reading material that only an expert can do to any subject. The book appears to be well researched and it was about time that a book on this subject came out (I think the last book about this speech came out before Mr. Holzer was born).I would considered this book to be a mandatory reading material for anyone interested in Abraham Lincoln and probably a good background material for anyone interested in the coming of the American Civil War."},{"Title":"Lincoln at Cooper Union : The Speech That Made Abraham Lincoln President","review":"This excellent book, by Harold Holzer, sheds light on the speech that may well have launched Lincoln towards the Republican nomination for president in 1860. In the fall of 1859, Lincoln had received an invitation to speak at the Plymouth Church in Brooklyn, NY. After negotiations about the most convenient date, it was agreed that Lincoln would speak in February 1860 for a fee of $200.00. He made the long, arduous trip from Springfield, IL, and when he arrived in New York, he discovered that the speech was going to take place in Manhattan at Cooper Union (the organizers had overlooked informing him of this change).He had an ill fitting, rumpled suit that was packed in a trunk. Prior to the speech, he went to Matthew Brady's studio, and through photographic wizardry, Brady made Lincoln appear distinguished looking although he was actually ungainly and he was wearing that suit. Because he seemed so presidential in the photo, it was used in campaign literature and was widely distrubuted, often with artistic variations. That night, when he appeared on the stage, people were shocked at the awkward looking presence before them. He got up to speak and he started in sort of a frontier accent (some reports state that he opened by saying \\"Mr. Cheerman.\\"). Before long, however, he had the audience enraptured. The first part of the speech was a well researched, scholarly exposition on whether the Constitution authorized the federal government to regulate slavery in the territories. By demonstrating that many signers of the Constitution who later served in Congress voted for such regulations (such as in the Northwest Territories) he argued forcefully that their understanding was that the Constitution did allow it. Thus, if we look to the intention of the fathers as Stephen Douglas had suggested in an earlier periodical article, such regulation is permissible. Therefore, with his exhaustive research, he basically hung Douglas by his own pitard by adopting Douglas's standard of analysis. He also spoke to the southern states; of course this was a rhetorical device since his intended \\"audience\\" was not present. Finally, he rallied the Republican party.The speech was a huge success and it took place in the Republican frontrunner's (Senator William Seward) home state of New York. The speech was widely published and distributed. Furthermore, Lincoln travelled to New Hampshire to visit his son Robert who was attending school there, and while on the road, Lincoln delivered variant's of the speech several more times. The speech brought Lincoln to national prominence and, since it was considered unseemly for presidential candidates to actually campaign back then, the speech, the additional speeches in New England, and the printed copies basically served as his only active campaign.This book is well written and extraordinarilly captivating for any reader who is interested in Lincoln or the Civil War era. In addition, Holzer includes the text of the speech in an appendix. I once saw a recreation of the speech (I believe on CSpan) delivered by Sam Waterston, and I certainly recommend hearing the speech if it is ever repeated. However, if you don't have that opportunity, you can read it in it's entirety in the appendix. By the way, there is a book with a similar title and similar cover art (the Matthew Brady photo) by John A. Corry. I intend to read that book also and will review and and compare it when I do so."},{"Title":"Lincoln at Cooper Union : The Speech That Made Abraham Lincoln President","review":"Holzer provides a fascinating view of Lincoln's important Eastern \\"coming out\\" which ultimately led to him becoming president. The narrative is clear; the research is thorough; and the analysis is first rate. Books of this type are often painfully dry; however, the author relates the history and provides his analysis in an easy and compelling manner. It's not a Grisham thriller, but you will keep reading until the end.While the Cooper Union speech doesn't reach the emotional heights of the Gettysburg Address or the Second Inaugural speech, it is still masterful rhetoric that achieves all of its key goals - shoot down Douglas' arguement against federal authority to limit the expansion of slavery to the territories; provide a unifying theme for the Republican party; and, allow Lincoln to present himself as a leading spokesman for the new party.It's not clear if Lincoln seriously entertained pursuit of the presidential nomination prior to the speech, but the overwhelmingly positive reaction to it either prompted him to consider it, or removed any lingering reluctance he had.Holzer's account is in three logical parts - the setup (how Lincoln was invited to speak, the preparation for the speaking engagement itself; and the preparation of the speech); the speech itself; and, the aftermath which led up to him becoming president.In addition to descriptions of the events surrounding the speech, the book provides an excellent discussion of the context of the circumstances and insight into its meaning. Holzer provides a good overview of the rhetorical devices as well as the logic used by Lincoln so that the reader learns why the speech was so effective."},{"Title":"Lincoln at Cooper Union : The Speech That Made Abraham Lincoln President","review":"For anyone who wants to use the founding fathers as a justification for their belief system should read this speech and this book.Lincoln in tight, careful reasoning lays out exactly what the founding fathers believed in regard to slavery.

Mr Holzer writes fluidly of an important, though seldom explained, moment in our nation\`s history. Holzer also does an excellent job puncturing the numerous myths surrounding the speech and events both before and after that February evening. Lincoln comes across less of an icon, more human in his ambition and political calculation. An excellent read."},{"Title":"Lincoln at Cooper Union : The Speech That Made Abraham Lincoln President","review":"There are so many books written on Lincoln and many different prespectives on his life and presidency. Holzer looks at the Cooper Union Speech and shows how Lincoln, the master politician used the speech and his trip East to get the 1860 nomination. Many historians assert that the speech made Lincoln. However, Holzer shows a unique view of the trip and the speech and how Lincoln used the opportunity to campaign in the East before he was officially a candidate. Ironically, Holzer points out that Salmon Chase turned down the opportunity to speak at Cooper Union demonstrating just one more ocassion when Chase blew an opportunity to get to the White House.While dispelling many myths about the speech and Lincoln's trip, Holzer also shows the brillance of Lincoln and the time and effort that he spent in preparation for this speech. He also shows how this speech became Lincoln's stump speech. Once nominated, Lincoln followed the tradition of the time and did not campaign but used the Cooper Union Speech as essentially his platform.For the person just beginning their interest in Lincoln or the seasoned scholar, this book is well worth the read. To add to that it is a quick and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Lincoln at Cooper Union : The Speech That Made Abraham Lincoln President","review":"In October, 1859, a small group of young Republican leaders in New York City invited Abraham Lincoln to give an address at Henry Beecher's church in Brooklyn on a subject of Lincoln's choosing. At the time, Lincoln was heavily involved in helping Republican Congressional candidates, was still smarting from his 1858 defeat for the Senate by Stephen Douglas, and was a dark-horse, favorite son for the Republican presidential nomination. Lincoln accepted the invitation, worked painstakingly on the speech, and travelled to New York City to deliver what became the Cooper Union Address on February 27, 1860. (Lincoln was unaware that the venue for the speech had been changed until he arrived in New York.) The speech and its aftermath brought Lincoln national attention. It played a major role in allowing Lincoln to overtake the Republican front-runner, Senator William Seward of New York, and secure the nomination and the presidency.Harold Holzer is an independent scholar who, in the midst of a busy career at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, has written or edited over twenty books about Lincoln. His most recent book: \\"Lincoln at Cooper Union: The Speech that made Abraham Lincoln President\\" (2004) is a comprehensive account of the \\"momentous\\" Cooper Union Address, including (p. 1) \\"its impetus, preparation, delivery, reception, publication, calculated reiteration, and its enormous, perhaps decisive impact on that year's presidential campaign.\\" It is one of a number or recent books that examine in detail a specific Lincoln speech or proclamation, (such at the Gettysburg Address, Second Inaugural Address, Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln-Douglas debates.) But the book does more. It helps the reader understand Lincoln and the issues that lead to the Civil War.The Cooper Union speech was lengthy, scholarly, and factual and endeavored to show that a majority of the founders -- those that signed the Constitution -- believed that Congress had the right to regulate and prevent the spread of slavery into the territories. This issue was central to the dispute between North and South and to Lincoln's debates with his great opponent, Senator Douglas. Holzer's book begins with a discussion of how Lincoln, the self-educated backwoods lawyer and stump speaker carefully researched this issue in an attempt to present a dispassionate yet morally committed approach to the issue of slavery.The book includes excellent accounts of the difficult and tiring nature of train travel during Lincoln's time, especially for an aspiring presidential candidate travelling to make a major address. It includes fascinating discussions of the New York City of 1860 --Walt Whitman's New York -- and its docks, piers, hotels, and Broadway. There is a wonderful account of Lincoln's visit while in the City to Five Points -- a notorious slum -- and a letter he subsequently received in the presidency from young men in a charitable school that he visited at the time.While in New York, Lincoln had a famous photograph taken by Matthew Brady. Brady's artistry made Lincoln look distinguished and presidential rather than like a tall, gangling shabbily dressed backwoodsman. The Brady photo together with the speech helped bring Lincoln to public attention.In the heart of the book, Holzer offers a detailed analysis of the Cooper Union speech (the text is given in an appendix) and of Lincoln's delivery that fateful evening. Although his audience was initially taken aback by the rough-hewn Lincoln, the substance of the speech and Lincoln's style of his delivery captivated the audience and made an astonishing impression. Lincoln helped shepherd his text into print, and made a hectic speaking tour of New England while visiting his son Robert at Exeter, thus furthering his position as a statesman of vision, integrity, and prudence.An interesting feature of the book is how Holzer reminds the reader of the fragile nature of historical accounts, including alleged eye-witness accounts. Many times, Holzer points out a received account of the Cooper Union speech and shows in detail how the account is questionably supported or is inconsistent with other sources. (For example, there is a story that Erastus Corning, Director of the New York Central Railroad offered Lincoln the position as corporate counsel following the speech for the large salary of $10,000. Holzer shows that this account lacks foundation.) The book shows how historical sources need to be approached, used, and interpreted with caution.This book is an outstanding account of Lincoln in his complexity as a pragmatic, opportunistic and yet highly principled leader. It gives a vivid picture of our country and its political life in 1860. It considers issues about the nature of the Union and of human freedom that Lincoln addressed eloquently. These issues remain with us today.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Excuse Me, Which Pick-up Line Works Best on You?","review":"This book is not a very original idea and some of the lines are the same ones repeated over and over."},{"Title":"Excuse Me, Which Pick-up Line Works Best on You?","review":"This book degrades women and homosexuals. NOT FUNNY at all."},{"Title":"The Shunra and the Schmetterling","review":"Lively images of the cat (shunra) and the butterfly (schmetterling) chase and play through the memories of a poetic child as Yoel Hoffmann, one of Israel's most celebrated writers, recreates childhood and the coming of age. More than sixty years have passed since the speaker first lived in Rabat Gan, and the passage of time has intensified some memories, eliminated the irrelevancies from others, and connected the fantasies of childhood with the perennial mysteries of adulthood. As he begins to recall images from his life, the veranda on which his grandfather sat rises from memory, &quot;like that legendary bird rising from its ashes&quot; and becomes &quot;the veranda of the world itself,&quot; a symbol of the experiences of the family and, ultimately, the history of the Jewish people, a veranda with &quot;A broken railing. Grillwork like Auschwitz. A floor laid with tiles of pogroms...Nuremberg laws in the plaster...&quot;Not a manifesto or catalogue of wrongs, this &quot;memoir&quot; is the vivid and poetic evocation of one boy's life, the people he remembers from a seemingly ordinary Israeli village, and his discoveries about dreams and the passage of time. Impressions from past and present flow through the speaker's consciousness, unfiltered, with one idea reminding him of another from another place and time. Gradually, the reader meets the speaker's grandfather, father, and deceased mother, the neighbors, his teachers, and his friends, all of whom have sought sanctuary in Israel from other places. Words in Aramaic, Hebrew, German, Yiddish, and even Icelandic, are sprinkled casually throughout the story, a natural part of the speaker's memory and the collective memory of his village and country.Though &quot;A butterfly big as a volume of Talmud stood above our heads&quot; throughout the speaker's childhood, the adults in the village have had more difficult lives, all of them having escaped from various wars. Soon it is time for the speaker to serve in his own army and fight in his own war, an experience which marks him forever. Nature imagery--of birds, animals, clouds, and the sky--permeate this impressionistic painting of a poet's life, giving depth and color to instants in time and to moments in history. Through intense, compressed and sometimes elusive pictures, the story--and our understanding of the speaker--do gradually emerge, insinuating themselves into our own consciousness and speaking directly to us, a powerful communication between author and reader which transcends time and place.

This volume, however, is different - for the first time I felt on the outside looking in without comprehension. Why? I suspect it is because I am not Jewish and have never been to Israel. Hoffman has written a beautiful, poetic narrative of childhood. It is, perhaps, closer to prose poems than poetic prose. The images are multifaceted gems that are pleasurable to read. But the connotations that should have arisen from the references to Jewish writers, to children's songs, to Jewish festival prayers and hymns -- footnotes gave me minimal denotations. The rest was lost on me.I still recommend everything by Hoffman but suggest that you learn to love him from one of his earlier books before tackling The Shunra and the Schmetterling.Earlier works:The Christ of FishorBernhard"},{"Title":"No Name (Penguin Classics)","review":"When both of their parents die in close succession, Magdalene and Norah Vanstone are shocked to find themselves left with no inheritance, due to fact that their parents were not actually married at the time of their birth.\\"No Name\\" is a good book, albeit a bit too long for my liking, but not a book that I would ever read again. Although I found it fascinating to learn of how illegitimate children were treated back in the 1800's (a topic that must have been close to Collins's heart, considering that he never married the mother of his children), this tale of a young woman's descent and torment at the hands of uncaring relatives, was just too depressing for my liking. Yes, it does have a happy ending, but having to wait over 700 pages to get to that ending wasn't much fun at all. I much preferred Collins's two, better known, works, \\"The Woman in White\\" and \\"The Moonstone\\"."},{"Title":"No Name (Penguin Classics)","review":"I am somewhat embarrassed to admit that until recently I had never heard of this book. However, I saw it on Harold Bloom's list of books comprising the \\"Western Canon\\" and, since I like Collins, I decided to read it. What I find! I am at a loss to understand why this book is not better known, because in this book Collins truly rivals Dickens in plot development and characterization. \\"The Moonstone\\" and \\"The Woman in White\\" are classics, but \\"No Name\\" is better. Yet it is almost unknown, and I understand that for a long time it was out of print.The less you know about this book the better. This is because it is one of the most ingeniously plotted books I have ever read, so it is best to be taken by surprise with the plot twists. Suffice it to say that it is about two sisters in a well to do Victorian household who discover, after both their parents die in fairly short order, that they are illegitimate and have no rights of inheritance. Norah, the older sister, passively accepts her fate and finds work as a governess, but Magdalen, the younger sister and the book's central character, becomes obsessed with revenge and with getting back the fortune which is rightfully hers. In this she is assisted by a charming rogue named Horatio Wragge. Read the book and see what happens! I think you'll agree that it is one of the best reads of your life."},{"Title":"No Name (Penguin Classics)","review":"No Name is the third book I've read from Wilkie Collins, the first two being The Moonstone and The Woman in White, which are considered to be the two most popular of his novels. As with those two, Collins once again comes up with a book that is deep, complicated, yet intriguing, suspenseful and fun to read, all despite its hefty length (over seven hundred pages). No Name takes on the issue of illegitimacy, which in Collins' time period might have been a stigma of disgrace for the children (although today we probably wouldn't even budge). The novel's main protagonist, Magdalen, is one of the two Vanstone sisters, who are dubbed \\"no one's children\\" after the truth about their parents' marriage is revealed. Symbolically, both sisters have their identity stolen from them in society; legally, both also have their inheritance and legacy taken from them and given to their greedy uncle, Michael Vanstone, who was on bad terms with their father. When he dies, all the inheritance then goes over to his equally greedy son, Noel. Both sisters, Norah and Magdalen, have to fend for themselves in the world after losing money and their home. While Norah tries to go about living by being a governess, Magdalen, very much the opposite of Norah, wants to reclaim their father's inheritance at any cost or means necessary. The story moves away from Norah, and we focus primarily on Magdalen the rest of the way.Several aspects make No Name an engaging book, namely its vivid characterization and plot devices. Collins constructs a complicated plot where Magdalen teams up with the self-proclaimed \\"moral agriculturalist\\" (aka scoundrel) Captain Wragge in attempts to regain the family inheritance, and the pair concoct a scheme which includes changing their names, identity, and their attire to gain access to Noel Vanstone and the inheritance. Magdalen even decides to take on the idea of marrying the miserly Noel Vanstone. However, Captain Wragge meets his match in Mrs. Lecount, the faithful and even shrewder governess for Noel Vanstone. Probably the most entertaining part of No Name is following along with all the twists and turns as Captain Wragge and Mrs. Lecount attempt to outmaneuver each other. Wragge and Lecount will stoop as low as they can to trick each other, and this creates some rather distasteful encounters, but funny nonetheless. Collins has a way of creating suspense, and then twisting a plot event into another suspenseful moment. Magdalen is the most complex character in the Collins' work, as she is a rare female hero in Victorian fiction that is feisty and unrelenting in her pursuit, even to the point where she can be cruel to those close to her. There are times when you want to root for her, but there are times when you feel as though she is acting too impulsive and foolhardy. Part of her depth stems from the idea that she is not just trying to only save her and her sister's name, but out of principle for her father's memory. Captain Wragge is one of the more memorable characters in fiction; his slyness is unrelenting, and his \\"street smarts\\" about deception is unparalleled in any character I've read. He struck me as reminiscent of a Dickens-type character in his eccentricity, which is not coincidental since Collins and Dickens were friends.Where The Moonstone and The Woman in White take suspense and blend in mystery and a tad of the supernatural, No Name is more of suspense with a moral issue attached. Similar to Dickens, Collins tended to produce books in serial form where there are many tiny episodes and a cliffhanger towards the end of the chapters. The writing in No Name reflects this type of format, but there are also letters written from one character to another to help the plot progress along. This is an interesting device because you get into each of the character's heads as the plot thickens.Over all, any fan of Victorian literature or Dickens will enjoy No Name. The more I read Wilkie Collins, the more I want to read other books by him. It's too bad that this book has been so neglected and overlooked, and not mentioned when the word \\"classic\\" is thrown around by scholars and readers. This novel would also make for a fantastic film (as long as the producers didn't mess up the story).Great book! Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"No Name (Penguin Classics)","review":"I am happy to be the first person to review this book in this format.

Being a Wilkie Collins fan already I knew I would like the book but I was totally unprepared at how the story developed. It is most certainly worth your time. Enjoy this wonderful read!!"},{"Title":"No Name (Penguin Classics)","review":"When Mr and Mrs Vanstone are killed in an accident, an understandable oversight and the misogynistic vagaries of Victorian law have left their daughters, Magdalen and Norah, orphaned and penniless. The Vanstone estate passes in its entirety to their embittered uncle who refuses to recognize the justice of their claim against his brother's wealth. A sanguine, disappointed and much more conventional Norah resigns herself to her fate and takes up a position as governess to support herself. But a furious and defiant Magdalen refuses to accept the loss of what she knows is rightfully hers and her sisters. With the help of an unscrupulous con artist, Captain Horatio Wragge, Magdalen embarks on a labyrinthine Machiavellian scheme to steal back her birthright.In his own preface to NO NAME, Wilkie Collins acknowledged that while he wanted to use the success he had achieved with his first ground-breaking \\"sensation novel\\", THE WOMAN IN WHITE, he also wanted to push his story-telling into new divergent directions. Far from being a purely gothic or atmospheric mystery, NO NAME is astonishingly realistic and down to earth. Norah's and Magdalen's illegitimacy in law and their loss of social status and inheritance rights are all entirely believable. Beginning a theme which he returned to later in MAN AND WIFE, Collins used his writing as a platform to examine the legal, moral and social issues of Victorian law as it related to marriage and the status of women. And he certainly didn't hesitate to use that platform to express his deep dismay over the inequities that he perceived in those laws.Interestingly, while Magdalen's quest to recover her fortune by any means available was quite understandable and, even to the most establishment bound Victorian reader, somewhat justifiable, she is not a particularly likable heroine. The dubious choices she made were certainly a substantial part of what made NO NAME such a scandalous book in its time and, equally certainly, are part of what makes NO NAME an enduring classic that allows readers to judge for themselves the virtues of what she does in the name of justice.Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"No Name (Penguin Classics)","review":"4.5/5 starsAfter the untimely death of their parents, the Vanstone sisters, Norah and Magdalen, face the stark reality of social stigma in Victorian England. Orphaned and penniless, they learn the devastating truth - they are illegitimate (children with \\"no name\\", hence the title of the book). And due to an anomaly in their father's will, the entirety of his wealth and estate is legally entailed away to their heartless uncle, who has no regard for their futures.Vastly different in temperament, the elder sister, Norah calmly accepts her change in circumstance, resigned to accept work as a governess, while independent and scheming Magdalen refuses to accept the fate that their uncle has bestowed upon them and sets out on her own, vowing revenge.To carry out her complex strategy of retribution, Magdalen enlists the assistance of the wily Captain Wragge, a distant relation and a self-confessed defrauder, who proves to be a comic relief with a tender humane heart at the core. Readers will be delighted to discover Wragge is just as memorable as many of Dickens' likable miscreants (not unlike Little Dorrit's Mr. Pancks).Wragge and Magdalen face an uphill battle of wits, trying to outsmart the ruthlessly sharp Mrs. Lecount, the controlling and manipulative housekeeper of the will's beneficiary, Noel Vanstone. While Norah dutifully carries on with her life without incident, the intrepid Magdalen continues on with her quest for justice - at any expense - culminating in a surprise ending.Perfectly plotted, though admittedly a tad bit slow at the outset, 'No Name' is a treat for any classics lover and is well worth the time invested in its 700+ pages. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"No Name (Penguin Classics)","review":"Everybody knows this Victorian novelist for his ultra-popular The Moonstone and The Woman in White. However, Wilkie Collins's lesser known novels are also worth reading. In my opinion, No Name is a lot better than both of the author's more popular novels, and I wonder why it isn't better known.The greatest achievement of the novel is the protagonist, Magdalen Vanstone. World literature hasn't produced many images of strong, resourceful, intelligent women. This is why rare exceptions such as Collins's heroine are so priceless. Magdalen is a woman with a cause, a plan, a dream that she pursues single-mindedly and without any reservations. Thankfully, this dream does not consist of snagging a rich husband with a big mansion, which makes Magdalen very unlike the insipid protagonists of Austin's novels.No Name has a very complex plot where two powerful, resourceful women scheme against each other. At a first glance, it seems that the object of their scheming is money. However, one soon realizes that it isn't about money at all for either of the heroines. Of course, as women of the comfortable, educated class of society, they need some financial means to maintain an existence that will not be too degrading to their sensibilities. However, their struggle for the inheritance allows them to exercise their intelligence in a way that no other pursuits available to women of their class at the time would be able to do.The ending of the novel is particularly curious. Behind an apparent concession to the patriarchal norms presenting women as pathetic, fragile flowers, the readers can see an alternative vision of reality, one where women remain untamed and undaunted no matter what befalls them.It's interesting how the novels with weak and pathetic female characters survive and preserve their popularity a lot better than novels with powerful and complex female protagonists. Everybody is besotted with the inane, weak and weepy protagonists of Pride and Prejudice Anna Karenina, Madame Bovary, etc. but who has heard of Magdalen Vanstone and Aurora Floyd? Bear in mind that the absolute majority of the readership of these novels is and has always been female."},{"Title":"No Name (Penguin Classics)","review":"Before picking up this book, one must adjust their values and morals meters - suspend judgement for a the 21st century world - and be open to learning about the life and value systems of Collins' world. This author is excellent at portraying the black, white and very grey value systems of the period and how they are reflected in the characters thoughts, actions and motives. The questions of fate, god's hand, or karma all arise in this story that twists, turns, strays and sneaks up on the reader. At times ponderous and slow for the modern reader but the attraction of extreme motives and morals more then overcomes.This story is very relevant to the extreme and divergent values at great conflict in our world today - spiritual, religious, amoral, evil. Could be straight from the headlines or the pulpit or the politician today."},{"Title":"No Name (Penguin Classics)","review":"William Wilkie Collins (1824-89) was one of the early authors of whodunit and sensational fiction in the Victorian world. His most famous books are \\"The Moonstone\\"; \\"The Woman in White\\"; \\"Armadale\\" and \\"No Name.\\"No Name was first published in 1862 to wide sales. The book is much lesser read today but is still worth reading in all its 741 page glory!The story is complicated.

The mother dies in a middle age childbirth while their kind find is killed in a railroad accident. They are disbarred from inheriting the estate of their rich grandfather with the money being given to the foolish, vain and cruel Noel Vanstone their cousin and the son of the deceased Michael Vanstone (who is their father's brother).Norah becomes a governess but Magdalene is much more feisty! She (under the management of swindler Captain Wragge)performs dramatic readings throughout England and she disguises herself to spy on Noel Vanstone.

Norah and Magdalene fall in love with good and decent men whose names are George Bartram and Captain KirkeTo tell the rest of the story would spoil it for new readers! Just let it be said that the book has a good deal of humor, interesting characters and is a page turner. It is also written in a style easy to read which provides many cliff hangers and shocking surprises along the way.

Obviously, I can't recommend it enough!"},{"Title":"No Name (Penguin Classics)","review":"No name is somewhat of a social commentary on nineteenth-century laws towards illegitimate children. Wilkie Collins was known to tackle social problems in his novels, and he was partial to the plight of women. In No Name, Collins had a chance to write about both of these social issues. The Vanstone family lived a happily and peaceful existence at the Combe-Raven estate. Mr and Mrs Vanstone had two daughters: Norah and Magdalen. Norah, the eldest, was the docile of the two. Magdalen, the youngest and a great beauty, was headstrong and unpredictable.When Andrew Vanstone unexpectedly dies in an accident and his wife shortly thereafter, the Vanstone daughters are left devastated and alone. What could possibly be worse than losing two parents in such a short span of time? How about finding out that your parents were not legally married at the time of your birth and your inheritance and everything you thought you possessed is now to be put into the hands of a complete stranger. This is the plot of Wilke Collins No Name.Andrew Vanstone's fortune is transfered into the hands of his brother, the cold-hearted, Michael Vanstone. When Michael Vanstone dies, the fortune find itself in the possession of the equally odious, Noel Vanstone. Norah meekly accepts her unfortunate fate, but Magdalen is haunted by the injustice done towards her father's wishes. She decides she WILL regain what is rightfully hers.Magdalen finds a partner in crime in a distant relative, the unscrupulous, Captain Wragge. Together, Magalden and the Captain plot to swindle the unsuspecting Noel Vanstone out of his fortune. However, Magdalen and the Captain meet their match in Novel Vanstone's housekeeper, Mrs Lecount. The gullible Mr Vanstone may be taken in by Magdalen's youth and beauty, but Mrs Lecount suspects foul play from the start. Magdalen and the Captain know Mrs Lecount knows and Mrs Lecount they know. The majority of the novel consists of the twosome trying to outsmart the cunning housekeeper and vice versa. I must say this was an incredbily entertaining read! The novel is quite long. It is over 700 pages. It took me a little bit longer to read than most novels, but it did not disappoint."},{"Title":"No Name (Penguin Classics)","review":"Victorian novelist Wilkie Collins is known today primarily for two novels, \\"The Woman in White\\" and \\"The Moonstone.\\" It's a shame some of his other works are not more readily available, for they are worth reading as well. A case in point is \\"No Name,\\" written between his two masterpieces. \\"No Name\\" tells the story of two young women, Magdalen and Norah Vanstone, who lead a happy and comfortable life in the loving care of their parents and governess. Their idyllic existence is shattered by the sudden death of both their parents and the cruel realization that they have been disinherited. The older sister, Norah, accepts their change in situation with resignation and stoicism, and prepares for a new life as a governess. Magdalen, however, refuses to accept her fate, and becomes determined to recover their lost inheritance. She is assisted in her quest by Captain Wragge, a rather disreputable relation on her mother's side. Opposing them is a formidable woman named Mrs. Lecount. One of the most enjoyable parts of the book is the battle of wits between Wragge and Lecount as each tries to outmaneuver the other.Magdalen Vanstone was considered rather wicked by Victorian readers, but I'm not sure most modern readers would agree. While she's clearly willing to use unethical means to reverse what she, and I believe most people, would see as an injustice, she's not amoral. In fact, while the story may have been considered shocking at the time, I found it rather tame (although still highly enjoyable).Don't be put off by the length. \\"No Name is the type of novel that is best enjoyed when the reader allows it to unfold at its own pace.

Sure, \\"Vanity Fair\\" came out first, but there's a definite Thackerayesque flavour in Collins' work - for instance, \\"A Rogue's Life\\" somehow resembles \\"Barry Lyndon\\" in substance and style; moreover, in \\"No Name\\" Collins avails of a narrative device implemented in Thackeray's masterpiece - that of resorting to the correspondence among the characters in order to carry the plot swiftly plus delving into their minds. Still, whereas missives were ocassional in \\"Vanity Fair\\", presented only to fill holes in the characters' individual (therefore limited and biased) perspective and experience, so that the readers were, contrary to these characters, given a clear and complete view of the spectacle framed by the author, \\"No Name\\" is divided in eight scenes, with a section called 'Between the scenes; progress of the story through the post', attached in between them, obviously, which sections contain letters, affording Collins some relief from the task of recounting facts by allowing the characters to speak for themselves, offering important details that will bear on the story next.Another trait akin to both Magdalen Vanstone and Becky Sharp is their flair for mimicking people; yet, while the two lasses also share a strong determination, attended by an utter lack of scruples, to attain their object, their motives differ widely (Becky's was burning ambition to climb up the social ladder; Magdalen's, restitution of her family fortune).Now, there's a Brontnian streak in the episode at the Admiral Bartram's house - at any rate, the mistery behind the blockade of the Admiral's room door every night recalled, to my susceptible mind, the incidents at Mr. Rochester's manor in \\"Jane Eyre\\". Later on, I may add, Collins revisited the perplexing occurrence brought about by the peculiar condition afflicting the Admiral; just that, in \\"The Moonstone\\", the source of this condition happens to be artificial - that is, opium-induced.A final note, in \\"No Name\\" I found my absolute favourite villain in literature - Captain Wragge, for he openly admits that he's a swindler; however, in his own terms, that word means: 'a moral agriculturist; a man that cultivates the field of human sympathy'.What with Captain Wragge's constant upbraidings of his numskull wife on mere trifles, his highfalutin descantings on the art of deception, and his battle of wits against Mrs. Lecount, you shall rejoice this tale immensely."},{"Title":"No Name (Penguin Classics)","review":"This was a very enjoyable book and one that I couldn't stop reading.

Both novels are indeed quite enjoyable. However I found them to be very different, and almost &quot;unbalanced&quot;. 'The Woman in White' is a complex novel, a rollercoaster of plot-twists at a hysterical pace. On the other hand, 'The Moonstone' is a slow-paced mystery which moves towards a satisfying conclusion. 'No Name' fits nicely in between.'No Name' is a story about how two sisters go on different paths on coming to terms with life after being mistreated by a cruel twist of fate, and being the victim of inhumane Victorian-era society (and its laws). The elder sister carries on without mishap, while the younger sister seeks justice at any expense ... to the extent of performing unethical and criminal activities herself. While seeking justice she encounters some rather equally cunning individuals (..another woman in particular), and the story unfolds into a battle of who can outfox whom. And it becomes abundantly clear that the person viewed initially as the victim is actually very cruel.Finally, I have to recommend the Penguin Classic version of this novel for one simple reason: its cover is great. It is a painting of a young woman (&quot;Miss Dene&quot;) who has such a sad, reflective expression on her face that one feels she is indeed the poor, suffering (yet malicious) younger sister Magdalen."},{"Title":"No Name (Penguin Classics)","review":"4 1/2 stars, but I rounded up.No Name is the story and portrait of Magdalen Vanstone... or as Wilkie introduces his novel in the preface, \\"Here is one more book that depicts the struggle of a human creature, under those opposing influences of Good and Evil, which we have all felt, which we have all known.\\" It's a fairly accurate description as throughout the course of the story, we see the evolution of the character of our heroine; we see her heading down a shady path, but yet somehow from a 21st century perspective, Magdalen manages to make it seem not so immoral. Often times I see her trying to act as morally as she can in the unmoral situations she chooses to involve herself in. Part of No Name's strength, arises from the deftness in which Collins creates Magdalen. She posseses such an enormous range in character and emotion that if No Name were ever to be made into a movie, actresses would vie to have her role.When Magdalen and her sister's inheritance are taken away due to unexpected familial circumstances, Magdalen resolutely follows a reckless path of revenge. While not exactly your Victorian equivalent of your \\"Kill Bill,\\" the novel seems closer in spirit to Alexander Dumas's novel: The Count of Monte Cristo. Of course it doesn't have the swashbuckling quality of Dumas's novel as there are no fight scenes to the death. Collins's novel is set in a domestic scene with a female protagonist and the action is far tamer. It is equally gripping though because it's the chase of the revenge that's the fun part; the deceit and swindling involved, the careful measuring of your enemy's abilities that is part of charm. Collins was genius to embroil a female in a revenge type of plot and I'm just amazed at how much free agency Collins bestows upon Magdalen - a female living in Victorian times. He completely cuts her off from the ties of society and gives her free reign.While I was reading, I felt that the novel could be loosely separated into 3 quite different parts - each with it's own distinct pacing and mood. It goes quite well with the divisions of the triple-decker novel they had long ago. I'm not spoiling much because the novel covers such massive ground, but the first part covers the idyllic times of the Vanstone family and we come to see how the inheritance is stripped from the Vanstone daughters. The second part (the best and my favorite) follows Magdalen as she pursues her revenge with the superior help of the rogue Captain Wragge, a self-proclaimed, \\"moral agriculturist\\" (I'll leave you to discover what he means by it). Wragge is one of Collins' best creations (he even beats out Count Fosco in my mind). A short, brown eyed, green eyed creature with enormous talents and verbal abilities, he is very resourceful, calculates very well, and is able to adapt quickly to whatever is needed in each situation. One of the highlights of No Name resides in Wragge's chronicle describing Magdalen's progress. The other crowning achievement is the cat and mouse game played between Captain Wragge and Madame Lecount (the housekeeper and keeper of the interest of Magdalen's victim). Both are directors of people and there is a large amount of plotting and counter-plotting that goes on that keeps the pages turning. It is here that No Name rivals that of The Woman in White, and if Collins had continued to write in this vein, No Name could have been on an equal footing to Woman in White.However it is in the third part -dealing with the fallout of the revenge- that No Name becomes more flawed. I would say especially so in the ending. Quite a lot of Victorians found the ending distasteful, but the modern reader might find it a little dissatisfying for a completely different reason.As No Name was delivered right after Collins's magnum opus, The Woman in White, there was a possibility of being in its shadow. However, Collins more than safely overcomes such a hurdle. He's crafted an entirely different story. Although in a way, I almost see No Name as an inverse of Woman in White. Think of a story looking and rooting from the side of Sir Percieval and Count Fosco--the nefarious plotting to take away an inheritance--and in a way, it is the story of Madgalen and Captain Wragge. Of course our sympathies are on completely different sides and this is due to the strength of Collins's characterizations. But that said, the books feel almost nothing alike.In the end, although not as tightly plotted as The Woman in White and a bit more flawed, No Name is more ambitious, covers more ground, more character development, a lot more stories, introduces way more secondary characters, and is pretty amazing as a whole. It's a massive novel in which Collins fleshes out so many people (and for Collins that usually means, so many people to like) and Collins is able to accomplish a measurable change and growth in the character of Magdalen. The more I reflect on the novel, the better it gets for me, and the more amazed I am at all that Wilkie attempted and accomplished.I recommend reading the Oxford World's Classics edition for its excellent introduction by Virginia Blain. It hits spot-on about everything that is good and bad about the novel as well as going into the themes of acting and of plotting (both human plotting and writer plotting)."},{"Title":"No Name (Penguin Classics)","review":"Wilkie Collins holds a unique spot among the Victorian novelists. His intricate plots don't dawdle -- they move, with cliffhangers throughout. And, he has a remarkably clear writing style that makes his works almost as accessible as those of a modern thriller writer. &quot;No Name&quot; has both plots galore and clarity, along with deeper character sketches than &quot;The Woman in White&quot; and &quot;The Moonstone&quot;. I rate it slightly below its more famous siblings because of a) the ending -- which was rather too contrived, even for Collins -- and b) a bit too much melodrama as Magdalen approaches her nuptials. To potential first time Collins readers, I recommend starting with &quot;The Moonstone&quot; and then moving to &quot;The Woman in White&quot;. If you enjoy these, you should definitely proceed to &quot;No Name&quot;."},{"Title":"No Name (Penguin Classics)","review":"This is the best-plotted book I have ever read. The intricacies of the ingenious cat-and-mouse game kept me unable to put the book down (despite its length, and my general impatience as a slow reader). Unlike other books I've read by Collins, this one is also extremely funny, largely because of one character who is an incredible rascal and scoundrel. This is really one of the most enjoyable novels I've ever found."},{"Title":"No Name (Penguin Classics)","review":"This story is set in the 1840's and I beleive it was written about that time too. It is an interesting story about 2 wealthy sisters and their life struggles. A lot of twists and turns and some fabulous old descriptive words used - you will use the dictionary feature on almost every page!The story is long winded at times, sometimes over descriptive, but I could not put this one down, the characters were wonderful and they were described in great detail. It is a long story that will take you a while to get through, it has many twists and turns and sometimes you will not know where it is heading. I enjoyed every minute of it and I 'bonded' so much with the characters that I can see them in my head now. Captain Wragge and his 'party coloured eyes' makes your imagination work to its fullest.The language used and the character development make this a story that will stay with you for a long while to come.Highly recommend if you enjoy Jane Eyre type stories AND IT WAS FREE!"},{"Title":"No Name (Penguin Classics)","review":"Wilkie Collins, best know for \\"The Moonstone\\" (which I have read and loved) and \\"The Woman in White\\" (which I have not read yet) is at his best in \\"No Name\\". I do not compare it to the \\"Moonstone\\" for the \\"Moonstone\\" is a great mystery for which the reader must wait to the end for it to be revealed. \\"No Name\\" is not a mystery but one great chessmatch, that oddly enough is not played by Magdalen and Noel Vanstone. It is played by the wonderful character of Captain Wragge and Mrs. Lecount. Reading and seeing the game as it is played out is one great ride.Although many, at the time the book was published, were shocked at the ending. I found it to be very good. It was shocking to those at the time that Wilkie would allow a woman who had done the things Magdalen had done to find happiness. As a reader, I was very much glad that she did find it (one litte bit of the ending revealed) for she deserved it (in my opinion).In the beginning of the book, I came to very much like Magdalen and wished her success in her quest to regain her rightful inheritance - although I knew what she was doing was wrong. I also found that I very much liked Captain Wragge, for all of his \\"moral agriculturalism\\", he had a soft spot for Magdalen which came through in the story. For her part, Magdalen, trying her best to be unemotional and strong, kept her soft side when it came to Mrs. Wragge (even though she was her downfall).All in all, this was a very good book that kept my interest through the 700 pages. For those of you that liked the \\"Moonstone\\" and the \\"Woman in White\\", \\"No Name\\" will no disappoint and I recommend it to anyone that enjoys Wilkie's style of writing.P.S. I did not write too much about the story line for I did not want to give too much of it away."},{"Title":"No Name (Penguin Classics)","review":"Magdalen is the rather spoiled young daughter of a country squire who seems to have a most normal life -- until her parents die, she finds that she and her sister are illegitimate, and she is completely deprived of her inheritance. While her sister sits patiently at home and endures trials of poverty as a governess, Magdalen sets out alone to regain her money from the hands of first a greedy uncle and then his equally greedy son. Populated with a cast of characters fit to equal any of Collins' more celebrated novels, No Name is at once a spellbinding tale of an resourceful and determined young woman's adventures, a deep perusal of her motives and morals, and an accurate portrayal of the Victorian society against which she rebells. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"No Name (Penguin Classics)","review":"Engrossing, densely textured read.Could claim greatness on the basis of the Wragges and Madame alone, but also contains one of the most original heroines in Victorian fiction,and draws a fascinating portrait of venality, social corruption and hypocrisy -- at times, it reminded me of both 'Pere Goriot' and 'Les Miserables'.And it's full of those little concrete details that make nineteenth century fiction so deliciously materialistic. Don't miss out on the Oriental Cashmere Robe!"},{"Title":"No Name (Penguin Classics)","review":"This book is much less known than its famous brothers, &quot;The Woman in White&quot; and &quot;The Moonstone&quot; (I have read them both). It was written between them, and I think it is a very worthy companion to the pair. Mr. Collins was the son of a well-known painter and you perceive his gifted eye for describing characters and environments. He also had a great talent for devising plots and producing very vivid, human and interesting characters. So, your reading enjoyment can be very rich and multidimensional. You can almost feel in the background the presence of the writer's very powerful mind behind the story, carefully describing very realistic scenes, with dashes of humor, irony and eccentricities, while keeping you keenly interested for almost 750 pages. Some of the characters and scenes in the book are gems, as the one of the rich and extreme miser, Mr. Noel Vanstone, in the agony of agreeing on the amount to inherit to his lifelong housekeeper, Mrs. Lacomte (who has been almost his mother). And this, while she is dictating to him the terms of his will ! Mrs. Wragge, his swindler husband, Magdalen and the Admiral are greatly portrayed. This is one of the few books that after finished, most probably will keep growing with you, and will keep its attraction in your memory for a long time. Mr. Collins's main works are so high-quality, that you'd be a much more selective reader afterwards. I would recommend also his &quot;Armadale&quot; (this I haven't read yet, but soon will)."},{"Title":"No Name (Penguin Classics)","review":"It is to Wilkie Collins' credit that more than a century after he wrote his novels, they still engage the reader and make sense in social terms. In &quot;No Name,&quot; two sisters by the last name of Vanstone find out that they are illegitimate. Their formerly comfortable lives are disrupted to the core as their lose their places in society, their friends, their inheritances, and even, literally, their names. Collins makes their predicament alive and vital despite the fact that today this sort of news would barely stir a social ripple."},{"Title":"No Name (Penguin Classics)","review":"Someone could make a pretty good movie of this. Tragic bereavement, determined revenge (that fails), shady characters, disguises and at the end romance and happiness. Of course, Collins was writing in the mid-1800s, and it was a serial publication, so be prepared to wade through a style that maximizes word count (at a penny each!). Nevertheless the plotting is wonderful and the struggle to outwit the villain - or even to be sure who the villain is, which takes a while - is worth the trip. If the ending is a little pat, it's well foreshadowed, if you can catch it. It's a good read."},{"Title":"No Name (Penguin Classics)","review":"I had read Moon Stone and Woman in White years ago, and wanted to read No Name.

This was fun to read with a satisfying conclusion!"},{"Title":"No Name (Penguin Classics)","review":"Wilkie Collins writes a good, fast paced story. Even for today's readers, the plot is tense. Set in 19th century England, it will appeal to fans of Dickens and Austin, with drama, intrigue, unexpected twists and heartbreak. The English is clean and sharp.Not wanting to give away any of the plot, I will say only this. I found the characters complex and vivid, and the intensity of their drive or equally extreme lack of purpose, captivating, and maybe a little shocking. I was also struck by the author&#8217;s underlying premise about what was true and what was important. You can feel him stretching the principles of the society of his day, challenging them, and in the end, settling them a little differently.I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"No Name (Penguin Classics)","review":"I love this book; best Wilkie Collins I've read so far.

Even the beginning, however, suggests the point guard's choices as he drives down the court:\\"Magic contemplates his next move. Should he go in? Or Out? Or should he stay right where he is.\\"Before I suggest that Magic loft up one to a soaring Michael Cooper for a \\"Coop-A-Loop,\\" let's turn to the dilemma facing Magic the cat. Each of the above choices entails different benefits, and all of them are tantalizing to a cat generally hungry for adventure, sleep, and food. For example, if he leaves his home, \\"maybe he could chase the loons. He'd hunt them along the rock shore, stalk them through the reeds, leap after them, then eat them.\\" (It looks like the loon just got away in time in the pictures showing Magic's fantasy.) Magic continues to ponder the possibilities; We see him envision swimming under the water to catch the brightly colored salmon, riding a moose to the bears' island, and sharing a meal of salmon and blueberry pie. This sounds good! But then again, \\"maybe not. Maybe if he stays right where he is, Magic's next move will come to him.\\" And that's exactly what happens, as the big round cat gently falls asleep on the front porch.In addition to writing an imaginative story about imagination, Elisha Cooper's watercolor and pencil drawings are outstanding. His drawings recall those of Barry Moser with their soft colors, excellent depiction of light, and use of \\"white space.\\" Cooper paints fairly realistically, but he also lets you see his watercolor technique as well. Much of the action is seen from the cat's eye level, but Cooper knows when to pull back to show you gorgeously illustrated panoramas of water, hills, and the cloud-adorned sky. Like most good daydreams, the book is both engaging and calming at the same time. This is a peaceful and beautiful book for story time and bedtime. Once again, a quality book from Greenwillow publishing.

My 2 year old \\"likes\\" it for the pictures, but I don't think she fully appreciates its beauty yet. We will have to keep it around for when she's older.

He likes to remind us that 'Magic weighs eighteen pounds!' Magic's classic kitty personality makes us laugh.

Sonny's father, Jake, is plagued by episodic anger and is a wife batterer. The reasons for Jake's behavior and ultimately, sadness, are revealed near the end of the book. Sonny's mother and Uncle Louis provide the nurturing that Sonny needs as he navigates adolescence including the difficulties of being bullied and excluded at school. Uncle Louis becomes Sonny's true life teacher as he is exposed to both the mysteries and extraordinary beauty in nature. Bruchac's descriptions in these scenes are to be treasured.The only failing in Bruchac's book is the odd addition of eugenic experimentation as the source for the explanation of the family \`secret'. This plot twist is unnecessary and disrupts the wonderful flow of the story as Sonny discovers his true ethnic heritage. The reader would be helped if Bruchac could explore the history of eugenics in Vermont within a different story that provides a more complete explanation of what happened and who was affected. Tagging this on to \`Hidden Roots' without a more thorough treatment is unsatisfying to curious readers.Overall however, \\"Hidden Roots\\" is a beautifully written story."},{"Title":"Hidden Roots","review":"This is a fantastic book.

So I checked out this book at a library recently with the intention of compiling a new list of drawing books that I would recommend to the people attending the workshops this summer.This book will not be on that list.Quite frankly, despite the fact that there are several very talented artists who contributed to this book, it's lousy. Most of the artwork featured is either mediocre or *not* done in the manga style Hart claims the book revolves around; in fact, seeing how Mr. Hart's art numbers among the worst in the book, I'm skeptical as to whether or not he is a credible source regarding non-Western artistry at all. (His Western-style cartooning is really quite good, so I'm rather surprised at his ineptitude in this field, myself.)As I said, there are some very good pieces in this book as well--they really stand out when you see them--but they simply make for good references, as most of the \\"step-by-step\\" diagrams are about four steps long, adding up to a pretty useless instruction method overall. The proposed \\"villains\\" in the book, in fact, are rather one-dimensional from a character perspective, but I can understand how it would be far easier to resort to stereotypical black-and-white personalities than to flesh out a really interesting villain (because, well, that wasn't what this book was supposed to be about, so I can't really hold it against him.)Most, if not all, pictures were colored digitally--something that most people won't have access to--and a number of them were printed with rough and jagged edges as if they had been drawn with the pencil tool in a Photoshop (or even paint. Strangely enough, these rougher works are actually some of the better ones in the book, if I recall correctly.)Please, if you're interested in drawing in the anime or manga style, find another book. If you're interested in Western comics, check out Hart's other work (or the Marvel/DC instructional books, which are quite good.) But if it's manga style you're looking to learn about...then this is NOT the book for you."},{"Title":"Manga Mania Villains: How to Draw the Dastardly Characters of Japanese Comics","review":"I had mixed reviews about this book, but I had to admit the reason why I bought this book was because of the title. Afterall, no one has drawn a book totally dedicated to villians.First of all, the book starts off by introducing you to drawing villian&#8217;s eyes, which is rather helpful since eyes are one of the important aspects when drawing villains. There&#8217;re also the &#8220;Good&#8221; vs &#8220;Bad&#8221; expressions and some explanations to go along. Then, there&#8217;re various types of baddies, from fighter chicks to medieval villains, and not to forget villains such as monsters, demons and aliens.Unfortunately, there are mostly one or two examples for most villains, which can be rather limiting if you&#8217;re trying to draw the same type of villain in a different way. However, I think this is where your imagination will come in. Some of the arts also strike me as rather kiddy (or perhaps, it's meant to be more for children), although some of the full-page color artworks are very nice.In addition, I&#8217;ve also noticed that most of the examples have a certain &#8220;American&#8221; (instead of Japanese&#8221;) style to it. For the serious mangaka-wannabe though, you are better off getting more &#8220;technical&#8221; and &#8220;Japanese-Style&#8221; books such as the &#8220;How to Draw Manga&#8221; Series, but overall, this book will make a nice reference or resource book for people interested drawing American cartoon."},{"Title":"Manga Mania Villains: How to Draw the Dastardly Characters of Japanese Comics","review":"I have read this book and I returned it to the store minutes after buying it.

It also showed that some of the harder aspects of drawing are not so hard if you break them apart. Three stars."},{"Title":"Manga Mania Villains: How to Draw the Dastardly Characters of Japanese Comics","review":"First of all, this book centers around a style of art, not teaching art itself. All its shortcomings revolve around the fact that it doesn't adequately teach this style of art.Christopher Hart's entire artistic background is in American cartooning and comics. Now, that's not to saw that an artist of Western background can't perfectly render Japanese-style art (some can and have books on it, Katy Coope for example has a pretty good kids' book), but the sad fact is that Christopher Hart simply can't, and he teaches people, essentially, &quot;how not to&quot; draw in anime style.So, if you like anime, and you want to learn to draw anime-style art, then you will be disappointed if you use a book like this as reference, and people make comments like &quot;Western/Americanized&quot; when they see your art.For a great example of failed attempts at anime, watch the show &quot;Totally Spies&quot; currently airing on Cartoon Network. It was produced by a French studio and has all the common flaws of &quot;Western&quot; anime. Also, like in this book, the villains look goofy or cute. Sadly, neither Hart nor the creators of &quot;Totally Spies&quot; know how to design anime villains.If you like mediocre &quot;anime&quot; like &quot;Totally Spies,&quot; then this is right up your alley."},{"Title":"Manga Mania Villains: How to Draw the Dastardly Characters of Japanese Comics","review":"I flipped through this book at a bookstore and was not very satisfied with the contents.First of all, MUCH of this book was in color. Not only is that not necessary, but it causes the guide to be unneccesarilly expensive for its size. The fact that many of the chunky images have been colored (and clearly not done so by hand, either!) seems to imply that it is meant more for children. (Obviously, young readers would lose interest if the book had been printed completely in black and white.) As most people should have noticed, many of the other manga-drawing series have been primarily in black and white, with a few exceptions.Furthermore, many of the examples (such as the rich man, his girlfriend and the bodyguard) were extremely one-sided and conventional. And there were many parts where I had the impression that a female \\"manga\\" villain had to be bursting with sex appeal or something of the sort.I strongly believe that most if not all manga villains are not completely evil. An excellent example would be 'Magic Knight Rayearth' by CLAMP. Every single person fights for their own wishes and ideas, and those with opposing ideas become your enemies. Absolutely none of the characters were truly evil-even Zagato, the main antagonist, had reasons for what he did that almost anyone would easily understand.A vilain is not someone (or something) who simply exists to make your life miserable or kidnap a princess. In fact, there probably shouldn't even be a book devoted entirely to how to draw villains. I would recommend that someone who has trouble creating manga villains should read a few varied volumes of manga, and come up with their own ideas on what an antagonist should be like.And finally, to conclude this review, I must add the comment that the \\"manga\\" is not quite manga at all. Everything is basically just Western cartoons with anime/manga faces."},{"Title":"Manga Mania Villains: How to Draw the Dastardly Characters of Japanese Comics","review":"Once again Christopher Hart presents the subject matter in such a way that an amateur artist like myself can sink his teeth into.

I am an American Teenager, and have been reading /watching un-translated, 100% Japanese stuff for quite a while now- and frankly, most of the stuff thats really popular in Japan is considered 'icky' and 'wierd' over here (in the US) . What i'm trying to say is, Although Many Americans love Traditional, more Japanese-ish stuff, most of our population is far too simple minded to 'get' any of it. So, all Psuedo (NON-JAPANESE)Manga-Ka's take the liberty of adding a bit of a western tinge to the material they produce, so that it apeals more to the American Audience.So, if your looking for 'real' manga, I would recomend either buying some or looking for instruction books by Natively Japanese artists. However, I have been an Avid fan of Christopher Hart's work (western and Manga alike) since i was a small child.

It takes a long time to work through all the material, there are other books on the market that are updated."},{"Title":"The Conqueror","review":"Georgette Heyer may be best known for her Regency romances (which I have yet to read), but The Conqueror proves that she is a master of the art of non-romantic historical fiction, as well. She covers 19 years of William the Conqueror's life; from the age of 19 when he truly begins to take control of the Duchy of Normandy he inherited as a child, to his victory at the Battle of Hastings and subsequent crowning as King of England at age 38.Heyer's style embodies what I consider the very best historical fiction; it is obviously well-researched, well-written, and told in a fine, slightly old-fashioned style. Although the heart of the story is naturally William, Heyer cleverly works in other characters through which she is able to tell many more angles of the history. For instance their is Raoul (arguably the main character of the book), a young Norman contemporary of William's. At age 19 he swears loyalty to his Duke, whom he hopes will restore order and civility to lawless Normandy. Although he does ultimately follow William all the way, it is not without inner struggle. He respects, honors and loves William but does not always agree with him. I'm not sure if Raoul de Harcourt was an actual historical person or a creation of Heyer's imagination, but through him she is able to show the more compassionate and human side of the Normans than can be illustrated solely through the ambitious, driven, often ruthless Duke William.Other characters that Heyer skillfully uses are Edgar and Galet. Edgar (again I'm not sure if he was an actual person or a figment of Heyer's imagionation) was a Saxon hostage of William's. After years living in Normandy he develops an admiration for the Norman and especially for Raoul, with whom he has a strong bond of friendship. When he is reunited with his Saxon earl Harold, these feelings are challenged; through the character of Edgar Heyer illustrates the complicated relationships that no doubt existed between many Saxons and Normans. Through Edgar she is also able to present the differences between the Norman and Saxon cultures, and this she does skillfully. She manages to present both cultures, and to compare and contrast them in a way that shows their differences without making either seem better or superior than the other.Lastly, the character of Galet was an especially clever invention of Heyer. He is William's court jester (or \\"fool\\" as they were more typically called then), and he seems to be everywhere observing everything. Heyer has him appear at many crucial moments and, though his words are usually discounted and he is berated, he always ends up being correct.Heyer's style is timeless and eminently readable. Just as she does in her Regency romances, she uses the language of the period to help create a sense of time and place. Her descriptions of the people and places are vivid and, at times, even lyrical. Georgette Heyer's style is a bit old-fashioned, which may not appeal to everyone; if, for example, you're looking for violence in battles scenes or graphic and passionate sex scenes then you won't find them here (although, some of her battles scenes are vivid and somewhat gruesome). While this may turn some modern readers off, this is exactly what I love about Heyer's writing; she is able to transport the reader to another time and place and still keep it clean and free of sex, profanity and violence.After this book, I am definitely sold on Georgette Heyer! I have already bought up the rest of her historical novels and several of her Regencies, as well. I am pleased that she was so prolific, as I can look forward to many, many hours of enjoyable reading."},{"Title":"The Conqueror","review":"Heyer is of course best known for her Regency romances such as Frederica, Cotillion, The Grand Sophy and more. However, as well as writing several detective stories set in the early 20th century she also wrote some historicals away from the Regency and Georgian periods that she made her own. 'The Conqueror' is one of these, the story of William the Conqueror who became the King of England after the Battle of Hastings in 1066.It's interesting reading the story with a positive view of the Norman Conquest when most latent English opinion is possibly rather more on the side of King Harold who was defeated at Hastings. It's part of Heyer's writing skill that enables her to paint a picture of an honourable and fearless man who was able to raise himself up from being an illegitimate nobody to a man worthy of the hand of Matilda, a high-born noblewoman. Heyer adds a fictional character, Raoul de Harcourt, to narrate to us much of the action, which does leave the reader somewhat distanced from William at times. However her mastery of battle scenes, the fact that she usually stays close to historical events in this story, add a great deal to the reader's enjoyment.Heyer's research into the periods in which she sets her books is well-known and in 'The Conqueror', alongside her other books, it shows. The eleventh century was of course a long time ago and certain aspects of the book, for example its language, mean it's not always an easy read. The pacing is good, however, and although the romance is a relatively minor part of the overall story, it is still well-handled, showing how two fiery and strong people can produce a genuine and deep affection.'The Conqueror', along with the other historicals such as 'My Lord John', 'Royal Escape', 'Simon The Coldheart' and others, are harder work for the reader than the lighter more popular romances. However their insight into life in some of the dangerous and fierce times in history are well worth experiencing.Originally published for Curled Up With A Good Book Helen Hancox 2008"},{"Title":"The Conqueror","review":"William the Conqueror is an extremely interesting character, and Heyer succeeds in bringing him to life: along with all of his complexities. Her book is a fascinating account of the life of William and I especially found it interesting to learn about his military stratergies. He seemed to be very ahead of his time in military tactics. Heyer's account of the Battle of Hastings, 1066, is very good.However, I gave this book 3 stars as opposed for 4 because I am reviewing it as a novel, and not as a textbook. The narrative structure is a little bit non-sensical and the plot has sometimes not been developed properly as Heyer no doubt was concerned instead with the accuracy and broad spectrum of historical fact.Nevertheless, this is a good book to pick up if you care to be whisked off to the time of Saxons vs. Normams."},{"Title":"The Conqueror","review":"This novel is set in the time of William the Conqueror. In the beginning he struggles just to stay alive, betrayal and death lurk in every corner and he never knows who to trust. However, he manages to stay alive and because of this his determination to rule over a peaceful duchy and later England drives him. Some of his decisions shock even his most faithful servant and friend, Raoul de Harcourt. Raoul known as \\"The Watcher\\" because he sleeps outside William's door at night to protect him, really does save his life more than once.More than once I found myself admiring William for he was a complex ruler and not always ruthless. However, in the end, I still felt for Harold who briefly became King Harold I of England because no matter what novel I have read about the \\"Oath\\" made to William by Harold, it always seemed forced.Once you get past the flowery chivalry-type language you find a worthwhile page turning novel! This book was much better than The Golden Warrior by Hope Muntz (which was forgetable!) and was more insightful of William's personality during his eventful life and leadership. It is out-of-print but well worth the time to locate and read!This review refers to the Harcover edition."},{"Title":"The Conqueror","review":"\\"The Conqueror\\" reflects the true genius of this talented historical author. I have read nearly all of Georgette Heyer's books, and was particularly drawn to her Regency era novels, but I believe this historical depiction of William the Conqueror is her greatest masterpiece!Let me re-phrase ... I was never interested in Medieval historicals, and never particularly drawn to that era in history either. Heyer's novels, however, drew me steadily back in time, century by century, until she involved me and gripped me through all periods of British history. Here was I, a lover of historical fiction, who detested warfare and violence, but who became ever so unexpectedly engaged in love of battle. She brought William, Duke of Normandy, to vivid life. She molded him skilfully into this engaging, though fearsome, character with whom any person across the centuries could identify. She then created the perfect foil in Raoul de Harcourt, the endearing, sensitive contrast to his master, the fighting Duke. Her skilful use of period language is unparallelled. This biographical novel is, all told, a magnificent tapestry woven with immense skill. I could not put the book down and I could not have enough of it!\\"Simon the Coldheart\\" was the first of Heyer's Medieval novels to clinch my interest. Anyone who fell in love with \\"The Conqueror\\" would also swoon over \\"Simon the Coldheart\\". I do not hesitate to recommend it.This author deserves the highest accolades that no words of mine can hope to express. I wish she were still alive so I could have conveyed my tribute to her in person. But since I cannot, I hope instead to entice others to appreciate the true genius of this writer. She has the power to teach love of history as no other author I've read. It is a great pity that Georgette Heyer does not receive the same kind of adulation as a period author as, for instance, Jane Austen does. In my view, she is not only in her league, but actually better. Jane Austen wrote from personal knowledge of a life she knew intimately. Georgette Heyer writes with better wit and skill from posterity. And in her writing goes a depth of research that not even Austen would have matched."},{"Title":"The Conqueror","review":"Once I got past the first several pages the book came alive to me and was wonderful from there to the end.

This book was published in 1931 so maybe this was why it was unsmooth reading and storytelling.

I am hoping to find more enjoyable historical fiction about William the Bastard by some more modern authors."},{"Title":"The Conqueror","review":"I bought this based on the great reviews, which is how I buy a lot of books I read. This wasn't one of my better choices. I know the story of William, his wife Matilda, their sons, Battle of Hastings, etc. I just found this book boring. I skipped through much of it. It never got or held my attention."},{"Title":"The Conqueror","review":"This was a well written book .I really enjoyed it.Anyone that loves French and English history this is a must read."},{"Title":"The Conqueror","review":"\\"All through his life men were to fear him and find it hard to meet the direct stare he bent upon them. Thus early the French were made aware of the ruthless strength of his will. The truth was he never swerved from his purpose, and would go to any lengths to achieve it.\\"History tells us that William of Normandy was born a bastard, held off multiple assassination attempts, became Duke of Normandy, repelled the French and invaded England to become it's King.This is the same story that Georgette Heyer tells here only it is told very thrillingly indeed.She begins her story with the birth of William and a prophetic dream of his mother who foresees him as a great tree spreading it's branches over both England and Normandy. As others whisper that he is bastard, she calls him king. The story ends with his coronation in London, Christmas 1066 after the bloody, hard fought battle of Hastings.In between these two milestones is a wonderful story of a charismatic, often enigmatic, man of towering self confidence and will. It is told mainly through the eyes of one his closest knights, Raoul de Harcourt. Because of his birth William had to pretty much subdue Normandy to accept his rule. Raoul is an idealistic youth who is sure that William will bring peace and prosperity to Normandy. Because of this he runs away to court to swear service to William. While there he manages to help thwart an assassination plot and is at William's side from that point on.Although I was very familiar with Heyer's writing through her Regency romances and her modern mysteries, this book was a complete revelation. I had always loved her stuff and had always held her as an example of a very elegant and witty writer. But reading this, my respect for her abilities has ratched way up.First the storytelling was excellent. What could have been a dry or even overly romantic catalog of events of a real person's life, instead was an exciting story that sucked me in and never once let me go. This was more a character study than anything. Sure the events were there, but each assassination attempt, each usurpation attempt, each war was a set piece to draw a picture of a superb war strategist, a merciful and very wise ruler, a shrewd judge of character and a person who inspired men to follow him.Second was the language. It was simply luxurious. Heyer used french derivations, archaic words and even the archaic meanings of common words to really create a sense of time and place. Her descriptions of places, people, clothing and food were rich and involved. One passage for a banquet reads:\\"Gisela began to eat of a Lombardy leach, flourished and served with a sober-sauce, but she did not eat much of it because her quick eye had observed all manner of delicate dishes on the board, and she meant to taste as many as she was able. She glanced around her and wondered aloud whether the Lady Adeline would instruct her in the way to make appulmoy, and whether it were well to put a dash of cubebs in a blank desire. One of the scullions had just brought in a dish of curlews. Gisela finished up what was left on her platter in a hurry. The curlews were served with chaldron, and Gisela was occupied for some time in trying to make up her mind whether this was flavoured with canelle or powder-douce.\\"Third were the scenes of battles. I admit I am not a keen reader of battle descriptions and probably would have tended to skim or skip them. But each battled was prefaced by a strategy session. Invariably William would think of some new, unorthodox strategy that flew in the face of conventional thinking and his advisors and vassals would strongly argue against it.\\"Warfare, as the barons understood it was a matter of chivalry charging to sound of tucket and drum; strategy was of the roughest order: one chose one's ground, one laid ambushes, or made surprise attacks, but while the battle raged there could be nothing to it than hand-to-hand fighting in a tight pack. But the Duke bent over his miniature battlefields, and moved his pawns this way and that, slowly evolving a more intricate way of war than his captains could understand.\\"William is credited with introducing archers as part of war rather than just for sport. And during his first battle with Henry of France, where he allows the French to advance deep into Norman territory, on unfamiliar ground, to a place of swamp land and uncertain footing so that the poachers and farmers could pick off the unwary, speaks of nascent guerrilla warfare. To read these scenes and see his strategy come alive and prove its merit to his naysayers is fun and thrilling stuff.And finally, it isn't all war and mayhem. History has by all accounts noted that the marriage of Williams and his wife Matilda was a strong, fruitful and loving one. Indeed, their courtship in this book is quite a stormy and passionate one. And in her way, Matilda is just as implacable and fierce as her husband.Loved this book and am now looking to read more Heyer historicals"},{"Title":"The Conqueror","review":"Although Heyer is best known as the Queen of Regency romance, relatively few people know that her passion was historical fiction. \\"An Infamous Army\\" was used as a textbook in military academies because of her incredibly detailed information on the Battle of Waterloo. In \\"The Conqueror\\", she turns her attention to William, the Norman Duke who conquered England in 1066. It's a fascinating look at a man who beat the odds - and too many enemies to count - and wound up with a crown. There is some romance, but based on fact. Spurned by a well-born woman who scorned his base blood, he went right into her castle and beat her. After that, he married her and it appears to have been a very successful union, resulting in eight children. William had tremendous vision and this novel brings a terrific sense of a man who is driven on many levels. Wisely, Heyer is restrained in the use of medieval language, so the reader navigates smoothly through the book. A host of secondary characters are well-rounded, and the plight of people caught underfoot in the constant warfare is also depicted. I've read this book at least six times over the years and it holds up perfectly, which is why I give it five stars. Anyone who has read Heyer's other historical fiction will enjoy it, but I think anyone who likes historical fiction and has avoided Heyer because they thought it was romance should give this a try as well."},{"Title":"The Conqueror","review":"Written with an emphasis on the personal, dramatic narrative of Duke William of Normandy. Accurate historically, Heyer adds life and detail to the motivations and challenges that provoke William to lay claim to the title of King of England. Essentially a life history from his illegitimate birth through the Battle of Hastings with a hard fought victory against Harold the saxon. Not just ahistory book, but a tale told through mainly his personal body guard and best friend. Mature, not overly romantic, and just the right emphasis on politics, personal struggles and battlefields."},{"Title":"The Conqueror","review":"Despite it's subtitle (\\"A Novel of William the Conqueror The Bastard Son Who Overpowered a Kingdom and the Woman who Melted His Heart\\"), there is very little in this novel that relates to the relationship between William and his wife Matilda. Though there is a chapter devoted to his determined \\"conquering\\" of her (including his beating of her when at first she refused to marry him), it's not a love story nor a romance. The story begins in 1028 with William's birth and continues to his coronation Christmas Day 1066, though most of the book is taken up with the battles for and around Normandy.William is portrayed as a hard man molded by his dubious beginnings, his relentless determination to have his will carried out and his ambition for the crown of England (ostensibly to secure Normandy's future). He was a brilliant strategist in war, which he was about most of his days, and he could be exceedingly cruel when it served his purposes. He valued courage and loyalty. In this story he says that Harold Godwinson is the only man he (William) respects. But that didn't stop William from using Harold, forcing him to give an oath of fealty (or face a gilded imprisonment in Normandy), the breaking of which he used against Harold to secure the Pope's backing for the planned invasion of England. The author does a good job of showing how William always served his own needs and any good he did for others was motivated by what it could gain him. Perhaps that is what it took to gain a country like England but the author suggests there was something lost in the man for the effort as echoed in the reservations uttered by the men who served him. For that, Heyer deserves full marks at bringing the real man to life.The history presented here is interesting and entertaining, though I felt like I needed a dictionary, a map of France in the 1050s and 60s and a notepad for all the names and places thrown at me, particularly when so many men around William had the same first name. Such things also slowed down the reading of the tale in places and made it difficult at times to understand just what was going on or who the men were behind all those names.In large part (perhaps the best part), this is the story of a friendship between one of William's closest knights, Raoul de Harcourt, and a Saxon, Edgar, who held lands under Harold Godwinson and who was the hostage of the Duke of Normandy. And, if there is a romance here, it's the love story between Raoul and Edgar's sister, Elfrida."},{"Title":"The Conqueror","review":"Most readers know of Georgette Heyer as the person who quite literally created the genre of the \\"Regency Romance\\", that is, books set in the period of time when King George III was insane and for many years his eldest son, \\"the regent\\" ruled England....it is the same time period, in general, as that of Jane Austen and the dry humor in Heyer's books often reminds me of Austen's.However, Heyer also wrote several historical novels set in the Middle Ages, as well as her very good book on the Battle of Waterloo. It is part of her series about two of her Regency families, and while it has many fictional characters, and fictional dialog, Heyer describes the times, the place and the battle very realistically.An Infamous Army: A Novel of Wellington, Waterloo, Love and War. She made a point of having the Duke of Wellington \\"say\\" nothing in her book that he did not actually say in reality.She also wrote a good book, in my opinion, on the escape of 21 yr old King Charles II from England and Cromwell's dictatorship during the English Civil War in :Royal Escape: In which a dare-devil King with a price on his head fools his enemies and terrifies his friends.In her telling of the life of William the Conquerer (The Conqueror: A Novel of William the Conqueror, the Bastard Son Who Overpowered a Kingdom and the Woman Who Melted His Heart) Heyer begins with his birth to the unwed mistress of the then Duke of Normandy; and takes it on through the conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Of course, almost all the dialogue is fictionalized as are many of the characters, but others are based on actual people, and there are quotes from both William, his wife Matilda of Flanders, and others. (I should add that despite the title, there is not too much \\"historical romance\\" regarding William and Matilda, his wife. She remains a prescence but this is NOT a historical romance, which I appreciate.)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SPOILER ALERT:As a bastard child, to use the terminology of that time; William had a truly horrible childhood. His father died young, on Crusade, and while he intended to leave the Duchy of Normandy to his only child, William, the adult relatives of the late Duke, as well as other Nobles, did all in their power to circumvent this. In the point of view of their time, a bastard child could be acknowledged, given education, lands, money, but NOT inherit a title.William was eight or so years old when his father died and he lost that protection. The rest of his childhood was spent in hiding, in being moved from place to place and in vicious attacks on the people trying to protect him, ending with the deaths of most of them; and yet finally at age 19 or so, William was able to ascend to the throne of Normandy, though rebellions against him went on for many years.... By all accounts, and Heyer makes this clear, he was ruthless as he had to be in his era; and yet fair when ruling as Duke of Normandy.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- END SPOILER ALERT:Having read the non-fiction book1066: The Year of the Conquestby David Howarth ( a clear, short readable book not written for professional historians only: a plus!) I would say that Heyer certainly got the last half of the book \\"right\\", that is, that is, the period leading up to William's decision to conquer England, and why, as well as the battle itself with its' world changing effects...England ceased being a small unimportant island, and became a Norman outpost of culture and part of the bigger world of Catholic Western Europe, from that time on.Heyer is very sympathetic to the Saxons, whom we know will be conquered: especially Earl Harold, who is the man that the Saxons of England wanted as King, and who fought William at Hastings.Another reviewer mentioned the Bayeaux Tapestry which \\"tells\\" the story of the conquest of England in art, and was probably created not long after the events.....specialists, art historians and historians are still not completely sure WHO created this masterpiece. Heyer goes with the older belief it was William's wife Matilda and her ladies; but that is not known, and can't be proven or disproven.The Bayeux Tapestryedited by David Wilson: I was lucky enough to find this (originally $200. book for about $20., on Amazon of course) book on the Bayeaux tapestry, which is new, up to date, and shows in beautiful oversize print each panel of the tapestry, as well as in the back of the book, a brief description of what each panel shows. The foreward also goes into the history of tapestry, as it is known, and verifies we cannot know who created it. If you are interested in the Conquest of England, the Battle of Hastings, etc, I'd suggest also getting this beautiful coffee table sized book.It is interesting, to me, to learn that the Bayeaux Tapestry remains our BEST historical source for the Battle of Hastings and conquest of England in 1066.Overall I'd recommend Heyer's view of Duke William the Bastard....later known as William the Conqueror....She describes life in Normandy with great detail, the feudal lifestyle, the life of the commoners as well as the nobility, and the description of the Battle of Hastings is vivid and intense and hard to forget.

It is out-of-print but well worth the time to locate and read!This review refers to the Hardcover edition."},{"Title":"The Conqueror","review":"The Conqueror is a novel depicting the life of William \\"The Conqueror,\\" Duke of Normandy, from birth until his coronation as King of England in 1066. While I normally love historical fiction (unable to put a book down), this novel had a hard time keeping me interested. There were sections that did have me wanting to shut out the world and keep reading, but there were just as many boring storylines that had me looking at my bookshelf longingly.Well-researched and portrayed for the time period, I have no complaints in that department. Heyer used great descriptive detail to portray the culture and history. The war-torn battlefields especially were very in-depth.However, Heyer's writing style thoroughly annoyed me. As an editor, I wanted to go through the book and correct the punctuation with a big, red pen. Written in 1931, perhaps this is just a style of the times, or the style of some genre I've never read before, but I found the break in my reading flow quite distracting.Another letdown for me was that the book was told from the viewpoint of Raoul, William's right-hand man. Not quite biography, not quite historical fiction, I was disappointed that the novel didn't let me inside William's head. Personally, if I can't be inside the historical character's head, then I'd rather read a biography of the person than fiction.Lastly, William's relationship with Matilda was so talked up on the book cover and everywhere else, but in truth, it was just a small piece of the novel and seemed to be missing too much of the real storyline to make sense. In contrast, the relationship between Raoul and his friend, Edgar, had much more romance and love portrayed. I kept wondering when the two of them would become more than friends, but then Raoul fell in love with Edgar's sister, Elfrida, putting that pondering to rest.In closing, it wasn't an altogether bad book. It just wasn't for me, and I'm doubtful I'll read anymore of Heyer's books"},{"Title":"The Conqueror","review":"This is really a very average, run of the mill historical novel-- nothing remarkable, no great characters, no powerful vision orgreat turns of phrase.

What a great example of dedication to duty for young people."},{"Title":"The Conqueror","review":"Georgette Heyer, best known for her formulaic Regency and Georgian romances, strayed from her usual path long enough to turn out this excellent, entertaining novel. The narrative follows the life and achievements of William, duke of Normandy--better known as William the Conqueror--through the eyes of one of his young knights, the fictional Raoul de Harcourt. Major events of William's life, from his illegitimate birth to his coronation as king of England in 1066, are described with fine period detail. Heyer's rousing treatment of the Battle of Hastings is particularly good, and for the most part, she sticks to the facts. Of course there are a few inaccuracies--credit for the creation of the Bayeux Tapestry, for example, is given to William's wife Matilda of Flanders, although it is known to have been made by the English not long after the Conquest. And did William really beat Matilda in her father's house?! That legendary event probably never took place, but here it makes for a lively episode in the account of William's courtship.All things considered, lovers of medieval history should find this book, with its colorful descriptions of eleventh-century France and its well-drawn characters, a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"The Conqueror","review":"This story is a refreshing change to the usual Heyer formula; if you are tired of buckskin breeches and oriental neckcloths, dive into The Conqueror for an entertaining glimpse of the Norman Conquest seen through the eyes of a fictional knight in William of Normandy's retinue.Written in 1931, the narrative takes William, the title character, from his birth and cradle, through his constant struggles to retain hold on the Duchy of Normandy against rival dukes and the French King himself (her depiction of the defeat of King Henry at the ford of Varaville is particularly well written) to the infamous wrangle over the English crown between himself, Harold Godwineson and Edgar Aetheling and the eventual battle of Hastings.Like her narrative of the events at Waterloo in An Infamous Army, Heyer is masterly in her battle descriptions; she never shies away from the brutality of war which is quite graphically depicted, and can switch easily from broad sweeping action scenes to intimate close-ups of battle from a individual viewpoint.William comes across as ruthless and single-minded, which he must have been, but his motivations are understandable due to the circumstances of his illegitimate birth (a sore point with him, evidently) - even though you may despise his cruelty you cannot help but admire his courage and generalship.The romance between him and Matilda of Flanders shows two equally fierce lovers, and according to historical accounts their devotion and fidelity is accurately written by Heyer, which would have been unusual at a time when heroic love, not courtly love, prevailed. Marriages were arranged to unite kingdoms and cement political alliances. It is an interesting romance of equals which could have been further developed, but unlike most of Heyer's other books, it takes up only a small portion of the story.The fictitious Raoul de Harcourt, who takes allegiance with William when both are nineteen, is the Conqueror's most devoted knight and becomes his closest friend. Heyer seems to be ambivalent about her title character, as if unsure how the Duke's occasionally unpalatable character will be received: Raoul's observations and feelings are distinctly modern, and he becomes the mediator between the Duke and us, the modern audience. Heyer endows Raoul with a lot of modern sensitivities as a result, to the point where Raoul becomes almost an anachronism in the brutal times in which he lived. Unfortunately Raoul as a device does not let us see more deeply into the mind or heart of the Duke: we end up knowing more about Raoul than his lord, who remains a mystery up to his coronation at the end of the book.Raoul may be tied to William by both loyalty and true friendship, but he is not slavish - some of William's cruelties sorely try his devotion, and one wonders what he would have made of the Harrying of the North which followed the Conquest a few years later. This is a compliment to Heyer's skill, though; if characters can inspire speculation over fates NOT in the book, then they are well-written.My other criticism of Raoul is his somewhat formulaic romance with a Saxon lady Elfrida, sister of his friend Edgar, a follower of Harold. It never comes across as convincing, and some of the plot devices to bring them together are too forced to make me care much about their fates.The problem is that Heyer has made a much warmer and engaging tale of love (in the heroic sense) between her hero and his boss; but then felt it necessary to balance this with a female love interest to woo Raoul away from William's side. Unfortunately Elfrida is so shallowly-drawn you end up wondering if she would have been able to keep him for long anyway.Her brother Edgar, who is sent as hostage to Normandy and becomes a member of the Norman court, is a far more likeable character, and he brings the necessary Saxon perspective to the tale without being purely a plot device. His inevitable meeting with Raoul on the battlefield at Hastings is sad and quite poignant.I think Heyer enjoyed writing this book - the pace is excellent and her paintings of the main characters assured. She balances her historical narrative with individual stories and romances, weaving them in and out of each other, so you get a good feel for not only the events surrounding the Norman conquest, but how it affected the lives of both Normans and Saxons and their families.Occasionally the language comes across as stilted: one can only take so many \\"by the Rood of God!\\"s but this is a difficult problem to overcome in any true historical novel and it doesn't threaten the enjoyment of the story. The religious aspect of Norman and Saxon society is handled very well in general, it's there but it doesn't overwhelm.Overall, an excellent read if you are interested in this part of English history, and want a reasonably true depiction of the Conqueror's life and the times in which he lived, and the events leading up to the Norman Conquest. If you are after a pure romance, though, you may be disappointed. The story is far more biography than romance.Note: this story has so much of the flavour of Mary Stewart's Arthurian saga of Merlin that I wonder if Stewart read it and became a fan."},{"Title":"The Conqueror","review":"I just started reading the Kindle version and then stopped until the publisher fixes the Kindle version.

Heyer's lovely potrayal of William the Conqueror is breathtaking, full of magnificence and romance. It is a story of war, a story of friendship and of love and sorrow.

But all in all, a very good read that gives a good sense of 11th century Normandy and England."},{"Title":"The Conqueror","review":"The Conqueror is one of six historical novels written by Georgette Heyer, who is best known for her Regency Romances, and if this is an indication of the other five - then sign me up!Heyer brings us back to 11th Century Normandy and introduces us to William, Duke of Normandy, (a.k.a. William the Bastard) through the eyes of Raoul de Harcourt - a knight in Duke William's retinue.Raoul began his service to the Duke as a young knight and he quickly rose to be one of William's most trusted friends. Loyalty is a running theme throughout the novel - loyalty from a knight to his lord. Raoul may not have agreed with a lot of the tactics used by William, but he trusted and respected his lord enough to comply. Don't get me wrong, Raoul was no pushover - he voiced his opinions when it was warranted, but in the end he knew his role and played the part.Duke William was a very intriguing man - ambitious would be putting it lightly. He valued brain over braun and cunning over might. Once he saw something he wanted, he got it. Doesn't matter how, but he got it. Which leads me into a great scene with William and his future wife, Mathilda....but I'll leave that for you to read! Let's just say it's not a good idea to call William a bastard!One aspect of why I love historical fiction is the educational factor. I know I'm a total dork, but it's true - I've learned so much history through all the historical fiction novels I have read. I take some of it with a grain of salt cause it's historical fiction after all, but for the most part I know a lot more than I did a few years ago. While reading The Conqueror I learned a great deal more about the difference between an Englishman (or Saxon) and a Norman and the Battle of Hastings scene was not put-down-able!I enthusiastically recommend this novel! Heyer's writing is impeccable and her research is without a doubt one of the best. Character development is awesome and dialogue excellent.

Her ethos is that you have no work friends and that everything is an opportunity to get ahead with the \\"Big Boss.\\" Her advice, though excellent at times, mostly falls somewhere between bitterness and seemingly unethical behavior. Suggested responses for certain situations range from manipulation, \\"Oh, do you REALLY think Doug can handle that, what with his divorce and all?\\" to the near absurd: \\"If your rival has just written something bad, tell them it's great and that they should show it to the Big Boss.\\"Also, a good many of the stories seem completely manufactured beyond reality for proving the author's point.I firmly believe, as Lichtenberg articulates, that Politics is fundamental to all situations and that it is naive to pretend otherwise. But this book goes far beyond that, and seems to push the bounds of moral decency.There are, however, nuggets of gold despite the shortcomings. Points like \\"Don't expect people to respond to things the way you would\\" and \\"don't try to fight every battle, especially the wrong ones\\" are good and well reasoned. Her discussion of Gossip's necessary role in a workplace I found to be very insightful as well.This book can be good if you don't take it too seriously, because the point of view from which this was written seems very myopic."},{"Title":"Work Would Be Great If It Weren't For the People: Making Office Politics Work for You","review":"If you appreciate 'out of the box' thinking combined with interest in how to deal with office politics, you'll love this book.

It is everything that has happened in my childhood, and more.Recommended readind."},{"Title":"Peter and Wendy,","review":"I adore books full of whimsy and charming turns of phrase on every page, so for the most part, I greatly enjoyed Peter Pan. I think the book hooked me when Barrie explained Neverland as an imaginary map visible to children until adult landmarks gradually overlap the map, leaving Neverland and its wonders forgotten. It's such a beautiful cartographic metaphor for childhood, and from that point on, I was invested in Barrie's ruminations on growing up and what children need (basically, they need moms), despite some boring parts and sexist qualms.As for the low points, and I recall this same criticism from my Disney watching days, the time spent in Neverland is not entertaining. I prefer the beginning and end, when the children are plotting their escape to and from Neverland, to the lagging doldrums in the middle of the book when the children are living in Neverland.I was also immensely annoyed by the book's sexism. I understand that a major theme of the book is the necessity of mothers for young children, but because of this theme, to be a woman in Peter Pan, you must be either A) maternal B) desirous of male companionship (and thus jealous of other women). A combination of A and B is probably preferable (Wendy, who both mothers the Lost Boys and serves as a (chaste) female companion for Peter, is the closest to being an ideal woman).The book wears its sexism quite freely. The reason Wendy goes to Neverland is because she \\"tempts\\" Peter with her knowledge of bedtime stories. Oh, and the Lost Boys need their pockets darned. Later, Wendy only returns to Neverland to do Peter's spring cleaning. It saddens me that only the little boys are depicted as having careless fun. Wendy's brothers get to kill pirates and parade around the island, but Wendy is always a mother, always a caretaker. The other main female character is Tinkerbell, who is mute and terribly envious of Peter's attention to Wendy. Also off-putting is the initial description of Tinkerbell as \\"a girl exquisitely gowned in a skeleton leaf, cut low and square, through which her figure could be seen to the best advantage.\\" Why do we need to see a tiny young girl's body sexualized??? It's disturbing how sexist this book is, but it seems to be largely ignored since it's a children's classic.I also found it interesting that Peter, the eponymous character, is a horrible, selfish, obnoxious, cocky brat. Although he is the supposed hero of the story, Peter is described as domineering and heartless, as all young children often are. Wendy manages to overcome her sexist role and, in my opinion, is the real hero of the book. I wish the book still bore its original title, Peter and Wendy, because that more accurately represents the true protagonist and somewhat ameliorates the sexism.Yet, I still rated this book 4 stars in spite of those many caveats due to the final chapter, \\"When Wendy Grew Up,\\" which absolutely completes the book. The chapter is a tour de force on the bittersweet occurrences of growing up, yet it was absent in the original Peter Pan play. I'm glad it was added to the published novel because juxtaposing how Wendy grows up and is actually quite happy about it though occasionally nostalgic for Neverland, next to the immutable, everlasting boyhood of Peter, who will always be alone, is incredibly moving. Books concerned with growing up often depict the loss of childhood as the great loss of every individual's life, the moment when we lose ourselves to a life of interminable monotony. But Barrie, in a children's book no less, pioneers a different theme. In Peter Pan, he essentially shows us that we do not want to be like Peter Pan. For all the charms of childhood, adulthood is an equally exciting stage; perhaps there are no pirates or mermaids, but there are plenty of other adventures. We must simply grow up to discover them."},{"Title":"Peter and Wendy,","review":"I enjoyed this classic book tremendously. It is an adventure I can pass onto my children.

I remembered the freeing experience of being whomever you wanted to be, without the concern of practicality. The book Peter and Wendy lets you revisit that feeling, then neatly put it away.

The images inside are truly beautiful, and the story is timeless. It is very hard to tell this New York printing from the London version."},{"Title":"Peter and Wendy,","review":"Like most people, my first introduction to the story of Peter Pan was through the Disney movie. And for the most part, the book and the movie are pretty similar. Some may disagree and point to all of the details that Disney misses or alters, but considering how many liberties Disney takes in its storytelling for most of its movies (consider The Little Mermaid), Disney's Peter Pan is surprisingly close to its source.I became curious about this book as an adult because I read that J.M. Barrie's inspiration for \\"the boy who never grew up\\" was in fact a child who died just a day shy of turning 14. This child was the author's older brother - a child who could never be replaced in his mother's heart. As a mother myself, reading about that dark origins of Peter Pan touched my heart and made me incredibly sad. I had never thought about it before, but yes, a dead boy is indeed a boy who never grows up because he can't.Ostensibly, this book is about a boy who comes to whisk three English children away for fun adventures with pirates, mermaids, and Indians, but dig a little deeper and actually this book is really a book about mothers. Over and over again, the author comments on the unconditional love of mothers, the importance of mothers, the role of mothers, and the poor children without mothers. Peter Pan brings Wendy to Neverland where she becomes a mother to him and the lost boys. As Wendy plays the role of a mother, she also keeps faith in her own mother's love and fervently believes that her mother would keep the window open for them. At one point, in a rare moment of darkness, Peter Pan reveals that he doesn't share Wendy's faith in a mother's love.\\"Long ago,\\" he said, \\"I thought like you that my mother would always keep the window open for me; so I stayed away for moons and moons and moons, and then flew back; but the window was barred, for mother had forgotten all about me, and there was another little boy sleeping in my bed.\\"And so, we see these small glimpses of darkness amidst the shining faith that Wendy holds on the unconditional love of mothers. Such nuanced and complex commentaries about mothers throughout this book make it worthwhile for adults, and especially mothers, to read.As a mother, I deeply connected with Barrie's theme of mothers, and it made me reflect on how important mothers truly are. With that said, I will say that I didn't care for all the swashbuckling Neverland adventures. I guess those are the sorts of stories that would appeal more to a child than an adult. Nevertheless, I wouldn't recommend this book to children, mostly because the language and vocabulary are rather advanced. Keep the Disney version for the kids and save the book for the parents."},{"Title":"Peter and Wendy,","review":"The cover really looks like the picture, black and white, with the words \\"Affordable & High Quality Paperback Book Edition\\" plastered across the front.

With the money and jewels they saved from their various heists, they have enough money to live in the most luxurious lifestyle imaginable if they so choose. Thomas gets called up from Scotland Yard occasionally to work on a tough case and Kick helps him in her own manner and style.Now the Queen Elizabeth has asked personally for Thomas's help because some of the crown jewels were stolen by her trusted footman Bradford who helped her pack them for the royal tour she is going on. Thomas learns that Bradford changed his name to Sebastian Tremaine and is the business manager and companion for opera singer Constantin. Thomas has a plan to get Kick in position to get close to Sebastion and Constantin but she has her own methods of doing things and escapes his scrutiny the first change she gets. She tries and succeeds in meeting one of the world's richest men George Naxos and his beautiful wheelchair bound wife Alma. Kick maneuvers them into letting her visit his large isolated estate (more like at a small hamlet) in Switzerland where the rich and famous stay including Constantin and Sebastion. She concocts a daring plan to steal the jewels back from Sebastion but in this garden of Eden there lies a serpent waiting to strike at her and stop her plan from succeeding even if it means killing her.Kick Keswick is very different than the usual heroine. She is self confident, comfortable in her own skin (even if she is twenty-five pounds overweight) and believes there isn't a jewel she can't rob given enough time. The way she maneuvers people to get them to do what she wants is a talent few people possess and the way she does it seems so reasonable at the time that readers find themselves believing she is an average person . This enjoyable crime caper is delightful and charming.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Perfect (Kick Keswick Mysteries #3)","review":"I am a huge fan of Marne Davis Kellogg. My friends and I have read all of her books and were counting the days until Perfect. I was a little disappointed. Kick is still a wonderful character, but there was no real suspense here and Thomas is too minor a part of Perfect-again. The clothes descriptions that were so much fun before seem a tad overdone, and the Mont-St-Agnes crowd left me cold.

Who doesn't love reading about jewels, fabulous food, shady sharacters, luxurious international locations, with a trace of danger and mystery? I love Kick: She's one classy lady who's smart without being smug; witty without being broad. Can't wait to read the next installment."},{"Title":"Perfect (Kick Keswick Mysteries #3)","review":"Let me start off by saying I absolutely adored \\"Brilliant\\". It is one of my favorite books, and Kick Keswick rates up there as one of my all time favorite characters. She is smart, tough, able to take care of herself, and looks out for those less fortunate. Or at least she used to. I therefore cannot understand what has happened to this series. The second book was slightly less interesting, since too much time was spent explaining how Kick became a jewel thief - we went through that in the first book and didn't need such a lengthy recap.This book, however, disappointed me beyond belief. There is no suspense, no build up to a big caper, nothing. We again get the recap as to how Kick reached this point in her life. And then, until one feels sick to their stomach from reading so much about it, we hear page after page, detail after detail, about the food she is eating and the drinks she is drinking. I can tell you, if she ate all of the fattening food she does, she wouldn't carry an extra 25 pounds as she claims. Try more like 250 pounds. We also get to hear about her luscious body, and how beautiful she thinks she is. Finally, this book seems like an advertisement for the fur industry - again, page after page, every character is draped in fur. It's enough to make one run out and join an animal rights group. It's also quite unbelievable that Kick is out to hold a fellow jewel thief accountable. It's not like her character is repenting and giving all the fruits of her thefts to charity or something. For anyone who ever wished they were a billionaire, read this book. It will make you very grateful you don't know people like these. Let's hope if there is a fourth book in this series, it brings things back around to the brilliance of \\"Brilliant.\\""},{"Title":"Perfect (Kick Keswick Mysteries #3)","review":"Kick Keswick is a retired, ultra-rich jewel thief with more than a dash of panache. When she was at the height of her career as the Shamrock Burglar, she amassed a fortune in stolen gems. Kick now has enough money stashed away in her home to last several lifetimes.Shortly after this novel begins, the reader finds Kick ensconced her home in Provence, sipping cider by the hearth. Her husband, Thomas, a retired Scotland Yard Inspector, tells her that the Queen has requested his personal assistance with solving a crime committed right under her nose. It seems that her trusted assistant, an employee with over 30 years of dedicated assistance, decided to steal the Queen's priceless Cambridge and Delhi parure. Since gem thievery is his wife's ex-specialty, Thomas asks her to assist him in recovering the jewels.Kick agrees to assist her husband, but she has a few tricks up her sleeve that perhaps it is best that a Scotland Yard Inspector didn't know (even if he is retired and even if he is her husband)! Soon Kick is donning and doffing disguises. Eventually, she masquerades as a Princesse and works her way into the exclusive snowy sanctuary of Mont St. Anges where the thief is hiding out with people who pay through their frozen noses to keep such riff-raff away.Ms. Kellogg's novel is as crisp and cool as flawlessly cool and crisp as an F1 diamond in a dry martini.

Yet when her latest tale takes us to a kind of Shangri-La in the Alps, which should be thrilling -- especially as a setting for a world-class jewel thief -- it's amazingly dull.Shamrock Burglar Kick Keswick, who was so unusual and interesting in Brilliant, is merely smug and self-absorbed in Perfect. We hear about her fabulous jewels, her preoccupation with food, the sumptuousness of her wardrobe and surroundings. When we finally reached the Alpine hideaway and introduced to the opulence of its hotel, it sounded redundant - probably because Kellogg had been raving over the opulence of a Paris hotel just a chapter or two earlier. And I question that Kick would be so out-of-shape; extra pounds notwithstanding, one would think her profession would keep her physically fit and agile in case she needs to make a quick getaway.Why have her married to Thomas, the charming retired detective from Scotland Yard? He appears only sporadically, and I'd like to know him better. But no, it's all about Kick. Normally I love to read about intelligent women of a certain age. Just not this one.I think this author has a lot of talent; it's just not channeled properly. That's where a good editor comes in. Hopefully Kellogg can \\"kick\\" the suspense and action back up in future novels and recapture the fun of her first two novels in this series."},{"Title":"Perfect (Kick Keswick Mysteries #3)","review":"I love strong older women heroines and Kick is one of the best!

It was original and fun. \\"Priceless\\" was much more uneven. ButI enjoyed \\"Perfect\\" even less. Kick has become smug, monotonous, and relentlessly self-absorbed. More importantly, she is humorless. After some chapters were over, I felt like I had just read an upscale shopping catalog. Plot and character development are being sacrificed for an unending parade of consumer goods descriptions. I think I should have stopped after the first book."},{"Title":"Perfect (Kick Keswick Mysteries #3)","review":"I agree with other reviewers who said they enjoyed Brilliant but did care for the two sequels. Brilliant was enjoyable to read but the sequel \\"Priceless\\" left me feeling disappointed. However, this book was the worst in the Kick Keswick series. Not only is it badly written (not a big surprise if you've ever tried to read her earlier books) but again, the author's preoccupation with getting older, her weight problem and obsession with plastic surgery seems to carry over to her characters. This is obvious if you turn to the back cover and see the author photo - obviously she is a big fan of multiple facelifts. By the way, her other books were similarly were about vapid aging women complaining about their weight and making catty comments about other women and their hair, wrinkles and appearances in general.What I found to be very disturbing in this book is her racist comments (which I won't quote here) which I truly believe the author does not think is at all offensive. How the editors did not catch and edit this out surprises me.Bottom line: \\"Brilliant\\" was accidentally written well but rest of her books were all a waste of money (couple of her books were so bad I gave up a quarter of the way through).

His previous works, including CARE OF THE SOUL, somehow manage to transcend pop culture, yet remain accessible and practical to the general reader with a yearning to grow. If only everyone could take the time to read his work, or listen to his tapes, we'd all be better people.DARK NIGHTS OF THE SOUL is especially needed in these times of quick-fix therapy and entertainment as anti-depressant. We need to accept the fact that tough times and dark episodes in our lives must be dealt with and honored, not medicated or pushed under the rug. Dark nights offer potential for growth, for soul expansion, and Thomas Moore is the one to lead us on this important journey.If you enjoyed his earlier work, you will appreciate his latest effort, and no doubt, will notice that he too is growing as a writer and giving us more to think about. Don't overlook this one."},{"Title":"Dark Nights of the Soul","review":"&quot;Every human life is made up of the light and the dark, the happy and the sad, the vital and the deadening. How you think about this rhythm of moods makes all the difference. Are you going to hide out in self-delusion and distracting entertainments? Are you going to become cynical or depressed? Or are you going to open your heart to a mystery that is as natural as the sun and the moon, day and night, and summer and winter?&quot;The above quotation is the crucial question in Thomas Moore's sequel to his best-selling and ultimately helpful &quot;Care of the Soul.&quot; Read in his soothing, contemplative voice it is a challenge to all for everyone of us experiences times of grief, suffering, disappointment, and failure. Rather than reject these experiences, try to avoid them or get through them as quickly as possible, Moore, a former Catholic monk who became a therapist, suggests that we see them as opportunities for personal and spiritual growth.Not an easy task you say. I quite agree. Yet, as Moore speaks from his personal life, cites case studies, and presents stories from art, literature, and mythology, listeners may find both encouragement and strength.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Dark Nights of the Soul","review":"There should be a section in the book stores called intelligent and thoughtful reflection. You can find books like these but they are scattered in the hundreds of awful releases in &quot;Self Help&quot;, &quot;New Age&quot; or &quot;Philosophy&quot;.Moore is intelligent, thoughtful and has spent years in reflection. He's also a good writer who doesn't offer easy answers. I've loved all his books. This is no exception."},{"Title":"Dark Nights of the Soul","review":"This is an excellent book on dark period in a person's life that is so often pathologized in our culture. It presents a compassionate view of the existential dilemmas of life and the cyclic nature of consolation and desolation that occur in introspective people.Thomas Moore writes in a very lyrical way and his analogies and examples are very poignant. He talks about the function of dark periods as putting us in touch with soul. This is a great message for a culture that often sweeps pain under the rug or is so busy that there is no value seen in taking time to listening to what pain has to say about life.This book is a comfort to anyone suffering from any kind of psychological pain from existential crisis to difficult life transitions. It reframes pain in a positive light and offers hope to the reader."},{"Title":"Dark Nights of the Soul","review":"In this day and age most people do not want to read about their Dark Nights of the Soul. We have a medical industry that does not want you to read this book. We have politicans who want to keep you in a constant state of fear who do not want you to read this book. And we have an entertainment and media industry which does not want you to read this book. For to read it is to know that the fear that they generate, the messages they try to stick us with, and the palliatives that they offer to assuage it don't work. Desperately wanting us to believe that life falls into their three act framework they do what they can to have us accept this souless narrative as our map to happiness, health and good fortune. But a few abberations slip through. Dark Nights of the Soul is one.This is a significant work. A primer for life and dealing with its natural ebb and flow. If you don't acknowledge the foundation of the book then you can't understand that the dark nights that we think are there to tear us down are really there to transform us.This book will change how to think and how you embrace life. It will challenge your ideas about disease, anger, aging, and even happiness. It makes connections between your body, mind and soul that you previously might have believed only lightly touch each other. It will or should help you to understand that a textured life is not about constantly walking around with an insipid smile on your face and saying 'feeling great' when someone asks.If there is a fault with the book it is that it is too honest and refuses to sugar coat its message. And in that alone it will be missed by a significant majority that absolutely needs to read this.Dark Nights should be on everyones list. Read it."},{"Title":"Dark Nights of the Soul","review":"I've known and followed Tom Moore and his work for years now, and I find this work to be of the best books he has written. Dark Night is clear, literate, focused, and immediately useful, identifying the gnarly issues of post-modern adult life and shining beautiful bright light on the path at the places where it narrows. Moore is at the height of his powers, incorporating what he has touched on previously, evolving it, deepening it, while making his piercing perception very accesible. I highly recommend this book, without reservation. And, bonus, it is a good read to boot."},{"Title":"Dark Nights of the Soul","review":"I attempted to write a review a few minutes ago but I could not collect my thoughts. I'm listening to the audio version of this book as I drive each day. Anyway, I closed out without submitting anything.I had to go downstairs to my basement hideaway for something and I saw the hundreds and hundreds of books all over the place and was reminded of my searching and aimlessness in life. It's all confusion and clutter to some, but every book tells a story. Not just the author's but the person who picks it up. Their interests and reason for touching it in the first place.I have many versions and interpretations of The Dark Night of The Soul. Thomas Merton and Finley were mentioned in other reviews. I have their books and so many, many others. . New Age and Old Age.What the heck am I looking for? When will this long \\"Night\\" end?I don't know. My soul and spirit seem to clash against my self and ego.Nevertheless, the audio version, read by the author, speaks to me. He attempts to make sense of the senseless. He speaks peace to me and encourages me to continue when I want to just give up.I'm saying that in the best way I know how is he is helping me admidst the clutter of my mind and soul to realize that it is not in vain. that there is a reason for this gloominess and isolation and withdrawal.I'm still going through the audio. I bought the book and tore into that. lotta notes. I like the audio because I can relate to him better.I wish all of you out there encouragement and pray you find peace and contentment in life."},{"Title":"Dark Nights of the Soul","review":"I purchased and read several other books on the subject of a dark night of the soul and they all left me disappointed and more stressed, feeling that there was no help out there. If you are really going through a deep, dark night, you may truly find this book comforting. I recommended it to a friend who was also going through this and they found it very helpful.The experience of a dark night is not really addressed by scientific, therapeutic or fix-it solutions. This book really explains why that is and helps you to embrace the experience. By helping you to understand better what you are going through, what the process is like, how to cope, and what could be the value/reward of going through it, it allows you to deal with the anxiety that comes with the unknown and strange journey a dark night takes you on. It references age-old mythology and ancient religions and cultures to help you to accept the experience and not judge it through the eyes of our fix-it contemporary cultural views which do not allow for spiritual exploration and healing. The writings of historical figures who have lived the dark night are included as references and analyzed to help put your own dark night in perspective.There are apparently many different sources of a dark night, and every single person's is a unique and singular experience. This book has several chapters that address a variety of sources including marital and relationship difficulties, creativity and artistic issues, and the struggle between being a parent and being an individual. I have not finished reading the book yet and am still not through my own journey so I can not attest to it providing the answers you are looking for, but it should provide a significant comfort and that can be a lot in the midst of a dark night."},{"Title":"Dark Nights of the Soul","review":"Even our blackest moods can have a constructive side if they help us to grow. Too often, however, we try to ignore or escape from our problems rather than face them. Since ancient times, man has faced the same conundrum -- in the famous Biblical story, Jonah's attempt to escape his destiny was intercepted when he was swallowed by the whale.Most of us have been there one time or another. Things don't turn out the way we had hoped, goals are elusive, relationships hit the rocks, we begin to realize what a boss or colleague really thinks of us... Too often, we tend to define who we are, and our self-esteem in particular, in terms of these roles, and when such unfortunate events occur, we may feel as though the lid has been ripped off the false sense of security we carved out for ourselves... At times, everything we have worked for seems to crumble to ruins under our feet, and we feel lost because we are not yet able to put it into perspective. In this little book, Thomas Moore correctly asserts that when one is feeling anxious, depressed, or defeated by some of life's setbacks, the best solution is not necessarily to reach for some pills, see expensive therapists, or resort to escapist behavior that can often become pointless or addictive, but rather to actually face these emotions and see what they might have to teach you.Indeed, the mind, or soul, at times is starving for fulfillment in the same manner that the body requires food, and if it too does not receive the type of nourishment it needs, depression may be one way of letting you know. If you choose, you can let this be a vehicle for personal growth, reflection and self-discovery, a quest to find one's true calling which may not otherwise have been possible. The trick is just to look at life through a different prism than that to which one is accustomed, a \\"Twilight Zone\\" version if you will, where at times you may feel somewhat like you are trapped in the eye of a storm, and you just have to ride it out and hang on to whatever you can, until the dust settles when your mind has completed the process of constructing a framework for what is to come next. Eventually you may even come to appreciate it as a learning or growth experience. The author subtly trains the reader to cultivate a more cosmic, mystical view of his or her life with a rich tapestry of imagery drawn from the folklore and mythology of many different cultures.Serious depression can distort a person's view of the world, making him or her see only the bad side of things and stop noticing the good. It can help to try to train yourself to discern the silver linings behind the clouds, and to sharpen your appreciation for whatever blessings you do have, and then try to live in the here and now rather than just brooding on all your mistakes, which can bolster your morale a bit during difficult times. Sometimes, when you feel like you have really hit rock bottom, redirecting your thoughts in a more creative direction can use that same energy to propel you, in springboard fashion, to new ways of looking at things and greater happiness than you may have imagined.If you feel the need for a little counseling but can't afford to see a therapist at the moment, I recommend this book. You may never look at your problems in quite the same way again! You will see them as challenges to overcome rather than impossible roadblocks, and will feel empowered to make the necessary improvements."},{"Title":"Dark Nights of the Soul","review":"I am someone who has had depression off and on for many years.As a spiritually oriented person, I tend to regard my depression in terms of one of my crosses to bear in life and to work with it,rather than fight it. But, sometimes I get upset with my tendency to be depressive and try to fix it and be done with it. I don't give the depression a voice or honor it. I just live with it most of the time.I believe in getting help in any way you can whether it be naturally or with medication or therapy.For some medication is a must.But I also believe that our culture is one that values, all things bright, youthful, and energetic and happy and one that fears darkness, aging, death and depression. We are addicted to feeling up, happy and achieving. Nothing wrong with achievment or being happy and young. But you cannot deny that our culture is overly identified with those things. Being over identification with one way of being can bring us many problems.I love how Thomas makes room for the dark and the depressive, not to promote it to stay but just to give it a voice, space and time, so that it does not have to destroy us to get our attention. Jesus himself loved the people who were considered the dark ones, the sinners. Why not love and honor our own darkness?Thomas is a brilliant man and what he says may be scary for some to hear or even confusing. I feel afraid in a to do this work but in that scariness I feel more alive and more ready to deepen myself by doing it. It challenges me and my normal ways of being. It asks me to go inside and explore, rather than run away to feel better.I know deep in my bones what he is saying is right for me.This work may not be for everyone.There are many paths.But it cannot hurt to give oneself some compassion and some time to entertain the dark spaces in the ways he suggests. Being as conscious as one can be while doing it.Not just succumbing numbly to depression.

He was skillfully sailing the ship until I got to his fourth chapter where he got off into a skiff and cut the rope. He has set me adrift in a wide sea without a moral compass.He leads his readers into the occult and astrology. A place where a former Monk should fear to tread. While I don't mind learning about insights of the dark night through greek mythology and other lesser known personalities, I feel Mr. Moore could have served his readers better examples by using concepts and personalities from the Judeo-Christian tradition.Mr. Moore holds too highly the concept of self and self fulfullment. What I understood from Part Two of the book \\"Disturbances\\" is don't take responsibility for your choices. Follow what you feel you must do in order to develop your inner self and talents even it that means to destroy and hurt your relationship with family and friends.Jesus' idea was in losing one's self that we find out true self.I haven't finished the book yet so I guess it's a bit unfair to write a review so soon. However, I thought I would tear through this book because the first 68 pages held so much meaning for me. I've gotten bogged down in the middle and have picked up another book by James Finley which is an expose of Thomas Merton's thought. Merton's Palace of Nowhere -A search for God through Awareness for the True Self. I love this book.What I am discovering from Merton is that the self we construct is an illusion but we need to find our true self through our search and union with God. I believe this is the true purpose of the Dark night of the Soul which is to lead us to the realization of our need for grounding in the source of life.I have two more books by Moore which I plan to read. Care of the Soul and The Re-enchantment of Every Day life. So stay tuned"},{"Title":"Dark Nights of the Soul","review":"I was hoping for a book with practical thoughts and techniques to help the reader navigate through the darker parts of life. Instead this is a rambling essay that quotes pagan God's and assumes a level of knowledge that leaves the average reader wondering what the heck he is talking about. I got tired of hearing about how we should embrace our dark side; and found the opinions that it's okay to invoke total lack of responsibilty for one's actions in pursuit of this darkness downright dangerous; (especially the chapter discussing women who wake up one day and no longer want to parent their children). It's no wonder his publisher released him as he states in one of his chapters. His book is obviously meant to appeal to a very particular audience and is not for someone who wants to get out of a depression and longs to live in the light. It's not at all what I expected from the book jacket and knowing that he is a former Catholic Monk! I also found his writing style difficult to follow and more in the mode of a scholarly paper than a book meant to convey knowledge to a wide range of readers. Only for those already into the occult and previously inoculated to this genre."},{"Title":"Dark Nights of the Soul","review":"I wouldn't recommend reading this if you are suffering from depression. The subject matter is very heavy and will only make matters worse."},{"Title":"Dark Nights of the Soul","review":"It gives you a better appreciation of your tough times and how to accept them and not deny them.I would like to make a note here. I find the comment of \\"Teri M. Oneal\\" pretty disturbing when she/he says \\"It's no wonder his publisher released him as he states in one of his chapters\\". If the author shares his experiences with us, or anyone for that matter, it is our duty as a mature adult person not to use it against him or her. If one does not appreciate another one's opinion, one can come up with reasoning. Moking or taking advantage of one's trust is the least mature action one can do."},{"Title":"Dark Nights of the Soul","review":"I've become a great fan of Thomas Moore's readings. Some deep analytical authors are so far out that I can't follow or understand what they are trying to say. Thomas Moore's work is profound, yet written at a level that the reader can relate it to his/her own life. He's the master of spiritual insight. This book can be read and reread as a person goes through the many dark nights of life's journey."},{"Title":"Dark Nights of the Soul","review":"I picked up this book on the advice of my therapist/teacher/spiritual director. If you're going through a hard time and have been for a long time, and you feel like it's just not shaking loose, pick up this book. I felt that it gave voice to what I was feeling and experiencing without the new-age-law-of-attraction advice of \\"just think good thoughts.\\" Because that wasn't working for me. This book validates that there are periods in life that are dark and depressing and just as valuable as those periods of great external success, happiness, money, etc. I feel like those of us who choose to experience these periods of our lives with grace live in small, quiet, lonely corners of life. People rarely talk about these phases. That doesn't mean they aren't real or valuable or simply part of life. This book gives voice to this phase. It's a companion along that journey. Highly recommend. Wish it were available on Kindle."},{"Title":"Dark Nights of the Soul","review":"Fabulous book! Thomas is my absolute FAVORITE author! Wonderful book that teaches you that not only is it ok to have feelings of depression, sadness, anger, but let's us know that these emotions serve a soulful purpose. I will continue to read this again and again and again."},{"Title":"Dark Nights of the Soul","review":"\\"The dark night is the soul shining through with its lunar luminosity. It is the deep, dark discovery of roots and cellars, the opposite of enlightenment, but equally important and equally divine. It is the pulling apart of meaning so that mystery can be revealed.\\" ~ pg. 311\\"Dark Nights of the Soul\\" is the type of book you want to read secretly without telling anyone about it. In some way it is a very personal reading experience. Perhaps it is like a secret pleasure or at least a refreshingly honest way of looking at life. This book is not really about depression, it is more about the darkly beautiful aspects of life.In reality life may be seen as one dark night after the other in which the soul is reborn through trials and spiritual experiences where the soul is tested. At times you pass the test and move on to a new level of awareness. Unfortunately sometimes you must repeat the test almost endlessly until enlightenment strikes.\\"The child Jesus lying in a manger, visited by kings and proclaimed by angels is yet another great image for this insight. At Christmas, much of the world honores the archetype of the child, who is seen as a light appearing at the end of a long dark night.\\" ~ pg. 203Thomas Moore's book is a journey through life. There are discussions of romantic love, marriage, aging, anger, sexuality, creativity, insanity and illness. In each topic he brings a fresh awareness of the dark aspects that are undeniably present. Throughout this book there are also discussions of Greek mythology, Zen Buddhism and astrology. Tarot cards are briefly mentioned. This seemed strange coming from someone who used to be a monk.If you have been depressed in the past or have gone through a dark night of the soul then you may already see a dark night as less of a problem and more of a transformation. All the fighting and struggling to be reborn is worth the effort as you emerge with a new clarity of vision and also gain wisdom. Perhaps this is an excellent book to read before the year ends so you can analyze your dark nights and then move on into love's beauty. This book doesn't talk about love very much, but love might be what saves you from eternally having to go through more dark nights. As Thomas Moore states: \\"Depression is a psychological sickness, a dark night is a spiritual trial.\\"I have rarely read a book where I felt so understood. If you have had your own dark nights then I think you will agree. You may also want to read books on Jesus because a belief in Jesus can sometimes make a dark night much easier to bear.Jesus: An Intimate Portrait of the Man, His Land, and His PeopleJesus (2000)What Jesus Demands from the World~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Dark Nights of the Soul","review":"I love the book because it has helped me to put those dark places that have/will occur in my life in a place that makes sense and enables me to move forward."},{"Title":"Dark Nights of the Soul","review":"It's title and the fact Thomas Moore wrote it that drew me in the first place. I was in the dark night (which is actually many nights), walking through the Valley of Sorrow, Loss and Fear. This book takes you out of that realm of feeling utterly alone. He has a mystical way of lifting you up so you can see your life with humanity and courage. Moreover, he shows you the breathe of life and how extraordinary it is in every direction. Reading Moore is like listening to a great singer whose songs affect you and melt you at your core only to strengthen you and make you more than you were before. Thank you Thomas for sharing your authentic self in a way that carried me through the dark night of the soul. I will hang on to this book to remind me, no matter what ... love carries us."},{"Title":"Dark Nights of the Soul","review":"Would recommend if you have the capacity to analyze self in relationship to self and exterior personalities.

I could not put this book down!"},{"Title":"Dark Nights of the Soul","review":"It was as if Thomas Moore was writing the words in this book to me right at the exact time that I needed it. Life does hand us some blows and he lets us know how to go through these times with grace. It is wonderful how Mr. Moore assures us through his compassionate writings that we need not dwell in a depression or a pity party. The literature is geared toward a learning experience and how we are to develop and grow into the person we are meant to be. It is a wonderful read and a revelation for those who are stuck in a pit."},{"Title":"Dark Nights of the Soul","review":"An excellent guide to navigating those times in your life when you wonder \\"why me.\\" Jungian in perspective but not technical, it asks you to look for the \\"gift\\" in suffering."},{"Title":"Dark Nights of the Soul","review":"Life is abundant with opposites. In order to fully know and understand one thing, you must understand its opposite. How can you understand fat without understanding thin? How can you comprehend hot if you don't understand cold? What is light if there is no dark? The same is true for life. How can one understand happiness if one has never suffered or been depressed? During periods of growth and evolution, an individual will undoubtedly experience darker periods of anxiety, depression, and the unknown. In Dark Nights of the Soul, Thomas Moore explains the life-changing purpose of these difficult times and successfully demonstrates how to navigate these periods to reap their most extreme benefits.Moore explains the concept of the dark night of the soul from the spiritual perspective. With a background in both psychotherapy and theology, Moore's gentle approach is neither too scientific nor too religious. Society has taught us, he suggests, to keep moving forward at all costs. To take a few steps backward or to experience hurdles along the way is to backslide, yet Moore appeals to his readers to find the hidden growth opportunities within these periods of disappointment and dissatisfaction.Diving into numerous causes for dark nights, including illness, creative anxiety, loss of a loved one, aging, marriage & relationships, sex, and emotions such as anger and jealousy, Moore leaves no stone unturned as to the possible setbacks in life one might experience. The reality is that setbacks are a natural part of life, and without understanding and accepting this, one fails to identify the value in experiencing one of these darker periods. Without going so far as to suggest embracing the dark night, Moore demonstrates the importance of taking these opportunities to better understand oneself and dive into creative productivity as a means of navigating the dark night. Citing several important religious leaders, writers, scholars, philosophers, and other creative types, Moore exemplifies the incredible contributions made to humanity by individuals suffering through some of the darkest periods of their lives.Moore also makes the connection between the mental, physical, and spiritual aspects of humanity, suggesting the connection between physical illness and mental state of mind is more than superficial. While not going so far as to disdain the use of antipsychotic drugs or antidepressants, he does state his opinion that society as a whole is overmedicated. Each time we experience a dark night of the soul, we run to medication rather than introspection and analysis to effectively navigate the experience and come through it changed for the better.Thomas Moore has done something truly profound in delivering Dark Nights of the Soul. Through this book, not only does one better understand the purpose and payoff of life's setbacks and dark periods. The reader also ends the book almost appreciating the experience and knowing how to come through such periods successfully and much improved."},{"Title":"Dark Nights of the Soul","review":"No kidding, this book entered my dark little soul and brought it to a place of healing I never knew existed. Approaching our emotional or physical crises from a new, deeper perspective that honors the darkness instead of running from it, encourages us to seek new ways of living within it."},{"Title":"Dark Nights of the Soul","review":"I found the book a little slow going initially after having just finished listening to it on CD - the author has such a gentle, captivating voice which is echoed in his written words. What a wonderful affirmation to know we all experience \\"dark nights of the soul\\", even better to realize we can embrace these times to enlarge all areas of our lives. Good for my soul."},{"Title":"Dark Nights of the Soul","review":"Despite its title, this book has absolutely nothing to do with the Dark Night of the Soul. Moore admits early on that he has co-opted only the title from the classic work by John of the Cross. Moore's book is about spiritual and emotional crisis. In the original by John of the Cross, the Dark Night is not about crisis, it is about deeper union with God... the \\"dark night\\" is a metaphor for the place where lovers meet. Moore's book is okay if you are looking for a self-help pop psychology book. But if you were looking for a book about deepening spirituality, you should read Gerald May's book of the same title instead. I think it is important to add this note, in case someone might be led to believe that this book is about the Dark Night of the Soul, or about John of the Cross, or about spirituality. It isn't."},{"Title":"Dark Nights of the Soul","review":"I love Thomas Moore's writing. My favorite Thomas Moore books are \\"Dark Night of the Soul\\" and \\"Writing in the Sand.\\" They have specific topics with specific insights. He thoughly covers every aspect as facets cover a diamond. There is much specific information in both of these books. Dark nights are not only about depression, there are dark nights of anger, jealousy, sickness and aging. The dynamics of a dark night are covered also. This book (DNS) doesn't ask you to do anything except experience and comtemplate the journey.Love & Death: My Journey through the Valley of the Shadow"},{"Title":"Dark Nights of the Soul","review":"This is an interesting piece from Thomas Moore who has produced several works that many would consider \\"spiritual introspections\\". Although he can be flaky at times and comes across as distinctly anti-medicine, his advice is to shy away from avoiding the \\"dark nights\\" that we all face periodically; instead, we can benefit by embracing these dark moments to better understand the forces that cause us to experience despair and suffering. Sure, it can be dangerous to face our fears head-on, especially for those in the throes of depression, but there is some real value in exploring the source(s) of our unhappiness, whether we are experiencing marital woes, financial difficulties, lack of professional fulfillment, or some crisis of a personal nature.The book has moments of terrific clarity, and some goofy sections where Moore waxes (rambles?) philosophically on topics ranging from sex, to academic tenure, to love, and more, but the larger point is robust - that there is terrific potential to grow emotionally if we can face our dark nights as students instead of as fearful sheep.Don't look to this book to cure depression, and take with a grain of salt this ex-monk's message about western medicine and its failure to address illnesses of the soul, but do take the time to give it a read. You might really appreciate the underlying message. I purchased the audiobook (cassettes - yes, I'm still in the stone age) and found it to be a soothing experience for a long morning commute to work. Give it a shot and see if it does something good for you. In these trying economic times, we could all stand to undergo a bit of introspection.david"},{"Title":"Dark Nights of the Soul","review":"Very challenging book. Makes you really think.

A reader of this review commented that some of the details (I considered them banalities) do indeed constitute spoilers and therefore I have deleted them from this edited version (12/5/11).That same reader was kind enough to point out the history of the novel which explains its disjointed narrative and lack of cohesion.

Our narrator pops in and out of town on visits recording these banalities to what end? A few instances made me smile, a skirmish between fans of Dr. Johnson and Dickens had some charm but for the most part the characters and their lives left me bored.

The short novel was first serialized in Charles Dicken's edited periodical \\"Household Words\\" during 1853. Its author was Elizabeth Gaskell (1810-1865) of Manchester who was the wife of the Unitarian pastor William Gaskell. Despite a busy life of charity work, raising several children and a wide correspondence she managed to develop into a fine novelist. Gaskell was friendly with Florence Nightingale and became the biographer of her good friend Charlotte Bronte. This novel has become a popular miniseries on BBC TV and is being broadcast in the United States on the Masterpiece program on PBS.Cranford tells the story of Miss Debroah and Miss Matty Jenkyns late middle aged daughters of a Church of England clergyman. We visit their quiet world of sewing, morning visits to friends, afternoon teas and trips to church events. We learn that they are old fashioned disdaining the coming of the railroad. Miss Deborah engages in a very humorous argument with Captain Brown (significantly this character is killed by a train) over whether Dr. Samuel Johnson or Charles Dickens is the best writer. We learn that Miss Matty had been courted by the eccentric farmer Mr. Holbrook. We learn he has 26 cows or one for each letter of the alphabet. Holbrook dies as an old man after fulfilling his dream of visiting Paris. We discover the story of the siblings wandering brother Peter who leaves home after a quarrel with their stern father. Peter becomes a sailor. Several years later he returns from India to be reacquainted with his surviving sister Matty and his friends in Cranford.We meet such eccentric old maids as Miss Pole and learn of other residents of the tiny village. Cranford is based on Knustsford the village in which Mrs. Gaskell grew to womanhood. Knustford is located close to Manchester in the industrial north of Great Britain.One of the most heartwarming tales of Cranford is to see how the friends of Miss Matty rally around and support her when she loses all of her money in a bank which failed.Cranford is a gentle glance into a rural England which only exists on the printed page. It is a loving little story of ordinary men and women bound together by blood, love and common interests. Excellent!"},{"Title":"Cranford;: A play from Mrs. Gaskell's novel,","review":"This book has been called Gaskell's greatest, something I just cannot agree with. ok, so it provides an sharp insight into the small town life of the time.

Reads very much like a newsy letter from an old aunt whose daily life sees great drama in little things. I laughed out loud more than once- as the writing is both sincere and gently parodying itself at the same time. I finished the book with a smile and a few times was quite touched by the goings on in Cranford.

The much that we get in this book includes a compassionate study of life in a small English town in the early 1800s before Victoria, using as Austin does, the stratum of families (mostly single and widowed women) who saw themselves as genteel though needing to practice elegant economy as the viewpoint. We get writing where each word is exquisitely chosen yet unpretentious; we get a quiet but clear sense of the social stratification where servants were kindly treated but unpaid including the little workhouse maiden whose arms were too small to carry a tea-tray. We get laughter as in the story of Miss Betsy Barker's cow going to pasture in grey flannel after she lost her hair when she fell into the lime-pit.Most of all, we get love: the love between sisters, brothers, fathers and mothers; the love between men and women;lovingkindness to strangers; and the love between the lifelong friends who are the women of Cranford.My copy is over 100 years old, illustrated in pen and ink drawings that are as witty and compassionate as Mrs Gaskell's writing. Found it in an odd lot in a Maine shop years ago, and it has been a good companion since, timeless as good stories and beautifully written work is, from Gilgamesh on."},{"Title":"Cranford;: A play from Mrs. Gaskell's novel,","review":"There are rules and regulations at Cranford, and women, and a society of women. The town keeps early hours. The inhabitmts of the town exchange kind acts.Captain Brown is killed by a railroad as he removes a small child from the rails. There is a general absence of men in Cranford, but not of the kind of young men suitable for dating the servants. The central postion in the story is occupied by Mathilda Jenkyns, daughter of a clergyman, an unmarried woman.The author has amusing ways of describing the people in the village, their quirks, their eccentricities, their habits. One character prefers Mr. Boz, (Dickens), to Dr. Johnson. Miss Mathilda Jenkyns is persuaded by her friends to visit Mr. Holbrook, a former beau who was considered by a member of her family to be unsuitable. The guests wonder whether it is possible to eat peas with the utensils provided. Shortly after the visit Mr. Holbrook dies to the secret consternation of Miss Matty Jenkyns.From letters it is learned that her mother expected Matty Jenkyns to grow up to become a great beauty. Her brother Peter, after mischief-making and being whipped by her father, disappears. He is sighted in Liverpool and it is understood his employment takes him to India. He sends his mother a shawl and then the family ceases to hear anything about him.Mrs. Gaskell describes a milliners shop in Cranford and another establishment selling general goods. Expenditure of dress in Cranford is mainly a case of new caps. A hostess gives her dog cream with his tea and her guests, milk. In misfortune, a bank failure, kindness and love are bestowed by friends and associates for the victim's support and betterment. Harmony, reciprocity are the qualities clearly evidenced.The appendix contains an essay of Gaskell's,\\"The Last Generation in England,\\" which bears upon her knowledge of the sort of society portrayed in CRANFORD."},{"Title":"Cranford;: A play from Mrs. Gaskell's novel,","review":"\\"Quaint\\" is the first word that comes to mind. I would almost describe it as one of Eliot's idyllic novels, if it had been written by Dickens. I would say that, if it weren't a disservice to all the authors involved. Jane Austen would be a more apt comparison, if Austen's works were more episodic. Mrs. Gaskell has a sweetness and a wit throughout the novel, with a tongue-in-cheek attitude towards the inhabitants of Cranford, that brings to mind both the works of Dickens and Austen--especially the characterizations, which are quite good. This is important, as with only a thin veil of a plot to tie to chapters together, the responsibility of drawing the reader in falls solely on the shoulders of her characters. Moving from incident to incident, as was not uncommon in Victorian novels, the novel begs us to pay attention simply because the characters are worth giving our attention. Obviously, a weak novel is one wants to study plot, but one could certainly choose a worth book to pick up to study the art of comedic characterization. With less on it's mind than some of Gaskell's other works--from what I've read--Cranford is an easy, enjoyable read, but far from life changing. It is simply a well-written, enjoyable read, and there's nothing wrong with that. Something to enjoy over afternoon tea."},{"Title":"Cranford;: A play from Mrs. Gaskell's novel,","review":"Last winter, I rented Cranford, the BBC miniseries (starring Judi Dench), from Netflix--and that got me interested in the book on which that's based. The book is a series of vignettes about the ladies of the town of Cranford, many of whom are elderly spinsters like Miss Matty Jenkyns and her sister Deborah, or Miss Pole (much as I tried not to, I kept seeing Judi Dench and Imelda Staunton in the roles of Miss Matty and Miss Pole).This short story differs significantly from the miniseries; the miniseries focuses a lot on the encroachment of the railways on the town of Cranford, and there's a romantic subplot going on there. The book is much more centered on the middle-aged and elderly ladies of the town, as seen through a semi-outsider, Miss Mary Smith, the daughter of a family friend of the Jenkynses.As another reviewer said on Librarything, reading about the ladies of Cranford is a lot like reading about the Golden Girls. This is a very lighthearted, funny book in many places, but still very touching. The ladies are very provincial, focused on the mundane details of their lives--but very loyal to one another, as seen when Matty looses her money and her friends conspire to help her out. It took a few pages for me to get into the story, but once I did, I was fully engaged in the lives of the characters in this book."},{"Title":"Cranford;: A play from Mrs. Gaskell's novel,","review":"I have always been a fan of 19th century novels and many of my favorite authors come from this time period. I have never read anything by Gaskill, and finally grabbed this book after seeing the BBC miniseries of the same name.It was a sentimental look at several spinsters in the town of Cranford, all of which are likable and good people. The overall tone of the book was very positive, with one of the main lessons showing that people love to help genuinely good people. It is a nice contrast to many novels that show the worst in people.Note that this does not match the BBC series in all aspects since the BBC series took all 3 Cranford books and condensed them into a miniseries, but many of the episodes from the book are included with modifications. I enjoyed the book and the TV show, even though they did not match exactly.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in this type of literature and who wants a refreshing glance as a time that was."},{"Title":"Cranford;: A play from Mrs. Gaskell's novel,","review":"...I came to the conclusion that this printing of Cranford has the CUTEST cover (i.e. a pretty teacup and a great font), therefore I bought it.My wife agreed.Mission accomplished hubbie. Mission accomplished.But seriously, if you or your wife are into Jane Austen(ish) stuff like my wife, Cranford is a MUST have. And of all the printed versions, this one is by far the cutest looking, which apparently is somewhat important to wives who like Jane Austen and her crowd of Victorian/Regency era authors. If you're a husband looking for a gift for your wife, this is a great one.And definitely buy her the DVD bundle of Cranfod and return to Cranford.And definitely buy her the DVD first few seasons of \\"Lark Rise to Candleford\\".Believe me...it's worth the money.She'll feel like you understand her a little bit...and she'll have some of her friends over for a \\"girl night\\" where they watch their DVDs and drink tea and dream about living in mid nineteenth century Britain, and you'll be able to work on the car/the yard/whatever without feeling like you're neglecting your wife because she'll be having way more fun than you.That's worth any price."},{"Title":"Cranford;: A play from Mrs. Gaskell's novel,","review":"Explore the 3 life perspectives of the folks in Cranford and surrounds and you'll settle in for a cup of tea at Miss Matty's in no time.

With several options to choose from, I am very happy with the aesthetics of this book. In particular I truly enjoy the \\"tea cup\\" cover and the simplistic and easy to read layout of the interior. And it's always good to have a nice book to look at on the shelf when you're done with reading it.After being impressed with this book I also checked out the other books tagged with cricket house and their other offerings are as equally impressive.This version of Cranford is definitely worth it's price."},{"Title":"Cranford;: A play from Mrs. Gaskell's novel,","review":"I was inspired to read Cranford by Elizabeth Gaskell after watching the PBS/BBC miniseries last year. The town of Cranford is dominated by women. There are relatively few men, at least in the social circle of the characters in this book. The main characters are all single, either spinsters or widows, and they fiercely guard their way of life.The book, originally published serially in 1853 in Charles Dickens' magazine Household Words, is a series of vignettes of the daily life of Miss Mathilda Jenkyns. This book is definitely character driven and starts off slow. Nothing truly exciting ever happens in Cranford and you have to get to know the characters before you understand how small disruptions can make huge waves in their lives. Gaskell manages to convey how important small events are to these characters. You get the sense that if anything big ever happened they'd die from the shock. The narrator, Mary Smith, a frequent (and slightly more worldly) visitor to the town tries to keep molehills from turning into mountains and for the most part is successful. But, sometimes even she gets sucked into the daily drama.Fans of the miniseries might be disappointed with the book. Many of the funniest storylines from the series are added. But, the loyalty and friendship the characters display towards each other should endear this book to all but the most jaded reader."},{"Title":"Cranford;: A play from Mrs. Gaskell's novel,","review":"When I finished the last sentence of Cranford, I was so sad. I was so sorry that it was over, that I would not be sharing more time with these wonderful people, especially the dear and familiar Miss Matty. I was moved to laugh and cry over the events of this book, and I will not forget the parts that touched me most. I found the most real and lovely part of the book was when the friends came together when Miss Matty needed them most, and they did this just as real friends do, without mentioning it. I have purchased the mini-series and look forward to watching that, but nothing compares to the days and nights I spent \\"walking\\" the streets of Cranford and sharing an inside knowledge of all that was going on."},{"Title":"Cranford;: A play from Mrs. Gaskell's novel,","review":"This novella has a good deal of charm and real feeling--I don't think you'll soon forget Miss Matty, who is the center of these little stories, even if her older sister was much more forceful in character. The efforts of the ladies of the village--and it is pretty much ladies--to cope with limited incomes, burglars, death, love, tea, cows, servants, and addressing the nobility are both funny and poignant. However much they bicker and contend with each other, when the chips are down, you'll find them (or their handmaidens) at the door with the 19th century equivalent of a casserole. (For one born in New England, these ladies are very reminiscent of much older relatives.)Heartily recommended."},{"Title":"Cranford;: A play from Mrs. Gaskell's novel,","review":"Cranford (Penguin Classics)I bought this book after having seen the Masterpiece production of it. The book is unique in that it is a novel set in the mid 1800s and comes complete with appendices explaining the words and references to people and events used throughout the book.

The three books were\\"Cranford\\", \\"My Lady Ludlow\\" and \\"Mr Harrison's Confessions.\\"Mrs Gaskell stories are considered comedies, and this comes clear in the original texts. Some sadness of course in events, but mostly there is a clear comic, even sardonic voice in which we can fall in love with the characters and still laugh at their foibles, fashions, and foolishness which seem still so apropos today.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Cranford;: A play from Mrs. Gaskell's novel,","review":"Let me begin this review by saying that if you are thinking about reading this book only because of the BBC series, you will find it very disappointing. The makers of that series used the authors name, the title of the book and some of the characters but the remainder of their production is pure invention. I am enjoying watching the BBC program, but it is not this book.Ms Charlotte Mitchell provides an Introduction and Notes for this book. It is my belief that it is essesntial to read the Introduction in order to fully understand Cranford. Elizabeth Gaskell had written a series of stories which appeared at irregular intervals in a magazine edited by Charles Dickens titled Household Words. The stories first appeared together as a novel in 1853. Ms Mitchell uses the Introduction to explain the chronology for the publishing of this and other novels by Elizabeth Gaskell. She also takes this opportunity to explore the question of whether or not Cranford was ever meant to be taken seriously by readers of Ms Gaskell since her other novels are so very different in tone from this one.One of the things I really appreciate which Ms Mitchell did was to include the Notes section to explain words and phrases which appear in the book which were very well understood in the 1800's but which may be unfamiliar to readers today. I read a lot of historical romantic fiction and these Notes gave me concrete explanations for words and phrases I have been too lazy to research for myself. I thought I knew what they meant before, now I know for sure. Items such as:1. gigot - a sleeve style described as leg-of-mutton2. baby-house - a dolls house3. sarsenet - a soft thin silk material4. blind man's holiday - a proverbial term for night or twilightMs Mitchell states in the Introduction that Gaskell later came to regret the fact that she had caused Colonel Brown to be killed in the first story. If he had remained a character longer in the series, I think that Cranford might have gone in a very different direction. As it is, Cranford is the story of a certain class of women, either unmarried or widowed, who live in a small English villiage. The main character is Miss Matty Jenkyns who only comes into prominence after the death of her older sister, Miss Deborah. The women relish their lack of male inhabitants and see themselves as lucky in not having to deal with the ways of men, which they see as uncouth and almost barbaric (they will speak too loud!). There is a very strict social structure among these women, even as to what time of day they can visit each other and what kind of clothes they should be wearing when the visits take place. These rules are in place to keep everyone on an even keel, so that everyone understands the rules, and no one may change the rules without the approval of the most prestigious ranking member of their set.Cranford is a study in contrasts. The differences in the male approach to the world, with their freedoms, and the female approach to the world, with all the restrictions placed upon them. I can honestly say that I had fun reading this book. I grinned, smiled, chuckled and even laughed out loud. No episode was too tiny to cause a complete, unrealistic upheaval among the ladies of Cranford. One of my favorite parts of the story concerns how they all react when rumor and half-truths have them convinced that a gang of thieves and burglars are roaming the countryside. It is funny and heartwarming but also sad to see the lengths they go to in order to protect themselves and their households from these thieves who are, in reality, simply the result of gossip and overactive imaginations. Another part I am particularly fond of is when the main characters allow themselves to unbend to the extent of divulging to their friends what their worst fear is. Miss Matty revealed that she was afraid each night that a man was hiding under her bed. Her method of reassuring herself that no person was there was actually quite astute and surprising for this woman's character. But Cranford is not all warm feelings and quaint happenings. There are real tragedies which effect these women and move their lives into totally different directions.This book is told in the narrative style, something which I usually do not like. There is very little dialogue. The name of the narrator is not even mentioned until page 137. I had read the persons name in the Introduction but I was very surprised to see that this type of presentation did not detract from my enjoyment of the book at all. It is not the most exciting book I have ever read, it is not a very long book, and it does not require much stretching of the readers intellect but I enjoyed all of the time I spent reading it and will certainly read it over and over.Very highly recommended for any reader who enjoys historical fiction. It is not a romance, more a journal of the everyday lives of women who depend on themselves and their friends for comfort and companionship."},{"Title":"Cranford;: A play from Mrs. Gaskell's novel,","review":"This Viking edition includes \\"Mr. Harrison's Confession,\\" \\"Cranford,\\" and \\"My Lady Ludlow,\\" the three novellascombined to produce the Cranford BBC series. The works are quite different from each other, \\"My Lady Ludlow\\" differing the most in tone and style.\\"Mr. Harrison's Confession\\" is the droll account of a young doctor who comes to Dunscombe (a Cranford stand-in) to practice with the much older Mr. Morgan, an old friend of his father's. As young Harrison makes the transition from the lively streets of London to the quaint lanes of the little town to which he has moved, he is involved in many humorous misunderstandings--and especially troublesome are those caused by a prankster friend of his! There are poignant moments too, as Mr. Harrison and the townspeople learn to know each other, and the young doctor finds love.\\"Cranford\\" is the most fully fleshed out of the three novellas, and easily the most readily absorbed by the modern reader. To one who grew up in New England of swamp Yankee parentage, the mindset of the Cranford ladies is completely familiar. Why care about dress when everyone in your town knows what clothes you own, and why care when you are away where no one knows you at all? The various subplots of the story are very reminiscent Sarah Orne Jewett, who wrote a few decades later in the US--\\"The Country of the Pointed Firs,\\" for example. The novel comprises several interlocking stories centering on Miss Matilda Jenkyns, her family and her friends who inhabit the little town of Cransford--a town of Amazons. Very few men live in the village. Though many of the stories are humorous, there are those that touch the heart.\\"My Lady Ludlow\\" is the most old-fashioned of the three novellas--set decades before the others at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and full of sentiment. Lady Ludlow, herself in old age, must learn to change as the world around her does. The story, narrated by a young woman in frail health, from the vantage point of later years, contains a lengthy and melodramatic subplot reminiscent of \\"A Tale of Two Cities.\\"\\"Cranford\\" is a wonderful piece of work, and the other two novellas are very enjoyable. Especially if you liked the BBC series, you'll enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Cranford;: A play from Mrs. Gaskell's novel,","review":"\\"Cranford\\" is likely the best known novel of Victorian author Elizabeth Gaskell. The novel follows the day-to-day social lives of a group of upper-middle-class women in the small, fictional town of Cranford, England. Rather than having a strong narrative, the novel delivers a tableau of social goings on that illuminate the characters and their lives. These stories are told largely through the eyes of a younger lady (Miss Mary Smith) who often visits from a nearby town. The ladies of Cranford are not rich, but wealthy enough to belong to a certain social strata, and much of the comedy derives from their careful considerations of who to include and exclude at various social gatherings. Miss Matty is essentially the main protagonist, and she is a basically kind woman if a bit miserly, especially when it comes to candles. She and her friends typically look to the most prominent member of Cranford female society, Miss Jamieson, and then assiduously follow her lead. Unfortunately, Miss Jamieson is sometimes rather narrow-minded, unlike the other ladies, which creates certain socially awkward situations.This enjoyable novel may seem a bit meandering to some readers, given that there is not a main narrative thread. The novel was originally published in serialized form in \\"Household Words\\" (edited by Charles Dickens), which may partially help explain its lack of a strong plot. Indeed, the 2007 BBC mini-series versions of \\"Cranford\\" included stories from several of Gaskell's other novels. However, the stories here all add up to a devastatingly accurate picture of small town life and the sometimes vicious yet amusing ways in which people in them behave. Gaskell clearly understood human nature, and readers are likely to recognize many truths about human foibles in her stories. I found myself laughing and touched often.Note: This review is for the Kindle version. The text is well-arranged and does not contain any noticeable errors, although there are lots of spaces in between section and subsections (which actually makes reading easier). This version has no extras, such as a biography of Gaskell or an introduction to the text; however, such materials are so easily available on the internet now that this exclusion is not a major debit."},{"Title":"Cranford;: A play from Mrs. Gaskell's novel,","review":"To you scoffers who find this novel uneventful - I say read it again toward the close of your life. The stories of these genteel ladies with their 40 year old lost loves and their strong familial relationships are very moving. I also like the way the book is contructed in a series of vignettes. But most of all I am enchanted with the \\"feel\\" of the portrait of village life in the middle of the 19th century - such a contrast with the mores of today it's hard to believe we are the same species! If you like Mrs. Gaskell, be sure to read Barbara Pym for the 20th century version."},{"Title":"Cranford;: A play from Mrs. Gaskell's novel,","review":"I have just discovered this wonderful author after watching \\"Cranford\\" on Masterpiece Theatre. I ordered several of her titles and I am hooked. I will read everything she has written. As someone who always wished that Jane Austen had written just one more book (or two or five or forty!!!), Elizabeth Gaskell is a real find. Her works are more \\"worldly\\" than the mild Miss Austen, but her characters are just as compelling and I love her."},{"Title":"Cranford;: A play from Mrs. Gaskell's novel,","review":"I read this series of village sketches as an independent study and found that it is most commonly referred to as &quot;charming.&quot; This so called charm is achieved through the humourous realism with which Gaskell depicts the citizens of the small, rural town of Cranford. The women presented are 'old maids' and though genteel, their economic status is far from certain. Perhaps the tender concern Gaskell shows for their welfare, and the friendship demonstrated for a friend in need is most pivotal in creating the charm of the novel. This book has the feel of a 'chick flick': no grand action necessarily, but little episodes of social excitement followed by periods of daily activity. The book provides both comic scenes and tear-jerkers and the method of storytelling could be likened to that of movies such as &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; or &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot;."},{"Title":"Cranford;: A play from Mrs. Gaskell's novel,","review":"Delightful, surely one of the most charming novels ever written. Using the lightest of touches, Mrs. Gaskell pokes fun at the simple people who inhabit the provincial community of Cranford in rural England in the 1840s, a village we are told at the beginning that is curiously \\"in possession of the Amazons\\": its male inhabitants nowhere to be found. Told in the form of reports by a frequent visitor to the village (Mary Smith) from a more cosmopolitan place, we are made privy to the disappointments, hopes, fears, and affronts of a number of the female residents, particularly Miss Matty Jenkyns and Mrs. Jamieson. All are related humorously, some wildly so. My favorite scenes include Mrs. Jamieson's defense of Samuel Johnson over Captain Brown's preference for Dickens's Boz and the sad story of Peter Jenkyns who is insulted by his father and runs away to join the navy. But every chapter offers its delights, and it's easy to see, as Frank Swinnerton mentions in the introduction, how many people at one time knew the book by heart. Long a best seller in the Everyman's Library, it's sad to see the book not included in the recent reissue of 100 of that library's most popular books, a gross oversight for sure."},{"Title":"Cranford;: A play from Mrs. Gaskell's novel,","review":"Sherwood Anderson once described life as a \\"history of moments\\". Miss Gaskell has created in Cranford a glimpse into a dying culture of the more egalitiarian rural Bitish Yoemanry of the 18th century collapsing under the urbanization of the society and with a more repressive capitalism to claim the lives and souls of the youth leaving the village for better lives. Goldsmith's the \\"Deserted Village\\" comes to mind.The story is told from the lives of elderly mostly female, spinster as well as widowed community of genteel rural poverty- self imposed and otherwise. Quaint yet, but with vinegary pithiness of death, stoicism and social veneer, in other words real life. This is civilized 19th century social writing at its best, like a journalistic Austen. The narrator is a wise insightful character commenting on the eccentric and slightly mad village women who make up this world. The rivalry between Captain Brown and Miss Jenkyns based upon their literary preference of Dr. Johnson vs Charles Dickens is especially amusing considering that Cranford first appeared in Dicken's magazine, \\"Household Words\\". Endearing and haunting- much more than its surface appearance."},{"Title":"Cranford;: A play from Mrs. Gaskell's novel,","review":"Reading \\"Cranford\\" is a lot like spending an afternoon in the doily museum of a provincial city; you can't help but admire the skill of the embroidery but you have to wonder at your own sanity for being there. I stuffed the book in my carry-on, as a relief from the 20th C anguish in the novels I'd been reading recently, and found myself waiting out a snow delay with nothing to read but this staid portrayal of a circle of spinsters nourished chiefly by their own proprieties. Cranford is not a novel at all, but rather a series of nostalgic sketches of the old-fashioned manners and quaint habits of genteel but impoverished provincial ladies, gently satirical, a porcelain cup counterpart to Charles Dickens's \\"Pickwick Papers\\". Dickens is explicitly mentioned in several chapters of Cranford; Miss Dorothy Jenkyns, the most literary of the Cranford ladies, finds him vulgar and less eloquent in every way than Dr. Johnson.Elizabeth Gaskell and Charles Dickens were quite well acquainted with each other's work; in fact \\"Cranford\\" was first published in serial form in one of Dickens's magazines. There are many parallels, particularly between Dickens's \\"Hard Times\\" and Gaskell's \\"North and South\\". Both books focus on the dire conditions of labor in 19th C England; both can be considered liberal protest novels. I suppose Gaskell is never as knee-slapping funny as Dickens can be, but she has other virtues, closer to Trollope, in terms of cogent story-telling and sympathetic insight into characters of all classes and both genders.Gaskell was totally 'out of fashion' when I went to college. The luminaries of Victorian literature, as taught at Harvard in the 1960s, were Eliot, Austen, and the Brontes, with Dickens and Thackeray cast as their knaves and Trollope as their butler. But Gaskell has made a comeback. Aside from \\"North and South\\", her novels \\"Ruth\\", \\"Sylvia's Lovers\\", \\"Wives and Daughters,\\" and others are in print and well worth reading. As her titles suggest, her feminism was more overt than that of her peers, and her sympathies were clearly 'liberal' in the current American political sense. Above all, she could tell a good story.Cranford was immensely popular in its time, when perhaps most readers had their own maiden aunts to caricature. It's quite well done in its way, but if you've never read Gaskell before, I wouldn't suggest starting with it. You might find it challenging to sit quietly with the ladies as they crochet and dither over their bonnets."},{"Title":"Cranford;: A play from Mrs. Gaskell's novel,","review":"Cranford the book isn't the same as Cranford the BBC series--after all, the BBC series was based on three novellas by Elizabeth Gaskell, not just this one--but for me the book fills in details and answers questions I wished the TV show had time to go into. Among the particulars that reading Cranford the book put my mind at ease about are why Miss Mattie's brother Peter never wrote or returned home and how Martha and her beau end up married and living with Miss Mattie. Also, after watching the TV series it was a treat to have a little more time to spend with the wonderful women of Cranford in their book forms."},{"Title":"Cranford;: A play from Mrs. Gaskell's novel,","review":"As with all of the other Gaskell books I've read, this was extremely well-written and a pleasure to get lost in the time and place. It did not truly grab my interest on an emotional level until the end because the story itself was not that strong, but how interesting could it be when it revolved around the lives of a bunch of spinsters? I did enjoy reading about the mindset of that group of women and as I had known already, their focus on the trivial. But wouldn't life be great if that was all that one had to worry about. And that's the feeling I had about Cranford itself.There was a good amount of humour and some human interest lessons that proved valuable and thought provoking. The spinster character type is often portrayed in a minor or negative way and it was nice to see them in a harmless, charming light."},{"Title":"Cranford;: A play from Mrs. Gaskell's novel,","review":"Cranford is one of the better-known novels of the 19th century English writer Elizabeth Gaskell. It was first published in 1851 as a serial in the magazine Household Words, which was edited by Charles Dickens. The fictional town of Cranford is closely modelled on Knutsford in Cheshire, which Mrs. Gaskell knew well. The book has little in the way of plot and is more a series of episodes in the lives of Mary Smith and her friends, Miss Matty and Miss Deborah, two spinster sisters.But what is it about Cranford and its deceptively simple tales of country life that makes the work so appealing? It has been aptly described as \`a piece of exquisite social painting' ... \`tender' and \`delicate.' Narrated by Mary Smith, a friend of Miss Matty and frequent visitor to Cranford, the lives, loves, tragedies, and triumphs of the inhabitants of Cranford are woven together seamlessly to create a tapestry portraying timeless emotions and choices.The petty social bickering, cold shouldering and jockeying for importance in the village's pecking order are outlined in a humorous yet pointed way--the author loves her characters, with all their faults, and is tolerant of their foibles while holding them up to gentle ridicule. In every community there is an arbiter of good taste, a setter of trends, a leader of public opinion, and all the other social whimsies that make up this colourful collection of characters. It is not easy to keep secrets in this closed environment, and as Mary Smith remarks, \\"It was impossible to live a month at Cranford, and not know the daily habits of each resident ....\\" Despite the squabbles and occasional \`no speaks,' the ladies of Cranford would rather die than see one of their own fall by the wayside. It is the community spirit that inspires Miss Matty's friends to decide to donate a portion of their annual income to sustain their beloved friend when an investment goes sour.As a different kind of history book and one that very possibly the author did not set out to write as such, Cranford is actually an analysis of an early Victorian country town. The inhabitants are shaken and disturbed by inevitable changes such as industrialization, the advent of the railway and other events that force an inescapable transition into an increasingly modern world.The appeal of Cranford cannot be better described than in the popularity of the BBC drama series. The teleplay by Heidi Thomas was adapted from three novellas by Elizabeth Gaskell published between 1849 and 1858: Cranford, My Lady Ludlow, and Mr. Harrison's Confessions. (The Last Generation in England was also used as a source.)A gentle, charming read, Cranford has much more to offer the discerning reader than a unassuming look at country life."},{"Title":"Cranford;: A play from Mrs. Gaskell's novel,","review":"This was a birthday gift for my younger granddaughter.

They have small private incomes (Matty has 127 pounds a year and a pound contained a third of an ounce of gold - a new silk dress costs five pounds) and observe lives constrained by etiquette and class distinction. It has been praised for its &quot;gentle&quot; humor (although I was chilled by the &quot;Irish beggarwoman&quot; saying her children were starving who gets the door shut in her face). I think you have to have a certain interest in how life was lived in 1850 to read it through. In this edition, with the explanatory note it is mine of information on domestic arrangements. The narrator often points out how old-fashioned these ladies are and what fasions are new and draws comparisons going back over fifty years. This adds an extra dimension. The train has arrived but sedan chairs are still used. Some of the explanatory notes are written in British English that needs more explanation to Americans. The introduction by Charlotte Mitchell says a lot more about the place of this book in feminist history. Basically it is something you'd read for historical interest rather than immediate entertainment.

I wish Penguin would release more books in such high quality editions.I'd never read any of Gaskell's work before, so Cranford was a pleasant surprise. It's a lively and warm-hearted novel which will appeal to fans of Garrison Keillor and Alexander McCall Smith.Another reviewer described Cranford as \\"not a novel at all, but rather a series of nostalgic sketches.\\" Certainly Cranford is nostalgic, perhaps even sentimental, but it's more than a series of sketches. I would go so far as to say that Cranford demonstrates a remarkable tightness of plot and character development, though Gaskell works with such a light touch (and elliptical style) that I can see how it would be easy to overlook the unity of the whole novel. If you read Cranford as a collection of anecdotes, I encourage you to ask yourself which parts could be removed without undermining the book."},{"Title":"Cranford;: A play from Mrs. Gaskell's novel,","review":"In the last few years or so, I've been noting a resurgence of a writer who was very popular in nineteenth century England. Not quite as famous as Charles Dickens or Anthony Trollope, Elizabeth Gaskell did find a niche writing about everyday people in the small towns and villages that dotted England's landscape.Cranford is a slim collection of vignettes. Each little story explores a person, a gathering, or an incident in the past or present. Some are humourous, others are very poignant, and some just look at the life and manners of the time. In specific, to one particular group in the village.For Cranford, as we are told in the opening sentence, is a place that is governed by Amazons. The Amazons are a group of elderly spinsters or widows who have fallen into genteel poverty, supported by meager savings left from legacies and inheritances. As a group, they inhabit nearly all of the homes of Cranford, deciding on questions of taste and morality, the correct behavior of servants, managing gardens, discretion in clothing and so forth. And where are the men, you might ask? Nearly all of them have fled, it seems -- to the military, to the navy, to the nearby city of Dumble (a stand-in for Manchester), frightened off, no doubt, by the formidable array of feminity before them.As the 'leaders,' there are the two daughters of the former vicar of the town. Miss Jenkyns and her younger sister Miss Matty, have risen to a level of respectability in the community, leading their little bevy of companion in acts of charity, mourning, welcoming (and shunning) strangers, and even to such details as what is to be considered suitable literature. When we first meet them, the town has been sent into turmoil by the arrival of a retired military man with two daughters -- and he has the temerity to actually suggest books to Miss Jenkyns. Horrors!But there is more to the story, and as the nameless narrator leads us through the various members of the village, there are stories that are humourous, such as when a string of burglaries occurs, or when a traveling magician arrives. Other stories are very poignant, such as Miss Matty and a collection of old letters, or when a bank in Dumble defaults and one person's savings are wiped out.What makes this collection stand out is the level of compassion between the various women as their little world is shaken up by the encroaching Industrial Age, and their somewhat stubborn intent on keeping their village just the way it is. And underneath some of the bristly exteriors, there are acts of selflessness and care that they extend to each other. This and the humour that the author brought to each story, was what made the book for me.I really don't want to reveal much more of the book as not to spoil it for anyone. The collection itself is rather slim, just sixteen stories of about twenty pages long. Along with the stories, there are extensive notes that have been added by Patricia Ingham, which really do help to understand the terms and usage of the language, and help to clear up some very unfamiliar terms.All in all, a very enjoyable read that is much lighter in tone than most Victorian fiction. Great fun to read, and to sigh over as well.Four stars. Recommended."},{"Title":"Cranford;: A play from Mrs. Gaskell's novel,","review":"This is a really good edition of the book. If you by classic literature you know that some editions are better than others, this is a very good version of the The Cranford Chronicles. This volume houses Mr. Harrison's Confessions(86 pages), Cranford (188 pages), My Lady Ludlow (203 pages).The type is not ridiculously small it's pretty average, this is a very readable version of the Cranford Chronicles. The story of the town of Cranford and it's inhabitants, the comings and goings, the slow and steady development of the women of Cranford and their coming together."},{"Title":"Cranford;: A play from Mrs. Gaskell's novel,","review":"Not a novel, not an anthology of short stories, Cranford is perhaps best described as a cohesive series of vignettes. Recounted by a young woman of about 30 from the city of Drumble [Manchester], these stories depict family, friendship, and love lost and found in a village dominated by poor but genteel spinsters and widows. \\". . . all the holders of houses, above a certain rent, are women.\\" Small, rural, and elitist in its way, Cranford is a place out of time, where faded fashions and proprieties still matter.Gaskell begins Cranford with a series of descriptive statements. Some are accurate, while others prove to be ironic. For example, \\"Although the ladies of Cranford know all each other's proceedings, they are exceedingly indifferent to each other's opinions.\\" While discovering Cranford and the Amazons who possess it, we also learn the dry perspective and voice of the narrator, who clearly loves the village while gently highlighting the foibles of its female inhabitants. \\"But I will answer for it, the last gigot, the last tight and scanty petticoat in wear in England, was seen in Cranford--and seen without a smile.\\"Like Gaskell's Wives and Daughters, Cranford is focused on gender roles and the different lives of women and men. The sexes share many characteristics; Captain Brown and Peter Jenkyns display the thoughtful, neighborly solicitude associated with women (with Peter going so far as to don a woman's dress), while Miss Jenkyns (the woman Peter impersonates) exhibits a manly will and resolution. It is the opportunities they have and the way in which they live that separates the sexes. Captain Brown, Peter, and Signor Brunoni have traveled and seen some of the world, and have even influenced it, while Miss Jenkyns, Miss Matty, Miss Price, the narrator, and their friends are constrained by their gender, gentility, and social code to hearth and home. Here, they perform their small household tasks, including ensuring that their maidservants are not disturbed or distracted by \\"followers,\\" or interested young men. The social code that prevents any of them from working in \\"trade\\" also determines the hours that can be spent outside the home. \\"Then there were rules and regulations for visiting and calls . . . 'from twelve to three are our calling-hours.'\\"In such a small, interconnected village, everything that happens is noteworthy, and every decision is important if the occasionally cruel social order is to be maintained. \\"The whole town knew and kindly regarded Miss Betty Barker's Alderney,\\" whose fall into a lime-pit warrants Captain Brown's advice, \\"Get her a flannel waistcoat and flannel drawers . . .,\\" so the narrator can ask the reader incredulously, \\"Do you ever seen cows dressed in grey flannel in London?\\" Miss Matty's decision not to marry against her family's wishes keeps the peace at great personal cost, and her wistful decision to allow Martha to have a follower recompenses her later when the outside world intrudes into her realm with its ugly realities--one of the many signs that Cranford must and will change. When Lady Glenmire renounces her title and takes the name of Mrs. Hoggins upon her remarriage, Cranford reels with shock and dismay, and it takes Peter Jenkyns, and his broader perspective from India, to reconcile the village and its de facto leader, Mrs. Jamieson, with the new ways.The narrator, who divides her time between her father in the progressive world of Drumble and the slowly and reluctantly changing Cranford, finds herself under the village's influence. As an observer, she describes the complex set of rules that governs Cranford society and the social slights they necessitate, not without a sense of regret. She is aware of the absurdity of Cranford society's beliefs and behavior combined with expediency, such as the occasion of Miss Betty Barker's party for the Cranford elite. \\"'Oh, gentility!' thought I, 'can you endure this last shock?'\\" when \\"all sorts of good things for supper\\" appear. \\". . . we thought it better to submit graciously, even at the cost of our gentility--which never ate suppers in general--but which, like most non-supper-eaters, was particularly hungry on all special occasions.\\" More seriously, she pities Miss Matty and her lost love and life, and like her other well-meaning friends determines that she shall be happy.With the arrival of Signor Brunoni and the ensuing panic over the perceived crime wave that seems to hit Cranford, the narrator loses some of her wryness and seems to become nearly as frightened by the rumors of strangers and robberies as her elderly friends. It is the new outsider, Lady Glenmire, who \\"never had heard of any actual robberies; except that two little boys had stolen some apples from Farmer Benson's orchard and that some eggs had been missed on a market-day off Widow Hayward's stall.\\" Even while caught up in the panic, however, \\"I could not help being amused at Jenny's position . . ..\\" When she speaks of Jenny's ghost, the narrator says, \\". . . for there was no knowing how near the ghostly head and ears might be . . ..\\"Through the narrator, who seems to represent Gaskell's own perspective, Cranford pokes gentle fun at a time and place that had already become a fairy tale-like setting, where goodness outdoes pettiness, justice prevails over setbacks and hardships, and even the prodigal son (or prince) can return to set things right. In Cranford, Gaskell reminds the reader of a recent past that is both amusing and moving, a time to look upon fondly but without regret for the changes that Peter and the marriage of Lady Glenmire/Mrs. Hoggins bring about. The one constant in life is change, and in Cranford change is at least as much for the better as for the worse."},{"Title":"Cranford;: A play from Mrs. Gaskell's novel,","review":"Elizabeth Gaskell's Wives & Daughters and North & South have recently become two of my favorite books, so it stood to reason that I should check out her other novels. When I read Cranford I already knew that it wouldn't have a coherent plot, so I wasn't disappointed about that. What I found was a short but slow read made charming because of Gaskell's humor and elegant style of writing.Plotwise, it reminded me of L.M. Montgomery's stories, because Montgomery usually features young girls being brought up by dominant spinsters in small towns. Cranford doesn't include children of any variety, but similar quirks of aging ladies and domestic life are depicted. Of course, Gaskell's writing is not quite as saccharine as Montgomery's.Men are so rare in this novel that they are great curiosities, to the main characters and to the reader. My only complaint is that the narrator (I think her name was Mary Smith) did not talk more about herself. Was she destined to grow old without love just like her friend Miss Mattie?This isn't a book I would read more than once or twice. I can't imagine that I would have enjoyed as much if I hadn't already been obsessed with the author."},{"Title":"Cranford;: A play from Mrs. Gaskell's novel,","review":"Not really a novel, but more of a series of stories of the narrators recalling of her time spent in the fictional Cranford. Quite funny in parts (\\"When it was ended, she turned to me, and said with mild dignity, 'Fetch me \\"Rasselas,\\" my dear , out of the book-room.\\" You know things are going to heat up when someone is going to go and get the Dr.). Once upon a time writers used to have love for their characters they created, which I believe is why so little of fiction from the last 50-100 years or more appeals to me.Unfortunately, the Introduction is a horror of modern criticism bugaboo gone wild. I'm remined of Kerouac's saying \\"I have the critics explaing me to me.\\" This is the sort of intro that trots out the writers (and what about the practise of putting the editor, the person who does the introduction, and the likes, NAME on the cover, inside and everywhere else, as large as the Authors? Its quite funny to look up a writer on Amazon and see someone elses name tagged along, as if Dante and Homer and the rest had a helper writer we didn't know about!) pet peeves and overly biased views: \\"In his healthy appetite for food ('the peas were going wholesale into his capacious mouth,' p. 33) we see an image of sexual appetite, unhampered by social shibboleths.\\" We do? Maybe you do, but I don't. It's amazing how many writers attribute their loony views to poor writers who, in all probability, meant no such thing (Freud, Fraud, Freud...). And they can't refute such nonsense and drivel, most being dead (and being dead being beyond refutation)."},{"Title":"Cranford;: A play from Mrs. Gaskell's novel,","review":"These little stories are about life and love in the mid-nineteenth century.

The book is about four old ladies and the life they lead. Mrs. Gaskell's characterizations are wonderful. Their lives consist of tea, cards and gossip. This is a book about ladies.

At the center of the novel is a circle of spinster and widowed females who wrestle mightily with the challenges of lives of genteel poverty. On its surface, \\"Cranford\\" is a comedy of manners, but its episodes have surprising and often moving depth.\\"Cranford\\" was originally published as a series of short stories, all narrated by Miss Mary Smith, a frequent visitor to the village and the young friend of its leading spinster ladies Miss Deborah and Miss Matty Jenkyns. The chapters are therefore not quite chronological in the telling; characters overlap but plot lines appear, disappear, and sometimes reappear.The narrative works through the relationships of the circle of women, as they deal with births and deaths, marriages, questions of fashion and manners, and such mundane events as a traveling magic show and a bank failure. Men are suffered to live in Cranford, but it seems that it is the women who actually arrange everything important in the village. The reader cannot help but be drawn into their lives through Gaskell's authentic dialogue and superb sense of place.\\"Cranford\\" was the basis for a Masterpiece Theater mini-series in the Spring of 2008, and is well worth reading on its own for its sympathetic portrait of a lifestyle now a distant memory.

Take one of those wonderful, wonderful novels, delete all the men, all the romance, and all the passionate class critique, and that leaves CRANFORD.All I can say is, this novel is like Barbara Pym's QUARTET IN AUTUMN or her EXCELLENT WOMEN, only more so. More old ladies, more \\"spasms and flutterings\\" of old ladies (to borrow from Andrew Davies' P&P; screenplay), more petty snobberies and antimacassars.A plot of some sort does rear its head at about 75%, but don't look for one before then.

A charming tale of leisurely--but never idle--life in the era, the author's cunning wit and ladylike charm adorn every page. In the oddly Amazonian town of Cranford, all the men have gone off to seek their fortunes in nearby indutry or simply never were born; the ladies of Cranford, then, occupy their time with ever-modest hostessing, challenging games of Preference, and demure speculation on the comings and goings of the penny-ante gentry that breeze through their midst. The copy I read offered a quote from Mrs. Gaskell, saying that she herself often read _Cranford_ when feeling ill or sad, as it was good for cheering her flagging spirits. Any modern reader would, no doubt, reap the same mirthful benefits."},{"Title":"Cranford;: A play from Mrs. Gaskell's novel,","review":"Orginally published in Charles Dickens' magazine Household Words, _Cranford_is in fact a collection of stories about the people (mostly women)'s lives in a city called Cranford in the 19th century. It is said to be Mrs. Gaskell's most popular book, and the only book that Mrs. Gaskell herself would want to re-read again. This book is indeed full of funny, ridiculous and heartwarming stories about some old-fashioned but really friendly and kind-hearted women (mostly old maids or widows) living in this little town called Cranford. I think Mrs. Gaskell did a good job in bring up themes like the confrontation of the old and new world, the comparsion between the life in an industrial city like Drumble (believed to be based on Manchester) and the little tranquil town Cranford.

Other times the same effect can be achieved by a slow novel about middle-aged women and their daily troubles.Pettiness and kindness, age and genders, nobles and lowborn, progress and tradition, all come together and weave the tapestry of rural middle England of the 1840's.RECOMMENDED!"},{"Title":"Cranford;: A play from Mrs. Gaskell's novel,","review":"I would like to begin by saying that this book is very little like the PBS production that is being aired on TV right now. There are many characters that make their way into the miniseries, but many that the producers seem to have borrowed from other Gaskell novels. However, though the producers do not stick to the plot of the book, I feel they have captured the spirit of Cranford.If anyone were to ask me what this book is about, I am not quite sure what to tell them. In essence, it is a book about nothing in particular and everything meaningful in general. The key characters are elderly ladies who, like prim Amazons in middle-aged caps, look after each other and those around them. The adventures in this story are so mild, yet taken so seriously by the characters, that I was myself as excited as they were to learn that a magician had come to Cranford, or that the new fashions had arrived, or that a Lady was to marry someone quite beneath her. The most moving part of the whole story is Miss Matti's past love, a love that she sacrificed for the sake of her family. Her stories brought many tears to my eyes.Overall, I am so impressed with how such a simple story could be so altogether moving, and, quite unexpectedly, very fast paced.

But it is also a quick, somewhat easy read, adjectives that don't usually come to mind when describing works of this era.This is a book about women, a point that Gaskell makes clear in the first line:\\"In the first place, Cranford is in possession of the Amazons; all the holders of houses above a certain rent are women.\\"And while the middle-aged spinsters of Cranford are a far cry from the women warriors who came to the assistance of the Greeks at Troy, the stereotypical rich, handsome man who comes to marry the woman in distress and therefore saves the day is absent from this story.Told through the eyes of Mary Smith, the two main characters of the novel, Miss Deborah Jenkyns and her sister Matty, put me very much in the mind of the Miss Brownings in Gaskell's final novel, Wives and Daughters. The foibles and misadventures of these two sisters and their circle of friends often had me laughing out loud.This is a delightful book. Written at a time when a woman's worth was often tied to how well she married, the gently humorous but dignified way in which Gaskell treats her characters in this novel is lovely."},{"Title":"Cranford;: A play from Mrs. Gaskell's novel,","review":"A delightful portrait of a somnolent English village in mid-nineteenth century Midlands, striving to shut out the noisy industrializing forces changing the world as they knew it. Vivid portraits of the largely single women--spinsters or widows--who dominate the social life of the town and their struggles to control who gets invited to tea parties etc and who doesn't, their criticisms of who doesn't observe the proprieties, and their underlying good-heartedness. In other words, Gaskell observes the manners and the people of this world with great insight and wit, not just looking at struggles to define etiquette but also at the last vestiges of a peaceful rural place and the changes being thrust upon its classes--working, middle, and nobility."},{"Title":"Cranford;: A play from Mrs. Gaskell's novel,","review":"A very quick review. A beautifully written book filled with the feminine niceties and social customs of provincial early 19th Century life. A very interesting read to myself as I was born at Cranford Lodge, Knutsford, the true market town in the north of England that Gaskell based her novel on. A visit to Knutsford itself brings out the flavour of the writing and tours of \\"Cranford\\" including Miss Matty's house and the Assembly Rooms at the George can be arranged through the Gaskell Society!"},{"Title":"Cranford;: A play from Mrs. Gaskell's novel,","review":"A sweet, gentle story of a small English town not unlike Jan Karon's Mitford, only 150 years ago. No high drama- only caring people with all their flaws. I read it years ago and remembered it fondly. Reading it again recently, I was not disappointed. Don't miss this little jewel."},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"This book is a must read! The Heisman nudge had me laughing for days.The book is very easy to read and very hard to put down.GREAT JOB!"},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"These authors are very creative. At some points in the book, I was laughing out loud. Very entertaining.....provides good information without the typical Dr. Phil approach."},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"Never has a book been so entertaining and educational at the same time. My only regret is that it isn't longer.....Can't wait for the sequel and the sure to follow, movie treatment."},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"Ah, if I only read The Sauce when I was 16. This book flat out gets it! It doesn't waste anytime as it gets right to business in chapter one with \\"Why women date bad seeds\\" showing bad seed 4 as a shaved headed, loser in a wifebeater t-shirt. I use chapter one as a reference in conversation after conversation. We have all seen the hottie with the dirt bag bad seed, ugh. The book gets better and better and peaks in chapter 8, a truncated version of the karma sutra. Love the old DSHPAS, good work gentlemen, GOOOOOD WORK !! Can't wait for the sequal, and the movie!"},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"Compelling and funny read on understanding the female psyche and how an ordinary man can apply the \\"Sauce\\" techniques to winning a woman over in a disciplined and novel approach. What a riot - material really hits home with both men and womem alike!"},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"The Sauce rocks. If you are looking for a funny, fun and practical anaysis of success with women, this is it. The Sauce is both attitude and skills which guarantee you to score. It is not a \\"how to\\" book, but rather a philosophy. If you understand and adopt the sauce, you're sure to get it wet. It's not about being there for them, it's about understanding and doing them. Better to know the enemy (target) and understand the game, than to get played. The Sauce rocks. Adopt it, love it, use it, score big."},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"After reading this enticing and intriguing book I knew the problems with my plan - I was too nice a guy and needed to start in the basement rather than on the top floor... Taguchis theory really inspired me and the way the authors tied some pretty intense math theories into the dating world was awesome!But dont worry folks! It isnt a math book it is a mans \\"MUST HAVE\\" book for getting the hotchicks time and time again...Excellent work to the Bob's.Looking forward to the next one!"},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"A humorous explanation on how to woo the ladies told in the way only an engineering geek turn player can. This one can be appreciated by Good Seeds who wonder why they have no luck with women and Bad Seeds who wonder why they do.

LOL!Anyway you slice it you'll not only learn something from this book but laugh while doing it.A great book with a well written light hearted approach to dating and meeting women. Money well spent!!"},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"I am reading this book for the third time and still finding analyses that fit. It is easy reading because it's very funny, but also because it finds a way to address my own experiences. No other book explains the mystifying world of relationships quite as well."},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"This is a hilarious book. And there is high confidence that there is a high probability \\"the authors\\" are right! Behavioral science is a statistical discipline and this is the case study of most interest to most humans. Highly recommended reading for technodweebs!"},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"After having read \\"The Sauce\\" I was in stitches. As a woman I can certainly identify with the idea that women like to change men. The authors surely have got this one figured out. Be a jerk first yet witty enough so the next time you see her she sees you are nicer and changing. It is reverse psychology at its best. If you and your friends are hanging out and looking fo some laughs, open the book up to any page and you'll have the entire gang rolling on the floor!!! It's time to get saucy!"},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"Great first book by this author who gives us some new insights on the dynamics behind attraction and dating."},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"This book is really funny as the authors refer to many mathematical theories to explain the dating scene and it is a riot. Definitely not a book to pass up, I laughed the whole time! As the definite outliar woman from the ones described in this book, I still enjoyed reading the theories on why girls choose Bad Seed Bob and how Good Seed Bob can get in there."},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"The Sauce is an insightful and extremely funny book. It's acutely witty and smart - yet has an aggressive and daring agenda. Their dating premise is right on. I think the old idea of men never \`getting' women, has possibly been trashed by Bad Seed and Good Seed Bob. Ladies, I think they're on to us! This is an interesting strategic guide book for guys who could use some help in the land of dating, and a laugh your ass off book for the ladies who realize that guys actually need a book like this. A sense of humor is definitely required!"},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"The Sauce is an irreverent look at dating, seemingly superficial but based on deeper rhythms of interpersonal attraction - what approach will get a guy noticed? While the premise that women prefer the \\"Bad Seed\\" at the beginning of a relationship may seem like simple misogyny, it actually speaks to some women's preference for (and some men's need to be) a strong, confident, and assertive predator. Evolutionary psychologists will love it, and thoughtful individuals can use the calculus to clarify their own approach to the hunt."},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"This book is hilarious! It reads like a Sex in the City episode. As a professional I was delighted by the innovative use of slang. What a refresing break from professional journals."},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"Fast & Ez...reading that is.Hard to believe that most of us gals have dated each of the bad seeds.Surprized to find all the truths sauteed in humor. Enjoy this quick read, waiting for the sequel."},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"Funny, and accurate.

The ladies will be amused that there is a need for the Sauce."},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"Funny, thoughful and, most importantly, accurate. These guys know what they're talking about! This book will keep you laughing and thinking with each turn of the page. The writers also win points for brevity. Looking forward to the next one."},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"The Sauce can be described as a marriage between engineering and pop-psychology: Engineering + Pop-psychology = The Sauce. This quick read about dating provides a \\"how to guide\\" for men and personal insights for women. The authors-Good and Bad Seed Bob-describe an interesting and witty view of dating. Men, self-proclaimed studs and social half-wits alike, can learn to be more knowledgeable about the women they encounter, and importantly, how to manage women's expectations for personal benefit. The Sauce is full of interesting and sometimes shocking tools for conversation and behavior. For example, men, can you imagine discussing the Heisman Trophy and hair pulling in the same conversation with a woman? Moreover, can you imagine this conversation actually being stimulating and productive such that the woman actually becomes more engaged, rather than heading for the door or back to discussing cosmetics and manicures with her female friends. Also, for men, have you ever wondered why your loser friend consistently scores the hot chicks, while you end up being the coat rack? Or, get this book and learn how to link soy to a discussion of sex, and I'm not talking about a tofu orgy. As for women, they can use this as a self-diagnosis, that is, why they are attracted to \\"bad\\" men? Besides entertaining, this book is practical, has a flare of sophistication, and good fodder for a future movie!"},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"This is the one year anniversary to my witnessing \\"The Sauce\\" in action, so I figured I'd write to tell you of my experience. I had the rare experience of watching the Master Bad Seed Bob execute The Sauce with precision and accuracy before reading the book.To be honest, I was a bad a seed. But seeing \\"The Sauce\\" in action solidified my entire dating experience in just one night. The bar and people we met that night, may never be the same. At one point, I was actually taken back by some of Bad Seed Bob's comments to the women were talking to, but they kept coming back for more. It was fun, amazing and effective.The next day, I read \\"The Sauce\\" I then understood the cause and effect that I witnessed the night before. The techniques were well describe and documented in the book. I found the book highly entertaining, factual as well as pushing the envelope of acceptable male behavior. But we are guys and that's what are expected to do, well at least the bad seeds.I'm now married with 3 kids, 2 early teen age girls and a young boy. I am torn on what to do with the resource. Do I give it to my girls to give them the warning on the operational tactics of the professional bad seed Bobs that they will encounter when they get to college and beyond? Or save it for my son, to give him the playbook to success? Perhaps both!This book is a must read for any Bad Seed Bob (or wannabes) to hone his skills, I would also recommend it for the ladies so that they can get a rare glimpse of the brain of a young bad seeds they will meet.The Sauce would make a very good, interesting and informative movie; my vote would be to have the author Bad Seed Bob play his lead role. I don't think it would be made for TV movie!"},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"You know, before reading this book, the way most single women behaved with regard to dating/sex confused the hell out of me. It just didn't make sense when I saw a woman blow off nice, intelligent, successful guys and gravitate towards nothing but arrogant jerks. This book outlines some pretty compelling theories about why many women behave this way. After you've read this book, you've got some level of understanding about what goes on in a woman's head. So you've got that going for you...As if that wasn't enough, these guys tell you how to use that type of behavior to your advantage when you decide you want to bed one of these women. And then they give you some nifty pointers to use in the sack once you get there. I'm sure for a nominal fee, they'd even come out to your local bar and act as your wing man, but you shouldn't need that much help. This book's all you need."},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"I originally thought that the book would be funny and not truly be serious about the dynamics of male and female dating. Was I surprised! The book is not only funny, but insightful and unpretentious. This is the definitive book for understanding the mysteries of dating. The only other work I'm remotely familiar with that broaches the subject is the independent film, \\"The Tao of Steve\\" which has a surprise ending unlike \\"The Sauce.\\" I can't wait for \\"The Sauce II\\" when Bad Seed Bob discusses the dynamics of marriage."},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"Best \\"how to\\" book ever. Borrowed this from my friend and tried it out that night in the bars. First night all I got was \\"like you are so rude\\"s. Did the same thing the next weekend and played the chapter 9 and 10 gig verbatim, complete with the line, \\"what was your name again?\\" Got some more \\"you are such an idiot\\" that night but felt the change coming on slowly. Finally, watching out for TSDZ I waited several weeks before going back into battle. Well, that was last weekend and this time, I bumped into some of the same people. This time, I was bad seed -3x and got lines like..\\"hey, why were you such an butthead to me several weeks ago, you are not that bad afterall\\". Key message, I was a playa this last weekend and owe it all to that little green book...The Sauce."},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"The Sauce is an incredibly sophisticated analysis of dating and mating behaviors; don't be thrown off by the humorous drawings and the irreverant humor throughout! The authors have truly done their research (and I'm sure had a great time doing it). Their use of mathematical analogies to explain the complex interactions involved in human behavior is both funny and interesting. I actually laughed out loud while reading this thought-provoking analysis of dating behavior. As a psychologist, I appreciate the incredibly intelligent way that the authors have summarized what we know to be true from various social psychology experiments on human interaction (all the while laughing my ass off). The Sauce is a quick read that is not to be dismissed!"},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"Ok - so I never realized I wanted to change my bad seed Bob to a good seed! This book is filled with little insights on what we do as women when we want to get a man and what we do once we get them - things we never realized. It's also nice that they get the word out on the Hair Pull - it's about time!! We know we love it! Excellent book, insighful, entertaining, and it will make you laugh and roll your eyes occasionally. It wouldn't be \\"saucy\\" if it didn't."},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"As an engineer myself I could really identify with the analogies. Funny as he//. If you like your advice sauteed in humor, mixed liberally with satire and sprinkled with some math, you'll love this book. I liked the rate of change advice too, it definitely provided some insight and understanding I was previously lacking. Buy it, read it, live it, you'll be lovin' it."},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"Bad Seed Bob's are everywhere and, yes, it is true...if they can implement what appears to be change, they rise to the top.This short, sweet guidebook on relationships is a must for every Good Seed Bob that wishes to experience success.I thoroughly enjoyed this well-written, easy read. (Yup, even the math!)"},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"Step over Dr. Phil.... this is a book that can really help your relationships. This book will be on the Oprah Book List by the end of the year. I could not put it down. An intellectual review of an emotional topic!"},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"Chapter 7 on the PLF is right on the mark. Too darn funny to apply Fizicks to dating!!! Even holds true in current dull lifeless relationships. This book was sweet. Despite all the humor, I can see practical application for sure....in dating and established relationships alike. A very entertaining read and a handbook I'll keep on the shelf for future reference!"},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"The creativity of a couple of enginerds realistically explains why Good Bobs of the world usually finish last when it comes to courting women. Hide Bad Seed Bob on an isolated island and leave him to crunch numerical analysis equations! These guys pretty much hit the nail on the head w/ this fun read! Read it and share it for a good office chuckle!"},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"The Sauce is how most books should be written. Short, concise, and to the point with just enough of a twist of humor and literary flair for the reader to enjoy the learning experience. The information is also dead on accurate as far as my experience has been. The Sauce provides the information you need to understanding women. The hard and fun part will be putting what you've learned into action. Buy the Sauce and happy dating!"},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"Like many of my engineering peers, this book warms the cockles of my heart. It makes me remember why I am glad that I took a lot of math during school. If only I would have had this kind of technical information in my earlier years. This book has to rate up there with \\"Everything you ever wanted to know about sex\\"...Wow!!! Numerous fun topics are explored. I particularly liked the sections on the DSASHP (doggy style, ___-spank, hair pull) and the value of setting an ultra-low first impression. Ride-em Bad Seed Bob..."},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"This book is hilarious!! As other readers claimed, I too actually laughed OUT LOUD. I am so glad that this book wasn't around when I was in High School or College- I wouldn't want the boys to use statistics or probability with me :) I think it's funny that men think they have us women figured out... sorry to say this but there is sooooo much about us that you have no clue about. Still amusing to read that you think you do ;). I would definitely recommend the book."},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"After years of working the good seed angle and wondering why my bad seed buds were getting more than yours truly, our authors have provided revealing evidence of courting dynamics that helps to bring closure on the subject. Bound to become regarded as the Bible for gittin' sum. Rock on Bobs!"},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"This book was very entertaining in a Star Wars nerd meets Van Wilder kind of way. As a fellow engineer, I thought using math to describe relationships was very comical. However, as a female, I'm not sure I buy the whole GSB-BSB theory of women. However, anyone who is looking for serious dating advise from a couple of male engineers, probably has bigger problems to worry about.This is a quick read, so don't worry, your pals on the Linux forums won't miss you for long. It's also a funny read for non-geek-types. Pick it up, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"This is perfect material for the Howard Stern Show!! It's an irreverent, in-your-face look at relationships. The authors (who are these guys?) are not bogged down by fancy titles or statistical surveys...but, have obviously been doing their \`fieldwork' gathering data. Interestingly, they nail down a lot of ugly truths about dating, and explain in a straight forward and humorous manner how thing REALLY WORK in the jungle of the dating world. Who knew that it would be best to make a bad first impression? Recommended only for mature audiences with an irreverant sense of humor."},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"This is the funniest thing which I've read in a long time!!Everyone has thoughts about how to best tackle relationships, but I'd have to say that this is the most unique approach which I have ever read!!"},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"I got this book about a month ago and read it that weekend.

This book is very well thought out and was a very fun book to read. these guys must have spent years on perfecting the skills and are just telling there secrets.

Big thanks to the producers of this book Good Seed Bob and Bad Seed Bob"},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"The idea of using an engineering point of view to explore the dynmanics and controls of a dating scene can be very useful- but like one famous statistician wrote: All models are wrong (i.e., never completely capture the truth), but some are useful (attributed to George Box)! The Bayesian analysis falls in this category! Technically ok, but is it right or useful?This book contains some very eye-opening information about relationships. Quite frankly, there are some things that I would rather not know - but perhaps, if I could put aside my New England sensibilities, I would find the content useful!When I queried my husband of 20+ years, who also read this book, with the question: \\"Is this really how men think?\\" He laughed and said, \\"Of course, (long pause watching for my reaction) ... not.\\" So what do I believe?I should probably give this book to my daughter (19 yrs) to read, too bad my husband took it to work to share with his male engineering friends...."},{"Title":"The Sauce","review":"This light hearted look at relationships should be required reading for young men stepping out on their own.

Imagine being a kid, particularly a young one and hearing what the other side is saying about your dad. Imagine trying to go to grow up and have a relationship with someone of the other sex. Imagine being a girl, do you think anyone would ever get up the courage to ask you out? On the other hand, with the secret service around you wouldn't have to worry much about date rape.

I would recommend this to anyone, 5 stars~"},{"Title":"First Families: The Impact of the White House on Their Lives","review":"A lot of the antecdotes in this book have been published elsewhere but the insights on how each of the more modern presidential families view the White House were interesting. In all, I would have borrowed this book from the library rather than purchase it. A nice read but not a book I will take off the shelf from time to time to review or share with others."},{"Title":"First Families: The Impact of the White House on Their Lives","review":"The book is interesting in how it presents the story - the chapters are broken down into theme (not time periods) and all presidential families that fit that theme are discussed in the chapter. A unique and fun way to learn about the families. On the downside the author makes the same points over and over and over again through out the book and also assumes that readers are intimately familiar with every president ever to hold office and will no all about them already - as such a lot of reference are by last or first name only and don't contain much background information.Overall it's a new spin for people who've read a lot of books on presidential history but if you're new to the topic - pick a different book."},{"Title":"First Families: The Impact of the White House on Their Lives","review":"\\"First Families\\" contains a number of highly entertaining anecdotes about the first families: how the White House shaped their lives, and how they in turn shaped the White House. I enjoyed it and stuck it through to the end. I'll keep it for a few of the First Ladies' quotes about life in the public eye.However,the book could have benefitted from sharper editing. Bonnie Angelo shifts from one presidential term to another, back in forth in time, without any apparent reason for her organization of anecdotes. Some stories (e.g., a Martha Washington quote abou happiness or misery being dependent upon our dispositions), are distinctly repeated twice; others are obliquely referred to more than once. Her chapters are loosely organized. The concept of \\"out we go, in they go\\" is purposely the title of one chapter, but remains a constant theme throughout the book. I would have preferred tighter organization and a more linear timeline.On the other hand, I have to give Bonnie Angelo credit for bringing long-forgotten First Ladies and their stories to life, for showing us the courage and independence shown by our First Ladies long before American society was ready for women to do so. The First Ladies (and oftentimes First Daughters) are the real stars of this book."},{"Title":"First Families: The Impact of the White House on Their Lives","review":"A fascinating account of life in the White House. What is it like being a First Family? How has life in the White House changed over the years? How was it different for Dolley Madison, Bess Truman and Jacqueline Kennedy? Which first ladies were beloved by all and which were the most difficult to like? Who is responsible for the Japanese cherry trees which blossom each April? Who was married in the White House and which presidential children got into the most trouble?I found this an entertaining and easy book to read. Some stories I'd heard before, but most were new. Bonnie Angelo is a longtime correspondent for Time and reported on the White House for years. She's definitely done her research and shares many delightful anecdotes about past presidents and their first ladies and families, from George Washington to George W. Bush. We learn which First Ladies relished their roles and which ones were reluctant celebrities.While Ms. Angelo cites many references, she doesn't do so until the end of the book. I found myself wishing that there were footnotes so that I could check references and sources, none of which are found in the actual text. She does have an extensive bibliography at the end of the book, many of which sound interesting and will probably end up on my reading list!A lively, entertaining book about America's House. Simply enjoyable."},{"Title":"First Families: The Impact of the White House on Their Lives","review":"This book rambles on gushing over some entries - \\"a perfect marriage,\\" i.e the Sr. Bushes; and then glaringly inaccurately in the very next paragraph states \\"Patti Davis termed her stepmother harsh...\\" - a very unkind cut indeed if Patti had termed her her STEPmother. I do not see how the author and her editor could have erred so obviously. I was already bored by the poor quality of both the content and the writing and stopped reading at that point (page 119). A true waste of space."},{"Title":"The Springs of Contemplation: A Retreat at the Abbey of Gethsemani","review":"This retreat given to several nuns, mostly superiors of their orders, was transcribed, and it shows that Merton returned to his monastic vocation. The things he says indicate his compassion, understanding, and responsibilities he had been given in the monastery--he was master of novices for many years. It is fascinating to read this retreat material and to compare it with his published journals of the same time. This comparison shows the consistency of Merton's private and public views.Merton is relaxed and often charming. His perceptiveness is obvious. For example, \\"obedience is meant to free us so that we can follow the Holy Spirit. We respect the authority of others and obey it, but we also have to follow our conscience.\\" Time has proved him right on many issues, and wrong on others. I find his sincerity undeniable, and I think this book gives a wonderful view into his thought processes.Anyone who is interested in Merton's views on celibacy and its place in religious life will find them in great detail here. Although his college friend Ed Rice claims in his correctly titled \\"entertainment\\" on Merton, \\"Man in the Sycamore Tree\\", that Merton talked about the possibility of married monks, that doesn't seem to be the case. During this retreat, in May 1968, Merton states that the secular clergy (usually known as parish priests) should be free to marry; he does not espouse marriage for monks (see the chapter \\"Collaboration, Penance, Celibacy\\"). For those interested in Merton's life, this book is a \\"sleeper\\" which reveals the applications he made of Catholic beliefs to everyday monastic life. I highly recommend this book as an antidote to the sensational and obtuse presentation of Merton by Mark Shaw in \\"Beneath the Mask of Holiness.\\""},{"Title":"The Springs of Contemplation: A Retreat at the Abbey of Gethsemani","review":"Thomas Merton is not the typical Catholic, yet is fully rooted in Catholic faith. He explores some troubles with the world with a cutting grace and how contemplatives should address them. For example, he discusses how the will to see problems change sometimes cannot overcome cold comforts--in particular, he talks about how people deplore racism but would not want to suffer the detriment of integration. He states, for example, how many whites felt terrible for the treatment of the blacks, but would not invite blacks to live in their neighborhood because it would decrease property value. He discusses how people tragically get caught up in a given protocol and can only break free with creative contemplation. He discusses why non-violence between MLK or Ghandi worked whereas the hippies were rather impotent. Ultimately, he shows that contemplation can free us from the mundane to really change the world.He discusses silence very deeply. I read this on an Ignacian Silent Retreat, so it really spoke to me, but reading this in another setting may reduce the power, which seems evident from previous reviews.If your are a Catholic or Buddhist interested in comparative religion, he has a lecture on Zen. He is very objective, giving credit where credit is due; he does not say, \\"If only Catholics did this . . .\\" or \\"Buddhism is inferior because . . .\\" Overall, he gives a really to-the-point discussion on meditative practices. No Unitarian, he readily brings up similarities and differences, being fair yet true to his faith. He really moves past the New Age Post-Modern crap which plagues most other comparative analyses.I would recommend this to any spiritual person going on a quiet retreat or even someone who just wants to spend a weekend alone contemplating God."},{"Title":"The Springs of Contemplation: A Retreat at the Abbey of Gethsemani","review":"Its odd, how things work out. In his Journals, Merton was ENTHRALLED by this reterat. He spoke in glowing terms of the participants,and praised the intamcy achieved. He states, flatly&quot;this is the best reterat of my life.&quot; Yet none of that comes forth in this collection, which is more the pity. Of course, some of this is indeed dated[the world is radically changed in 33+ years]and perhaps, as it seems Fr. Merton was wont to do, he gets overly enthusiastic about something before he has completely immersed himself.Still, second level Merton is better then just about top shelf from anyone else.Some nuggets on prayer left me thinking that perhaps the great moments of this retreat were the celebration of the Mass that were held each day. In that silence was perhaps that ineffable moment that cannot be heard nor touched that Merton groped for so in his life and writings. So, in all not great Thomas Merton, thjough still necessary to see the entire picture of this good great man."},{"Title":"The Springs of Contemplation: A Retreat at the Abbey of Gethsemani","review":"This volume contains lectures which Thomas Merton gave to nuns of the Loretto community during late 1967 and early 1968. He manages to say almost nothing of substance, except that &quot;contemplation&quot; (however we define it) is good, and that authoritarian structures are bad. Only the most fervent devotees of the somewhat trendy Trappist would find this book ineluctable; the rest of us can profit by avoiding it. We look to his earlier work for nourishment: Thoughts in Solitude (1958), New Seeds of Contemplation (1961), and many of his poems and journals. THE SPRINGS OF CONTEMPLATION strikes this reader as needless chit-chat about silence. We do not find God in the book, but a tired talkative Merton who is a bit too convinced of his own sagacity. Alas."},{"Title":"Who's Running America? The Bush Restoration (7th Edition)","review":"Pretty good book about political elites in the United States. Its strongest point is its empirical discussion of personalities and of groups that have a lot of power in America. Even though the book has been through seven editions, including one following election 2000, some information needs to be updated. This is true, for example, of the discussion about the richest people in America.The theoretical model I found a bit tangled and not one hundred percent persuasive. I am on the side of the author as far as the major thesis, but I think theoretically this is not the last word on the elite theory of American politics, nor is the book astonishingly creative from the theoretical standpoint.I also needed more persuasion as far as some specific hypotheses. For example the role of endowments and foundations was presented as a truly major role. Most textbooks on American politics do not even mention endowments and foundations that support academic and scientific research. Much less do most textbooks on the subject consider endowments and foundations to be key players.Nevertheless, it is a clear no-nonsense book and easy to read, especially if you are interested in politics. I thought it had a nice introductory chapter, paying homage to some of the early great elite theorists, such as Vifredo Pareto, Robert Michels, and Gaetano Mosca.I recommend it to undergraduate students in American politics and political theory."},{"Title":"Who's Running America?

This book is filled with the inspiring tales of people who are like Julia Hill, who do care and who have made a difference in our world. It also is packed with information on all sorts of environmental issues from water conservation to the clear-cutting of trees to to the very positive effects of vegetarianism on the environment.

Part of the problem with &quot;One Makes the Difference&quot; is that it's not sure what it wants to be. Is it a handbook for applying environmentalism to everyday life? If it is, it fails. Many strategies (for instance, biodiesel) lack enough detail for the reader to translate them into action. It's also broken down into artificial sections, like &quot;air&quot; and &quot;water&quot; and &quot;land&quot;; in reality many strategies for environmental living benefit more than one of these. A better way to organize would've been into different categories of human action, like transportation, diet, and home-heating/cooling. Humans can compartmentalize; nature cannot.Another source of frustration with this book was the &quot;inspiring&quot; tales of people who &quot;made a difference&quot;. While it *can* be inspiring to read about people who succeeded, I was ultimately left wishing that the author had explained more about *why* these people were successful. Otherwise, the stories feel like nothing more than mere chance amidst the many attempts at environmental activism that fail.I would suggest this book only to those who are relatively new to the environmental movement."},{"Title":"Ultimate Gay Erotica, 2006","review":"I've read a few of the stories.

This book takes on these issues and sorts out the reality from the hype by honestly and objectively examining the good and bad of all major types of commercial annuities, from fixed to variable to equity indexed, as well as trust structures involving annuities and the tough section 72(s) issues. The book also includes such useful things as the actuarial tables for taxing annuities, exclusion ratio calculations, and the most pertinent Internal Revenue Code Sections.

To be perfectly honest, I did not realize its brilliance and importance until the second time I read it. When this book was first published in the mid 80s, I was already a fan of Ashe, having read other books by him about reconstructing a historical Arthur figure and culture. The first time I read it, I thought that it was weak and conflicted with theories put forth by him in his previous books -- theories which I felt were fine and did not need to be improved on. A couple of years ago, someone convinced me to read it a second time, and it absolutely blew my mind! So I recomend that anyone who is not impressed with it give it another chance. Yes, it shifts Arthur chronologically back a generation or so, but many Arthurian events are being shifted back several years in light of the most up-to-date scholoarship. What Ashe does is he lines up the legend of Arthur, as told by Geoffrey of Monmouth, side by side with the history of the fifth century British king, Riothamus, and points out not just a few, but a whole slew of parallels. There are many theories out there trying to reconstruct a historical King Arthur (e.g. see my review of _King Arthur: The True Story_ by Graham Phillips and Martin Keatman), many of which try to identify Arthur with someone on record under a different name; most such theories are weak at best and often quite preposterous, being based on the vaguest scraps of evidence and the most tenuous conicidences. Ashe's theory, on the other hand, is a startlingly strong case made up of a preponderance of circumstantial evidence; one may point to any one thing and say that it is only a coincidence, but when you get layer upon layer of these and couple it with archaeological evidence, one can no longer dismiss the similarities between Riothamus and Arthur as mere coincidence. Take it from a guy who has read a lot of books and articles on this subject: this is not just another among the myriad of historical Arthur theories; this deserves to be far and away the preeminent reconstruction of a historical Arthur. Ashe is a genius!"},{"Title":"The Discovery of King Arthur","review":"I've skimmed this book several times (for the pictures) before I gave it a real chance when college professors pointed out the thesis of Ashe's work: there are remarkable parallels between the &quot;legendary&quot; King Arthur of Geoffrey of Monmouth and Riothamus, an actual 5th century British King.Ashe brilliantly leads up to his thesis by presenting the facts, the legends, and previous attempts to discovery the &quot;real&quot; Arthur (&quot;The Old Welsh Trail&quot;). By doing so, Ashe gives the readers the proper context to fit his thesis into.There are excellent pictures of late Roman/early Saxon Britain artifacts and most interesting of all: an artist's conception of an &quot;Arthurian Knight&quot;.Ashe's book is far more legitimate than King Arthur: The True Story, written by Graham Phillips and Martin Keatman. Although well-written, Phillips and Keatman's book tries to link a petty Welsh King of the early 6th century (Owain Ddantgwyn of the Annales Cambriae) with Nennius's King Arthur merely because \\"he was in the right place at the right time\\", his nephew Maglocunus could have been Mordred, and because he is mentioned as the \\"Bear\\", which means Arthur or something.This is no criticism of Ashe's believable and accurate work but I must say that I can't believe that Riothamus is the ONLY Arthur. No one can deny that Geoffrey of Monmouth based a good of Arthur's continental campaigns on Riothamus but what about Nennius and the other Welsh Dark Age manuscripts? What about Ambrosius Aurelianus's successor, the Romano-British Warlord/King who slaughtered the Saxons at Mount Badon, a battle that Gildas reported? Riothamus fought in the 460s and 470s, a period atleast 20 years before the battle at Mount Badon. I think there were two special men, the warlord of Badon, and Riothamus, who captured the imagination of the Welsh, and Geoffrey of Monmouth incorporated the two into one man."},{"Title":"The Discovery of King Arthur","review":"As a King Arthur enthusiast, I read this book both with awe, and admiration for the author, Geoffrey Ashe. His insight and passion, and vast historical knowledge, into finding out the facts behind the legend of King Arthur make &quot;The Discovery of King Arthur&quot; a powerful read indeed. Ashe unravels the tangled myths to reveal the facts behind the legend, and pinpoints Arthur to one individual who, more than any other man, fits the description of &quot;Arthur&quot;. Ashe makes a very provocative, and eloquent, case for his existance; and bases his argument on facts, rather than hearsay, or personal opinion. We may never know whether or not King Arthur actually existed; however, Ashe treats us to a well written and fascinating look into myth and reality, as well as giving us a history lesson we cannot possibly fall asleep reading."},{"Title":"The Discovery of King Arthur","review":"This book represents the culmination of a lifetime of research by a leading scholar. Geoffrey Ashe should be commended for the great advances he has made in uncovering the history underlying the legend of King Arthur. Even if one finally decides to reject (as I do) the equation of the historical Arthur with Riothamus, one must nonetheless come to share Ashe's appreciation that the history of Britain in this period cannot be properly understood apart from events transpiring elswehere in the Roman Empire, especially Gaul."},{"Title":"The Discovery of King Arthur","review":"Geoffrey Ashe's book provides a much needed clarification of the romanticized Arthurian myth as it's known today. In a cautious and scientific method, Ashe sifts through Medieval annals and stories to find common links as well as inconsistencies to uncover the probable truth behind the myth. The book is approachable by all readers regardless of their historical knowledge and is written in a simple prose.Writers and minstrels of Medieval Europe had little interest in historical truth as we do today and usually sought to impress their monarchs and nobles with fancy stories about the great origins of their titles instead. Sir Thomas Malory's 'Le Morte D'Arthure' was no exception and, his version is even more suspect in that he wrote it hoping to please the king enough to get him out of prison. Although these early ballads and chronicles obscure more than clarify the true origins of the myths, they do recite certain common and recurrent facts or themes pointing to events during a specific historical period that can reveal glimpses of the truth that lies beneath.With strong evidence and use of logic, Ash comes to certain tentative conclusions about the real Arthur. First, Ash goes to the earliest known chronicles which place Arthur at a much earlier date than later writers. Accounting for some identifiable errors in dates, Ash concludes that Arthur couldn't have lived past the 5th century A.D. which would place him in the final years of Roman Britain. Ash correctly recognizes that the name Arturios is a Latin name of which a Germanic Angle, Jute, or Saxon monarch would not have had. He also finds that the legends of Merlin and the Green Knight indicate a strong Celtic influence of druidism which would coincide with that period as Christianity was just beginning to propagate through England and Ireland with evangelists such as St. Patrick: a good portion of Britain and Ireland were still very much Celtic and pagan. Ash also found that the name Arturios sounds a lot like a Romano-Celtic war chieftain named Riothamus who existed approximately during the same period. Finally, Ash also suggests that the initial success of the Romano-Celts in repelling the invaders came hand in hand with some territorial expansions into northern Gaul in modern Britanny which would account for the myth of Lancelot. Gaul was of course also a Roman province that was suffering even more severe invasions at the hands of the Franks, Vandals, and other Germanic invaders during that time. He speculates that the mythical Arthurian prosperity of Camelot simply reflected these initial geo-political and economic successes. Ash also supports his theory with archeological finds dated to that period and etymological extrapolation form names and words.Stories like the Arthur myths and the Song of Roland tended to be a Medieval minstrel's fancy account of obscure histories to please his audience of nobles and monarchs and were devoid of any factual truth: making these stories myths instead of history. Ash lifts the veil of these myths and points to the kernels of truth he did find leaving a final conclusion for future historians who dare to take the challenge. The book is easy to read and one doesn't require a high knowledge of history to understand his argument. Overall a great book with a lot of good information not only about the Arthurian myth, but also about a period of European history that doesn't offer a lot of information, hence appropriately referred to as the Dark Ages."},{"Title":"The Discovery of King Arthur","review":"Ashe makes a compelling argument for the existence of a REAL King Arthur and has identified the landscape in which he operated. This book is very hard to put down -- I read it in one day, stirring my soup with one hand while holding the book in the other! I found myself reading it with my Ordinance Survey map opened to the appropriate places, and found it very helpful and convincing.VERY highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Discovery of King Arthur","review":"Unfortunately, Ashe chose to write his book in the form a detective mystery in which he explains how he unraveled the long-perplexing mystery of the historical Arthur. Thus, only near the end, does he actual set out his case. This makes for some tedious reading if one does not care about the mistakes of others before Ashe or is not already an Arthurian romance junkie. Hence, a general reader might want to cut the chase at the end of the book -- you can go back to crucial portions nearer the begining, which are cross-referenced by page number at the appropriate point. Still, despite his choice of a ponderous format, Ashe's argument and conclusions are compelling, and I think it take a very strong argument indeed to disprove his find. We have the real King Arthur at last."},{"Title":"The Discovery of King Arthur","review":"My library on ancient Britain holds well over 500 volumes.Geofferey Ashe is considered the leading expert in this field.

While not suggesting such material is irrelevant, it becomes monotonous after a while, although his section on the way the Arthur stories fared later in history is very interesting.This is not one of those books in which the author tells the reader how he/she located the information, and in which the finding could have been set out in a two-page article (although such books can be enthralling). Rather, it consists of sold scholarship from beginning to end, and I hope to read more from Mr. Ashe's research in the future."},{"Title":"The Discovery of King Arthur","review":"Although this book was written a thousand years after the events analyzed there-in, I get the impression that Ashe is almost obsessed with finding out who King Arthur actually was.Taken at face value, this disection of the known facts from that time does lead us to a reasonable conclusion that Ashe has determined who Arthur was. Interesting reading for history buffs and Arthurian's."},{"Title":"The Discovery of King Arthur","review":"I suppose you could call this historical forensics. Geoffrey Ashe attempts to sift through all the legends and fiction surrounding King Arthur to see if he can pin down who the actual man might have been and when he might actually have lived and where. Apparently Ashe is a well known Arthurian scholar, and the books reads that way."},{"Title":"The Discovery of King Arthur","review":"One of the greatest English myths is of King Arthur, Camelot and the Knights of the Round Table; the legend says if England is in dire trouble, Arthur and his knights will ride once again to their rescue.Unfortunately, this book mostly ignores the legend and limits itself to bare facts. Without giving away the plot, the book concludes that either Arthur really existed even if no one is sure of what all he accomplished, or else someone with the same name did it all. In other words, it's good investigative history with a poor understanding of King Arthur.Although it may not be apparent to an Englishman, King Arthur embodies the finest of the English spirit and attitudes. He was a great warrior who successfully defended his land against almost impossible odds (to be specific, the Saxon invaders from Germany). He was the architect of English fair play, justice, equality and democracy -- why else have a &quot;round table&quot; at which all are equal?It was the Normans who imposed an absolute monarchy; the English, in the Magna Carta, told them that no one in England has the right of absolute rule. The legend warns of the perfidious French in the person of Lancelot, who seduces the Queen. In today's England, the legend of King Arthur says &quot;this is who we would like to be.&quot;Ashe provides a cornucopia of facts about the possibilities or likelihood of the real King Arthur, including a tantalizing suggestion the origins of the legend may date back to the beginnings of Stonehenge some 4,000 years ago. Granted, this may be a latter day addition to the legend, in effect claiming &quot;we've always been like this.&quot; Or, it may indicate the stubborn English individuality may date much further back than anyone suspects.It's a pity Ashe didn't examine the legend and it's modern meanings -- even in the recent American form with Richard Burton in Camelot -- and how this grew out of the facts he has compiled. The legends of Beowulf, der Ring des Nibelungen, Gitchee Manitou, the Good Soldier Schweik and others tell a lot about people. Someday, in a far distant time and place, &quot;legends&quot; of Battle of Britain pilots may merge with Camelot; think of Squadron Leader Arthur, his Spitfire knights gathering around a table in some pub after battling the Saxons.Impossible? In America, legendary stories of George Washington began to arise within a few decades of his death. Today, true believers swear by such stories. Such modern legends express the best of America. It's what legends mean.History is more than facts -- it is also meaning.This book is a rich trove of facts, well worth reading. Whatever one thinks of King Arthur, this book provides a solid foundation for further analysis. I'd have preferred more, in the line of &quot;here's what the legend means.&quot; Even limited as it is, it's well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Discovery of King Arthur","review":"Ashe as usual hasn't the faintest idea of his histories. He simply perpetuates the myths which make his income. He clearly has no interest whatsoever in the factual historicity of the person who has come down to us as King Arthur, nor has any academic background to support the work which he does. Ancient manuscripts in, for example, the Harleian, the Bodleian, LLandaff Cathedral, the Vatican Manuscripts, the correspondences in the Louvre, and thousands more, delineate a clear and factual history for not just one, but two clear and distinct Kings called, in English, Arthur. Their zones of influence are clear, as is the fact that their seat of power was in South Wales. Only a pretentious untutored moron would place King Arthur in Glastonbury - or Tintagel! Camelot, - the french for 'rubbish' is Caer Melyn, Kerniw is the forest (Coed) of Kerniw, known as such for more than two thousand years, and the stone (llys) court (faen) near to which Arthur the Second had his seat is Llys Faen. Curiously, Llys Faen, Caer Melyn and Coed Kerniw are all between Cardiff and Newport.

I have heard parts of it repeated in watered down ways, and that is a testimony to the power of his work, that so many quote or refer to it without knowing that they are doing so, because they have heard his ideas second or third hand.I am a philosophical libertarian and Popper was not. I would call him a Progressive in the Herbert Croly sense. I think his belief that small scale experimentation might work is a good one, though, and is very, very distant from today's \\"progressives\\" who never saw a large scale program that they could not support or a philosopher king whom they could not worship, most recently President Barack Hussein Obama.The recent cap and trade law exemplifies the huge distance between Popper's picture of gradual experimentation and social engineering with the radical, single sweep mentality of today's left-wing \\"progressives\\". The cap and trade bill would implement radical, strict regulations on housing, for instance, without any information about what the true effects of such regulations would be on the economy. A central czar, the cap and trade administrator, presumably a demigod in the eyes of the Democratic Party with knowledge of the Pythagorean global warming number, would be empowered to dictate a federal housing code. Any interest in deliberation, debate or local control would be squashed by the federal authorities. Like good Platonists, when the Democrats have recently been confronted with e-mails that document that the global warming research at the Anglia Research Center on which most of the arguments for cap and trade are based has been falsified, they shrug their shoulders and do not care. Like Plato's guardian class, the American media and academic establishment do not care if they are advocating lies. They just go ahead and advocate them, and count on the blind obedience of their Democratic minions and their willingness to goose step behind them.The analogies between Plato and today's Democratic proposals do not stop there. Plato was the first to use propagandistic lying to claim that he was an altruist when in fact he was a collectivist. Popper outlines the distinction and the immense harm to history that Plato caused by confusing altruism and collectivism. It took Adolf Hitler and Alexander Solzhenitsyn to wake us libertarians up. American \\"progressives\\", including Popper's famous student, George Soros, remain committed to the use of lying and propaganda in the defense of the confusion of collectivism and altruism. This confusion remains an important soporific tool in maintaining the sleep of collectivist Democrats, who had done immense harm to America in the name of altruism, but are nothing more than selfish collectivists, beginning with the self-interested movements of unions and government employees. Thus, authoritarian, centrally imposed laws like cap and trade are marketed as the product of \\"deliberation\\" by today's Democratic Party totalitarians."},{"Title":"The Open Society and Its Enemies, Vol. 1: The Spell of Plato","review":"Up to the introduction of computer software Plato's thinking catastrophe went at large unnoticed culminating in the past centuries' human catastrophes.

I think this is what Feyerabend had on mind when writing: \\"And those who still rant and rave against him (Aristotle) turn out to be 'crude animals who bark at things they do not comprehend'\\" the quote being from Albertus Magnus. It is not easy to see that someone can be a totallitarian while denouncing totalitarianism. For the record, Popper, in his later work adopted most of Plato's ideas, including any sympathy for left of monarchy politics (do not be fooled by the rhetoric). This is the book that still has the nickname in London \\"The open society - by one of its enemies\\".As for whether the ills of the Western civilization are due to Plato and Aristotle, this seems a valid point. If seen otherwise, both the goods and the ills in fact. The reader will find that similar or worse ills characterized, say, the burning of the (Aristotelian) Great Library, the murder of the (platonist) philosopher Hypatia, the mongol raids, or even the civil war in remote Easter island.

Popper was under no circumstance an intellectual (in the right sense of \\"thinking person\\"), yet a highly opportunistic mass member who managed to rise in totally unmerited positions by constantly keeping himself within the fashion of his times.Typical to thoroughly primitive humans, Popper does not understand concepts being separated of actions and translates the former into the latter, actions being the only things he truly had any command into. For Popper, a concept is valid once it's transposition into action is \\"acceptable\\" (in the twisted post-modern sense). A clear manifestation of this common process is how in the entire waste of words of whom this book consists, NEVER does the author attempt some insight into an issue, merely remaining on the outsides looking for imputable manifestations. This is a MUST among modern \\"proffesional\\" academics, as well. Such procedure serves two reasons:1. it promotes a political agenda to whom the author is in debt by being granted the formal position he has.2. it diverts discussions into ad-hominem attacks, something anybody, no matter how archaic-minded, can deal with.Arguments are meaningful only to those who understand them. They are but a manifestation of weakness in the eyes of those with an unbounded instinct of conservation such as Popper. The best strategy of all for dealing with propagandistic garbage would be to simply IGNORE it. An even better alternative (since propaganda is boringly repetitive) is to respond directly with an ad-hominem...I am glad I didn't bought this book.

Each volume has a table of contents, text, addenda, truly awe-inspiring endnotes, an index of names, and of subjects. This is a review of BOTH volumes.\\"If in this book harsh words are spoken about some of the greatest among the intellectual leaders of mankind, my motive is not...to belittle them. ...we must break with the habit of deference to great men. Great men may make great mistakes...\\" (from the intro to the 1943 edition)Karl Popper was fighting the war in his own way. He saw what was essentially the same in Stalin and Hitler: a monstrous confidence. They may have drawn on different philosophies of the state, but it came to the same thing in the end: wholesale murder as a tool of social engineering.But WWII is over, and we won. Moreover, the Soviet Union has collapsed, and we won again. So what is the fuss? Relax: Marxism is dead, Platonism sounds quaint, and who the hell is Hegel, anyway?But don't rest easy just yet, free-market man! Every four years we seem to reaffirm our need for a philosopher-king. And while the historicist faith is now all tarted-up with computers, networking, and the Fable of the Bees and re-christened \\"emergent order\\", it still leaves us feeling smug and moral in doing nothing but tending our own gardens.Popper is pithy throughout, but I only started noting things (this time around) at the penultimate chapter of the work, 24:&quot;... the fight against suffering must be considered a duty, while the right to care for the happiness of others must be considered a privilege confined to the close circle of their friends.&quot;(vII, p237)[on language, and the aim of rationalism] &quot;... to use it plainly ... as an instrument of rational communication ... rather than as a means of 'self-expression', as the vicious romantic jargon of most of our educationists has it.&quot; (p239) See also II, pp276/7 on the aims of education.[On bullshit] &quot;... irrationalism will use reason too, but without any feeling of obligation.&quot;(II,240)A brilliant look at Hegelian thinking in the sociology of knowledge (II,242/3), which must be read whole, but ends: &quot; ... their thoughts are endowed ... with 'mystical and religious faculties' not possessed by others, and who thus claim that they 'think by God's grace'. This claim with its gentle allusion to those who do not possess God's grace, this attack upon the potential spiritual unity of mankind, is, in my opinion, as pretentious, blasphemous and anti-Christian, as it believes itself to be humble, pious, and Christian.&quot;Popper is relentlessly brilliant in moral indignation. See his pointing out that moral futurism (e.g. 'the meek shall inherit the earth') condones the abdicating of individual moral responsibility, since one need do nothing toward this certain end. His answer: &quot;...it is certainly possible to combine an attitude of the utmost reserve and even of contempt towards worldly success in the sense of power, glory, and wealth, with the attempt to do one's best in this world, and to further the ends one has decided to adopt...for their own sake.&quot;(II, 274)This is one of the great works of practical philosophy of the century. Awesome in scholarship, relentless in moral vision, yet as fair-minded as his own high standards dictate, Popper has produced a book that is at once an explication of important philosophers who have had a malign impact and an attempt, largely successful, to demythologize them, and to give the average reader intellectual weapons to combat their legacy. His care is, at all times, to be clear and rational. He is concerned to communicate, not to obscure. The spirit of civilization shines through this work; it exemplifies what is best in our intellectual and spiritual heritage.A hint: read a few of the notes to convince yourself that Popper has completely mastered his material (in several languages), that he has anticipated all the main counterarguments to his positions, and that he stands ready to defend in severe philosophical jargon anything he seems too-casually to advert to in the text. Then just read the books, and dig into the notes later, when you go back to a section for some serious research."},{"Title":"The Open Society and Its Enemies, Vol. 1: The Spell of Plato","review":"I think the title of this review is a true description of this book, but I urge you to judge for yourself. My only regret is that I did not read it many years ago when my head was turned by the siren calls of what Popper calls 'tribalism'. Even then I heard about it and had it pooh-poohed as 'old hat' by 'advanced' thinkers (self-styled!). Often misinterpreted as an attack on Plato, Marx and Hegel, it is in reality a stirring defense of democracy and liberalism, written at democracy's darkest hour. Now that Marxism has collapsed, Popper in an interview given before his death called for us now to look for the 'roads not taken', admitting that embattled western liberalism became, to a certain extent, an unquestioned dogma like its opponents. A good place to start that search is with Popper's greatest book."},{"Title":"The Open Society and Its Enemies, Vol. 1: The Spell of Plato","review":"When confronted with the rise of totalitarianism and the destruction of all that he held dear, Poper felt a single, overwhelming urge: to return to the Greeks, to the dawn of our civilization, so as to understand the root of the evil and to offer a practical way out of bestiality. His search was motivated by the insight that \\"this civilization has not yet fully recovered from the shock of its birth--the transition from the tribal or 'closed society', with its submission to magical forces, to the 'open society', which sets free the critical powers of man.\\"Heraclitus set the stage with his claim that \\"the cosmos, at best, is like a rubbish heap scattered at random.\\" If \\"everything is in flux\\" and \\"you cannot step twice into the same river\\", then at least we can try to discover the historical or evolutionary laws which will enable us to prophesy the destiny of man.Plato's claim to greatness is to have discovered such a law: that \\"all social change is corruption or decay or degeneration,\\" and that the only way to break this cycle of decay is to arrest development and return to the Golden Age, where no change occurs. His belief in perfect and unchanging things, the Platonic Ideas from which all things originate, finds its expression in all fields of inquiry: be it social justice, nature and convention, wisdom and truth, or goodness and beauty.Behind these lofty ideals, Popper uncovers a discomforting truth: Plato envisioned the ideal Greek polity as a totalitarian nightmare, where the 'race of the guardians' had to be kept pure from any miscegenation and where the role of the rulers was to breed the human cattle according to some esoteric formula (the 'Platonic Number', a number determining the True Period of the human race). Along his apology of Sparta came his endorsement of infanticide and his recommendation that children of both sexes be \\"brought within the sight of actual war and made to taste blood.\\"Popper demonstrates that these crazy ideas were not the vague mumblings of an otherwise sound philosopher: they were central tenets in Plato's philosophy, a system which has been characterized by another author as \\"the most savage and most profound attack upon liberal ideas which history can show.\\"Popper connects this extreme radicalism of the Platonic approach with its aestheticism, i.e. with \\"the desire to build a world which is not only a little better and more rational than ours, but which is free from all its ugliness.\\" Plato, the Philosopher-King, can be best characterized as an artist: a man attracted to a world of pure beauty, a craftsman who tries to visualize an ideal model of his work and to copy it faithfully, and for whom \\"the part has to be executed for the sake of the whole, and not the whole for the sake of the part.\\" His desire to \\"start from a clean canvas\\" or his claim to prefer \\"the original to the copy\\" find disturbing echoes in contemporary political debates. Contrary to Plato's belief, however, the canvas can never be made clean, and the copy often improves upon the original.Let's give Popper the last word: \\"But there I must protest. I do not believe that human lives may be made the means for satisfying an artist's desire for self-expression. We must demand, rather, that every man should be given, if he wishes, the right to model his life himself, as far as this does not interfere too much with others. Much as I sympathize with the aesthetic impulse, I suggest that the artist might seek expression in another material.\\""},{"Title":"The Open Society and Its Enemies, Vol. 1: The Spell of Plato","review":"Popper wrote this book for me and for people like me, i.e. for people who stand in awe of Plato simply because he is Plato.I read Plato's Republic in 1985 or thereabouts. I had learned of the allegory of the cave in class and wanted to know more. Also, in one M*A*S*H episode, the Republic was among the books Frank Burns was burning, so of course I had to read it. I did, and apart from Book One's denunciation of the maxim \\"Might Makes Right\\", I felt uneasy about the rest of the work. At the time, I felt that there must have been something wrong with me, that I wasn't reading it right, that after all having stood the test of time for over two thousand years Plato simply couldn't be wrong. If only I had known of Popper in 1985!Popper is in many ways pointing out the obvious: that Emperor Plato is wearing no clothes. His Republic is nothing more than a totalitarian state and his value system represses the individual in favour of the State.Popper begins by describing what he calls \\"Historicism\\" or the belief that history develops according to laws from which the future could be predicted, with Heraclitus being the first \\"historicist\\". Popper then continues with an overview Plato's thought, especially his Theory of Forms and his brilliant sociological insights. He then exposes over three chapters Plato's political programme to bring about a perfect City-State, and here is where Popper points out the obvious: Plato's Republic is a totalitarian state that controls every facet of the lives of all its citizens and represses any every invidual path to happiness.In the last chapter, Popper sketches out how an Open Society would work and gives the example of Athens just before Plato. Unlike others who have savaged Plato (e.g. Ayn Rand) Popper doesn't lay out a master plan to replace Plato's. He doesn't believe in utopias, Platonic or otherwise. Popper believes in what he calls \\"Piecemeal Social Engineering\\" i.e. fixing problems as they come up, or improving institutions when the opportunity arises.This is Popper's Open Society. One where we accept that things are as they are, that they can be improved, that individuals are the only judges of their own happiness and that they should have complete freedom to pursue it as they see fit, insofar as they don't harm others too much. His test for an Open Society is very simple: a society is open if its government can change without bloodshed.In 1948, Scott Buchanan wrote, in the introduction to Penguin's Portable Plato, that \\"the reading of Plato's dialogues by a large number of people could make the difference between a century of folly and a century of wisdom for the world\\". Perhaps, but only if the reader approches Plato without awe and with a critical mind. As did Popper.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"The Open Society and Its Enemies, Vol. 1: The Spell of Plato","review":"A timely critique of the vast umbrella of ideology which invisibly governs our society.There are many teachers who we barely refute, such as Plato, who have had many great ideas, but also some bad ones; bad ideas which are rarely questioned due to the originator's prestige. However, &quot;The Open Society And Its Enemies&quot;, does just that, and much more.Humankind's tendency toward a more primitive society (totalitarianism) than that demanded by our awakening powers of criticism is, as Popper lucidly suggests, the result of historicist prejudice, which envisions a degenerative future. Popper sees such historicism as a self-fulfilling prophecy, and labors to convince the reader that we are actually in control of our destiny, that our course is as yet undetermined, and, more to the point, that it is not the proper place of science to predict the course of social change (Marx).This book is refreshing, insightful, and brilliantly argued; a MUST HAVE addition to your personal library."},{"Title":"The Open Society and Its Enemies, Vol. 1: The Spell of Plato","review":"This work is by now a most considerable classic whatever one's conclusions, multiple perhaps, about its many theses, and by any standard a compelling study, must read. Becoming well-known after World War II almost as an apologia of liberalism, its roots are in the thirties when the young socialist Popper sees the consequences in action of misapplied theories. Among its many sides, apart from its great argument about historicism, as seen also in The Poverty of Historicism,the work is notable for its sketch of the curious evolution of democracy in world history, and the development of its argument in a discussion of the birth of Greek Democracy. Its discussion of the Great Generation highlights one of the most crucial moments in world history, when democratic freedom struggled to be born. One problem with the argument here is that the opposite of an open society is,indeed, a closed one, but a tribal society is wrongfully typified as such. Popper fails to see that it is more than the transition from tribalism that is involved. It is not the antithesis with tribalism, but the 'openness' of the still semi-tribal yet cosmopolitan Greeks compared with 'closed' societies like the Assyrian or Persian empires. From this period springs Popper's critique of Plato, for which Popper is notorious among some, hero to others. Plato in the philosophic tradition deserved this correction, though not always the rebukes Popper gives him. One of the curiosities of this work is the limitation of its own successful argument, in the sense that its implied rejection of universal history is belied in the very history of democracy that it portrays. Why did democracy appear when it did, and why did it fail to survive? A strange contradiction lurks in this classic portrayal as it unwittingly shows the grounds for a post-historicist universal history. For the appearance and definition of the open society and its evolution are two different questions. This book is so filled with invaluable this and that, from the text to the notes, that it should linger on one's desk as a source of innumerable study projects."},{"Title":"The Open Society and Its Enemies, Vol. 1: The Spell of Plato","review":"Just bought this book (August 2005) to reread in response to current clash of ideologies over Iraq. This densely argued philsophical treatise offers exceptional insights into the history of philosophy, and into totalitarianism, fascism, communism, and religion. Those insights put a unique perspective upon the current clash between Western (nominally open) society and Christian and Muslim fundamentalism. This book places the \\"you are either with us or against us,\\" \\"three strikes and you're out,\\" and \\"zero tolerance\\" mindsets into perspective. I was first exposed to Karl Popper's ideas when he came to the University of Denver in 1964 to teach a course with this title to the Centennial Scholars Program. It is a great pleasure to reread this book and savor Popper's careful dissections: scientific method and scientific truths, and their relation to philosphical, religious, and societal norms. This book sheds much light on what is going on in the world today."},{"Title":"The Open Society and Its Enemies, Vol. 1: The Spell of Plato","review":"Popper is famous for attempting to shift philosophy from various idealist systems to one of empiricism. He is famous for suggesting that the basis of the scientific method is the falsification of false theories by empirical analysis. He describes earlier systems such as those of Plato as &quot;essentialist&quot; or such that cannot be disproved by experimentation and thus rejects them.Popper's importance is more than just a philosopher. He is a person who was of the twentieth century and was revolted by the development of totalitarian systems. In his view these systems were the product of &quot;essentialist&quot; philosophical systems or ideologies. He favored pragmatic systems in which ideology could be challenged by his method. This work is a work that is one of the most learned and systematic attacks on ideological systems which has been written in the last hundred years.Despite the difficulty of its content the book is readable and simple. Over half of the book is devoted to footnotes. Its exposition of the Platonic and Marxist systems is learned and erudite.In its time the book has been heavily critiqued by Platonists. Ignore such criticism, this book is one of the most important books to be written in the last hundred years."},{"Title":"The Open Society and Its Enemies, Vol. 1: The Spell of Plato","review":"This book, written as a sustained critique of the social philosophy of Plato, is one of the best statements of classical liberalism I have encountered. The basic message of Popper's book is that an open (free) society is characterized by the presence of criticism, discussion, and participatory reform. Popper finds occassion to contrast this view of society with the philosophy of Plato, one of the great minds of the western intellectual tradition. And it is interesting to note that in the preface Popper writes that he chose to attack Plato only because he is so revered.Plato, it must be remembered, lived in Athens at a time when democracy was being introduced. Plato witnessed the displacement of many of his friends from political positions of power, and was shocked by the social turmoil that these changes engendered. Plato saw these changes as extremely bad, and concluded that all change is necessarily destructive and degenerating because he conceived the origin of society as consisting of pure forms of absolute objects such as good, beauty, perfection, etc.The task before him was to find a way of preventing (or arresting) change, so that degeneration and social decline could be avoided. He believed it was necessary to divide society into three classes: the rulers, the warriors, and the workers. In order to arrest change, there must never be disunion in the ruler class. To accomplish this, it was proposed that property be abolished in this class, and the family destroyed, since famililal loyalties often lead to political conflict. No mixing between the classes should be tolerated, and Plato argued that special methods of breeding should be employed among the different classes to ensure \\"racial purity.\\"For Plato, then, the chief aim of the \\"philosopher king\\" was to arrest change by preserving harmonious union among the ruling class. This could be achieved only by dividing society into classes the purpose of which was to specify in advance the activities that could be performed by each.The concluding chapters are more positive, and attempt to introduce alterntative political arrangements that would do a great deal in promoting an \\"open society.\\" This would include the existence of democracy, critical discussion, change, \\"piecemeal\\" reform, and so on. Popper sees utopian programs like Plato's as exemplary of tyranny. They preserve taboos, dogmas, rigid social inequities, power, etc. Only until alternative views are permitted can we hope to bring into existence a free and open society.A wonderfully insightful book, and especially useful against those who see Plato as the founder of humanitarianism based on the principle of The Philosopher King."},{"Title":"The Open Society and Its Enemies, Vol. 1: The Spell of Plato","review":"I will not comment on volume 2 of this work as I have read little Hegel and less Marx. Plato, however, I have read, and therefore will address volume 1, &quot;The Spell of Plato&quot;.This is a fascinating book. In a review of another book on Plato, I wrote that one important test of any work of secondary literature is whether the time spent reading it would be better spent re-reading the primary literature instead. Popper's book easily passes that test. I would by no means recommend reading it as a substitute for reading Plato ???- it contains too many interpretations that I think seriously wrong, and its narrow focus on political philosophy leaves many aspects of Plato's philosophy untouched, but as a text that helps the reader read Plato critically it is excellent, provided only that the reader doesn't forget to read Popper critically as well.The principal focus of the book is of course Plato's political philosophy. Popper reads it as part of an Athenian debate between democrats and anti-democratic reactionaries, and that Plato writes on behalf of the reactionaries. Popper presents Plato as a man who began under the tutelage of Socrates, whose positive influence is responsible for the best aspects of Plato's thought, but that Plato over time became increasingly corrupted. Popper summarizes his view in a really fine piece of writing that I cannot resist quoting:&quot;Socrates had refused to compromise his personal integrity. Plato, with all his uncompromising canvas-cleaning, was led along a path on which he compromised his integrity with every step he took. He was forced to combat free thought and the pursuit of truth. He was led to defend lying, political miracles, tabooistic superstition, the suppression of truth, and ultimately, brutal violence. In spite of Socrates' warning against misanthropy and misology, he was led to distrust man and to fear argument. In spite of his own hatred of tyranny, he was led to look to a tyrant for help, and to defend the most tyrannical measures. ??? he succeeded in blinding himself, by his own spell, to powers which once he had hated.&quot;As a general rule, I judge an interpretation of Plato by its ability to explain difficult passages and in particular passages that appear to be contradictory. I think that Popper's main thesis, as quoted above, is a very strong interpretation. Many passages that other interpretations struggle with (such as the numerous passages in which seeking the truth is praised vs. the famous passage in Republic in which lying is conditionally endorsed) can be explained by Popper's theory that Plato's thought corrupted over time.Although Popper's book is absolutely one I recommend, I mentioned that I thought that some of Popper's interpretations were simply wrong and believe that elaboration on a comment like that must be made. One of these is Popper's thesis that Plato was a historicist. Popper's historicist classification of Plato depends on Popper's reading that Plato held that all historical social change to be corruption. I think that this reading creates numerous interpretive difficulties and is therefore very likely false. The primary support Popper cites for this view is the developmentally ordered series of states in Republic VIII. A difficult text for this theory is Statesman 302b-303b: in that text, Plato ranks democracy as superior to oligarchy, and so (according to Popper's theory) oligarchy out to be developmentally later than democracy, yet in Republic VIII it is democracy that is later than oligarchy. Another difficult passage is Laws 694b to 696a, in which Plato describes Persia not undergoing a continuous decline but as going from good (under Cyrus) to bad (under Cyrus's children) to good again (under Darius) and back to bad (under Xerxes). Still another difficult passage would be the brief text in Laws 676a-c, in which Plato proposes an examination into how, over time, states have made moral progress or declined, and how superior states have deteriorated and bad ones improved (the example of Persia mentioned earlier is brought up in this context) with no hint that he viewed the idea of progress or improvement as a problem for his philosophy. On this topic I would conclude with the general observation that unlike Hegel and Marx, both of whom wrote book-length world histories, Plato seldom referred to historical events, and his longest historical text (Laws III from which two of my examples are taken) is unproblematic if read without reference to Popper's theory but becomes a confusing series of puzzles if read with reference to Popper's theory.In closing, I would like to quote (in a slightly abbreviated form) from Jonathan Barnes' introduction to &quot;The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle&quot;: &quot;Suppose you read a chapter in which it is suggested that Aristotle believed such-and-such. If you turn over the page and say to yourself, 'Oh, Aristotle believed such-and-such', then the book will have failed. For you are meant, as you put the book down, to converse with yourself in the following sort of way: &quot;Oh, so Aristotle is supposed to have believed such-and-such. What an interesting - or perplexing, or perverse - thing to have thought. Might it be true? Come to that, did Aristotle really mean exactly that? Let me look now at Aristotle's own words and see what he actually says.&quot; I do not know if Popper intended such a response from his book on Plato, but I think it an admirable goal for any work in philosophy's secondary literature and it is certainly the response Popper got from me.Highly recommended, faults and all."},{"Title":"The Open Society and Its Enemies, Vol. 1: The Spell of Plato","review":"Popper is probably the most cogent of the defenders of classical political liberalism I have read. However, in his attack on Plato, I think he misses (or ignores) a couple of key things:1.)Most Plato scholars doubt that 'The Republic' is intended to serve as an actual proposal for a state. Popper spends the vast majority of his time on Plato analyzing 'the republic,' with only occasional reference to Plato's later works.2.) 'The republic' does not represent Plato's more mature philosophy. Plato's political philosophy is substantially revised in the later dialogues 'the Statesman' and 'Laws'.3.) In 'Laws' particularly, the older Plato seems to come to view democracy as a perfectly acceptable form of government and emphasizes the rule of law, rather than the personal rule of a philosopher-king as necessary to the life of the state.4.) if the rule of law is important to plato, and if the laws ought to be made in such a way that they support the virtue of the citizens, then this presumably alleviates the charge of totalitarianism, since the concern of a totalitarian state would be to increase the power of the leader by whatever means possible and without regard to the citizens.5.) I think that Plato's own political philosophy can be accepted, because the elements that a liberal like Popper might find objectionable are not key components to the program and can, therefore, be revised. It is possible for a political platonist to believe in the superiority of democracy, for example.6.) the cure that popper wants to introduce is worse than the disease. Popper seems to think that the body of Philosophy is infected with the cancer of totalitarianism/tribalism/wholism, which he tries to treat with the chemotheraphy of liberalism/cosmopolitanism/individualism. However, he has misdiagnosed the problem and his solution, therefore becomes more harmful than helpful. The virtue ethicists have urged a return to ancient ethical philosophy, because doctors like Popper cannot 'cure' society. (See, for example, Alasdair MacIntyre, &quot;After Virtue&quot;).in short, i think popper's work to counter totalitarianism is important, but, in his furor, he seems to have left careful scholarship behind and his positive proposal does not seem helpful.shane wilkins"},{"Title":"The Open Society and Its Enemies, Vol. 1: The Spell of Plato","review":"The philosophical enterprise that begins in wonder and question comes to one of its climaxes, very early on, in the absolute system of Plato.In the world of 'The Republic ' there is an ideal heirarchy in which the Philosopher- King rules absolutely.Such absolute rule even for the Good of All is as Popper understands , disastrous for human freedom, creativity and development.It is the Totalitarian Mind that has and knows all answers , and dictates them to everyone.Against this Popper presents an ideal of an Open Society one which draws upon the freedoms and powers of individuals to shape and change life and history.The twentieth century's central political drama was in the struggle of two forms of Totalitarianism Nazism and Bolshevisim against the exponents of the Open Society, exemplified above all by the United States of America.Now as a new form of Totalitarian , Islamic Radical Fundamentalism casts its shadow over Mankind as a whole, we cannot only hope that the United States and whatever true allies it has , will be able to keep the Open Society thriving and developing.For if not , who knows what dark night of the human spirit the closed- minded will bring to us all ?"},{"Title":"The Open Society and Its Enemies, Vol. 1: The Spell of Plato","review":"This excellent book is a powerful, clear and passionate defence of democracy in the truest sense of this word.

Popper astounded me. And he assesses the issue from the point of view of an individual as opposed to coming from a certain school of thought - the way all things should be approached. If only we did not have people amongst us, great elitists, and philosophers, like the powers that be and Plato with his successors, who tell us what to think and that we are too stupid to think for ourselves.Maybe this is the most useful book for my education i've ever read. And to be honest, before reading this book, i was never too impressed with the idea of democracy, though admittedly it had more to do with having seen the results of our de-mock-racy, rather than with intellectual considerations of what it would and could really be.And i can imagine it would be very difficult indeed to find a book more relevant now when tyranny is so close upon us. i challenge all persons of good character to read this book.Of course there are things i disagree with mr. Popper - but on nothing very essential to the message of the work. But most i disagree with that he gives Plato the benefit of the doubt that at least Plato honestly believed what he preached. My own opinion is that Plato was a bit more cunning, and indeed did not believe in his own doctrines which he had instead made up so as to find support for elitist rule. When i first read Plato it was very hard for me to believe that this giant of intellect actually would have believed in his theory of forms and ideals, and now that i rather understand what he was after, i am quite convinced he did not but was trying to _hoodwink_ his audience.i am looking forward to reading the second part, on Hegel and Marx."},{"Title":"The Open Society and Its Enemies, Vol. 1: The Spell of Plato","review":"Yes, this is an important book, yes, Popper knows his stuff, and yes,historicism does have its flaws. Yet the other reviews here seem tomiss Popper's essential Manicheanism: his belief that there is aclearly defined intellectual/social battle of &quot;good againstevil,&quot; in which his book is a salvo for the forces of Good.Any mature human being, however, knows that the world works inshades of gray, and seldom do we encounter pure Good or Evil. Itseems that Popper cannot stop thinking of most philosophers as eitherall-good, or, in many cases, all-bad. His derisive use of&quot;German&quot; for philosophy which he thinks is Evil is a smallinsight into his excesses. (By the way, to reviewers who claimedPopper is German: No, he's Austrian, and thus probably has an axe togrind with Germans/Prussians.)Popper's treatment of Hegel leavesone with the impression that Hegel has nothing -- literally nothing --to contribute to philosophy. I just refuse to believe that. Somehave more to contribute than others, and Hegel can sometimes beunclear and self-contradictory, but to categorically dismisseverything Hegel ever wrote as complete rubbish is intellectualdishonesty of the kind Popper claims to abhor. Surely, there must beat least one small grain of wisdom in everyone's thinking, even if wedisagree with their conclusions. Too often, Popper either fails tofind this grain, or perhaps doesn't even attempt to look for it.Onthe upside, I was impressed with Popper's uncharacteristicallyevenhanded treatment of Marx. Popper writes that Marx had goodintentions, of the &quot;Open Society&quot; sort, even if he wastrapped in historicism.This is a pretty engrossing read, even ifPopper's self-righteous skewering of German (and ancient Greek)philosophers is excessive.

Popper, however, brings a number of interesting points to light, including the political careers of Plato's students, many of whom went onto to become tyrants in their own right. Indeed, it is Popper's claim that The Republic is, first and foremost, a sort of political pamphlet advocating the rule of the Philosopher King and his worthy acolytes (i.e. the Guardians). After reading Popper's thoughts, Plato's Republic seemed much more like the state in Orwell's NovelNineteen Eighty-Four. The Philosopher King also seems very much like the Secretary of the Communist Party, with the Guardians those selected for Communist Party membership. It is also worth noting that The Republic advocates a sort of totalitarian eugenics, noting that because the breeding of horses is controlled and supervised, why should not the vastly more important breeding of human beings be supervised as well?"},{"Title":"The Open Society and Its Enemies, Vol. 1: The Spell of Plato","review":"There are spots in many of The Great Books that make me want to slap the author around a little, but that's OK -- it shows I'm thinking. Such as: just what is this man's problem with Aristotle? It isn't his fault that he was born before William of Occam, was it? Besides, Popper couldn't have read \\"The Politics\\" with the care he should have, or he'd have noticed that Aristotle specifically says that the worst possible form of government is a theocracy run by an oligarchy masquerading as a democracy. Guess who he was referring to. So if Plato really was the first totaltarian theorist, it's also the case that Aristotle's line of thought eventually resulted in the American constitution. Madison knew his Aristotle better than Popper did; but I'll just write this all off to Popper's pulling a classroom outrage to see if his students are awake.So why is this books still so necessary? 1) Popper's defence of free speech and democratic process gets right in your face. Briefly: the history of science is mostly the history of peple being wrong, and since democratic process is the political equivalent to scientific method, we need democracy, not because \\"the people's will\\" is usually right, but for the reverse reason: because it's often wrong. I can't see how this can be answered. Popper shows you can be an intellectual elitist and a radic-lib populist at once. 2) Once you've \\"gotten\\" Popper, you can smell an ideologue a mile away; and just as important, you can easily grasp WHY Arendt's way of defining her terms in the monumental,and equally necesary, \\"Ideology and Terror\\" are the only appropriate way to do it. And you don't even have to slog your way through Arendt's Wagnerian prose; she was even more erudite than Popper, but she never got over being German. 3) Popper's book is a reproach to, and an antidote to, the Rousseauvian mish-mash of sentiments that liberalism seems to have become with the advent of PC. Consequently, such people as Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Ibn Warraq have taken up the Popper standard, and are carrying it into the current battle-of the-books against what Salman Rushdie calls, and rightly, \\"The New Totalitarianism.\\" Just check my review of John Esposito's recent cow-pie and you'll see why."},{"Title":"The Open Society and Its Enemies, Vol. 1: The Spell of Plato","review":"Karl Popper had two different views of the social science. The first view is the historicism view, which included the theory of Heraclitus and Platon. Heraclitus said that everything is in a state of flux and he believed in the law of fate. Platon believed in Heraclitus too. He wanted to stop the declining process by establishing the perfect state. The perfect state is the best in the line of different states. The poisoning of the perfect state shows the process of decline. In which Popper explained the theory of Platon. His forms and ideas are explaining the process. If you want to retain the perfect state, you must establish a pure race. Every form of individuality must be controlled that a degeneration of the perfect state is impossible.The open society was his second view of social science. His social technique is different from the view of Platon. It is a status quo orientated view. He thinks that every person is his owe fate and that the process of history is not predetermined from a different point in the past. He wants to create a social system which serves the people and gives them the freedom for a liberal state. He showed the differences between the closed society and the open society. The enemy of the open society is the totalitarianism. He showed it in an excellent way."},{"Title":"The Open Society and Its Enemies, Vol. 1: The Spell of Plato","review":"A co-worker recently introduced me to the works of Karl Popper. Popper's works are a devastating indictment of the enemies of human thought, who would create class conscious societies to trap the vast majority of humanity into lives of meaningless, dead-ended servitude. In the first volume of &quot;The Open Society&quot;, Popper contrasts Plato, with his contemptuous, exploitative attitude toward the masses of humanity, and his desire to impose social stagnation, to Socrates, who counseled open, unflinching search for truth, no matter where it might lead, and an acknowledgement of the inherent dignity and worth of every human being. It is especially important now to understand how tenuous is human freedom and how inextricably it is linked to the concepts of justice, and equal opportunity for every human being, and how devastating and horrific our lives would become should we lose the freedoms granted by an open society."},{"Title":"The Open Society and Its Enemies, Vol. 1: The Spell of Plato","review":"I wish Popper were still alive because there are so FEW philosophers who can write so clearly.Volume 1 of the Open Society is a critique of historicism and an analysis of how Plato's later thought supports totalitarianism, not democracy.Popper presents a convincing argument about the danger of deifying philosophers of the past. He shows how some of the ideas of Plato are imbedded in our culture in ways that do not always support an Open Society, by which he means not only democracy but a society that is OPEN to learning from its mistakes and adapting to change.If you are interested in political philosophy or the interaction of philosopy and society, this book is worth your time."},{"Title":"The Open Society and Its Enemies, Vol. 1: The Spell of Plato","review":"For most intellectuals, Popper's research would have been a lifetime of intellectual heavy lifting. But then Popper takes a fillet knife to the murkiest parts of western philosphy, gives it the death of a thousand cuts, and rubs it with salt. And he does it with a combination of good cheer, scientific precision, and a strong dose of scorn.Popper's critique of Utopian philosophies is straightforward - in a world of mandatory equality and tribal life, there are only peasants. But with no way to excel, the only other career choice is to be a dictator. And since Utopia demands the destruction of imperfect democratic institutions, the seeds of post-Utopian terror are there from the start. Although Popper was largely concerned with Facism, he'd have been right at home in today's world of yuppie ecoterrorists and ethnic cleansing. People that romanticize some sort of modern tribal life don't understand that tribal life means war and hatred. Or, as Popper suggests, they really just an outlet that lets them vent their hatreds while sounding noble.The overwhelming thing about this books is the depth and breadth of Popper's research. This book leaves the reader with a better understanding of human nature, history, philosophy, and politics. It's a book that truely educates. So Popper gives the best of both worlds - on the one hand there is the pleasure of watching a true master dismantle dangerous popular opinions with a wicked intensity. And on the other hand, it also a critical analysis of philosophy and politics that makes William F. Buckley sound like Forrest Gump.If this were a CD, the hidden &quot;bonus track&quot; would be Poppers analysis of how an economy would handle prosperity.

Popper's view is that such theories are not only wrong (his view of history is that it has no &quot;meaning&quot;) but also dangerous as they can be used as a rationale for the suppression of free institutions in the name of ideology. &quot;...if our civilization is to survive, we must break with the habit of deference to great men.

However I do find myself wondering if Mr. Enigl has seriously read this book? Popper, while certainly an enemy of totalitarianism was not at all an enemy of the use of state power. In fact in several places of the book he deals with the pardox of complete freedom. In particular I would reference this following:&quot;I believe that the injustice and inhumanity of the unrestrained 'capitalist system' described by Marx cannot be questioned; but it can be interpreted in terms of what we called, in a previous chapter, the paradox of freedom. Freedom, we have seen, defeats itself, if it is unlimited. Unlimited freedom means that a strong man is free to bully one who is weak and to rob him of his freedom. This is why we demand that the state should limit freedom to a certain extent, so that everyone's freedom is protected by law. Nobody should be at the mercy of others, but all should have a right to be protected by the state.Now I believe that these considerations, originally meant to apply to the realm of brute-force, of physically intimidation, must be applied to the economic realm also. Even if the state protects its citizens from being bullied by physical violence (as it does, in principle, under the system of unrestrained capitalism), it may defeat our ends by its failure to protect them from the misuse of economic power. In such a state, the economically strong is still free to bully one who is economically weak, and to rob him of his freedom. Under these circumstances, unlimited economic freedom can be just as self-defeating as unlimited physical freedom, and economic power may be nearly as dangerious as physical violence; for those who possess as surplus of food can force who are starving into a 'freely' accepted servitude, without using violence. And assuming that the state limits its activities to the suppression of violence (and to the protection of properly), a minority which is economically strong may in this way exploit the majority of those who are economically weak. &quot;"},{"Title":"The Open Society and Its Enemies, Vol. 1: The Spell of Plato","review":"Popper, writing in the depths of World War II, produced a triumphant retort to the forces of absolutism and illiberality then all-too evident in the world. Its relevance has not diminished with time; if anything, the book has greater power today, when we have both the lessons of the past to learn from and the threat of the future to confront. His criticisms of Plato are particularly brilliant. In school, I was taught that Plato was a \\"hero in democracy\\"- no person who has read Popper's book could maintain that view. In \\"The Open Society and its Enemies,\\" he systematically examines and demolishes the persistent and pernicious arguments against democracy, crushing assumptions yet doing so with such relentless logic that the truth of his statements cannot be denied. All this is delivered in a style which is at once erudite and scrupulously documented yet also eminently readable: his arguments draw you in, and even if you are not a student of philosophy, the appeal of his writing is sufficient to maintain interest."},{"Title":"The Open Society and Its Enemies, Vol. 1: The Spell of Plato","review":"Karl Popper was one of the most important philosophers of the 20th century. In The Open Society and It's Enemies he presents not only the case for democracy (an open society) but also the case against tyranny (a closed society), no matter how benevolent any given tyranny purports to be. Popper also explains why many people are still attracted to tyranical forms of government -- whether fascist or communist. Such people prefer order to freedom. One of the paradoxes presented by Popper is that some degree of inefficiency is endemic to democracy, whereas highly-efficient government -- which many people think they want -- is almost invariably tyrannical. This book is a must read for everyone interested in maintaining individual freedom and understanding the threats which it constantly faces."},{"Title":"The Open Society and Its Enemies, Vol. 1: The Spell of Plato","review":"The Open Society and its Enemies is a beautiful defence of human freedom written in majestic prose by one of the few indisputably great thinkers of the century. The prose style is a sheer delight. Popper writes with vividness and clarity in the service of high ideals. His work is a vital antidote to those many thinkers, especially on the post-Sartrean Left, who destroy forests in order to promote painfully turgid and woolly views which - on the rare occasions when they are understandable at all - turn out to be the bedrock for people who hate freedom. Fortunately, Popper's book is taken very seriously, a testament to the diminishing power of such ideas."},{"Title":"The Open Society and Its Enemies, Vol. 1: The Spell of Plato","review":"Writing close to the time of the Anschluss in his native Austria, Popper had reason to see the threat to open society as pressing. It is all the more interesting, then, that he devotes an entire volume to the Platonic roots of authoritarian statism and social conservatism. Fascism is a slippery beast and not easily pigeon-holed, but Popper reminds us with drive and clarity that the threat to open society and the drive towards statism in his time was as much a creature of the socially conservative right as of the revolutionary left. Indeed, he actually seems more concerned with conservative statism than with communism, which I must say came as a surprise.Popper has accrued an air of gravitas, so I was pleasantly surprised to find this work plain, readable and admirably clear. The casual reader might question the relevance of Socrates and Plato in the modern political world, but I think Popper makes a strong case that Plato laid the foundations for hereditary authority, the divine rights of rulers and a fear of change which continues to resonate to this day. He also, in effect, lays an accusation of treachery at Plato's feet - of having defamed the principled legacy of Socrates' individualism to argue for the rights of kings and slavers. While he also exonerates him as nobly motivated, Plato's reputation makes this a potent poison and the accusation sticks. Socrates died for his individualism; by the time Popper is finished one suspects that Plato would have manned the gas ovens to prevent it spreading.If I have quibbles with Popper, they are with his equivocation about Bolshevism and his sentimental attitude to Christianity. Also, does not Nazism show that absolute sovereignty can, in fact, be ceded to a leader by an act of will? On the other hand, he scores with some insights which I really felt hit home - that we should moralise politics rather than politicising morals, a totalitarian urge very apparent today; that a democrat who cannot distinguish a friendly from a hostile criticism of democracy is himself imbued with the totalitarian spirit; that Plato's essentialism conflates essential nature with ultimate origin and thus entails historicism, the rationale of both fascism and communism - Romanticism and the myth of the Golden Age are dangerous.Plato sanctified the attempts by the Dorians, including the Sparta so admired by the last century's fascists, to ossify the structure of society and weld it into the state. From the God-given rights of princes and laws to fairly recent racist and social-Darwinistic justifications for slavery, this urge still echoes. The original state of society is the pure state, so change represents degeneration. In this way, Popper pins down the source of the historicism that crushes the spirit by denying human progress. What remains to be covered is the historicism that crushes the spirit by mandating it.This review refers to the Routledge Classics paperback issue, ISBN 978-0-415-23731-4"},{"Title":"The Secret Life of a Satanist: The Authorised Biography of Anton LaVey","review":"I also read The Devil's Avenger, by Burton Wolfe (1974), and experienced extreme deja vu.

However, it was seen in the 19th century as Eliot's masterpiece. Some of the blame for the novel going out of fashion must rest with F.R. Leavis who said that &quot;few will want to read Romola a second time, and few can ever have got through it once without some groans.&quot; If Leavis, viewed as one of the great literary minds, thinks this, then more average readers like us are bound to be put off.True, the start of Romola is bogged down in detail, but it is introduced by a wonderful, stirring and majestic 'Proem' which sees the Angel of the Dawn sweeping across the Earth and loftily states how humanity is the same now as it was when Romola is set. After this, the notes are best ignored - consult them separately, and concentrate on getting into the book. It is a stirring and sometimes hard read, and moves one with awe at what Eliot has created - you really feel you are experiencing Florence in the 15th century. There is one scene that stands out for me - the haunting and almost surreal episode where Romola drifts by boat to an apparent coastal haven. Images of peace and life are reversed disturbingly.So ignore Leavis and the dissenters. If you've read another Eliot, you'll like it. If you haven't, maybe start with something else, but come back, for it's a rewarding read"},{"Title":"Romola","review":"George Eliot spent two years preparing &quot;Romola&quot;, and the result is a rich, densely detailed &quot;Tale of the Renaissance&quot;. Never a facile writer, here she is concerned with one of the most intellectually challenging (not to mention politically complicated) periods in history; and she paints the panoply and power struggles as a background for the personal tragedy which is the novel's crux. While not an &quot;easy read&quot; in the Sir Walter Scott sense, &quot;Romola&quot; presents in sumptous detail the banquets, the festivities, and the famous bonfire of vanities that one associates with late 15th Century Florence.But from a purely literary viewpoint, the most important thing about the book is its delineation of Tito Melema, the young man who in the opening chapters is the story's hero, but slowly, irrevocably becomes its villain. Neither Sir Walter nor Charles Dickens has psychological insight (in the modern sense) as sharp as George Eliot's, and this study of a fictional character's downfall is one of the most stunning depictions of corruption in English literature. That he is the husband of the heroine, a sensitive, finely sensual woman, makes the tragedy all the more poignant. Scenes involving historical characters (including Savonarola and Machiavelli) tend to be a little stiff in costume movie style. Oh, and because the story takes place in the 1490's, one must imagine the Piazza della Signoria without Michelangelo and Cellini. This must really have frustrated a connoisseur like George Eliot."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"Given the majority of Eliot readers begin with Middlemarch, I found myself in the unique position of not only beginning with Romola, but also on a subject that I find most interesting. That of Renaissance Italy. Beginning at the death of the great Lorenzo di Medici in '92 I read this great novel twice. Once quickly as any other Twenty-First century paperback; the second, slowly, with more respect for the intellectual scope within the pages.After the first attempt I was mildly disappointed. I came away with no true sense of the whole that is fifteenth century Florence and a bewilderment at the inconsistent central characterisation of Tito Melema and his golden-haired wife, Romola. The supporting actors were brilliant, from Fra Girolama's fantatical Catholicism to Bratti's salesmanship. But I was left disappointed, believing in the superficality of Tito, the maddening naivety of Tessa, and the almost puritanical martyrdom of Romola.So I re-read it. Slowly.It is now extremely clear why this great work of english literature is, as Eliot herself puts it, a \\"book of mine which I more thoroughly feel that I swear by every sentence as having been written with my best blood\\".Each scene is mesmerically depicted, the infintesimal attention to details and Eliot's total control of her subject matter shines through.Renaissance Florence wasn't so well depicted by its contemporaries.From Tito's waking at the Loggia de' Cerchi to his final fall at the Ponte Vecchio his character moves through a full range as you would expect from a man in his early twenties. His child-like mesmerism coupled with his Greek tutorage gives rise to a cherubic man whom Florence loves. His fatal flaw is his desire for love and a single terrible lie he gives that, like Murphy's Law, evolves into a a stigma that alters his very persona. What is all the more damaging is that you truly believe he is unaware of the pain he causes. He is truly egocentric, in an almost blameless way. For Romola, you cold argue the opposite. Indeed she is potentially more culpable. Her fierce intellectualism is offset by a descent into a world of religious supersition, a world where religion is used as a political tool. Throughout she has the knowledge of where her actions will take her and a terrible sense of duty and restrains her. From the beginning, with the story we hear so often of Tito's escape from drowning, to his final near drowning at the hands of the mob, to his strangulation by his father there is a certain bitter justice until all that he leaves is his proud and world-scarred wife Romola and the innocence that he preserved with Tessa. Tito's move from innocent 'hero' to startled villain is an excerise in human failings. Yet it is not a sufficient single human tragedy, as Eliot says, \\"Florence was busy with greater affairs, and the preparation of a deeper tragedy\\".In many respects \`Romola' is Eliot's King Lear. The parallels are many, including Baldessare's depiction. There is no Edgar, nor Edmund but the Fool is here in many guises. In taking one of Shakespeare's finest themes, Eliot has given true life to fifteenth century Florence and it is, perhaps, best encapsulated by Romola's final statement to Tessa's son, Lillo:\\"There was a man to whom I was very near... who made almost everyone fond of him, for he ws young, and clever, and beautiful...I believe, when I first knew him, he never thought of anything cruel or base. But because he tried to slip away from everything that was unpleasant, and cared for nothing else so much as his own safety, he came at last to commit some of the basest deeds - such as make men infamous.\\"So, Eliot's \`Romola'. Read it, delight in it because it truly is, as the author can rightly claim, one of the finest works in english literature."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"Yes, it bristles with Glossaries and Appendices and Notes like so much barbed wire. (And if you actually read the Penguin editor's introduction, it's a sure thing you'll never read the novel: she makes it sound like about as much fun as chewing rocks.) But don't let all that deter you. You may have some rough going at the beginning, mostly because Latin and Greek scholarship is so important to the plot. Use the notes and they'll enhance your enjoyment of the story, but ignore them and you're still in for a thrilling tale gorgeously told. Tito Melema is one of the great characters in fiction, and he's someone we all know: a thoroughly despicable human being who has no idea he's anything but a nice guy. Eliot has wrought a dreamy and hair-raising hybrid of fiction and history, infused with her own astonishing insight and complicated sympathy and delivered in her matchless prose. I loved this book."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"Romola was a difficult book to read. If I did not happen to be on a business trip that left me long hours on seemingly endless international flights, I doubt if I would have had the perseverance to stick with it. In writing this book, Eliot spent six months in exhaustive research on fifteenth century Florence, and she is going to give it all to you whether you like it or not. This made it difficult to enjoy because I was constantly going to the back of the book get the translation of Italian and Latin phrases, reference to obscure historical characters, and other minutia which would only be clear to someone with a doctorate in Italian history. I was frustrated by this throughout the book. Having said that, the book is worth the wade! As always Eliot's writing is a pure joy to read. Some of her description is so beautiful that I have to step back in wonder that someone can create narrative so rich and inviting. Her characters are complex, intriguing and well developed. First, Tito was the most original antihero I have run across in years: a man who avoids unpleasantness and discomfort to the point that he betrays anyone he has ever loved while intending only to take the easy way in all his dealings. Romola is a women deeply learned, but raised only by her aging father and the classics, is unprepared for what the fates have brought her: love, duplicity, and purpose. And lastly, Savonarola, Tito's opposite: a religious visionary who strives to lead Florence to a new order, and is willing to give up church, state---anything but his place in the order, to see his prophecy fulfilled. This is Eliot's favorite book. I can see why."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"Funny how Eliot's least-loved novel today was the author's personal favorite and her best seller during her lifetime. How did it slide into relative obscurity? Partly because Eliot's acknowleged forte is her depiction of rural life in Victorian England, whereas this novel is set in a large Italian city (Florence) during the Renasaissance. Also, the novel does bog down a bit in its own scholarliness, as nearly every reviewer has mentioned. Still, the innumerable references to prominent Florentines can be glossed over without losing much. As for the urban setting, Eliot's Florence is every bit as vivid as Dickens' London, or Dostoevsky's St. Petersburg. And, of course, every page is filled with Eliot's trademark wisdom.For anyone who cares about great books, all seven of Eliot's novels are absolutely mandatory. So, by all means start with \\"Adam Bede\\" or \\"Middlemarch\\", but don't neglect \\"Romola.\\"A word about the Konneman edition: I love the compact format (It fits easily into a briefcase or purse), the lovely cover art and the high-quality cloth binding. Be advised, however, that it is loaded with typos, some of them hilarious. It's still a good buy, however."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"When one starts reading a Victorian novelist, one prepares before hand to face a certain amount of wooden, heavy-handed moralizing, as every great narrative of the epoch is fraught with the opposition between the calls of pleasure and the calls of duty, between seeking for one's private advantage and sticking to one's role, with the writer making the latter to win overwhelming. This novel is no different, in that it's the dutiful Romola that has the upper hand over her nice and debauched husband Tito Melena in the end. However, the novel being set in late Renaissance Italy- a country with which George Eliot had an enduring love affair - it captures the atmosphere of the time and place in such a beautiful way that this enormous, throughly reserched historical novel has such a flowing, luxurious style that takes an almost liquid quality, like a fresh, transparent scream flowing along a summer Mediterranean landscape. Also, in the person of Savonarola, Eliot menaged to introduce the figure of the idealist turned evil through his attachment to his call. In short: a gorgeous novel. Loved it!"},{"Title":"Romola","review":"I loved this book! Set in fifteenth century Florence, Romola explores the deep recesses of the soul. Renaissance Italy with its political/religious conflicts, intellectual, pursuits, artistry and pageantry are all beautifully protrayed throughout Eliot's magnificent love story. Deceit, greed and selfishness are artfully displayed against the purity of a nobel soul which knows no compromise. Romola, the book's main character is a study in virtue, while Tito her husband has but the veneer of goodness. Tito falls forever because of one lie. This is a book to read slowly and savor."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"A book with unforgettable characters - in Tito who demonstrates the degeneration of the soul in the pursuit of money and an ideal character in Romola who personifies duty. This book characterizes George Eliot's concept of truth. Truth according to her is not only what is real, but also, what should be. Another character who fascinates is Savonarola - we see him as a human being, with strengths and weaknesses. And Eliot teaches us to be like Romola - to appreciate the good in a human being instead of damming him completely. Along with true to life characters, ideal characters,historical characters, also a superb depiction of rennaisance Italy. Whatever critics say about 'Romola' being the least readable of all Eliot's books, it remains her most idealistic work which makes one feel deeply, and want to emulate the good. Hence, a great classic which is enjoyable and which sets you thinking about your own inadequacies."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"Romola is a dense, compelling historical novel by the master of English fiction, George Eliot. Although this book is a bit slow going at first, the true-to-life characters and the towering themes make the reader's efforts more than worthwhile. Like the great film &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman,&quot; this novel deals with love, betrayal, parenthood, revenge, greed, spirituality, religion, and deceit, in ways that seem remarkably modern. I read it three times!"},{"Title":"Romola","review":"Let me first say that there is much to love here. Truly! The first fifty or so pages felt interminable, but once past that point the book becomes a veritable page turner.Eliot crafts a fascinating, first-rate historical fiction plot based in Florence, Italy, from the death of Lorenzo de' Medici (in 1492), through the time of Savonarola's influence, and culminating in an epilogue placed in 1509. In the midst of this tumultuous social situation is placed our heroine, Romola. The daughter of a scholar, Romola herself is very well educated for a woman of her time. This novel follows Romola through six complex post-de'Medici years of Florentine politics, further inflamed by the preachings of Savonarola, a Dominican friar. As the plot swells in complexity, the gentle woman transitions from being her father's daughter, to her husband's wife, to a woman meeting life head on with a dignity of her own merit. Possessed of a fast moving, labyrinthine plot, this novel, despite its length of just over 600 pages, keeps up a taut pace until the very end.As might be expected in a novel named after a character, this one, despite the enticing plot, is very rooted in its performers. Romola is a central figure, but by no means the only one. Eliot pulls some of her players direct from the history books and some from her imagination, but each and every one of them feels so genuine that it is difficult to know which really lived and breathed and which only ever lived within her pages. This is the type of book that has you googling purely imaginative personages-because they are portrayed with such authenticity.Florence of the late fifteenth century is very well depicted: the pageantry of her holidays (including a fantastic description of Savonarola's Bonfire of the Vanities); the dress, habits, and occupations of her various classes; and the architectural details of her stone edifices. As you wander the streets with the novel's inhabitants you are drawn into her neighborhoods, with their chaos, aromas, and idiosyncrasies.So why a relatively low three star rating? Because the prose is so dense that it left me wallowing somewhere between philosophy text and nineteenth century history tome. For some reason, I had to work exceptionally hard to remain focused on reading the words themselves and concentrate with that little bit of extra grey matter to wrap my mind around what exactly was being expressed. Was it worth it? Well, yes, as my clear admiration for the book's merits shows; however, I can not say that I \\"really liked\\" (four stars) or \\"loved\\" (five stars) a book which required so much effort. So, three stars, a simple \\"liked\\" verdict, it is for this work. This is definitely not a book for someone unused to literature of the Victorian era, as, in my opinion, this novel is some of the least accessible writing from that time frame."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"In my opinion, this is a must-read for anyone who has ever been to Florence. I read it while there for three months on a study abroad program and loved it. If I had never been there or had no knowledge of the history of the city, the novel wouldn't have been as interesting. It is hard to believe that it was written in the 19th century and not during the renaissance as an eye witness account. Elliot's knowledege of Florentine history and her use of real historical characters in the text is amazing. The story starts off very slow at first but then sucks you in. It seems to keep getting more and more dramatic and then concludes with a very satisfying ending."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"It's as sentimental as you would expect, but the writing is glorious.

I'm even inspired to find out more about a historical period that's not really one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"Romola was published in \\"The Cornhill\\" magazine in 14 parts from July 1862 to August 1863. It is George Eliot's foray into the realm of historical fiction made popular by the earlier novels of Sir Walter Scott. Eliot is a great English novelists known for such classics as Adam Bede; The Mill on the Floss; Felix Holt; Middlemarch (her masterpiece), Scenes of Clerical Life and Daniel Deronda. Romala is the only novel she wrote not set in the British Isles. It is her least popular and known work though she considered it her favorite. The book is lengthy and intricate in its recounting of the life of the title heroine Romola in fifteenth century Florence. The major players are:Romola Bardi: She is the idealistic daughter of a blind scholar Bardo de Bardi. She falls in love with the young and amoral Tito Melema a Greek who has arrived in Florence. Tito is the assistant to Bardo in the latter's classical studies. Tito sells the precious classical library of Bardo. Tito's selfish character is revealed to Romola who leaves Florence for a short time in utter despair. Savanarola persuades her to return to the city.Tito also betrays Bernado del Nero one of five men executed by the government. Bernado is the godfather of Romola and dies before her eyes in a gruesome beheading. Romola learns that Tito was instrumental in the arrest and death of del Nero. Romola becomes a supporter of Savanrola as she ministers to the poor. She also learns of his adultery.Tito Melema: Handsome husband of Romola who has a second family with the poor girl Tess. (she has two children by Tito). Tito is a schemer and adulterer who is ambitious for fame and fortune. He has stolen money and abandoned to slavery his stepfather Baldassarri. Baldassarri tracks down Tito with murder in his heart. Baldassari reveals the deep and sinful past of Tito to Romola.I do not agree that the characters in this novel are flat. Villains like Tito and Baldassarri are well drawn as is Romala. Eliot was the first great psychological novelist in English influencing such writers as Henry James.Savanorola is the real life religious reformer who seeks to clean up decadent Florence. He is famous for the bonfire of vanities in which Florentines threw away many luxury items in an effort to become more faithful to God. The reformer was burned at the stake in 1498.The City of Florence is a character during these turbulent times. Pietro de Medic the ruler of Florence has died and the French army under Charles VIII has become an occupying power. The League of Venice declares war on the French and Florentines. Hunger and plague run rampant through the streets of Florence on the Arno River. The political machinations are hard to follow. Machiavelli the real life author of \\"The Prince\\": appears in the book.The novel concludes with the death of Savanarola and Tito. Romola has taken Tessa and her two children under her wing. Romola, like George Eliot, is a kind woman who learns the secret to life is helping others as a good samaritan. She has emerged from her personal tragedies to become a wonderful woman. The Penguin edition contains a definition of many Italian words and phrases used in Romola, textual emendations made to the manuscript and an incisive and helpful introduction. Penguins are the best paperbacks for classics!George Eliot and her lover George Henry Lewes did a great deal of on site research in Florence; read deeply in the politics of the Renaissance era and put that knowledge to work in Romola. The book is a classic which tells a fascinating story. Like all of George Eliot's works it is a gem in the literary crown of the author. Romola is hard reading but the story is compellinig and it is worth your time and effort."},{"Title":"Freedom Is For Those Willing to Defend It: Stories of Men in War","review":"I recommend this book.

Confabulation, the topic discussed in the book is one that was completely new to this reviewer, but the preface and jacket summary motivated the subject in a way that definitely convinces the reader that it is relevant to both neuroscience and neurophilosophy. It is important to emphasize that both of these fields are used to discuss confabulation in the book. The author is a professional philosopher, but he makes heavy use of the latest research in neuroscience, and this is refreshing, for it makes his conclusions more credible, not being ones that are arrived at solely (and therefore incorrectly), through sophisticated rhetoric and from the safety of the academic armchair.As a phenomenon in the human mind, confabulation is rather disconcerting, and one can only feel extreme empathy for those who are afflicted with it. The author discusses several different cases of confabulation, including Korsakoff's syndrome, anosognosia, Anton's syndrome, and Capgras' syndrome. He also gives an extensive discussion of the different explanations for confabulation by various researchers. Many of these explanations are interesting, such as the one that connects confabulation with the human storytelling. Individuals concoct stories in order to engage in self-protection and self-definition, and consequently define, however inaccurately, their identities. This can be done without conscious deliberation, and its function is to solidify the personal identity of the narrator.Another interesting explanation for confabulation that is discussed in the book considers the time scales needed for individuals to formulate decisions and then act on them. If these time scales are very short, the decision-maker cannot consider all possibilities, and minute concentration to detail is prohibited. Therefore the human mind will omit these details, eliminate any feelings of doubt from the cognitive process, and concentrate on the \\"big picture.\\" Confabulation is then essentially a smoothing function, a large-scale manifestation of this process.For the author though, confabulation is a process that cannot only be studied empirically, but can also be connected with epistemological issues in philosophy. When confabulating, the human brain is unable to check whether an answer is not real. He attempts to justify his theories by using what is known in neuroscience, with the specific goal of showing that the brain's ability to construct an appropriate response is independent of its ability to check that response.Since the author is a professional philosopher, and not a neuroscientist, readers of a more scientific persuasion may be concerned that the discussion on epistemology will degrade into sophistry. Refreshingly though it does not, for the author gives a fascinating discussion of confabulation as an \\"epistemic phenomenon,\\" but integrating it with the neuroscience of confabulation. Two epistemic mistakes are made when confabulation is present argues the author. The first one occurs in a particular knowledge domain in which a process causes a thought to occur that is \\"ill-grounded\\". The second mistake is the result of the failure to self-correct, this process of self-correction occurring in the frontal regions of the brain. All cases of confabulation involve these two mistakes argues the author, and he connects his assertions with the more general field of naturalized epistemology, the latter of which was put on a more rigorous foundation by the philosophers Alvin Goldman and W.V.O. Quine. These philosophical musings are necessary argues the author, for they allow one to distinguish between \\"well-grounded\\" and \\"ill-grounded\\" beliefs, which one must do if a successful explanation of confabulation is to be obtained. The biology of the brain though must enter into any of this theorizing, for as has been shown experimentally, damage to the areas of the brain responsible for the construction of knowledge domains, along with damage to the monitoring processes in the orbitofrontal areas of the brain, can result in confabulation.Most interesting in this discussion on confabulation and knowledge is the author's contention that the construction of effective representations by the human brain takes place in degrees. He then discusses an appropriate consequence of this assertion, which he calls the \`degraded representation principle.' This principle asserts that if the capacity to represent events of a certain type is diminished in a particular individual, then the likelihood for this individual to confabulate about these events increases.Self-deception, a \\"lighter\\" manifestation of confabulation is discussed at the end of the book, and is, one could argue, the most prevalent form of confabulation. The author does distinguish it from clinical confabulation, and after reading this chapter this demarcation becomes justified. The person who is engaging in self-deception frequently has a greater ability to access the information that is needed to prove his belief is ill-grounded. A clinical confabulator though does not, as the processes and brain areas needed for this proof have been destroyed. Various degrees of tension also exist in the range from that of the clinical confabulator, who experiences none when making ill-grounded claims, to that of the self-deceiver who may experience a lot.As an example of self-deception, the author offers the educator who describes himself as being better than their colleagues. It is interesting that he chose this example, since it seems that this form of self-deception is the rule rather than the exception in the halls of academia, at least from an anecdotal standpoint. This inflated view though is accompanied by the \\"weakness of the warrant\\", wherein the justification or \\"warrant\\" for the belief is very weak. An individual engaged in self-deception has beliefs that are not constructed from the most reliable collection of beliefs that his brain could deliver if it was not crippled by self-deception. The issue of course here, as it is throughout the book, concerns the human need for belief systems that can be justified or warranted. As the author points out early in the book, the avoidance of confabulation must have an evolutionary importance for the well being of the human species. Time constraints and resources though may prohibit an exhaustive check of all assumptions and beliefs."},{"Title":"Brain Fiction : Self-Deception and the Riddle of Confabulation (Philosophical Psychopathology)","review":"I was attracted to the book by a review I read in (I think it was) Science, and the topic of self-deception and confabulation. As an attorney the ability to understand the factors that influence the articulated perceptions of witnesses is critical to me. As a scientist reading outside his field (physics) I was attracted by the idea of relating behavior to brain structure.I was rewarded in the first four chapters by being able to glean a general idea about how some types of brain damage can be related to behavior. However the author's efforts to illustrate the book and describe the affected areas was hampered by his adoption without apparent modification of images from other sources that were not carefully related to the text they were intended to illustrate. I found myself attempting, with little success, to make sense of the text and the illustrations by reference to my copy of Gray's anatomy.The problem became worse in the later chapters where the author goes into great detail on each of the syndromes by which he attempts to demonstrate his hypothesis. I eventually gave up trying to follow the arguments, lost in the morass of poorly related detail.It may be that a person familiar with the structure of the organ and the nomenclature can better use of this book, but without some external reference the non-specialist is going to have a hard go. Maybe a sceond edition could incorporate a chapter on these topics."},{"Title":"Brain Fiction : Self-Deception and the Riddle of Confabulation (Philosophical Psychopathology)","review":"When asked to pick a book related to neuroscience, I was interested in finding one that was able to relate the two fields that I am interested in; neuroscience and neuropsychology. This book does a great job of relating these two fields in the explanation of confabulation and self-deception. Although this book was a somewhat difficult read, the topics discussed throughout the book are extremely thought-provoking. The detailed descriptions of examples of confabulation in patients along with the idea of self-deception in normal people, really made me think about all of the ways I have exhibited these same types of symptoms. Using these patient accounts, he is able to describe and thoroughly explain his definition of confabulation as \\"lying without the intent or knowledge that one is actually lying.\\"In the more scientific field of neuroscience, Hirstein describes confabulation with a set of syndromes that express confabulation. For example, in a patient with Korsakoff's syndrome, autobiographical memory is disrupted, so that this person will create confabulations to questions about themselves; how old are you, what did you do last night, and so on... There are also some other neurological syndromes defining confabulation such a anosognosia (denial of illness), Anton's syndrome (denial of blindness), and Capgras's delusion (the delusion that people to whom the patient is close have been replaced by impostors). Looking at these different disorders, Hirstein is able to come to conclusions as to where in the brain confabulation may originate, by looking at where the brain damage takes place in these patients.In the neuropsychology field, Hirstein explains the process by which confabulation may occur. He states that there are two pathways by which our brains create a hypothesis. First, the brain generates a plausible hypothesis. Second, the brain checks this hypothesis with memory and knowledge that that person has. For a person to confabulate, both of these pathways must be damaged. For a person who is performing self-deception, there is no damage to these pathways, yet the checking process is somehow not being used. An interesting statistic used in the book was the fact that 94% of educators describe themselves as better at their job than the average colleague. Thus, obviously these educators have a self-deception rate of 44%.What I really enjoyed about this book was how the author relates a normal person's self-deception to the clinically impaired confabulators. Hierstein suggests that there is very little difference between these two ideas, that the only difference between confabulation and self-deception is the confidence with which a person makes a claim. Confabulators have complete confidence in their claims, because their checking process' are damaged. Those who self-deceive have the ability to use memory and knowledge that may decrease this confidence in their own claims.Although this book was exceedingly informative, I did have some problems with the way it was written. The amount of detail on each topic made the book feel very long and repetitive. I felt like, in many instances, the author kept repeating generalizations without ever making any new inferences to the overall goal of explaining confabulation. Also, although the author hints at an overall theory that may explain confabulation, the book is mostly references of incidents where confabulation occurs. Entire chapters are dedicated to these incidents, with very little conclusions made.Overall, this book was an interesting read. The accounts told of patients who display confabulation are extremely fascinating. Hierstein is able to relate both confabulation and normal self-deception, but makes a very loose overall confabulation theory. I recommend this book for those who would like to learn more about how we create self-deceptions in our everyday lives and how specific syndromes cause people to confabulate. But an answer to the question of confabulation is mostly filled with more hypotheses and more questions."},{"Title":"Argumentation and Debate (with InfoTrac ) (Wadsworth Series in Communication Studies)","review":"This book is recommended by Professor David Zarefsky, a Professor of Argumentation and Debate and Professor of Communication Studies at Northwestern University.

This book does not contain any of the vital information so essential to the modern, discerning, travelling diver. There is no information about; travel agencies, airlines, airport tax, Tourist Board details, hotels, safari boats, available equipment, what to bring, what to wear, electricity, currency, language, time differences, photography, local traders - and if I missed anything, yet again, we have a book which missed everything.A look at the diving content reveals difficulties with the English Language from the very beginning. This is because of the Publisher's own brand of \\"Italian-English\\" which makes you want to throw the book away. In addition, the Authors cannot make up their mind whether to use the spelling is Gobal or Gubal so they use both. Similarly, the correct spelling of the Egyptian shipwreck \\"Ghiannis D\\" is Giannis D and the Sudanese \\"Blue Bell\\" is actually the Blue Belt. It is high time this Publisher - with so many titles on the market, found someone to translate their works to \\"English-English\\" - or is it lack of research?Sadly, one of the very few interesting things about this book is comparing how they have changed their depiction of the Thistlegorm over four books. This particular version shows an artist's impression of a ship that bears no resemblance to the Thistlegorm whatsoever and even includes Battle Tanks - complete with long barrels strewn over the seabed. For the record, there never were any Tanks on board the Thistlegorm! Similarly, the pictures of the Carnatic and Giannis D (I am using the correct spelling.) look nothing like the wrecks I have come to know so well. With further basic inaccuracies on other shipwrecks, any reader must be left wondering just how much of this book \\"is\\" factually correct?Altogether, I find it a great pity that a format with such great potential is being misused in such a way. Another example is the way in which the maps are drawn. Wherever I have travelled all maps are shown with North being at the top of the page. On p. 71 of this book, however, the \\"North Pointer\\" is shown pointing south-east, on p.73 it is pointing north, but on p.77 it is pointing south - and that from 3 consecutive sites taken at random.The book's one redeeming feature, however, is a very high standard of photography - for which the book retains it's one star rating. What a pity such excellent photography is wasted on such an abysmal product.NM"},{"Title":"DK Readers: Movie Magic (Level 3: Reading Alone)","review":"This fascinating and fact-filled book is graced with the outstanding production we've come to expect from publisher Dorling Kindersley: Smooth, thick paper, thorough coverage, interesting sidebars, and rich color illustrations (and some photos).

The author, a once dedicated Communist himself, shows how millions of Soviet citizens were arrested, tortured into \\"confessing\\" various \\"crimes against the state\\" and imprisoned for long periods to satisfy Josef Stalin's paranoia concerning the threat posed by his \\"enemies\\" both real and imagined. His personal experience forms the basis for this saga, perhaps, the saddest of all time.Solzhenitsyn takes the reader through the arrest and brutal interrogation process that broke the strongest of men. He then carries them with him in grossly overcrowded \\"Stolypin\\" prison rail cars and prison ships called \\"Black Maria's\\" into transit camps where prisoners were deprived of almost all the basic necessities of life. God help the attractive, female prisoner sentenced to ride in either!At the transit camps prisoners are fed only \\"gruel\\" which often had to be eaten by hand as no eating utensils were provided. The strongest men ate well. The weak starved. A trip to the latrine was the highlight of ones day! Almost unbelievable is the fact, the worst was yet to come.Life in the camps was unbearably hard. Prisoners performed back-breaking labor including digging canals and logging forests by hand in sub-zero temperatures wearing only summer weight clothing. Their \\"crimes:\\" One man got a tenner (i.e. a ten year prison sentence) for being the first to stop applauding after a Stalin speech. Others included being a Priest/Nun who refused to renounce his/her faith. A third was being female and telling a State Security Officer, \\"No!\\" A Soviet jailer said it best: \\"The punishment for doing absolutely nothing is ten years!\\"Archipelago is the work that showed the world the difference between what Communism promised and what it actually delivered. It deserves recognition as one of the most effective pieces of social literature ever published and serves as a tribute to the millions who perished under the most repressive regime of all time. It should be required reading for everyone aspiring to a government leadership position because, God forbid, it CAN happen again! Five Stars!!Harold Y. Grooms"},{"Title":"The Gulag Archipelago 1918-1956 I-II","review":"I read this book, both volumes and part of the third, years ago in the wake of this work becoming a political slogan and football bandied about so much during the Reagan years, as it turns out by people who obviously had not read it. While intially approaching that task with some skepticism, I quickly concluded that it was very well written and informed, being worth the time spent in reading it.\\"Gulag\\" is an acronym in Russian for an agency that was known as the Central Administration of Corrective Labor Camps which the author, a former Red Army officer, entered in 1945 as a \\"zek\\" or prisoner. The book(s) is a very absorbing chronicle of the history of this system in general and through the personal stories of specific individuals that became known to the author. While Solshinitsyn is very explicit, obviously, in making his bitterly and well earned anti-communist outlook known, this work is not a hysterial rant or screed, but a serious memoir and work of historical literature, one that is neither boring nor tendentious. Moreover, while the author's affinity for Russia's Orthodox traditions shines through, a certain social-revolutionary sensiblity that has also been a hallmark of that culture during the last century and half of upheaval also emerges. As Herzen observed about Bakunin, who endured his own stuggles with Russian Tsarist tyranny in the previous century, it seems that the Gulag's author was not born under any ordinary star, but a comet.The forced labor camp system set up by Stalin was designed to purge his political opponents, set up a system of cheap forced labor to subsize his economic development and industrialization programs and as a vehicle for the implementation of his own peculiar take on ostensible Marxist-Leninist social cleansing and transformation. Thus the first section is entitled \\"The history of our sewage disposal sytem,\\" detailing how a quarter of \\"Leningrad\\" was \\"cleaned out\\" in the political and psuedo legal context of the newly adopted Soviet Constitution (Article 10 as I recall) that criminalized the formerly privileged classes and \\"socially hostile elements.\\" In the camp context this meant that the common criminal element, \\"the socially friendly\\", that may have been present was pandered to while being incited against political enemies of the state, parts of this story being reminiscent of MacKinlay Kantor's fictional descrition of POW life in \\"Andersonville\\", although in this context it was a concious policy pursued as part of the \\"institutionalization of the dictatorship of the proletariat.\\" And how does one recognize the socially friendly? The presence of tatoos on their bodies, for one thing, the author astutely observes.The first camp that was set up was in the Solovetsky Islands during the era of the Bolshevik Revolution in the early 20s and was not particulary egregious by prison standards of the time. The theme was set by the slogan on the Herring Gate which stated the theme, \\"For the Workers and Peasants!\\", a context in which one not atypical prisoner arrived garbed in a tuxedo. Later, in the days of the Great Purge and thereafter, privileged seeming arrivals would be jeeringly greeted at the Kolyma by the socially friendly with comments like \\"Welcome to Vorkuta, Fascist Gentlemen!\\" At this point, however, the definition of socially privileged was dramatically lowered to include \\"kulaks\\" or landed peasants; the campaign of the Russian state against whom was an unmitigated moral and economic disaster.The Gulag system in its maturity was set up under the leadership one Neftely Frenkel, a former Turkish businessman who oversaw the creation of a large network or \\"archipelago\\" of camps all over the Soviet Union, reaching to the remotest parts of Eastern Siberia. He supervised this vast fiefdom from his personal railroad car in which he traveled where he willed in the manner of a robber baron.Solshenitsyn describes the pathological paronoia that set in during the era of the Great Purge and the arbitrary predations of Stalin's petty \\"Chekist\\" hacks, whose own subsequent demise provides some sweet irony to the author. All this actually weakened Russia, from the destruction of its officer corps to the inefficient and shoddy projects completed by convict labor, such as the Belamor Canal which Stalin forced to be built by hand and which turned out to be too shallow. Given the meagre rations that were based on Frenkel's concept of the \\"differentiated ration pot\\" which meant that, in theory, food was given out on the basis of labor expended, but in reality meant the socially friendly and others with relative privileges got more, survival meant getting out of \\"general assignment\\" into some special assignment outside of working in the main labor project. This the author managed to do by getting a job in camp administration based on his education. Otherwise he would have faced the prospect, leaving execution aside, of slow starvation after he fell out as one of the camp's \\"last leggers.\\" Although executions are described in these camps, including en masse, they were not death camps on the Nazi model, as Stalin's regime, for the most part, didn't wait to ship people off it had already marked for death before killing them. In this connection, the abuses of the \\"differentiated ration pot\\" are discussed, a theory by which people were fed according to the amount of work they did, but more often in reality according to who was in favor leading to the weak and dissident elements being worked and starved to death.While the author disparges Marxism and atheism, he gives some grudging respect to Bolshevik and revolutionary traditions when linked with the struggles of the common folk and Russian patriotism. Thus we have the story of the Cossack who polevaulted over the camp walls to join the front line fight against the German invaders and Volume 2 concludes with the story of the Red Army veteran in 1945 who walks off a job cleaning up war rubble in protest of not having any shoes. When confronted by a cop with a threat of arrest and deportation to camp, he responds angrily that he is veteran of the war and a Bolshevik, willing to make further great sacrifices, but insists on at least having shoes. The cop backs off. Thus the theme is returned to that opened the work when the author, indignantly informs those arresting him, for writing comments critical of Stalin in personal letters, of his status as a Red Army tanker. Then of course there was his angry implication in reponse to the students that heckled him at Harvard in the late 70s that those privileged socially hostile elements could perhaps use some corrective labor.I am surprised that Solshentisyn has not emerged more as a public figure in post-Soviet Russia. It seems that he would have a lot to contribute. I encourage people to read this work. It fully deserves the awards and accolades it has achieved."},{"Title":"The Gulag Archipelago 1918-1956 I-II","review":"This monumental work and successive volumes (reviewed also by me), provide priceless information about the Gulags, arcane details about Russian history, insights into Soviet thinking and policies, etc. I can only touch on a few of these.Anti-Christians never tire of bringing up the Spanish Inquisition. Yet this most severe of inquisitions paled in comparison not only with the killings under Communism, but even with just the deeds of the Cheka further limited to early post-Revolution times. \\"...in a period of sixteen months (June 1918 to October 1919) more than sixteen thousand persons were shot, which is to say MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND A MONTH...during the eighty years of the Inquisition's peak effort (1420 to 1498), in all of Spain ten thousand persons were condemned to be burned at the stake--in other words, about ten a month.\\" (p. 435; emphasis his).Some Communist apologists have claimed that Communism \\"went bad\\" only because of Stalin, and that, had Trotsky (Bronshtein) ruled instead, Communism would've been rosy. In actuality, Trotsky wasn't substantially different from Stalin. Solzhenitsyn quotes Trotsky as saying: \\"'Terror is a powerful means of policy and one would have to be a hypocrite not to understand this.'\\" (p. 300). Also: \\"The terror Trotsky inspired as Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council was something he acquired very cheaply, and does not at all demonstrate any true strength of character or courage.\\" (p. 410).The 1939 Soviet conquest of Poland's Kresy had been justified as a protection of the Byelorussians and Ukrainians (and, of course, liberation from those big, bad \\"Polish landlords\\"). Ironic to this, Solzhenitsyn condemns the imprisonment of successful members of those groups, and of Poles, which, he admits, led to Katyn. (p. 77). Otherwise, he rarely mentions Gulag Poles (e. g., p. 81, 86).Solzhenitsyn has choice words about Teheran and Yalta: \\"In their own countries Roosevelt and Churchill are honored as embodiments of statesmanlike wisdom. To us, in our Russian prison conversations, their consistent shortsightedness and stupidity stood out as astonishingly obvious. How could they, in their decline from 1941 to 1945, fail to secure any guarantees whatsoever of the independence of Eastern Europe?\\" (p. 259).Contrary to his portrayal as a \\"Russian nationalist\\" (who, one would think, would adopt a blame-the-victim approach), Solzhenitsyn is very candid about both old and new Russian imperialisms against Poland: \\"Still worse: In October, 1944, the Germans threw in Kaminsky's brigade--with its Moslem units--to suppress the Warsaw Uprising. While one group of Russians sat traitorously dozing behind the Vistula, watching the death of Warsaw through their binoculars, other Russians crushed the Uprising. Hadn't the Poles had enough Russian villainy to bear in the nineteenth century without having to endure more of it in the twentieth? For that matter, was that the last of it? Perhaps more is still to come.\\" (p. 257). God forbid!"},{"Title":"The Gulag Archipelago 1918-1956 I-II","review":"Fascinating, depressing, encompassing trip through Stalinist Russia.

The Mind Snatchers are an insectoid race with the chilling power to switch minds with anyone else. Even some of Rhodan's men are affected by the Mind Snatchers. It's kinda fun to watch Perry and his Mutant Corps defeat the evil insects that would like nothing better than to have the entire universe to themselves.In Part Two, \\"Base on Venus,\\" Rhodan and his hand picked crew discover that the Arkonides left a large highly advanced base on the planet Venus. This version of Venus is closer to the Space Opera Venus of years past - filled with steaming jungles and terrible creatures. Rhodan and his Mutant Corps have to fight the base's defenses in order to take it over before it, too, can send a signal to it's alien masters. I loved the deja-vu that the jungles of Venus (which we all know scientifically cannot exist) created - it took me back to a time when man knew very little about Venus - or any of our other neighboring planets either.This is one of the books that reminded me most of the older space operas like \\"Buck Rodgers\\" and \\"Flash Gordon\\".

I'm sure this book is great for all loved ones, but I specifically tried to use it with my boyfriend. When there is a question in the book, such as \\"Should I confront my loved one when she/he is using symptoms?\\" the book offers a few suggestions, because no two individuals are alike. I highlighted the information that I wanted my boyfriend to take and turned over the corners on pages that were particularly important, to say, \\"You are not doing this and it's super important that you do!\\". Some of the great advice that I can remember is that you can confront someone about using symptoms but do not confront them WHILE they are using symptoms. For example, if your loved one is binging and purging, do not talk to them about it until later, in a safe and comfortable environment. It also said that some individuals want to be stopped from purging, while others do not, and that is a conversation one should have with their loved one. It gave tips for how to deflect questions such as, \\"Do I look fat?\\" It teaches skills where most loved ones are, unfortunately, sorely lacking.If your loved one is trying to recover, I might give them this book and have them highlight some things, to see if there are any areas where they really want you to change some unhelpful behaviors. Keep in mind that some of the highlighting might be performed by the individual's eating disorder, but it IS her/his recovery. If you think some of what is highlighted is ridiculous and it's just to protect the eating disorder, then that may be a great thing to bring up in family/couples therapy. If your loved one is still in the midst of an eating disorder, not yet ready to work on recovery, then I would read this book without asking her/him to highlight anything. She/he might just use it to manipulate you, and they might not be ready to talk about their eating disorder at all.I highly recommend this book to significant others, parents, siblings, and friends. It is a super quick and easy read. I recommend it to all my recovering friends when they ask me, \\"How can I help my family understand my eating disorder?\\""},{"Title":"Talking to Eating Disorders : Simple Ways to Support Someone With Anorexia, Bulimia, Binge Eating, Or BodyImage Issues","review":"I found this book as a second try and I'm glad I did! When I had the need for a book on this subject I checked one out of the public library in my hometown. It was so bad I returned it after reading about half. I found this one on Amazon and ordered it without reviews but I'm happy I took a chance.The focus of the book is on talking, communication and understanding. How to be the best support for a person you love. It empathetically explains what you can expect to help out with and kindly lets you know when to hold back or have patience and realize that you cannot control what someone else eats.That said there is a lot that you can do to be supportive and encouraging. I have read each section and found myself better understanding what the person suffering from the eating disorder is actually thinking. How they are processing what we are saying, for good or bad. I realized that this is one disorder where it is so easy to try your best to be supportive but fail because your words are inadvertently hurtful or misunderstood.What I also loved about this book was the lack of filler. It does not spend pages quoting side effects, endless paragraphs of examples that take up space or chapters dedicated to rehash. They wrote a book that filled a need and not to make money on a \\"hot\\" topic. It also lets you in on the fact that with an eating disorders there is no easy cure. Many of the books I looked at seemed to hint that if you followed this or that program you'd have this problem crossed off your list, and fast.The author explains the long term situation, the 3 steps forward 2 steps back path that this disorder usually takes. I appreciated knowing that it might be a long road and not to expect miracles.

I felt that they provided some very good suggestions as to specific words that are helpful, and words that don't encourage.I bought this book, as my mid-twenty year old girlfriend has anorexia. Unfortunately, I found that while good information was presented, it was very basic. For example, the first chapter talks about blame and how blaming others can complicate a situation. While this is true, I didn't need to be reminded of this simple fact.There is no fluff in this book what-so-ever. It is simply filled with tons of suggestions of things to say or not to say, along with a description for each comment. I found it frustratingly simple, with, as I've said before, many topics that felt like common sense. I feel that this book, however, would be a fantastic resource for younger friends of a person with an ED, maybe for the middle school and early highschool years.On average, I read about half the book within about a 3-day time period, and skimmed the rest.Chapters include topics on:Blame, understanding change, being in control of what you can and should be in control of, conversation basics, talking about body image, talking about messages from the media, talking about touch (for romantic relationships), talking about diet, talking about exercise, talking about professional help, talking to young people, managing emergencies, handling relapses, and a \\"dos and don'ts\\" chapter.Each chapter is short, and, as I said before, have many of the \\"comments\\" in bold, with an explaination.For me, this wasn't helpful, although it did affirm a lot that I already knew or felt.

I find this book beautiful, for it captures couples who were in that moment, deeply attached to each other. The book is called Lovers, not Marriage. And the moments caught in this book are priceless. There are a thousand ways to photograph a single individual, and these photos are in rich black and white with dark darks and light lights and strong midtones.I was taken by not just the faces, but the textures: the look of happiness in two men's eyes who are dressed in their rough tweed winter coats; the sophisticated poets standing ironically in a disheveled farmyard, just the curve of her breasts alone so alive; a close-up of a woman of legendary beauty with perfect skin and her lover's face close by with its deeply ravaged and pitted skin; and one of the most haunting photographs ever of a man and woman in an all white room with nothing in it but a white bed, and her long black rough and wavy hair flowing over the side of the bed to the floor, and her lover lying atop her like a child at fullest peace...this picture is grainy and atmospheric and perfect also.I tend to look at photographs not just for the subjects, not just for the postures and gestures, not even just for the technical skill of the printing, but also for what emanates/ed in that moment the camera eye snapped closed and opened again. In this sense, even the more posed photos with fine grain, are poignant. This is why I did not name the famous people these photos are of and about. The photos stand for themselves and are not images of faces and bodies, but a stop motion in time in a great story. Those who know at depth the fore and after stories of the subjects are even more enriched in viewing these moments of time when the loved also loved in return.It is true that there are many forms of love, tired and grim love, tenacity with disappointment love, dedicated love without care, forever love and cherishment, tender and awake love, and also there is a kind of true love that is fleeting, but nonetheless real, just like the camera's eye snapping closed and then open again... imprinting a deep image on each lover for all life...regardless of longevity, regardless of all else. I think that for every moment that people love one another, we are ahead."},{"Title":"Lovers: Great Romances of Our Time Through the Eyes of Legendary Writers","review":"For me, I was disappointed in my copy of &quot;Lovers.&quot; Mostly, because I consider 'true lovers' to actually stay together. Many of the couples featured in this book became separated or divorced. Sorry, not my idea of true love, or romance either.Plus, I'd prefer more photos than just the single one per couple. The lowercase font used as a title for each bio was really annoying, and the format (one large photo and an essay), tedious. Also, there were few contemporary 'lovers.'Since its publication this book has become obsolete. (As the ill-fated Anne Heche and Ellen deGenerres romance will suggest).Overall, I've seen books which handle this subject much better.

Photo books don't have the same punch, and longer articles are too much to invite the casual brouser to read. Each profiled couple is one page worth of commentary and the facing page a black and white photo, so that your guests can read one or two entries easily. Yeah, the Anne Heche/Ellen Degeneras entry is a bust, but most of the rest are classic couples.

The main function of the book is to relate the tree of life to the workings of the human race.

I found very little practical knowledge to be gained. The book is set in a lecture style with at best some ponderings to be made.It is clear that the system of the author is forced reasoning, but to its credit, so are many other explanations of the tree of life workings.

This is a classic of world literature, a work of genius. It is a finely-written tale of family, a simple story about an older man who is fond of his daughter-in-law, though his relations with his own two grown children, son and divorced daughter, are ambiguous. The story line, as in other Kawabata novels, is simple----there are no great events, no dramatic conclusions or climaxes. Natural phenomena---birds, animals, plants, and weather---play a large role in setting the mood and are used as symbols throughout. Far from being a recurring theme, the \\"sound of the mountain\\" is heard only once, on page 10, yet it and many other signs presage changes in life that follow a pattern unseen by human eyes.The most amazing thing about THE SOUND OF THE MOUNTAIN is its capacity to summarize or to encapsulate family life, the compexity of family relationships. The only other book I know that comes close is Christina Stead's \\"The Man Who Loved Children\\", but that is a most verbose book whose characters verbalize nearly every emotion, or else the author does it for them. Kawabata's novel, however, succeeds in portraying family life equally well, if not better, with an absolute minimum of brush strokes. The indecision, the steps not taken, the regrets, the lost loves who return in dreams---all the myriad small events from which marriages and families are constructed---flow in a way that is both typically Japanese and universal. Shingo, the old man, was particularly kind towards Kikuko, his daughter in law, who \\"was for him a window looking out of a gloomy house.\\" \\"Kindness towards her was a beam lighting isolation. It was a way of pampering himself, of bringing a touch of mellowness into his life.\\" There is nothing so definite (or crass) as an out-and-out love affair between the two. Rather, there are solutions that are no solutions, compromises that have to paper over the disappointments. Life goes on and Hollywood is for children. What a brilliant book !"},{"Title":"The Sound of the Mountain","review":"&quot;The Sound of the Mountain&quot; (&quot;Yama no Oto&quot;) should have been a script for an Yasujiro Ozu film. All of the elements are here, with the kindly aged father Shingo who cannot gain his children's respect or love, ready to be portrayed by Chishu Ryu, and the lovely and loving daughter-in-law Kikuko, far more understanding than his real children, designed exactly for Setsuko Hara. The family who has left its rural home to uproot to Tokyo, following the jobs, losing their heart in the process. It really is too perfect.Instead, the story is guided by the gentle hand of Yasunari Kawabata, who gives us the Japanese family, still disheveled by the end of the war and not quite certain what their roles are and dealing with their loss of identity. Confucian ideals, such as respect for the elder parents, have been swept aside in the post-Occupation reality. Shingo's son Shuichi has come back from the war an indifferent, cold-hearted man, flaunting his affairs with neither spite nor pleasure. Shingo's wife, Yasuko, is an ugly reminder of her sister, whom Shingo loved in is youth yet died. Their daughter Fusako is a burden, returning home with ugly children, her husband a waste and their marriage broken. The only pleasure in his life is the daughter-in-law Kikuko, whom his son wounds daily with his lack of caring.In the Kawabata style, there is neither complaint nor surface rage at life's inconstant fortunes, but rather an acceptance and perseverance. Life is about moving forward, even at the advanced age of Shingo and Yasuko, who take their burdens as they come. Shingo is the main character, and so this is a book of old age, of looking back at life's mistakes and longing for fading pleasures. &quot;The Sound of the Mountain&quot; is a brilliant, cherishable book, one that captivated and moved me.Interestingly enough, &quot;The Sound of the Mountain&quot; was eventually made into a movie, and while Ozu didn't get to direct, Setsuko Hara did get the part of Kikuko. Someone else must have had the same idea."},{"Title":"The Sound of the Mountain","review":"A haunting, evocative novel of family life in the immediate aftermath of the second world war. Shingo, the grandfather of the family, describes the relationships between his children and their partners, interwoven with flashbacks of his own early life. The disharmony of their lives is overwritten with a sense of Shingo's personal unfulfillment and unrequited love for the long dead sister of his wife. A constant theme of the novel is the decline in the powers of Shingo as head of the family and his inability to shape the destiny of his children as the story unfolds.This is a beautifully written book, rich in the culture of Japan which maintains a sense of melancholy throughout yet accurately reflects the mundane nature of day to day family existence. A highly recommended, gentle read."},{"Title":"The Sound of the Mountain","review":"I love Japanese literature. Unlike American writers - who overdo both their descriptions and their passions - Japanese writers, especially Kawabata, demonstrate taste. Like the beautiful, small cherry blossom, Kawabata's book is exquisite in its understatement. Only in Japanese literature could you have a father-in-law be completely in love with his daughter-in-law and not have the entire thing reduced to some graphic affair. This story is quietly profound. American readers who are in for action or blatant romance will not enjoy it, but if you are a reader who likes a book that makes you recognize your own silent yearnings - then this is the book for you. But I warn you, you will need to read it at least twice to really get it. Since the underlying theme of this novel is the dwindling of life, I recommend reading this novel in the fall or when you are feeling your own body failing."},{"Title":"The Sound of the Mountain","review":"This is arguably one of Kawabata's best works. After reading and rereading it over many years, my admiration for Kawabata as a writer only increases. There is something so comforting about the domesticity in this book, despite any problems in the domestic landscape. The style of the book and the writing is pure genius. It captures the essence of the lives it portrays like poetic prose. There is zen in the simplicity and the structure of this book. It makes you want to get up and move to Japan, or at least visit. It makes you want to learn Japanese so that you can read this beautiful writing in the original, even though the Sidensticker translation is great in itself. I'm still thinking about what the sound of the mountain could be. Kawabata is the apex of world literature, and this book is very highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Sound of the Mountain","review":"Written by Nobel-prize winning author Y. Kawabata, \\"The Sound of the Mountain\\" is a stunning and complex novel about the family life of Ogata Shingo. Shingo, head of the household, is deeply troubled by the moral decay of his children's families. Shuichi, his son, is married to Kikuko, but carries on an affair for a year, which results in a....... child by his lover and an abortion by his wife. Fusako, Shingo's daughter, separates and later divorces her drug-addicted husband to live with her two young children at her parents' house. Both of Shingo's children disrespect him and think little of him because of his absent-mindedness. These periods of thoughts are filled with beautiful imagery of nature's sounds, smells, and scenes. However, increasingly Shingo's dreams bring him anguish over his moral responsibilty, his hidden love for his daughter-in-law, Kikuko, and his desire for the beauty of his wife's younger sister, his late first wife. In the end, family ties hold this microcosm of Japanese life together--for better or for worse."},{"Title":"The Sound of the Mountain","review":"kawabata's slow moving novel of family life blends dreams, rememberances and glancing interactions between the characters with a study of nature and the process of aging.the subtle, furtive love between shingo and his neglected, much abused daughter-in-law kikuko forms the core of the novel. while nothing physical actually happens, a certain passage with a no mask is among kawabata's most erotic.worth many re-readings, this poetic and beautiful book is among the best of kawabata's works translated to english."},{"Title":"The Sound of the Mountain","review":"Written by Kawabata sometime between 1954-59, it is obvious from this work of art why he won the Nobel prize in 1968. He accomplishes the telling of ordinary domestic life in pictures of words, not unlike a form of expanded haiku. The Japanese aethetics of simplicity and nature are so well described, at times I did not know if I were reading or in an art museum. ..."},{"Title":"The Sound of the Mountain","review":"The Sound of the Mountain is about an older man named Shingo, a grouchy divorced daughter, a lazy, loser son that is cheating on his wife, and his son's wife Kikuko. The story tells of abortions, infidelity, abusive husbands, and war widows. Shingo suffers from flashes of lost memories and occasionally hears the mountain behind his garden rumbling, which seems to signify the closing of death. Shingo's memory is failing and he is showing signs of dementia or Alzheimer's disease.Deciphering the different themes, I would think the mountain symbolizes the aging generation of Shingo. Reading his thoughts, the mountain seems to speak of ancient wisdom: the sin of incest-like relation, the responsibility and moral obligation towards one's own blood and marriage. With these, he thinks about repressing his gentle love for the child-woman, Kikuko and cleaning up the mess his family creates. The exact opposite is Shuichi, finding pleasure in an older woman, and remorselessly treating his marriage with cruelty. He cheats on his wife with an older woman and she becomes pregnant.The haikus, or Japanese poems, enrich this admirable read far beyond most others, leading to the author being awarded the prestigious Literary award of Nobel Prize in 1968. Overall, this was a very interesting read. I would recommend this book to all."},{"Title":"The Sound of the Mountain","review":"This translated version of _The Sound of the Mountain_ makes me want to read the original text. During my read, I felt like I was missing the essence of Kawabata's words (obviously). A tale of an old man, Shingo, and his immediate family--wife, daughter-in-law, daughter and son--the novel captures the twists and turns of familial bonds. Shingo narrates this wonderful story, and we learn from his thoughts that age certainly carries with it a yearning for the past, an apathetic outlook for the future, yet, curiously, an appreciation for what is situated in the present. Kawabata's descriptions of Shingo's thoughts are existential in nature; the narrative is calculated, yet poetic--minimal, yet suffuse with meaning. I highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Sound of the Mountain","review":"good boo"},{"Title":"The Sound of the Mountain","review":"The aesthetic details of nature is poetic, the book is full of nuances. Full of existentialist narratives, I really appreciated the subtlety, but I can't get past how Shingo treats his daughter in-law like a concubine/servant. I must have counted a million times where he tells her to fetch his slippers or robe or whatnot...then when his son's mistress is pregnant, I get the vibe that he's more concerned about his rep and his grandson being born illegitimate, rather than the welfare of the woman and about to be single mother, who by the way was abused by Shingo's son, and Shingo seems almost passive to cast any reproach. And his constant thoughts of how his wife is not as pretty as her sister, how he settled for second best, and how his daughter looks even uglier than his wife, it's no wonder how disgruntled and indignant his daughter acts.Apparently, many things were lost in the translation, maybe a new edition/translated version should come out..."},{"Title":"The Sound of the Mountain","review":"It's funny how contemplative we get when we realize that the Fates are deciding whether or not to cut the thread to our life. We look back and question our existence: was the journey a good one, or did we waste it? Why did I marry him or her? Did my children turn out right? What is my legacy? What about my friends? What kind of lives did they leave behind? Why did they die before me? Why do I suddenly find my in-law a whole let sexier than I did a week ago? Ogata Shingo asks himself these questions when we meet him in The Sound of the Mountain. I've always had the fear that Shingo has; that the life I will lead will not have been fruitful. Not that I find my in-laws particularly sexy. His failures as a husband and father - he believes - are expressed in the marriages of his children (his son is having an affair at the start of the story, which forces his daughter-in-law to get an abortion, and his daughter married and later divorces a suicidal drug dealer). The sound of the mountain in the title was a sound he associates with death, and when he mentions it to his family the next day, his daughter-in-law reminds him of the time his wife's sister (his former love) passed away. Right before he learned the news of her passing, he heard the sound of the mountain. If you've ever felt the need to question your reality, The Sound of the Mountain is a good way to go."},{"Title":"The Sound of the Mountain","review":"This is a great book! It pulls you into the story and doesn't let go. You can really feel what the main character Shingo is going through with all of his guilt and confusion and his helplessness at times.

The dreams he has are particularly interesting."},{"Title":"The Sound of the Mountain","review":"OK if your reading this review you're likely to know something about Japanese literature. Kawabata stands alone with his haiku influenced prose. If your new to Kawabata you might think about starting with Thousand Cranes then Snow Country, then The Sound of the Mountain. Each I would recommend you read in small chunks savoring each bite. I would also recommend reading his stories twice. You'll be amazed at what you missed the first time. If your over 40, reflect sometimes about your life then this book has your name written all over it. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Sound of the Mountain","review":"The Sound of the Mountain is a beautifully written book about very little. It portrays post-war Japan from the perspective of an older person, but it fails to make his experience of the war seem real. The book's greatest strength is the sense of the Japanese culture and its sensitivity to nature which leaves the reader aware that (s)he has had a real encounter with a world of unique delicacy. However, the attitudes towards women that are reflected in the book also show a society of great insensitivity.The greatest negative of this book for me was the lack of energy. The characters seem more like players in a noh drama than people. They go through stylized actions, but they seem to bring no force to bear in their lives."},{"Title":"The Sound of the Mountain","review":"This book is so well written, so lyrical and evocative, with descriptions of nature and natural metaphors. It presents a picture of everyday life in Japan that is recognizable to Western readers since despite the cultural differences, the situations depict universal experience. The relationships between the family members are familiar. The central figure, a man approaching his twilight years, is contemplative, having lived a quiet life, he finds himself dwelling on matters of mortality inspired by the increasing numbers of deaths of his friends. It was difficult at first to get oriented as to the time this story is taking place. The book, written in 1970, refers to the War Years as if they were closer than 30 years previous. The optimistic tone throughout is ironic given that despite winning the Nobel Prize in 1968, Kawabata committed suicide 2 years after the publication of this book."},{"Title":"The Sound of the Mountain","review":"To me this book was very intersting.

The descriptions of scenery and trivial movements is overdone and detract from the final story. There were many points throughout the book that I just couldn't figure out what was going on because the writing was so muddled and the primary thread was simply not continuous.The book reads like a puzzle. The story is thin, and Kawabata attempts to weave every scene, every action into some over-arching theme (old ways good, but new ways may have good points too) that simply left me cold. However, there are many who like this kind of storytelling, so my experience should be taken with an appropriate amount of salt grains.Not having read the book in its original language, I can't say whether the translation helped or hurt the book. The words and sentences were certainly poetic, but ultimately empty. The poetry simply couldn't carry the poor plot, if anything it hindered it all the more."},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"Winning on Wall Street is the first book I ever read about investing (back in 1990). Marty Zweig may not be the most glamorous or charismatic guru, but his disciplined and unemotional approach to the markets is what makes him my most revered market player. Famous for calling the 1987 crash (forever captured on the archives of Wall Street Week), Zweig has receded from public view considerably. He discontinued his valuable Zweig Market Letter about 5 years ago and ever since Rukeyser disbanded his elves, Marty rarely shows up on the show. So, this is your best opportunity to tap the mind of an investor whose success has lasted for decades.Admittedly, Zweig's writing style is fairly academic (he's a PhD). The book is different from many in that much of it works to set forth a model which will allow you to be on the right side of the general market for its major moves. When you boil it down, the primary influences on the model are interest rates, and measuring the underlying strength of the averages. I can now attest firsthand to the durability of this model - I have been dutifully running it myself since 1990 and it has performed admirably. Major BUY signals came in 12/90, 1/96, and 1/01. SELL signals came in 5/94 and 9/99. Again, those were not perfect bottoms and tops, but allowed you to participate in the major upmoves and avoid significant stretches of downward activity. Other useful discussions include those on sentiment and seasonal indicators. The fundamental portion of the book leaves something to be desired - stock picking is not Zweig's strong suit. By the way, opinions suggesting that Zweig is a speculator are off the mark. In fact, his approach is designed to 1) minimize risk, and 2) catch the majority (middle portion) of a market move. (...) Winning on Wall Street has become one of my best reference tools. If you are serious about building your understanding of the markets and improving your investment results, this is a book that you must own."},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"Zweig made his reputation as a market timer, and 2/3 of this book presents a detailed market timing model that incorporates both \\"money indicators\\" (e.g. prime rate, fed funds rate, consumer debt) and a basic momentum indicator. The model is relatively simple and the method is clearly explained. According to Zweig's data, the system produced remarkable results up through the final revision of this book (in 1996).But, of course, you have to wonder... The book has been revised four times since its initial publication in 1986...and yet not a single revision in the past ten years. Hmmmm...wonder why?Unfortunately, the obvious answer is the correct one. Zweig's \\"Super Model\\", which he touts as \\"The Only Investment Model You Will Ever Need\\" (yes, that's an actual chapter title), utterly failed after 1996. Some other reviewers claim to have followed the model successfully since the last edition of the book. I don't know what numbers they're working with, but I've done the very tedious work to recreate the signals the model would have given since 1996, using only actual data available as of the date it became available, following Zweig's methodology precisely, and applying it to the Value Line Arithmetic Index (a very close substitute for the proprietary benchmark he uses in the book). From March 1996 (the last data point in the book) through June 28, 2006, the Value Line Index produced a gain of 222.8% (buy & hold, excluding dividends). Following the Zweig \\"Super Model\\" long-only generated a gain of 95.5% (not including interest income while in cash), and following the model long/short produced a gain of only 18.4% (yes, that's total, not annualized...). So much for the \\"Super Model\\".As for Zweig's stock picking method, it's a pretty straightforward approach blending GARP and momentum and is very capably summarized on AAII's excellent web site. Save yourself the time and money and just go there if you want a starting point for stock screening ideas."},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"A basic work that every investor should read. The best source for simple explanations of the mechinisms that drive bull and bear markets. &quot;Outdated and misleading&quot; says one reviewer who did not find it applicable for trading the .com mania in Feb 2000, but why that market crashed a month after the review was written can be found in Mr. Zweig's work. The fact is the theories and applications found in this book have correctly called every major market move since the mid 1980's. You can find books that can help you make more money during bull markets, but if you want to KEEP the money you make this is the best place to start."},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"To avoid confusion about whether or not the Zweig method has been rewarding over the past decade (one reviewer says it has not and another says it hasn't), simply look at the two close-end funds on the New York Stock Exchange managed by Zweig based on his philosophy:1) Zweig Fund: lost about 70% between January 2000 and now (November 2009)2) Zweig Total Return Fund: lost about 40% between January 2000 and November 2009If you know that the S&P; with dividends included lost about 13% over the period, we can only conclude that the funds substantially underperformed the market averages. Even worse, over the 20 years ending in December 2009, the average annual return of the Zweig Total Return Fund including dividends was only 5.6% - way below the return of the S&P.; This is not what one should expect of \\"the only system you should ever need,\\" and probably explains why Zweig's investment letter has silently disappeared through the back door (as mentioned by another reviewer).The big flaw in his method, as far as I can tell, is that he used a timeframe that was way too small to make meaningful conclusions. For instance, the idea that interest rates are a driver behind stock markets (which was also proclaimed by Kenneth Fisher, who, by the way, also was taken completely aback by the bear market of 2007-2008) is based on a 50 year period up until 2005 or so. But anyone who would take the trouble to look beyond that time frame, would have seen that the relationship between stock markets and interest rates falls apart before 1950. So why trust on such an indicator?"},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"I almost hate to tell you how good this book is, for fear that Zweig's Stock Screen will quit working for me if too many people know about it.

Then I joined the American Association of Individual Investors, which sells a computer program called \\"Stock Investor Pro\\".

I base my buy/sell decisions on those results.AAII also independently rates all those stock screens, and the long term perfomance of the Zweig screen topped all the others for cumulative gain from 1998 through 2005. In any given year, another screen may top Zweig's performance, but his screen is the overall winner by far. Even during the tech bubble collapse of 2000, Zweig's annual return was positive. It's annualized rate of return was over 40% over that 8 year period. That's an ANNUALIZED rate of return, not the cumulative rate of return. Don't believe those people who tell you that you can't do better than the S&P500; over the long term because the market is \\"efficient\\". I don't know what they're smoking, but it can't be too healthy."},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"As a matter of fact Martin Zweig is one of the few Phds who's \\"able\\" to explain even somewhat complicated subjects in plain words. The same thing can't be said about the contemporary authors of various market, finance or economics books published over the last years.Hands down, this is one of the best and one of the most (again) simple books ever written on Wall Street. It provided me with new insights on different aspects of trading and economics in general, like the Four percent model indicator, the Monetary model, the Mutual Funds cash/assets ratio, the three crucial conditions for bear markets. There were also other brief and concise ideas which seem to stand the test of time, like \\"It's ok to monitor the crowd and go against it, but you only want to do so when the crowd is extremely one-sided\\", \\"Recognizing the relationship between trends and the industries that might benefit from them can lead to above normal returns\\", \\"If you could just eliminate the worst 10% of all stocks and choose even randomly from the rest, you would certainly beat the market\\". And the most surprising of them all (at least to me): \\"There seems to be some inborn reasoning in Wall Street that better profits mean higher stock prices, but this simply is not true in aggregate. The best gains made in bull markets tend to come in the first six months of a fresh bull market, when profits are usually declining\\".But when it comes to the brass tacks of his methodology, I think the best part of this book is the one about scanning the financial section. His method of picking the winners by simply checking the latest quarterly figures in company sales and earnings in the daily financial section of The Wall Street Journal or The New York Times and the process he goes through afterwards, until deciding in the end which ones to buy is simple, yet very powerful.I don't know why, but almost every single page of this book reminded me of the legendary Jesse Livermore and his valuable and immortal lessons. After reading M. Zweig's book you'll never invest the same way as before. \\"Winning on Wall Street\\" is an intelligent and insightful investing book, yet simple to understand. Rather than trying to razzle-dazzle the reader, this book explains why it is so important to stick to simple concepts and rules such as \\" buy strength and sell weakness, stay in gear with the tape, the trend is your friend, etc\\"; rules you have read and heard about a gazillion times before, but which are so easy to violate! As a trader once said: \\"The market is the train, so be the caboose\\"."},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"This is a great book.Zweig tells you what to look for and what not to get distracted by.I keep his 4% rule (Buy when the market closes up 4% and sell when it closes down 4% on weekly closes) as one of the indicators to look at when thinking of buying and selling a stock.That rule alone should make one more money than a buy and hold approach.Fine book."},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"This is a seductive book since it appears to provide useful guides that will enable the investor to time the market. It is by no means a simple scheme, and based on the information provided, seems pretty foolproof. Trouble is, the data stops at 1990, just when things got interesting in the market, and has not been updated. The other troubling and puzzling thing is that Zweig's own mutual funds have not been star performers and his market letter was discontinued years ago."},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"I purchased this book because the AAII 8 year study of different strategies showed Zwieg's returning 1,659.3% from 1998-2005. He was #1 out of 56 others, including Buffett, Lynch, Fisher, O'Neal's CAN SLIM, Motley fools, and using ROE, P/E's etc. Second place was O'Neal's CAN SLIM with a 860% return, which is the strategy I use. This study got my attention.Zweig is a rare mix, he was previously a finance professor, (He holds many degrees in finance). He is a successful trader in his own right. He is the chairman of a very successful closed end fund and a mutual fund, and publishes one of the most successful newsletters the Zwieg Forecast.His super model for stock market timing focuses in on timiming for entries and exits based on monetary policy and market momentum. He uses the prime rate, Fed rate, and installment debt as factors to judge the markets performance. He also uses market momentum indicators like advance decline ratios being greter than 2 to 1, up volume being at a 9-1 ratio. He also discusses simplyfing into entering on a 4% advance and selling after a 4% decline. He puts these factors together to create a point valued timing system that was close to perfect during the past 30 years predicting the trend. He shows the performance of each factor in real historical data.He favors value combined with growth and to stay away from huge P/E ratios, and diversifying your portifolio across at least 5 stocks in different industries. Which is great advice for investors. (I am a stock trader so I play the market differently, but use this in my 401K).He does believe in using a trailing stop loss on your stocks to limit losses to 10-20%. He also does the best job I have seen explaining short selling and how it is the same amount of risk as going long. Excellent book I put it at the top of the list in my library of 75 trading books. A must have for all serious investors/traders."},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"Although you don't hear too much about Marty Zweig anymore, in the late 80's and early 90's he was the authoritive voice in investing and in my book, still is.This book was my first investment book. Showed me how to make money in any market and how to do it on my own without listening to pitched from brokers and other commissioned financial people.This book is still a winner. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"Gives an insight in mindset of a succesful investor/trader and quite a few original perspectives about the stock market. Highly recommended, even if sometimes sounds like a generation old."},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"The contents of the book are great. But the book was delivered with the cover and several pages mangled. Only bought it because it was advertised in very good condition. I still am enjoying the book."},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"I have to warn all readers of this book that its methodology is either outdated or just simply not working. As a regular investor, I don't think you can gain any insightful info out of this book."},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"Zweig, widely known and acknowledged on Wall Street, has written a pretty clear book here on market timing. I have a degree in economics myself, but I was astonished how simple Zweig can explain macro-economic concepts in his book. If you want to know more on the Fed, or the tools it has in house, and how to interpret its actions, this book is a great read.Actually, this book is one of the best books on market timing I've red and I've red a lot of books on this theme.Also very helpful was the scoring system Zweig has provided in this book. With this scoring system you have an easy tool to keep track of the decisions the Fed takes. I have constructed the system for myself in excel, and I was able to copy and reach the same scores as Zweig shows in his examples.The last part of the book is on how Zweig selects the stocks he trades. I was interested to see his method, but it's not my own way of trading. It seems he looks for growth stocks, very similar to the CANSLIM investment style.Someone here in the comments on Amazon claimed his system stopped working back some time ago after this book was released. I have not done any backtests myself on the system presented, but I would strongly advise to backtest the system yourself before one starts using it."},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"My opinion is this book is the all ones need to be succussfull in the market. I used Martin's formulas to see how they worked the last 15 years. They worked very well. The book can be used as a textbook on investing. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"This is one of the best books on the stock market. I cannot imagine anyone doing a top-down analysis of the market without having first read this book. Zweig, a Wharton graduate and PhD, looks at the monetary, momentum, and sentiment indicators (among others) that affect the DJIA, S&P; 500, and the ValueLine(tm) Unweighted Price Index. I think it is unfortunate that we have not heard from Dr. Zweig in quite some time (I cannot remember the last time I heard him mentioned on TV, and if I'm not mistaken his newsletter is no longer printed) and the book is somewhat dated (revised in 1997). Still, Zweig's Winning on Wall Street is still a good read.Zweig also has a later section of the book where he outlines a method for choosing particular stocks. I do not have an opinion on that part of the book (I'm a CANSLIM investor) but Zweig's analysis of the broad market is all you really need."},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"An excellent treatise on the use of data from the New York Stock Exchange. It may be a little difficult to obtain equivalent UK data but a very thought provoking methodology."},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"This is the best book I have ever read about the stock market, selecting stocks and indicating the best times to invest and when to stay out of the market."},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"I have read many investment books. Martin offers a seemingly accurrate and straightforward timing model."},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"\\"Winning On Wall Street\\" is more than a classic. It's required reading. Even though the original text is over 16 years old, the information in this book forms part of the analytical methods that kept Marty Zweig from getting wiped out in the stock market crash of 1987, and that has kept his mutual fund family alive. This book and its staying power, shows that the more things change, the more they stay the same. The methods here have clearly stood the test of time, making Zweig's opus truly a seminal work in market analysis and one that set the stage for many market timers that followed.The key to the book is that it truly tells the reader how the market works, and how to get a grasp of the big picture before risking money. The section on market sentiment, includes tales on how to analyze magazine covers in order to diagnose market tops and bottoms, as well as how to make sense out of market sentiment surveys. This is worth the price of the book alone.But, you get so much more: especially the wisdom of one of Wall Street's true successful market timers, and the guy that invented the Put/Call ratio, an indicator that is so widely used that it has become part of the market's vernacular.Zweig was one of the first to utter the phrase;\\" don't fight the Fed,\\" a maxim that still holds true, even if it during the bear market of 2000-2001, it took longer than in the past for the Fed's ministrations to at least stop the fall of much of the market.The 4% Value Line model, is a key concept that embodies another of Zweig's trademark phrases: \\"The trend is your friend.\\" This information is still useful,as many newer generation traders were not exposed to this kind of top down analysis.Many of Zweig's tenets have become part of my own analysis rituals, and their influences can be found in my own market analysis...Highly recommended along with Ned Davis' \\"Being Right Or Making Money.\\""},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"Mr. Zweig is simply a genius. And his book is a reflection of it. A must read to every person dealing with the stock market."},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"Got a lot of practical pointers on various market timing indicators. Good read and its suggestions are practical."},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"to me it's a refresh course but it's kind of simple. No mentioning of fundamental aspect of stock investment."},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"Even though Zweig's prime rate indicator has performed well in the past (giving excellent buy/sell signals); it would not have kept you out of the recent bear market. For example, using this indicator alone (which Zweig recommends you can do), you would have been invested in the market on February 1, 2001 (the last buy signal). As a result, you would have suffered the market's incredible drop (as the sell signal never occurred). I haven't backtested his other indicators (or super model) on recent market data, but, I am assuming that these indicators also failed (please let me know if I am wrong). One never expects 100% accuracy, yet, on the otherhand, you want an indicator to do its job when its necessary. Conclusion: technical/monetary indicators are not infallible, not even Zweig's."},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"This is not for daytraders, but it will show you the best times to be in the market and when to get out.Zwiegs model shows you how to catch the upside of the markets."},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"Very simply this system is all about following the trend and followin interest rates.In 2000, when Allen Greenspan was raising interest rates that identified a sell signal. When interest rates go up, stocks go down.Zwieg is not a &quot;buy and hold&quot; man. His system works. I've been following it since 1989 when I bought this book along with Winning with New IRAs and Wealth without Risk. To wit I caught the big stock market boom in late 1990 through 1991 and again in 1995-1996 and in 1998-2000.I also missed the selloffs in late 1989-1990, 1994-1995, and 2000.The Zweig system works. Try it, you'll love it."},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"...Martin Zweig had a good run and then (as with most stock market &quot;gurus&quot;) his investment ideas sort of lost their magic. This book isn't terrible, but neither is it the best. If you are interested in investing, it's worthwhile to read, as you will gain the benefit of seeing how Martin Zweig views the markets.Nothing in this book really stuck out for me (except for his ideas on the importance of The Fed to the markets)... that's just the kind of book it is. Not to take anything away from Zweig, but &quot;Beating the Street&quot; by Peter Lynch is a much more useful book."},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"Don't focus just on technical analysis to trading. In fact, Zweig claim his not sure if all those double bottoms and other chart patterns really work. He takes sound fundemental and realistic approach to Investing and Trading.This books make you learn a lot about how the market really works (big picture). You can use a lot of his stock selection criteria to do your own investing.I'm a big fan of AAII's zweig stock screen. Don't knock it until you try. According to AAII, zweig method of stock selection has returned over 1600% since 1998. Second was O'neil's CAN SLIM. 1000%+."},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"I enjoyed this book because Zweig takes you step by step through the development of his models. He discusses why each factor is important and how it contributes to performance. The model continues to work twelve years after he published the first edition. The section on stock selection is not great. I think other books provide more detail and evidence. But the heart of the book is about identifying trends. For that part, Zweig deserves five stars."},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"This is by far the best investing book I have read. I just gave Jim Cramer's book, Real Money, a 3 star rating for lack of usable info on top of his 400 pages of egoistical ramble.First of all, Dr.Zweig has the financial education and extensive research of the market since 1929 behind him. After all he has earned his bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degree in Finance. He has the track records that are particularly amazing in BAD markets. As Zweig says, \\"anybody can be a hero in a bull market\\".The entire book is an introduction of his \\"Super Model\\", what he calls it. It is a series of monetary and momentum indicators combined into a one powerful model, which is a perfect fit for the \\"weekend investor\\".Do not get me wrong. His extensive research model is simplified in this book to fit the \\"weekend investor\\" complexity, but it is not as simple as it may sound. If you are serious about his approach, then you will have to read his book at least 2 times to get the overall concept and then it will require to actually work out the model in current numbers on a separate Excel worksheet.If you \\"get\\" the book, you will understand that developing the so called \\"Zweig Screen\\" is just half the battle. Stock picking is very important to Zweig, of course; however, knowing the direction of the market based on his models is the other 50%. It may just mean your being invested 100% in stocks and sleeping soundly or being invested only 25% in stocks and sleeping soundly again, knowing you are not missing anything.To sum it up in one sentence, Zweig's approach is a combination of economics and finance. I suggest constructing his models and following the final Super Model. Then create a simulated portfolio on any financial site. Follow some Zweig Screen, for example AAII.com's, and measure the performance of your portfolio for a quarter. You will see results. Remember, there are no shortcuts in Zweig's models!I wish there were more books from Zweig, but in all, this book is really sufficient."},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"I am an aspiring daytrader. The book doesn't go much into daytrading, but does give excellent insight on the basic strategies that made Zweig a legend on Wall Street. Basically, he states something that I have always wanted to hear from one the the established greats; that buying and holding is not always the best answer. That the trend is your friend. He backs up his theories with a proven track record over 3 decades. One criticism is that most of his comparisons are bases on his method of buying and selling on signals compared with buying once and holding, and I had wished he had made a comparison based on dollar cost averaging also."},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"Martin Zweig states in this book that people buy it when they experience loss or frustration in the stock market. I have to agree and wish I would have found this book a long time ago.Zweig provides a model to tell you if you should be a buyer, seller, or stay in cash. Then outlines some of his work at picking stocks. If you follow his model (you need to get data from the U.S. Gov, Barrons, and some stock indexes all free) then you can track the model on a WEEKLY BASIS not DAILY. This really provides direction for bigger moves and keeps the \\"weekend\\" investor from looking at the market in detail a day at a time.If you ever found yourself wondering overall should you be a buyer or seller, this book will answer that question for you. You will know when to start moving to cash, when to start moving into stocks, and if you should be in stocks or cash 100%."},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"While I was in high school, I bought this book at a neighborhood bookstorein 1987 if I remember correctly. It was my first stock market book ever. At the time, I did not know that it was going to be a Wall Street classic though I should have foreseen it. When I first browsed through the book initially, It was quite advanced for me. Many years ago, I carefully reread the severely bangged up copy of mine again. That's when it all became clear for me. In fact, the stock screening method in the book is the backbone of my stock selection process now although it's not the only criteria I use. If anyone believes that it is possible to beat the stock market on consistent basis by logical stock selection, this book must be read at least a few times IMO."},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"I read this book in August 2001 and wished that I had read this book in 1998. Not that I would have paid much attention then, but surely it would have saved my hard earned money.

In the pockets of those who read and wrote masterpieces like this, and understood and followed what he was saying.Just one , the very first chapter would convince you he is a master. He clearly forecasts what would happen once a bear market arrives, and even that when it would come.Only regret is that in bull mania of those gone years, I missed this book. Next time when it comes, Mt Zweig would have me ready.Thank you Mr. Zweig"},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"If you are a longer term type of investor this is a great book.

Not for Every Investor but may be for Every American Investor which is actually stated in the title. Certainly some parts can add real value to ones investing strategy somewhere else in the world. Sticking to the rules laid out in the book you will perform better than others during bull markets (but not necessarily outperform) and what is important you'll outperform during bear markets. I found the most valuable the chapter about market centiment and croud psycology. Anyway the book is not a waste of time at all"},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"Marty is a genius in his simplicity. The books shows the clarity of his thought process and deep market experience. The book's highly effective techniques would mostly be relevant in a non-deflationary enivronment. The book's monetary model timing techniques would work in say 90% of the situations but could cause major financial demage in relatively rare defaltionary situations such as 2001/2002 when the monetary model (and the overall super model)gave a buy signal. My humble advice to any follower of these models would be to increase the 4-percent model weighting to 50% of the overall super model during uncertain times. That should ensure that one enters/exits only when the tape mandates it (along with the monetary indicators) and thus limitng any major damage when the monetary model fails as it did in 2001/2002. Perhaps Mr. Zweig should update this book or even better write a completly new book as the markets have evolved a lot since the early 90's. He owes it to investing humanity and should further share his god-given talent for the common good."},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"Martin Zweig is one of the smartest and most successful stock pickers ever to walk down Wall Street, and he's not ashamed to admit it. This book tells you more than you ever knew you wanted to know about him personally before getting down to the brass tacks of his investment methodology, but then he delivers one of the best guides to investing ever written. You don't even have to trade stock actively to benefit from his lucid explanation of how the market works. We [...] recommend this book for anyone with savings or investments, and especially for active stock investors."},{"Title":"Winning On Wall Street","review":"Martin Zweig write to his reader as a friend, wanting the reader to understand the magnificant logic of his amazing, and simple investment strategies.

The Luftwaffe was extremely effective in interdicting and preventing enemy counterattacks, also Luftwaffe officers and army officers directed the attacks. But Van Creveld argues that the Luftwaffe wasted their resourcers against civilian targets such as railroads. The next air force that Van Creveld analyzes is the Soviet air force. The Soviet air force was under complete control of the army and acted as flying artillery to prevent any German counterattacks from appearing, but the Soviet air force engaged in hardly any interdiction missions against the Germans. According to Van Creveld the Soviets had the most effective form of aerial warfare since their role as flying artillery impeded the Germans from stopping the Soviet attacks. The final air force that Van Creveld evaluates is the Israeli air force. During the Six Day War, the Israeli air force was able to destroy lightly armored trucks but could not due any damage to the Arab tank forces. In the 1973 war the Israeli airforce couldn't provide close air support due to the presence of SAMS. Van Creveld than concludes the book by writing a chapter about the Gulf War that is strongly crititcal of the USAF. In Van Creveld's opinion if the USAF wasn't addicted to strategic air warfare than it could have closely cooperated with the ground forces in destroying the Iraqi army. In the appendix chapters USAF generals reply to Van Creveld's criticisms by stating that the Allied bombing campaign in Western Europe allowed the Russians to gain air supremacy and have effective close air support operations and the same applied to the IAF's performance in the Six Day War. The only weakness of Van Creveld's book is that he ignores Allied close air support operations in Western Europe from 1944-45, but otherwise this an excellent description of how the Russain and German airforces operated in the Second World War and how the IAF operates today."},{"Title":"Air power and maneuver warfare (SuDoc D 301.26/6:M 31)","review":"Blargh! That was the sound of my brain spewing out all the garbage thoughts I had about strategy before I read this book. Dr. van Creveld, et. al., provide a remarkable (and concise) analysis of manuever warfare and the coexistent application of airpower. You're missing the boat if you think this book is Stewart Smalley self-motivational testimony for the \\"Zoomies\\" (Air Force). This book concisely provides the six tenets of maneuver warfare within the first 10 pages, giving the lay-reader an excellent oversight into how it is that the United States dominates every battlefield (and by extrapolation, the reader can figure out why disasters such as Somalia occur when the military deviates from that 'winning' formula).In describing the history of maneuver warfare, van Creveld pre-empts the maneuver warfare nay-sayers by going beyond simple parallels of the German model. Yes, he gives the reader an outstanding version how Nazi Germany 'Blitzkrieg' tactics (really the application of maneuver warfare concepts) devasted Europe in the opening months of the Second World War. But Dr. van Creveld also goes into detail regarding the Soviets' masterful turning of the tables on the Eastern Front, Israel's decisive brilliance in the Six Day War, and maneuver warfare's direct role in the defeat of Iraq in 1991.Now, who should read this book? In my humble opinion this book should be mandatory for all new military officers and senior non-commissioned officer. Not because it espouses air power's importance in modern warfare, but because it gives the reader an excellent template from which to build a cohesive team and winning strategy for overcoming challenges. Hell, you could even cull out all references to air power and strictly look at the six principles of manuever warfare - I'm strongly considering doing my master's thesis on \\"Maneuver Warfare Concepts and Modern Business Strategy\\".In short, whether you're a military member, aspiring military historian, or a business person looking for new creative techniques to conquering the competition, this book is for you!"},{"Title":"Troll Meets Trickster on the Dakota Prairie","review":"This book was a gift.

A winner!"},{"Title":"Real ACT Prep Guide w/CD-Rom, 1st ed","review":"This guide is essential for a simple reason. It is the only one that provides authentic ACT questions. When preparing for the ACT, it is critical that you practice with test samples using true ACT questions. All the other companies (Barron's, Kaplan, Princeton Review, etc...) provide imitations of such questions. Some are criticized for being too hard, or too easy. Don't waste your time and use the real stuff.However, you can't trust the test makers to give insightful strategies about how to handle their own test. That would be like a conflict of interest. Use this book strictly to practice the test. For strategies, you'll have to look elsewhere. Some of the best sources are from books on sale on the web by companies founded by students who have been extremely successful ACT test takers. One of these companies is Lazy Student's Way. If you want to spend less money, use the Kaplan ACT guide. It is much richer and better in terms of providing strategies than this one. Either way, you will be well armed to ace the ACT."},{"Title":"Real ACT Prep Guide w/CD-Rom, 1st ed","review":"I bought this book along with the ACT for Dummies, and I only use this book for the practice tests. Whether you want to improve your score or just get a feel for the test, this book's 3 practice tests can't be beat. After all, they are the real ACT tests.The answers after each test offer some explanation if you missed the question, but since this book doesn't tend to brush you up on any skills in the beginning, it won't do it in the answer, either. If you miss a hard math problem, the answer won't offer as much explanation as other books do.If you're planning on using this book to review for the ACT a few nights before, don't bother. The information is organized as if you were taking the real test, question by question. It tells you what type of question it was, and how you should have answered it. The night before the test, I would find it more helpful to go straight to your math notebook and brush up on your geometry instead of trying to memorize types of questions.Overall, this book really does seem like it was written by \\"the Makers of the ACT.\\" Explanations and directions on how to approach a question sound like they come right out of the test its self. This can be helpful if you haven't taken the test before, but for those of us who have and simply want to improve our scores, this information is just repetetive.In conclusion, if you want to buy this book for it's practice tests, you'll be satisfied with it. I suggest also picking up a sample practice test along with your registration packet if this is your intent. But if you want to buy this book to help you better understand sine, cosine, and tangent, and cram information right before the test, don't bother with it."},{"Title":"Real ACT Prep Guide w/CD-Rom, 1st ed","review":"Everyone studies for the ACT in a different way but the one thing that everyone needs to do is practice. This book offers 3 practice tests published by the College Board. Getting into the ACT offers 2. My advice is get both of them. When I did 2 practice tests before this book I got 28's on both. Then I worked through the 3 tests in it and saw significant improvements each time. When I finally took the ACT I got a 31 on it so from personal experience I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Real ACT Prep Guide w/CD-Rom, 1st ed","review":"I purchased this book before taking the ACT for the first time. I figured it would be a good idea to get a review book with full-length tests included because unlike the SAT for which I took the PSAT, I had never taken the PLAN exam because my high school does not offer it, and I was completley unfamiliar with the ACT format. The book is very extensive, which is helpful if you have the time to read through the whole thing, but I for one did not: I waited until after taking my SAT to start working on ACT prep so I wouldn't be trying to prep for two different tests at the same time and therefore I only had a few weeks to review. This may seem like a long time, but anyone who is a junior in high school (especially those who attend college prep. schools) knows that there is little time left to do much of anything after homework and extracurriculars. I only cracked open my copy of the Real ACT Prep guide ot get a feel for what on earth this \\"science\\" section is all about, to see how scoring works, and look at how the ACT optional writing differs from the SAT essay (in my opinion, the ACT writing prompts are less abstract than the SAT ones).I did most of my prep work from Kaplan's \\"Procrastinaters Guide to the ACT\\" purely because I WAS short on time and it covers topics in a much more concise fashion. It does only include one full practice test, but when I registered for the ACT via mail at my school, we were given a booklet from ACT with a practice test, so I actually had two tests outside the \\"Real ACT prep guide.\\" This was plenty under the time constraints I had.I will probably re-take the ACT simply because I can do so and choose which score I want to send (unlike the SAT). This time I will have more time to prepare so I will use the \\"real ACT Prep guide\\" to especially look over the math and \\"science\\" sections in more depth.In short, if you have plenty of time before you take the test, this is a very good book. If you haven't got a whole lot of time, go for something more in the vein of \\"The procrastinator's guide.\\"*note: I put the science section in quotations simply because the section has little to do with scientific knowledge; all it really measures is how quickly you can analyze table and graphs to make conclusions and beat the clock--emphasis should be put on the -quickly- part!"},{"Title":"Real ACT Prep Guide w/CD-Rom, 1st ed","review":"I needed a 32 on my act score, and got a 31 before, so I checked out a few books from the library on ACT test review.

I would recommend Kaplan or Princeton Review series ACT books to help you get better at the ACT.

As a teacher who helps prep students for the college admissions tests, I know what most students are willing to do. Hours of study and review over a long period of time may be the ideal, but it is an unrealistic ask of most teenagers. Their most efficient use of time is to take practice tests and then look over the problems missed. This book has real questions direct from the source combined with good explanations of all answers. The overall review sections are short and to the point. Students may take practice tests one section at a time to avoid burnout (but must understand why they missed each question). A few hours spent preparing with this method will raise scores, probability of admission to certain schools and the amount of scholarship money a student is likely to earn."},{"Title":"Real ACT Prep Guide w/CD-Rom, 1st ed","review":"The ACT is quickly becoming an equal competitor to the SAT college entrance exam. Accordingly, the test prep industry is growing up around this relative newcomer-turned-regular on the admissions scene.This book, published by the ACT organization--the makers of the test--is a fantastic resource for any student or teacher working on test preparation. But, in all honesty it is only worth the [...](a pretty reasonable price) because of the three real practice tests included inside. The rest of the book...the introduction, the strategies, and even the question answer explanations...have been done better by other organizations. It's no slight to the ACT company, but they simply did not choose to share the best strategies to beat their own test.Still, this book contains the only published real ACTs, and all other companies cannot match their faithfulness to the test (some companies unfortunately are very, very far off). Similarity and accuracy are essential for practicing, because the format, style, and difficulty level of practice problems can vary immensely. Since the best way to practice for the test is to work out real problems, this book is a must-have resource for any student or instructor.Hopefully the ACT will publish some more tests soon. In the meantime, you can also try and get a hold of their free \\"Preparing for the ACT\\" guide which comes out every fall. Each one contains a full practice test, so try and get your hands on them.

Unlike many Shoah memoirists, Isabella didn't stop at what happened immediately after the liberation. This wonderful little volume details what she and her two remaining sisters went through from January to June of 1945. They managed to escape from a death march to Bergen-Belsen on the 23rd of January while most of the guards had run to the back to halt and punish an earlier escape that was already in progress, and the guards who remained in front of the column couldn't see them from their position. They also happened to be right across the way from a house with no smoke coming from the chimney, and in that blink of an eye it became one sister blindly mutely following the other. Isabella and the youngest of her remaining sisters were very nearly caught and shot, but miraculously the SS man and his dog walked away without seeing or scenting them. The oldest sister wasn't as lucky and was captured, beaten, and dragged back to the column to continue the march. But for the three who escaped, the liberation came a few days later, in form of the Red Army. For 6 weeks they stayed in the house they'd escaped into, along with 3 Polish women who also escaped into the house (and there were 30 girls and women who escaped in the same vicinity, they discovered). They were still cold and hungry, and being forced to work for the Russians (such as washing their bloody uniforms in harsh lye and herding cows), and with no stores open had to loot everything, or be ingenious with what they already had, but the thrill of freedom was so great that in the grand scheme of things it didn't really matter to the girls.We see flashes of bitterness and hatred for what was done to their family and against the people who did it to them in the first place, but overwhelmingly this is a story of their reawakening, their gradual return to normal life and the human family, a constant continual joy and delight in life, at all of the people they met on the road in front of their house, on the road from Jagadschutz to the train station in Oelsk, on the train to Odessa, and finally in the refugee center in Odessa. These people knew what had happened and then some, had already lived through too much for one to expect them to be happy or hopeful, yet there they all were, full of love, life, hope for the future, constant acts of little kindnesses to total strangers to whom they instantly felt like lifelong friends or family, were constantly upbeat about the future, optimistically asking anyone and everyone if they'd seen their missing friends and family, to tell them they were alive if they saw them, hoping that their oldest sister and only brother would find them anyday now. The joy and love in these pages are balanced by the sorrow of remembering the barely recent past and how they will forever be condemned to live in two worlds, then and now, that the memories will live as long as they do, but this is not a book about hate and bitterness, it's a book about forging a hopeful loving future. As it says in one passage, these sisters were sewn together emotionally in the camps, a powerful bond forged in fire, and on the road from liberation to joining their father in America they continue to be virtually inseperable, still helping and supporting one another. And as we find out, the youngest sister Regina (called \\"Rachel\\" in this original volume because at the time she didn't want her real name in print) turned out to be the bravest strongest one, the mother hen to this shrunken little family, when before she'd been the one who most wanted to go the way of the smoke, saying the moment they were separated she'd go to the crematorium and wouldn't mind, and that she was only making this superhuman effort for her three older sisters.By now this volume has been made largely obsolete, however, because of the publication of it and 'Fragments of Isabella' in one combined volume, but here as in the first book we see sentences, minor but telling words and phrases, and even entire paragraphs that were excised in the updated edition. The most glaring omission is in one of the early chapters, where Isabella is talking about how she and her sisters have no feelings as they step over a dead body on the newly liberated German roads, and only perk up if the corpse, Nazi or not, is wearing nicer clothes than theirs. In this original volume there are several paragraphs talking about how this numbness to death was formed in Auschwitz, when every morning the women who had died overnight were stacked up outside of the barracks and collected by the Totekommando, and how glad she always was that she wasn't among the dead stacked up outside of the various blocks. \\"There but for the grace of the deadly night was I.\\" It's also bittersweet to realise that while Isabella and the two sisters whom she escaped with are adjusting to freedom and on their wonderful life-affirming journey to Odessa and then America, their fourth sister was still on the death march and then in Bergen-Belsen, that she was liberated and died soon afterward as they were sailing to America, knowing that if the guards hadn't returned at that moment, she would have been with them."},{"Title":"Spirituality of Liberation: Toward Political Holiness","review":"\\"In this book, Jon Sobrino invites us to enter this amazing new world of 'political holiness' in which life is transformed and hope rekindled.

It is a remarkable story by all accounts. Their poetry has recently, in the past 10 years or so, been re-discovered and places them in the same category as many of the Great Victorian Poets, i.e., Wilde, Swinburne, Rossetti, and others. To label them simply by the title of lesbian literature limits 2 women whose works are some of the best produced during their time period. What Emma Donoghue does is tell Elizabeth Bradley and Edith Cooper's story simply and easily. After reading her book, I was so interested in these 2 women I spent days, weeks and even months searching down more information on them. Donoghue brings them to us in a moving and unexpected way. This book is a joy to read whether you are interested in Victorian literature, Lesbian literature, or simply human interest stories. I highly recommend this book as an introduction to 2 wonderful and creative writers."},{"Title":"We Are Michael Field (Outlines)","review":"This is an excellent introductory biography of Michael Field. There is not much written about these two remarkable women writing under a pseudonym in the late-Victorian period, but this book broadly covers all of the bases.

Their poetry was highly acclaimed in their day and published under the masculine pseudonym &quot;Michael Field&quot;. Unfortunately, this eccentric pair and their writings are no longer remembered today and little has been known about them until this book was published, bringing to light rare information culled from unpublished journals and letters. This is the story of two unusual and extraordinary artists who did everything together, including write with each other by day and sleep with each other by night. They had likeable and unlikeable sides to their perosnality and not all of their views and attitudes would be acceptable in today's more liberal times.

Frank was a fine theoretical physicist and a very cultivated man. Afterwards, in America, he became a philosopher of science at Harvard, I believe. This book is not the most complete biography of Einstein, but I still think it is the most intelligent, and the most beautifully written. Having had many conversations with Einstein at the peak of his career, he offers wonderful portraits of both the early life of the genius and of his work. I lost the count of how many times I read this book!"},{"Title":"Einstein, his life and times","review":"When discussing the life of Einstein it is never clear whether one's focus should be on the simple biographical facts, the scientific work or his political and social activism. This book attempts a distillation and mostly succeeds because it captures the essense of the man who was simultaneously many things - a complex, gentle person who became a persona.For a long time he was defined by the equation E=MC2 but over time his other theoretical work has been explored (and many times dismissed) and more importantly, his early years and the ideas that emerged from that era have come more sharply into focus. The author provides a wealth of data on the European life of Einstein which is interesting in itself.The author waxes eloquently on the non-scientific side of the man, the humanist that the world knows today. This is a beautiful, complete work covering all aspects of Einstein's life."},{"Title":"Einstein, his life and times","review":"Einstein: His Life and Times was written by Philipp Frank, Einstein's close friend and colleague. It includes a plethora of information about Einstein's life and ideas as well as the effects of his work. The biography begins with information about Einstein's family, childhood, and early schooling along with the first signs of his interest in intellectual topics. The book discusses Einstein's personality and his relationships with others including colleagues, friends, and students. The book is not constrained to physics alone. It also goes very deep into philosophy and how philosophical ideas have shaped the world of science and physics. Besides Einstein's personal life and struggles (e.g., with anti-Semitism and finances), Philipp Frank explains Einstein's major theories (including the theory of relativity, the quantum theory, and the equivalence of mass and energy) and scientific ideas. Obviously, Einstein's theories are very complex, and even many scientists of his day could not fully comprehend them. However, Frank tries to explain these theories in terms that can be understood by most people. The book is interesting because it is not overly simple (it includes some very difficult concepts and proofs), but it isn't overly complex either. Frank covers many topics, ranging from curved space to the relativity of time to the atomic bomb. There is also lots of discussion of politics and the effect of the Nazis and World Wars on Einstein and physics. Philipp Frank has written this book for several reasons. Firstly, Einstein was a great influence on his life because they were colleagues and good friends. In addition, Einstein appointed Frank as his successor as the professor of Theoretical Physics at the University of Prague. Frank must have felt extremely fortunate to be connected with a man of such intelligence and fame. Frank wants to provide the reader with his personal insights and experiences with the world's most recognized genius of the modern age. His purpose was to perhaps provide a clearer picture and understanding of this enigmatic man known as Einstein. Frank even says in the introduction, \\"I am writing this biography of Einstein...for people who want to understand something of the contradictory and complicated twentieth-century world....[A]nyone who comprehends even a little of Einstein's personality, his work, and its influence will have taken a long step toward [such] an understanding.\\" Anyone who is at all interested in Einstein's life, his ideas, or abstract concepts regarding physics and philosophy should read this book. The book is absolutely full of interesting facts, experiences, and information. I had a lot of fun reading it especially because it is suited for both the layman and the more advanced."},{"Title":"Einstein, his life and times","review":"Einstein was and still remains the most compelling figure of the 20th century. He is universally recognized as the greatest mind the world has ever known even though many of his proponents do not understand the theories that made him a public figure in the first place. Einstein: His Life and Times attempts to shed light on both the theories that created the genius and the genius that created the theories that forever altered the course of mankind. In describing Einstein's theories, Frank is more than competent as he was Einstein's successor as Professor of Theoretical Physics in Prague. There is no doubt that Frank understands the concepts articulated by his predecessor. For the lay person Frank's explanations and the prose they are written in are difficult to comprehend. To worsen the symptoms, the in depth discussion of the theories of special and general relativity, as well as the history and development of the physical sciences are laborious reads at best. Moments such as these are precisely what keeps this biography from achieving the greatness it is capable of. Frank would have served his audience better if he had trimmed the biography of some of it's theoretical \\"fat\\" and \\"seasoned\\" it with deeper insight into the humanism of it's subject. For the most part Einstein: His Life and Times was an enjoyable read, I just wish I had tried one the other Einstein biographies instead."},{"Title":"Einstein, his life and times","review":"Although Frank's writing is readable, it is not easy reading for the general reader. Walter Isaacson's Einstein bio is an easier reading, which I suggest, UNLESS one is into Physics...flyingears"},{"Title":"Einstein, his life and times","review":"When discussing the life of Einstein it is never clear whether one's focus should be on the simple biographical facts, the scientific work or his political and social activism. This book attempts a distillation and mostly succeeds because it captures the essense of the man who was simultaneously many things - a complex, gentle person who became a persona.For a long time he was defined by the equation E=MC2 but over time his other theoretical work has been explored (and many times dismissed) and more importantly, his early years and the ideas that emerged from that era have come more sharply into focus. The author provides a wealth of data on the European life of Einstein which is interesting in itself.The author waxes eloquently on the non-scientific side of the man, the humanist that that the world knows today. This is a beautiful, complete work covering all aspects of Einstein's life."},{"Title":"5001 Nights at the Movies","review":"This is a very good anthology of Pauline Kael's writings, but capsule reviews are very unsatisfying to those who are familiar with the strengths of her reviews as they were originally written. Kael is known for her flowing, \\"conversational\\" writing style; by chopping many of her reviews into two or three paragraphs, the main reasons for reading her in the first place tend to evaporate. In a typical Kael review, she literally layered opinions on top of opinions. It was not enough for her to simply review a movie--she had to express exactly how the directors and actors had grown (or diminished themselves). One looked forward to reading her because she had such a superb way of relating the film she was writing about to other films, whether by the same director or not, and she could intelligently speculate on how the film tied in to current events or may have been a product of them. She would talk expertly about how many films seemed to evolve out of other less superior ones and then expand due to a director's vision and desire to update a particular theme. Kael focused on what a movie is about--what it is really saying--and her dedication and playfulness was quite infectious (the many reviewers who used her style became known as Paulettes.) For a reference book, \\"5001 Nights At The Movies\\" is fun to look through; it is full of reviews but it is Kael-lite. She didn't call one of her best books \\"Deeper Into Movies\\" for nothing!"},{"Title":"5001 Nights at the Movies","review":"As someone who is just beginning to explore the classics, I love being able to see what Pauline Kael thought about many of the most important movies of our time. Since I often agree with her, it helps me save time and money in determining which movies I want to rent (and if not available to rent, buy). All movie titles are in alphabetical order, and there is an index in the back which contains film titles, directors, actors, etc.However, the capsule reviews can occasionally be misleading. From the capsules, I thought Pauline liked (or at least didn't dislike) &quot;8 1/2&quot; by Fellini and &quot;Hiroshima Mon Amour&quot; by Resnais. But in her book &quot;I Lost It At The Movies&quot;, the full reviews are a pretty harsh pan.I also wish that she had a &quot;Best Movies&quot; list. Nevertheless, still a very useful (but thick) book."},{"Title":"5001 Nights at the Movies","review":"Gosh... Movie reviewers can certainly offend easily. I agree with Pauline Kael's assessments roughly 50% of the time, but I still love reading her. She is always intelligent (even when she is wrong wrong wrong) --- and what a great writer! She manages to be &quot;mean&quot; over and over again without exactly being mean-spirited. And why on earth is a movie reviewer not supposed to have political opinions? I never understand this peculiarly American criticism. Can you review &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; or &quot;Rambo&quot; or &quot;La Chinoise&quot; without venturing into the realm of politics? Probably, but why would you want to? I don't think the type of person who makes this criticism is really looking for a dry, studied dissection of film technique, but perhaps I'm wrong. Anyway, she's no more &quot;political&quot; than any other worthwhile reviewer I can think of. This book is full of buried treasures --- quite a few films in it that I had never even heard of before. It's just a darned entertaining read, too. Every few pages, there is a laugh-out-loud funny turn of phrase. Usually a pretty mean turn of phrase but it's hard to have harsh feelings towards someone who writes, for example, in her review of &quot;Funny Lady&quot;, &quot;The moviemakers weren't just going to make a sequel to 'Funny Girl'---they were going to kill us.&quot; Or, in a review of &quot;The Last Tycoon&quot;, &quot;...so enervated, it's like a vampire movie after the vampires have left.&quot;"},{"Title":"5001 Nights at the Movies","review":"Pauline Kael was at her tangy, erudite best in the long-form reviews she wrote for \\"The New Yorker.\\" Nevertheless, these capsule reviews she culled from her longer articles to comprise \\"5001 Nights at the Movies\\" manage to capture the acerbic essence of her style. (There are a few exceptions, such as the bare-bones squib on the Gene Deitch-Jules Feiffer satirical cartoon \\"Munro,\\" so short and bland that I wonder why they bothered to print it.)Kael was the first celebrity film critic, and still the most bracing and fun to read, although she can be extremely annoying when you disagree with her. (I don't understand her enthusiasm for John Boorman's indigestible \\"Excalibur,\\" or her condescending summation of John Ford's masterful \\"The Quiet Man\\" as \\"fearfully Irish and green and hearty,\\" to give two of many examples.) Kael had an encyclopedic knowledge of film technique and history, and she was never afraid to call them the way she saw them. One of her sharpest putdowns was of the Dustin Hoffman-Mia Farrow romantic drama \\"John and Mary\\": \\"Remember when that man in \`The Graduate' told Hoffman to go into plastics? Well, he did when he made this one.\\" And she was no respecter of inflated reputations, as when she took on Alain Resnais' revered \\"Hiroshima, Mon Amour\\": \\"Hushed and hypnotic, it makes you feel so conscious of its artistry that you may feel as if you're in church and need to giggle.\\"Kael excelled at giving readers the exact mood and feel of a movie, and when she was right about a movie, she was very, very right. She puts the finger on Jean Cocteau's \\"Orphee\\": \\"Cocteau's special gift was to raise chic to art.\\" And she was astute enough to call Kurt Russell \\"a star in the world of the mendacious\\" for his much underrated comic con man performance in Robert Zemeckis'\\"Used Cars.\\" She also pinpointed the exact problem with Lawrence Kasdan's Western \\"Silverado\\": \\"The film is so opulent it has a nouveau riche aura about it; it's a counterfeit Western, without the feel of the memorable ones.\\" The book doesn't quite live up to its title--there are 2,800-plus capsule reviews here, not the 5,001 the title would suggest. Nevertheless, they make compulsive reading. Like a giant tub of buttered popcorn, you'll find yourself consuming these reviews till you come to the end."},{"Title":"5001 Nights at the Movies","review":"Pauline Kael is fascinating to read, providing you know that you won't necessarily agree with her. In fact, you'll probably become quite irritated with her blindness to the greatness of a film. But Kael is (was) a fantastic reviewer of film, because she never compromises her opinion, she makes you think, and most of all, she obviously loves movies. I say that she makes you think because when she trashes a movie that you may love, (&quot;Star Wars,&quot; &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;) you will start coming up with arguments to her points yourself. Thus, she does what any great critic should do: challenge your opinion of a film, and make you gain a new perspective of what made that film great or terrible. Furthermore, Kael was one of the first major critics to do this. I also said that Kael obviously loved movies. This really comes across when she gives a film a good review. Her praise is, to say the least, glowing. If she thinks that a film is brilliant, she seems almost giddy in her writing. In short, Pauline Kael possesses all the qualities of a great reviewer."},{"Title":"5001 Nights at the Movies","review":"Mention the name \\"Pauline Kael\\" and you'll no doubt hear her work spoken in hushed tones and unwavering reverence. Indeed, the late film critic changed the way many writers approached reviewing movies. With the exception of James Agee, most critics prior to Kael's era tended to come off like high-minded Theater Critics slumming through a lower class of show business. Kael loved the movies for what they are- mass entertainment, and embarked on a buoyant writing style that gave the reader a visceral sense of a movie's immediacy with all the five senses she could muster. It was if she were a gourmand savoring each bite and describing the taste to a salivating dinner quest.She was a dazzling writer. However, for me, oddly, there has always been a problem reading Kael. Her style and shtick (she had the jauntiest use for the English language) could sometimes smother out her main focus- the movies. When Kael's criticisms were fired up, you could not get more illuminating when she championed the likes of BONNIE AND CLYDE or picked a fight with a party-pooping film theorist. But other times, whether you agreed with her or not, she could be frustratingly dismissive or obtuse and do mere \\"drive-by's.\\" I felt this way while wading through 5001 NIGHTS AT THE MOVIES. Kael's collection of capsules comments culled from over decades ultimately could be subtitled the \\"Best and Worst of Pauline Kael.\\"When chopped into smaller portions, Kael's reviews tend to read like a pastiche of ersatz thoughts and puns jotted down on pocket paper. She had a maddening inability to take just a few steps back and relive any movie from a different vantage point. Thus, you get the gist of the moment but nothing more expansive as to how a particular movie relates to the pop cultural landscape over time. Case in point is her review for FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE which she opines is \\"exciting, handsomely staged, and campy [?]\\" but writes little else before hitting the exit door. There is nothing about how the second James Bond adventure fits into the series' cannon or how the movie's cold war zeitgeist plays today. Instead we have to make do with her quickly assembled thoughts way back in 1963 that make her work seem uncharacteristically dated and out of touch. Elsewhere, oxymoronic word play pile up like \\"this isn't a good movie but it's compellingly tawdry and nasty,\\" or \\"this isn't much of a movie but it manages to be funny a good part of the time anyway.\\" Again, this was all part of Kael's shtick but if one is a novice and truly wants to use this book as an introduction to the world of movies you'd probably be left scratching your head as to what exactly does the lady mean here?Look, when it comes to literature on the movies, Pauline Kael is a must. But for a readable, on-the-money, and multi-layered take on the movies you'd be better served by Danny Peary's GUIDE FOR THE FILM FANATIC (a personal favorite and sadly out of print) or any of Roger Ebert's yearly guides. These books go a longer distance and with much plainer language."},{"Title":"5001 Nights at the Movies","review":"Having read Kael's work for years, I find untenable the assertion that she was favored European &quot;art&quot; film over American cinema. Any perusal of her writings will indicate that she lauded innovative American filmmaking - Scorsese (&quot;Mean Streets&quot;, &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;), Coppola (&quot;Godfather I&quot; and &quot;Godfather II&quot;), Altman (&quot;MASH&quot;, &quot;McCabe&quot;, &quot;Nashville&quot;, etc.) and was a discerning and forthright critic of &quot;art&quot; cinema - she does not exactly heap praise on Kubrick, she's rather reserved about Bergman (with some notable exceptions), doesn't have much use for Truffaut between &quot;Jules et Jim&quot; and &quot;Adele H.&quot;, adored Antonioni's &quot;L'Avenntura&quot; but didn't like his other work (especially &quot;Blow-Up&quot;), disliked Fellini's carny-collages, and railied against the pretentious art-house cinema mind games of Resnais's &quot;Hiroshima, Mon Amour&quot; and &quot;Last Year at Marienbrad.&quot; While she does indeed praise many foreign films - and this alone seems enough to make her a snob in some people's eyes - one comes away from her works of directors she liked (Scorsese's 1980s films, Altman's 1980's films, Satyajit Ray's &quot;Distant Thunder&quot;, Bunuel's &quot;The Milky Way&quot;) and praised the works of directors she didn't (Alan Parker's &quot;Shoot the Moon&quot;). Granted, she was often critical of popular favorities (and some of my favorities, too - like &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, &quot;Wings of Desire&quot;, &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;) but a critic who kowtows to popular sentiment rather than exercises her own judgement isn't a critic but a publicist.It's ironic that Kael spent most of her life criticizing those &quot;snobs&quot; (like Dwight MacDonald) who refused to acknowledge film as a popular art form - that there could be something aesthetic in a mass art form - and now, people accuse her of the same sort of arrogance. In truth, she was one of the most lucid and analytical film critics of her time. When she dug into a film's themes, a director's motives, an actor's performance, or a cinematographer's color scheme, she could make any subject complusively readable. And she performed the critics' most important function (which is not panning, despite what people may think) -- she helped one see elements and ideas in films that were frequently overlooked or taken for granted and she helped you to see them in new ways. You may have disagreed with her but you walked away from reading her work a sharper film viewer than before. The only flaw with a collection like &quot;5000 Nights&quot; is that all you get are summaries, not the complete reviews, so you can't get a full appreciation of her essayistic skills. For that reason, this book should be complemented with &quot;For Keeps&quot; to round out not only the breadth but depth of her writings"},{"Title":"5001 Nights at the Movies","review":"Pauline Kael (critic, author, scholar), is perhaps the most insightful film critic this century. Her book &quot;5001 Nights at the Movies&quot;, though consisting only of short encapsulated reviews, is unparalleled in its witty, sometimes scathing, but ultimately impartial examination of cinema (past &amp; present). Kael, thankfully, did not succumb to popular opinion, chosing to praise or scorn a movie for its artistic quality (or lack there of); she touted films that challenged and invited us to see things another way. This book isn't for the casual moviegoer looking to be pandered to. It is for those of us who still view cinema as an expressive and important art medium, instead of a vehicle for quick-fix, viewer condescension."},{"Title":"5001 Nights at the Movies","review":"I agree with some of the other reviewers of the book in that Pauline Kael is always worth reading even when you will not agree with her opinions. It is great to have someone's real opinions rather than some tepid mirror of an imagined contemporary consensus.On the other hand Kael goes well beyond expressing an opinion. It is clear that she has a personal agenda that influences all her writings. This is reflected in her powerful advocacy of the New Hollywood directors of the late 60s to 70s which, no surprise, happens to coincide with her own coming of age (at least as a professional critic). I think it is transparent in her writing but is also overtly made clear by Peter Biskind in his book Easy Riders, Raging Bulls. Indeed she played a significant role in bringing these directors to prominence and if only half the stories related by Biskind are true, she was hardly an impartial or disinterested voice. She was an insider and on her own particular power trip. Thus, in her support of these fantastically self-indulgent group of directors she must also take some responsibility for the big-studio backlash which we still suffer from today, namely big-budget, risk-averse blockbusters dependent for success more on their advertising budgets than true merit.Finally, in common with several of the other reviewers I also would like access to the original full reviews rather than these encapsulated versions. Of course a print version would be far too big. I only have the original edition but am reluctant to put out another twenty-plus dollars just for the 90s update. But I would readily buy a CD/DVD-ROM version especially if it was (i) properly formatted for searching etc and (ii) had the full original reviews."},{"Title":"5001 Nights at the Movies","review":"Pauline Kael did not specialize in capsule reviews, and in her NEW YORKER columns, any film that did not merit much more than one or two paragraphs was literally and figuratively being given 'short shrift.' The reviews in 5001 NIGHTS AND THE MOVIES were either written (kinda) anonymously for the \\"About the Town\\" section or have been largely been edited down from her lengthier reviews to make them more \\"browser friendly.\\" There are upsides and downsides to this approach. Readers still get a flavor for Kael's sharp, quirky writing style, but also get to the heart of her criticism more readily than they would have in the longer format. Yes, you can see almost immediately whether she LOVED IT or HATED IT, but some of the fun in reading Kael's longer reviews lay in following the twists and turns in her arguments. The more you got used to her highly personalized and somewhat rambling writing style, the more you appreciated her insights, which could be wildly enthusiastic, bitingly negative OR (more often than people gave her credit for) understandably mixed.Her writing often seemed like an attempt to reason through why a particular film mattered (implicitly, why it mattered to HER, but also why it might matter to other more or less like-minded souls). But even when she was dismissive of a film, she would often write at considerable length as to why it failed, why it still might be a popular success and why it may or may not matter as a cultural artifact, even if it was an artistic disaster.As some other reviewers have stated: she got you thinking. And even if you vehemently disagreed with her, either in general, or on this or that particular film, that's always a good thing. I remember, in my early 20s, getting excited over the auteur theory debate that was raging(?) a few years prior between Kael and Andrew Sarris. After a bit of reflection, I decided they were both right, in their ways. I'm nothing if not a critical mamby pamby, I guess. But seriously, there was something to be said for the film-as-product-of-an-auteur school and for the film-as-collaboration school. Both critics enhanced my understanding of film, and if that's mamby pamby, so be it.I'm glad to have this handy compendium of Kael's abbreviated writings. As noted, the capsule format makes for great browsing, and for many reviews, a reference for a more extended treatment (when available) is cited, so that researchers and new found fans can, if they choose, dig up a more exhaustive critique. Be advised, however, that many of the anthologies of her full length reviews are currently out of print. They still may be available through out-of-print services and in public libraries.If you like what you find in this volume, don't stop there."},{"Title":"5001 Nights at the Movies","review":"Reviewing a reviewer is always tricky, especially one as celebrated as the late Pauline Kael (d. 2001). She is famous for her love of some movies, such as Citizen Kane, and her dismissal of other classics, as in her famous review of Star Wars, which she called an \\"epic without a dream.\\" She did like Empire Strikes Back, though, so you have to give her some credit. One could find fault with every critic: I find Kael's preference for Ghosbusters 2 to Ghostbusters, Exorcist II to Exorcist, and Temple of Doom to Raiders of the Lost Ark inexplicable, but so too with Roger Ebert's liking of Van Helsing while trashing Napoleon Dynamite. No critic is perfect. But Kael at times seems such a tough critic that you begin to wonder if she even liked movies all that much. That may seem an odd statement to make, but what else could one wonder when she says Amadeus merely has \\"redeeming qualities\\" or when she gives a tepid review of The Third Man? After reading her slams of such classics as The Searchers or 2001: A Space Odyssey, at times, you wonder if Kael would have preferred to have been a food critic. After all, how many people complain, as she often does, about a movie's \\"texture?\\" And she includes enough literary references to make you also wonder if she would have been better off doing literary criticism. What bothers me most about Kael's book 5001 Nights is not that she prefers De Palma to Kubrick or that she dislikes some movies I like, what bothers me most is when she is glib or vague. The reviews here are usually not very lengthy. Some get only sentence or two. And since she does not have a star-rating system, you are left scratching your head as to whether or not she liked certain films. Nor does she include running times or MPAA ratings. The book, furthermore, contains few reviews from the 1990s, so don't look for the films of QT or Paul Thomas Anderson here, though the book is useful for older movies from the 1930, 40s, and 50s. For film buffs, you must read Kael at some point. But if you read this book, you are apt to be a little disappointed with her--best film critic of all time or not. I prefer Ebert's mid-western brand of criticism. Ebert seems a guy who really, really loves movies. That love comes across loud and clear in his reviews. With Kael you get the feeling that film criticism was often just a way for her to turn a clever phrase, whether or not it had much to do with the movie's good or bad qualities. And in that sense, she was at times the most condescending type of critic."},{"Title":"5001 Nights at the Movies","review":"Pauline Kael inaugurated an integrated, non-dogmatic era of film writing.

Simply because some people disagree with her, they slag her off as bitter and twisted. But, there are few more generous critics among her peers - consider, for example, her right-on-the-money review of &quot;Mean Streets&quot;.

Her prejudices and oversights are legion. Whole genres and careers are disposed of with little thought or discussion. American film (including most popular Hollywood products) is dismissed out of hand. She thoughtlessly skewers particular film actors whose work and careers have long since been re-evaluated and revitalized by other, more discerning critics (Norma Shearer is a good example). Kael harps on endlessly about the value of obscure European films that are often grainy, grim, technically inept, and a trial to watch. Her whole, 1960's philosophy of &quot;American film sucks, European film is flawless&quot; is outdated and tiresome. She can be witty, but her jokes are often at the expense of true, thoughtful insight and analysis of the films she is critiqueing. If a reader followed her advice whole, he or she would miss out on many of the great moments and performances in film history. Kael has her moments, and, if nothing else, her reviews, pro and con, may lead the reader to seek out and view the films themselves, as well as reading the work of other, more balanced critics of film."},{"Title":"5001 Nights at the Movies","review":"I have but four words for anyone thinking of getting this horrible book: Get Roger Ebert's book instead"},{"Title":"5001 Nights at the Movies","review":"Is Pauline Kael married?

In San Diego we've had the same movie reviewer, Duncan Shepard, for the San Diego Reader for two or three decades. Everyone I know who reads his reviews has cranky things to say about his reviews as his point of view is very distinct. However, the reviews are not useless. Once you learn that most of his 5 star films are something that the typical movie goer would give 2 stars to and his 1 or 2 starred films are sometimes our favorites, then it's a breeze reading his reviews. His point of view has remained true all this time.The same can be said for Kael. Both reviewers are very intelligent and see movies through their own viewing lens. We all have no choice but to see everything from our own point of view. The good news is, Kael keeps her consistent point of view, writes sharply and with some humor and is quite intelligent. As a result, one can learn about films by reading her reviews. The best way to approach this book, least for me, was to immediately read her reviews of films I have seen. Then I got a good idea of her perspective. Where she was coming from became more evident.I am delighted I purchased this book on amazon.com, the best book store around (besides Powell's in Portland but, it's in Portland, though, of course, they do have a website but it ain't the same as seeing all their books in their massive store). Ironically, it's the reviews on amazon.com that really help a person make more informed decisions about books you can't actually thumb through.I don't completely agree with Kael on her evaluations of every film. That's because everyone has their own fingerprint for their distinct tastes in movies, music and art. We are each formed by our upbringing and our experiences and our personal taste. What matters is when a person can efficiently convey an intelligent idea of a film to us with an honest perspective that remains true to her own point of view over the decades. Kael has accomplished this.I look forward to many more opportunities to dive into this thick book to explore the world of film from the late 1920's to the late 1980's. chrisbct@hotmail.com"},{"Title":"5001 Nights at the Movies","review":"What is it about Pauline Kael's reviews that catch us off guard?

Sometimes writes a like a girl, though - dead wrong on Blazing Saddles and other \\"guy\\" movies; otherwise, very perceptive about whether a movie is entertaining and spelling out the intended and unintended messages conveyed - read \\"The Searchers\\" review and you'll get an amazing amount of insight into the characters, story and director's intent."},{"Title":"5001 Nights at the Movies","review":"Pauline Kael's 5001 NIGHTS AT THE MOVIES is the best short note movie reference book. Kael has the ability both to describe and unload with a paragraph or two, which is the standard length of each movie treated in the volume. Each contains Kael's summary of the main players,the plot, and typically a physical attribute of one of the actors that caught her eye. Never has any critic written so much about how actors walk or talk or carry their arms or fluff their hair or roll their eyes. And, from Kael, it never gets old and once she points it out, you notice that she's right. That's not to say that her opinion of every movie is right. She gets as many wrong as right, but the wonderful thing the conviction with which she writes. Not for the tame of heart, but for movie lovers, a greatresource book."},{"Title":"5001 Nights at the Movies","review":"This covers - as you may have guessed - 5001 movies, and her views are clear, intelligent and valuable.

Helpful, entertaining stuff.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"},{"Title":"5001 Nights at the Movies","review":"Since this book first came out in the mid 1980s I have gone through no less than four well-thumbed, well-handled editions that have fallen apart from overuse. This is a compendium of all Pauline Kael's shorter reviews from the front of THE NEW YORKER, and it has perhaps given me more pleasure than any other book in my life. By no means exhaustive (Kael even made a gesture towards its ultimate incompleteness by neglecting to comment directly on GONE WITH THE WIND and THE WIZARD OF OZ), the book covers more films than you would imagine, and its always fun to see what Kael saw and what she thought about it. Her aesthetic--simultaneously magisterial and informal, Olympian and fun-loving--has been discussed, critiqued, and even criticized to death; yet there is no getting around the fact that she is not only smarter than most other movie critics but also funnier. Her reviews of works as disparate as \\"The White Cliffs of Dover,\\" \\"The Sound of Music,\\" and the 1951 \\"Show Boat,\\" have given me joy for years. Buy this, and see if you don't have to buy yourself another copy when the first one wears out."},{"Title":"5001 Nights at the Movies","review":"My review echoes what a lot of previous reviewers have stated: Pauline Kael makes you THINK about the movies, pure and simple. When you are generally in agreement with her review, you become excited to go back and view the film in question because you want to look anew at certain aspects of it that she has brought to your attention. When you disagree with her, and it is very easy to disagree vehemently with Ms. Kael, you become an advocate for or a prosecutor of the movie she comments on, and this makes the movie-going experience all the more fruitful. Ms. Kael makes a great number of &quot;big&quot; comments about movies, and, because of &quot;5001 Nights&quot;' condensed nature, these opinions are magnified. Most critics narrowly focus on the film they are reviewing, but you feel that Ms. Kael brings a thoroughly historical perspective to each review, and she doesn't shy away from turning a single review into a lesson in comparative film history. Finally, Ms. Kael is notoriously unsentimental when it comes to the movies, and at times the you can feel that she has missed an important, emotion-inducing quality of a film because of this personal and/or stylistic rigidity. Usually, though (but not always!), upon further reflection, you realize that your emotional reaction to the film was actually more ephemeral than you remember, and that this reaction was probably induced more by the dilute but still powerful medium of film itself rather than by any particularly cogent aspect of the individual movie in question. This realization teaches you to value the films that truly &quot;stay with&quot; you more than ever."},{"Title":"Graphic Classics Volume 7: Bram Stoker - 1st Edition (Graphic Classics (Eureka))","review":"\\"Graphic Classics: Bram Stoker\\" serves up an excellent collection of illustrated stories by horror Grandmaster Bram Stoker. Each tale is either fully illustrated, comic book style, or text and page combined. All of the illustrations are in black and white, and feature a wide variety of styles and flair. This is definitely not the typical art you would find in a DC or Marvel comic, but is much more \\"arty.\\"There is plenty of \\"Dracula,\\" Stoker's number one claim to fame, but there is also enough of his other works to let us know that he wrote more than one novel.\\"Lair of the White Worm\\" is a great tale of jolly, haunted England and the monsters that haunt its green and pleasant land. A comic book style tale, with a Victorian flair in style.\\"Torture Tower\\" shows the danger of being a loud-mouthed American tourist in Nuremberg. Comic book style.\\"The Wondrous Child\\" is illustrated text, with a flight of fancy and a trip to fairy land.\\"The Funeral Party\\" is a one-page illustrated text. Excellent dark humor.\\"Dracula's Voyage\\" is a scratchy rendition of the first few chapters of \\"Dracula.\\" Very well done.\\"The Dracula Gallery\\" has artists taking a snatch of text as inspiration, then creating a page.\\"Vampire's Hunter Guide\\" is a combination of Van Helsing's text and semi-humorous drawings.\\"The Dualists\\" is an illustrated text piece of two friends and their passion. By far the most gruesome of the lot.\\"The Judge's House\\" is comic book style, a haunted house story.\\"The Bridal of Death\\" is adapted from \\"The Jewel of Seven Stars.\\" A mummy tale."},{"Title":"Graphic Classics Volume 7: Bram Stoker - 1st Edition (Graphic Classics (Eureka))","review":"Like Mary Shelley, Bram Stoker is considered to be a one-hit wonder in the world of literature. Of course when you are talking about novels like \\"Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus\\" and \\"Dracula,\\" that is enough to establish your literary immortality. Both authors did write other works, and while Stoker does not have anything else in his literary resume as good as Shelley's novel \\"The Last Man,\\" overall his writing output was superior. \\"Lair of the White Worm,\\" his last novel, written fourteen years after \\"Dracula,\\" is the centerpiece of \\"Graphic Classics, Volume 7: Bram Stoker,\\" but to no one's surprise his vampire count pops up in a number of pieces as well.\\"Lair of the White Worm\\" is illustrated by Rico Schacherl and adapted by Tom Pomplum in 32 pages. Adam Salton arrives from Australia to meet with his great uncle Richard as the last surviving members of the Salton family. Adam travels to the old kingdom of Mercia in the heart of ancient Britain where strange things start happening. For example, snakes quickly crawl away from Lady Arabella March but later a mongoose attacks her. Eventually we get to the well by which the legendary White Worm came and went, and Lady Arabella has an even stranger encounter with a mongoose. Eventually Adam figures out what is going on and the goal becomes to destroy the titular creature. Do not think that the cover painting by Glenn Barr gives an indication of what the artwork is like for \\"Liar of the White Worm\\" because Schacherl's work is a lot more cartoonish. But the adaptation is solid and does a more serviceable job than the Ken Russell movie version.\\"Dracula\\" pops up in a variety of ways in this collection. The book's introduction is a letter to Stoker by Mort Castle with a modest proposal for a new dramatic presentation of \\"Dracula\\" as a ballet (which makes sense to anybody who has seen Guy Maddin's \\"Dracula: Pages from a Virgin's Diary,\\" which both Castle and I have done). \\"Dracula's Voyage: An Excerpts from Dracula by Bram Stoker,\\" adapted by John W. Pierard, retells the story of the journey of the \\"Demeter\\" that brought the count from Varna to Whitby. The black & white illustrations are more white than black, which is an interesting approach, and if Pierard is thinking about doing the entire novel that would be fine. \\"The Dracula Gallery\\" has a dozen one-page illustrations based on the novel displaying a wide variety of drawing styles. Those by Michael Manning, Jeff Gather, Lisa K. Weber, Todd Schorr, and Todd Lovering stand out from the others. Then there is \\"Professor Abraham Van Helsing's Vampire Hunter's Guide,\\" freely adapted by Tom Pomplun and illustrated by Hunt Emerson to humorous effect.The rest of the volume is an interesting variety of approaches and visual styles. \\"Torture Tower,\\" adapted from Stoker's \\"The Squaw\\" by Onsmith Jeremi, uses a dozen panels per page to tell the story of a man on his honeymoon in Germany who makes the mistake of killing a kitten (think E.C.'s \\"Tales from the Crypt\\"). \\"The Wondrous Child\\" is a fanciful fable by Stoker where the text has been edited down and there are a half dozen illustrations by Evert Geradts. \\"The Funeral Party\\" is a very short story by Stoker on one page with a Richard Sala illustration opposite. \\"The Dualists\\" is another edited text story, this time illustrated by Lesley Reppeteaux, which also evidences Stoker's grim sense of humor. By the time you get through these you will definitely be revising your estimation of Stoker as a one-hit wonder.The final selection of stories gets us back to conventional comic book presentations. Artistically \\"The Judge's House,\\" adapted by Gerry Alanguilan, is the most effective. I liked his close-up of the rat steadily glaring at our hero with baleful eyes; for that matter, I like the eyes of the judge and the ill-fated hero on the last couple of pages of the story. \\"The Bridal of Death,\\" an excerpt from \\"The Jewel of Seven Stars,\\" is adapted and illustrated by J. B. Bonivert, with an almost art deco style that seems rather ill suited to Stoker's story but which is certainly striking.Tom Pomplun's name pops up a lot in this volume because he is the designer, editor and publisher of \\"Graphic Classics\\" (he specifically edited down the text stories presented herein). You can find \\"Graphic Classics\\" devoted to the works of H.P. Lovecraft, Jack London, Ambrose Bierce, H.G Wells, Arthur Conan Doyle, and O. Henry. This venture has been successful enough that a revised and expanded second edition of \\"Graphic Classics: Edgar Allan Poe\\" has been released. There are few recognizable names (e.g., Richard Corden, Gahan Wilson), involved in these retellings, but you will see some of the names in this volume in others and will certainly come to have your favorites. I look forward to more of these volumes, especially if we get to the likes of Arthur Machen, Clark Ashton Smith, and Robert Bloch that I was read in my formative years."},{"Title":"Graphic Classics Volume 7: Bram Stoker - 1st Edition (Graphic Classics (Eureka))","review":"Reason for Reading: I'm working on reading the complete series.I had to ILL this volume and was a little disappointed to see I received the 1st edition (now out of print) as a more recent 2nd edition has been updated. But beggars cant be choosers and I'm just appreciate of my library system that they are able to get hold of about 95% of the books and movies I request through them.The publisher's website describes the changes in the second edition so I'm able to know how this one differs. First off, I have read Dracula twice and while I don't recall, I must have read a short story of 2 of Stoker's in the numerous anthologies I've read over the years. That said only one story in this book was familiar to me \\"The Judge's House\\".This book has some fun with Dracula, starting with an introductory letter to Mr. Stoker entreating him to put his book into ballet form (which it has been). Then there is a graphic adaption of Dracula's voyage across the sea, this was not very impressive, a Dracula Gallery consisting of art illustrating a quote from the book. Lovely art but again not so impressive and finally a supposed Vampire's Guide written by Van Helsing, comic and cute. These Dracula parts of vol. 1 have been removed, except the Vampire Guide, and replaced in vol. 2 by a full graphic adaptation of the novel. For this reason if I came across the second edition, I would read it for this alone. The rest of the two books are the same minus two small items. Lair of the White Worm, Torture Tower, The Judge's House and The Bridal of Death have all been graphically adapted. I absolutely adored Lair of the White Worm and The Judges House. Torture Tower was good, quite Poe-esque but The Bridal of Death was strange. The Wondrous Child has been presented differently, as an edited short story with several illustrations. I don't mind reading a book of illustrated short stories but I'm not impressed with editing them and it really had no place here in a graphic novel, besides they kept this story, while deleting The Funeral Party and The Duelists also written as a short story, and I would have rather have had them keep the much more sinister and creepy Duelists.I enjoyed all the artwork. Done in black and white it suits the macabre nature of the stories. There are many artistic styles presented but they are not so far apart that they mesh together nicely, coming together in a nice cohesive. I didn't even mind J.B. Bonivert's artwork this time, though I still don't care for it! Otherwise well-done and I am now a big fan of Stoker and must make sure I read more of him. His short stories are comparable to Poe. 3.5/5"},{"Title":"Graphic Classics Volume 7: Bram Stoker - 1st Edition (Graphic Classics (Eureka))","review":"Graphic Classics: Bram Stoker presents illustrated novel adaptations of classic tales of terror by Bram Stoker, best known for his classic novel &quot;Dracula.&quot; Stark black-and-white imagery by a variety of different artists (Hunt Emerson, Rico Schacherl, J.B.

Cozarinsky's style is metropolitan and compelling and the use of style to convey points is well done -- for example he uses excerpts of letters and other historical documents to call into question the truthfulness of memory.

Tactics are there in theory and actual 1st hand experiences in the text.A great offering"},{"Title":"The cavalry of World War II","review":"The Cavalry of World War II by Janusz PiekalkiewiczOne of the greatest myths of sublime courage to come out of World War II was that of the Polish Cavalry charging the German tanks. Curiously it was made by the German propagandists as a way of ridiculing the aledged backwardness of the Poles. It also shows the difference in militarisms and that Nazis were not just vicious but vulgar. An Old-school officer, German or otherwise would not have gloated at such a thing.There is another thing to know about the event. It never took place. Actually never is such a strong word. It might have taken place, war is always rather confused and the Polish campaign seems more confused then usual. If it happened it was either a miscalculation, a deliberate sacrifice(to cover another unit for instance), or simply an act of despair. But even the legendary specialty chauvinism of cavalry did not extend so far as to think a sabre could penetrate a tank's armor. Nonetheless this legend is taken as both an example of the desperate courage and quixotism of the Polish people and the obsolescence of the horse. The first is no myth, or rather no falsehood; the Poles fought well in their lost cause and in the end all they received was honor. The second is false. For cavalry, with it's limitations rightly understood was a very useful tool. What it could not do in a modern battlefield is as important as what it could do. It could not be \\"heavy cavalry\\" any more. That is it could not be concentrated at a weak point like a wedge jammed into a wall to be hammered home after the infantry crowbar had pried it open. That role was exclusively the tanks. It could not monopolize the \\"light cavalry\\" role of scouting, pursuit, and \\"exploitation\\"(roughly, marauding and terrorizing rear-echeloners)as there were now aircraft and armored cars. However the horse had a niche of it's own in the \\"light\\" role. It can go over broken terrain that machines can't reach. It can(to some degree) live on grass*. And it is often easier to buy or steal fodder then to do so with fuel. This made the horse important in wild places like the wastes of Russia.The author gives tales of the horse as it fought round the world for various nations large and small. There are many interesting tales. But most of the book is given over to photos that give a remarkable show of the cavalryman's life. These photos show such things as normal life in camp and on the march. It achieves one of the great achievements of a good historian, of transporting the reader into another world, in this case the bittersweet world of men who are not just fighting but upholding a way of life that the world seems to have little room for-and yet finding a place for it. It displays a curious incongruity with the world of technological warfare.In a way World War II was the end of the old world. This was the time when sailing ships disappeared finally from the world of commerce after a long struggle with engines. It was a time when much of the world still traveled by animals even in what we would think the most technological developed regions. It was the end of the old colonial world and the predominance of Europe. It was perhaps the last war directed and fought to a large degree by the descendants of the old aristocratic class that had reigned for centuries. World War II was a time when the old and the new existed together in a strange contrast. And it was the last large scale war in which cavalry played, if not a key role, certainly not an insignificant part.Perhaps it is appropriate that the book was written by a Pole, a nation proud of it's \\"horseiness\\". And a nation that is the home of lost causes. For a Polish cavalryman fought for two lost causes at once-that of Poland, and that of the horse. Neither succeeded but both had a good run for it. So read this book which is a great tribute to, to paraphrase the German analyst in the movie Patton: \\"The Mounted Warrior, A Magnificent Anachronism.\\""},{"Title":"The cavalry of World War II","review":"The only reason I did not give this 5 stars was it could have been even longer with more detail.

And, although it's written for Network Marketers in particular (and can truly help both the beginning and veteran Network Marketers to reach significantly higher levels of success within their companies), the wisdom contained in Dr. Barrett's teachings are applicable to any person in any field; assuming the goal of that person is to become a top producer and/or top leader.While I found myself learning and re-learning ideas throughout the book that held significant value (highlighter and pen were used often and lots of pages are dog-eared - the sure sign of a book I found to be very valuable), there were certain chapters that were of such help, I had to realllllly slow down and be sure to absorb them.While I won't spoil it here by trying to summarize in just a few sentences what he taught in an entire chapter, I will say that his concept of the \\"jelly in the donut\\" brought an entirely new understanding of \\"belief systems\\" and how they either help us or hurt us . . . usually, without our even knowing. He then expertly explained how to get the bad jelly out and the new, life-enhancing jelly in. If his explanation and teaching of just this one concept was all you read, it would still be worth many, many times the price of this book.However . . . don't stop there. There is so much more to read and learn, as well. I tried to read just a bit at a time but couldn't do it; the more I read, the more I wanted to read and the more I looked forward to knowing.What a great teacher. Thank you, Dr. Barrett.

Like many of the previous reviewers, I started this book with not quite high expectations, but certainly expected a diverting read. Boy was I wrong! It is so bad, it actually antagonized me. Full disclosure: I'm a retired USN person, and have some familiarity with the milieu. First the good stuff: the probability of the Las Palmas earthslide is almost 100%, according to much of what I've seen and read independently: it's only a question of when it will happen. Now the bad stuff: as others have noted, the naval terminology is egregiously wrong (Ensign junior grade? How junior can one be?); full Captains commanding an FFG (and oh by the way, in 2009, these ships will be about 40 years old and most are decommissioned now); ships and aircraft going the wrong way (course 270 is due west, not east), and so on. The characters need a lot of development to be even two-dimensional; the military coup is absurd; loooong spells of space-filling data describing volcanos, which is then repeated at least twice more; naval tactics allowing a known hostile to transit vast ocean areas with NO attempt at surveillance (lots of mention of SOSUS, but no discussion of what it is, how it works, or any explanation or rationalization as to why it didn't detect the BARRACUDA); no mention of any effort to find the source of the boat or its support, even though NSA determined that Chinese satellites were being used for communications, which is a VERY hostile act; using Antisubmarine Rockets (ASROC) to shoot down a cruise missile is ludicrous, since ASROC is a rocket-assisted torpedo, designed for ASW. One of the most unintetnionally funny parts was the starry-eyed characterization of Senator Teddy Kennedy as a staunch supporter of the military! Very bad book: if you must read it to keep your Patrick Robinson string alove, get it from the library: don't waste a dime purchasing it."},{"Title":"Scimitar SL-2","review":"As a life-long Republican, I was amazed and insulted by this book. Only the Republicans can do anything, the Democrats are totally inept. This is the main premise of the presidential \\"crisis\\" that is pivotal to the book. Where was the Secret Service while this was happening? The idea is idiotic to say the least.The story itself is an interesting idea, which is unfortunately so poorly executed as to be almost unreadable. The main idea is that a volcano in the Canary Islands will erupt and cause a \\"mega-tsunami\\" which will effectively destroy the east coast of the USA and the coast of Europe.Unfortunately, Mr. Robinson can't even keep his technical details straight even when he is making them up himself. At one point, describing how the tsunami will form, he says it will start at 1 kilometer in height and then increase to 150 feet when it hits the east coast. Sounds like a decrease to me, but I never was good at math. In addition, what a tsunami is was explained at least three times in the book, to people allegedly intelligent, who you would think had heard of the concept.Poor editing there.As to the other technical details, they don't border on the ridiculous, they leap-frog right past it. F-15s being flown by the Navy, US Air Force squadrons embarked on a carrier, a Harpoon missile being used as an anti-air weapon! Did Robinson simply pick the names and nomenclatures of weapons out of a copy of Jane's All the World's Weapons Systems at random?His cruise missiles use \\"sonar\\" altimeters to keep their altitude. The Patriots are either flying at \\"near the speed of light\\" or else possibly not capable of doing the intercept job. Which is it? The list goes on.A pivotal plot point involves bringing an aircraft carrier out to search for the rogue submarine, the carrier being loaded with Seahawk sub-hunter helicopters. Pages are devoted to the transfer of these helicopters from this carrier, to another carrier already in the area. The danger and complexity involved in transferring the fixed wing aircraft from the already resident carrier to the helicopter carrier (also a Nuke class CVN) and the helicopters to the first had me wondering, why not just fly off the carrier that brought them? Needless nonsense that makes no sense whatsoever.As to the sub hunt itself, it was idiotic from the start. We have the US Navy command searching for a submarine that they know they can't hear with passive sonar, and just using radar in the hope they will run across a periscope above water. Well, if you're searching for a sub you know is going to launch nuclear missiles, just use active sonar, right? Maybe not the same range, but effective nonetheless.I could go on, but I'll leave it with this thought. Techno-thrillers, unless they are science fiction, must, and I repeat must, be plausible. They have to \\"follow the rules\\" as it were. Otherwise it's just bad, and I mean very bad fiction.Love or hate Tom Clancy, but he always has his facts straight. In fact, if he read this book, he's probably laughing himself to sleep at night secure in the knowledge that Robinson poses no threat to Clancy in the techno-thriller genre.Don't buy it, don't even borrow a copy. You'll waste your money, which is bad enough. But above all, you'll waste your time on a piece of idiotic drivel."},{"Title":"Scimitar SL-2","review":"Scott Gaines' review is dead-on. I really liked the first 4 or so books. But this book and the previous one are just plain ridiculous. I won't go into details but I recommend you read Scott's review.I wish the Patrick of Sea Wolf/Nimitz/USS Unseen would return."},{"Title":"Scimitar SL-2","review":"While I enjoyed the plot of a majority of Mr. Robinson's books I found the inaccuracies of the book to be beyond belief. An example would be a Harpoon Missile being used to shoot down a cruise missle.The Harpoon is a Surface to Surface or Air-Surface anti ship missile with a top speed under the speed of sound not an Surface to Air or Air to Air anti aircraft/cruise missile weapon platform which would have a speed in excess of Mach 2.Another issue is the fact the he would lead us to believe that the SAS, arguably the finest counter-terrorist force in the world, would fail to sucessfully investigate the background of an officer under consideration for joining the regiment.Mr. Robinson states in his book that he has numerous contacts within the military community and if so I would suggest that they be allowed to read the book before publication to correct inaccuracies such as I and others have detailed."},{"Title":"Scimitar SL-2","review":"I am a big fan of this series of Sub, techno warefare books by Patrick Robinson. However this particular book did not hold my attention as closely as the previous books. Some of the descriptions of the obvious went on for pages and I found myself skimming through most of the descriptions. Also, where was the editing done? Last I checked the word was vulanologist, not volcanoologist. Also I found some of the technical stuff unbelievable and some wrong.Most importantly, where were the twists? They were not there. Robinson's humorous and intelligent Adm. Morgan and company never really got into a major battle of wits with their adversary. They were almost told what to expect by the enemy. There were no good undersea battles or special forces as in Nimitz Class or Kilo Class or any of Robinson's others. As I said before, the twists and mind games were missing.Maybe I was over eager to get my hands on this book. I would not discourage reading it, but do not start it with the great expectations I had when I flipped open the cover, maybe someone else may enjoy it more.I hope the next offering from Robinson returns to the format and style of Kilo Class or Unseen, or Seawolf."},{"Title":"Scimitar SL-2","review":"Hamas, the Moslem world's most organized terrorist group, had commissioned the building of a super nuclear submarine and loaded it with nuclear warheads. Can the United States stop Hamas from wreaking major havoc with their ultimate weapon?The premise is intriguing and Patrick Robinson's research into naval operations, submarines, nuclear warheads, and terrorist communications are impressive. But Robinson's naval operations research becomes an anchor that sinks his novel with carboard characters, crass stereotypes and unbelievable subplots.For naval operations veterans and other naval ops hobbysits, this book may have value in Robinson's painstaking detail in depicting the U.S. navy's strategy and maneuvers to stop the submarine. Robinson credibly debunks the infallability of sonar and plots an effective geography of the seas and defensive equipment that a submarine must navigate for real silence.The normal reader will find much of these operational details tedious and wonder why the author could not have spent the same kind of care in his depictions of people. Robinson's rough-crusted-but-soft-inside hero is shallow ; the superevil-totally-heartless villain even more so. So disappointing."},{"Title":"Scimitar SL-2","review":"The premise is interesting, but the execution and political campaigning is amateurish. I'm a big fan of the techno-thrillers, but Patrick Robinson's pro-GOP, anti-Democrat bent is ridiculous... bordering on juvenile. This book is more like an episode of Johnny Quest as written by Rush Limbaugh. If you have only moments to spare before your plane starts boarding and this is the only available book at the news stand, then maybe give it a try. But you may be better off just staring at the seatback in front of you."},{"Title":"Scimitar SL-2","review":"You know when an author has exhausted his genre when the entire naval climax takes less than a page and a half, and details on how the Eastern seaboard is evacuated takes over 30 pages. I can't tell you how delighted I was in skipping entire pages where Robinson just goes on and on about how Washington DC was being cleared of its treasures. I am so glad I got this book for the low, low price of $0.80 (not including shipping). This book is only slightly more palatable than a day old burger sitting in the heating tray at your local fast food burger joint. Hmmm... its a close call. Maybe I should have paid more attention to those 30 pages."},{"Title":"Scimitar SL-2","review":"As a staunch conservative, I enjoyed the idea of reading an enthusiactically anti-PC novel, since virtually all other novels these days are blatently and pathetically PC regardless of subject matter. But this novel was so full of errors, contradictions, and obvious mistakes that I couldn't make myself love it.On another but related point, anyone likely to read this novel has certainly read The Hunt for Red October. As such, any reader is likely to know at least a little about basic submarine warfare. I found myself continually exasperated with the silly way the rogue submarine was pursued (and repeatedly lost) and how \\"passive\\" sonar would ping and \\"active\\" sonar somehow was never an option. And don't get the idea that these were the worst holes in the story. This book was bad, really bad."},{"Title":"Scimitar SL-2","review":"As usual, this Robinson techno-thriller is fast reading and hard to put down. The plot, like in his previous novels, is a bit hard to swallow at times, but nonetheless engrossing. However, for some reason I cannot figure, there are always a few mistakes in his novels which any sharp editor with knowledge of the U.S. Navy and U.S. government agencies should have caught. Maybe I am being too picky; however, whenever they pop up it annoys me. I recall in one of his earlier novels he referred to a junior U.S. naval officer with the rank of \\"ensign upper class\\" or something as silly as that. There is no such rank in the U.S. Navy, nor in the British Navy as far as I know. In this book he talks about a U.S. agency involved with the control of U.S. military satellites as the National Surveillance Office vice by the correct name of National Reconnaissance Office. He also refers to the Armed Services Committee as the Armed Forces Committee. Then, the topper, and although it is a matter of politics, it is too unreaslistic to be believed. He bad-mouths every liberal in the President McBride administration but then praises Senator Ted Kennedy like he is the savior of our nation when in fact Kennedy has consistently been one of the most anti-military persons in the senate. A couple lines which nearly made me vomit: \\"But I know Teddy, if he lived on top of the goddamned Rockies, he'd still do the right thing about a threat like this.\\" And then we have a line describing Kennedy as \\"the senior member of the Armed Forces Committee, whose patriotism was unquestioned and whose personal motives to act on behalf of the United States were always impeccable.\\" Robinson has got to be kidding. Kennedy's obstructionist attitude toward the current administration, by words and actions, has consistently been anti-American, anti-military, anti-Iraq war. I know that this book is a work of fiction, but portraying Ted Kennedy as some sort of saint is ridiculous. But, with all the warts, I still enjoy Robinson's books. Carl Sundstrom, Captain, USNR (Ret), San Diego, CA."},{"Title":"Scimitar SL-2","review":"Just as spelling and grammatical errors will jar a reader, the endless errors in this novel made it hard for me to enjoy the plot.First of all, Robinson seems to be unaware of the deep and continuous indoctrination of American military officers and enlisted personnel concerning the ultimate authority of the civilian leadership in general and the President in particular. It's no coincidence that the Chairmanship of the Joint Chiefs is rotated regularly and that all commisions and the highest honors are issued in the name of the President and Congress. The likelihood of White House military guards not protecting the President from mutinous generals is almost as incredible as the Secret Service acquiescing without firing a shot.Then we have a thoroughly westernized British Moslem with no local clan membership suddenly getting religion and getting a top job in Hamas. Of course, when upset, our radical Islamist still mutters \\"Jesus Christ\\".We could at least ask that the easy military stuff be correct, but after hearing about the constant pinging of passive sonar (what does Robinson think active sonar does?) and how a cruise missile that gets through the SAMs will be stopped by Patriot missiles (if Patriots are not Surface to Air Missiles, what are they?), it is impossible to credit the technical details.Back at the White House, Robinson has the defense of the nation run from the Oval Office with paper maps spread out on the furniture when there is a well equipped Situation Room two floors down.My favorite nonmilitary bloopers are Robinson's assertion that a long shutdown of the stock market would be a global economic disaster (he should read up on 9/11) and his complete scrambling of the street layout of Manhattan. \\"... from 57th Street, north to Sutton Place, First, Second, and Third Avenues.\\" Sutton Place runs south from 57th Street and you don't need to go north from 57th Street to get to First/Second/Third Avenues, 57th Street intersects them all. Get a map, Patrick!"},{"Title":"Scimitar SL-2","review":"First off, I have to say that I always read Patrick Robinson under the self-imposed caveat that he's no Clancy. It's the same spirit by which I listen to Godsmack even though they're nowhere near as talented guitar-wise as Robin Trower nor as creative as Dream Theater. As such, what you get in this story is largely a Bond flick of a book--all action and not much character development. But then, I've loved Bond flicks ever since I saw Goldfinger as a teenager, so there you go. Okay, there's an exception in the curmudgeonly Admiral Arnold Morgan, but after all, Robinson has had several books to round out this old war horse. That's the advantage to having the same character in several books. And I don't have the same difficulty with the Ray Kerman character some other readers have. A guy who's been a British subject long enough to have served as a Special Forces-level soldier in Her Majesty's army would never cross over to the other side? Then how do you explain Cat Stevens, a Greco-English pop star, becoming a Muslim? But the basic premise itself is implausible to say the least. A bunch of Arab extremists get hold of a Chinese-owned Russian-built attack sub and decide to and a sunday punch on The Great Satan with its cruise missiles. That's where the PC bunch will get their first snit from. That's two nations many consider as victims of right-wing American xenophobia dissed in the same plot. Fun wow. But our villains plan to use the sub's missiles to knock the side off an island volcano in the Atlantic and cause a tsunami that would wipe out the East Coast. They give America a demonstration by causing an artificial eruption of Mount St. Helens. Actually, most real-world terrorist groups would get their jollies if they could accomplish that feat alone. To find out how to do it, the bad guys kidnap an eminent English vulcanologist, squeeze him for the info, then dump him in the Thames. One tends to wonder if any such experts really know how to actually make a volcano erupt, much less pass that on to someone else in a short period of time. Even a \\"student\\" with some expertise already. That's where this book reads a bit 007. I mean, Gold-fingaaahhhh! Or maybe more like Blofeld. Where the PC weenies are bound to go into overdrive is their tendency to forget that books like this are ADVENTURES, hear what I'm saying? Adventure stories have a good guy and a bad guy. Take that element away and it's about as entertaining as Ultra Slim-Fast is delightful to the palate. Really, after I take into accounting that this is not literature as such, that Robinson is no Pat Conroy, or even a Clive Cussler, the places I feel that Robinson went wrong here is that there are times where he has Morgan's wife Kathy sounding like a bt of a bimbo, where her appearance in earlier books indicate she is no such thing. Plus, there's my usual picky-picky that Robinson's American characters sometimes use British colloquialisms. Being that, as Robinson's bio indicates, he lives in the States as well as his native Ireland, you'd think he'd be more conversant in American slang, or, failing that, just have his Yanks speak a bit more formally."},{"Title":"Scimitar SL-2","review":"Patrick Robinson is back with his long-awaited follow-up to the excellent BARRACUDA 945, where we first met ex-SAS turned HAMAS General Ravi Rashood(aka Ray Kerman). The story opens in London when Rashood and some fellow terrorists kidnap Dr Paul Landon, a renowned expert in natural disasters. They force information out of him on volcanic eruptions and their effects, and how to set them off . . . Landon is later executed.The year in this book is 2009. The Republican Administration is ousted from the White House by a new Democrat President, Charles McBride, a thinly-fictionalised Clinton or Kerry. Admiral Arnold Morgan and his fellow military chiefs have also resigned or retired. Morgan, the regular good guy in Robinson's books, marries his secretary Kathy and they honeymoon in the Canary Islands, which are well-described here. Morgan and Kathy visit the mountains of Cumbre Veija, a dormant set of volcanoes and see four Arabs which Morgan suspects are up to no good. One of them, unknown to him at the time, is Rashood.Nobody thinks anything of it at first, until Lt James Ramshawe, a brilliant intelligence officer, has a hunch. It is later learned that after the unexplained eruption of Mount St Helens, HAMAS, using a second BARRACUDA-class submarine stored for them by the devious Chinese navy for money, and armed with North Korean-built missiles, has hatched a plan to force the withdrawal of all US forces from the Middle East and the creation ofa Palestinian independent state by forcing the Israelis off the West Bank - or the BARRACUDA will fire nukes at Cumbre Veija and create a mega-tsunami which would destroy America's east coast and parts of the European coastline as well.The President refuses to believe it, passing it off as a sick hoax. This President is more interested in the welfare state, it seems, than security of the country. Admiral Morgan fails to convince this new Administration, so when a second eruption triggered by HAMAS missiles occurs and the President still refuses to believe it is a terrorist attack, Morgan stages a coup in the White House and Paul Bedford, the more patriotic Vice President, is sworn in. Morgan then organises a mass evacuation of the East Coast.There is also a massive naval operation to locate the Barracuda(a former Soviet sub purchased by HAMAS through China) all across the Atlantic. Whilst well-detailed, there were a few errors - F15 Tomcat??!! Probably just a typo. Plus that was a hell of a fluke shot with a Harpoon, why not just let the Patriots get on with the job. And while the build-up was excellent throughout, both with the naval deployment and the evacuation of the East Coast of the USA which would make for some great panic scenes in a movie adaptation, the ending was a little weak. I suspect the author had to finish it in a hurry, though there is another instalment on the way in May called HUNTER KILLER featuring the same characters!The scientific background was well researched - Cumbre Veija is a very real threat. However there were a couple of goofs - railroads are commandeered to assist in the evacuation, firstly the Long Island Railroad would be no good to evacuate New York as its tracks are confined to Long Island, a place very much at risk from a mega tsunami. And the Southern Railroad does not have trackage rights to New York, CSX operate freight up there last time I looked. And I thought the SR was now called NORFOLK SOUTHERN?Robinson also goes a little into depth about what wine characters drink and where it came from, as usual, however I take back any criticsm about food and wine as I have done it in a book I have had published as well.But overall, an exciting read!

Could not put it down until finished."},{"Title":"Scimitar SL-2","review":"If Stephen King has in fact retired, I think I have found his worthy successor. His name is Patrick Robinson. Robinson writes military thrillers, probably more properly classified as naval thrillers. And no, these are not books that speculate as to what Britney Spears might be wearing tomorrow. We're talking naval thrillers, as in big ships that can wreak havoc and destruction from far away. Does Robinson write horror novels? No. Is he as good a writer as King? No. What Robinson does do, however, is tell a great story, and tell it well, and scare the living vinegar out of you along the way. If anything, he is scarier than King. We all know, even while reading a King novel, that serial killer clowns don't come crawling out from under bridges, that there aren't towns in Maine inhabited by vampires, or that trucks don't attack people on their own. Robinson, however, deals with real boogeymen, the guys who are out there, right now, plotting the demise of you and me, and the United States and Israel, and now even Russia. Between the nightly news and the possibilities presented in SCIMITAR S-2, Robinson's latest novel, I haven't slept in days.Before I read SCIMITAR S-2 I didn't waste more than a brain cell or two thinking about tsunamis. If someone had asked me to define \\"tsunami\\" I would have stood up straight and tall as I was taught to do at St. Agatha Grade School and said, \\"tsunami: a really big wave that only occurs in Japan but that we don't have to worry about in the United States.\\" As it turns out, I would be wrong. Robinson goes into great detail about the causation of tsunamis, and about how the fixings for one that could wipe out the entire east coast of the United States exists in the beautiful, idyllic Canary Islands. If that isn't enough to keep you awake all night, he brings a brilliant, deranged fundamentalist Islamic terrorist into the mix, a guy who has the inspired idea to set the wheels in motion to cause such an event to occur --- by shooting a nuclear missile into a volcano.Fortunately, Robinson has already created a hero to deal with the lunatic. He is United States Admiral Arnold Morgan, who is blunt, gruff, and to the point; a straight-shooter with a spine of steel tempered in the fires of war. There is only one problem: Morgan is no longer a United States Admiral. Given the boot by a new president hardly worthy of the title, Morgan has resigned himself to retirement until he receives a cryptic, taunting message from an old adversary --- the very man behind the plan to obliterate the East Coast. Knowing only that something big, dangerous and deadly is about to occur, Morgan interjects himself into the pending crisis, where he finds that his most significant adversaries are not the terrorists who plot the destruction of the nation, but the leaders who consider themselves anointed to lead the less-enlightened masses to glory while ignoring the clear signs of slaughter ahead.Morgan and his former Navy colleagues do their duty, while Robinson provides an over-the-shoulder view of how the job of intelligence monitoring, gathering and analysis gets done. Robinson occasionally gets mired in the exactitude of the weaponry hardware involved, and as a result there are points in SCIMITAR SL-2 that read more like Janes Weekly (not that there's anything wrong with that) than a novel. This dry recitation lends an authenticity to the book, which, when combined with the hard science of volcanoes and Robinson's demonstrated knowledge of the way the world works, makes for a thrilling and frightening non-stop read.SCIMITAR SL-2 may well be the most frightening book you will read all year, a novel that will bring even the most faith-challenged among us to their knees, praying that the events contained therein will never happen. If you wonder why Ed Koch feels that the issue of terrorism trumps all others, read SCIMITAR SL-2 and wonder no longer.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"Scimitar SL-2","review":"I enjoy Patrick Robinson books and was please that his eariler ediction arrived on time and in great shape. I will use this serivce again. Thanks"},{"Title":"Scimitar SL-2","review":"I've been a fan of political and military-oriented thrillers for years, and have never read such a poorly written book as this one. Mr. Robinson is totally out of his element writing on the inner workings of the US government and military. However, what he lacks in actual knowledge, he makes up for with terrible writing.The premise of this book is valid, but his execution of the story is laughable. Ironically enough, his characters laugh at almost everything, especially at the wrong time. It's as if Mr. Robinson accidentally set out to write a book for the cricket and tea crowd.It's painfully clear that he did little research to prepare for this novel. The characters are shallow, poorly constructed, or outright unbelievable. Their motivations make no sense. Oh yes, and let's not forget the nonsense \\"liberal democrats will destroy everything we know and love\\" plot line.Save your money, this book isn't worth the paper it's written on."},{"Title":"Scimitar SL-2","review":"I've read a few of Robinson's books and he seems to be taking a downhill path. This novel is mostly a political skree and his neocon far-right stance is very close to being a parody of itself.The plot of the book falls apart on at least one blindingly obivious point about half way through. For some reason both the good guys and the bad guys believe that the incredibly large terrorist blow can only happen on a single day. Why? The bad guys fail in their mission and die in the attempt, whereas if they waited a week or a month for the GPS to come back on, they would succeed gloriously. The good guys also believe that they only need to turn off the GPS for a couple of days to foil the evildoers; presumably they know how stupid the bad guys are. Again, why? This is a stunningly innane point in the plotting; it moves the book off the shelves of \\"bad fiction\\" and onto the shelves of \\"really really stupid fiction.\\"Other than all that, this book is certainly the greatest piece of literature ever conceived.MS"},{"Title":"Scimitar SL-2","review":"This was the first book by Patrick Robinson that I have read and it will be the last one. The characters in the book are completely one-dimensional and unbelievable. The author seems to be have some hang ups with authority and believes that anybody who discusses anything with anyone is weak. The book reads as though it was written by a twelve year old and I was utterly shocked by the utter immaturity of it all. I had thought he was a well known author. The technical errors are numerous. My favourite one: when the GPS is switched off, he talks about a tanker running aground in Northern Nigeria, which happens to be in the middle of the Sahara desert.I enjoy a good brainless action thriller at times, but this was in no way a good action story. The plot and ending were utterly predictable. The writing was terrible and the same points were repeated again and again, presumably because the author figured that the readers would have been too bored to pay attention the first time. A thoroughly unjoyable read."},{"Title":"Scimitar SL-2","review":"Patrick Robinson's common sense has gone to the bottom faster than the \\"towelhead\\" submarine in Scimtar SL-2. In his previous novel he developed the character of the brilliant, but evil, Hamas \\"General\\" who was a former British SAS officer gone rogue and returned to his moslem roots. In this silly book the general has gone from rogue to wooden. His antagonist the American hero, Admiral Morgan, is a nutcase who decides to take over the US government temporarily to save us from a jerk president who is too liberal to see the danger facing us. If that weren't enough Robinson has \\"Teddy\\" Kennedy, yes Teddy Kennedy, actively supporting the treason of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.This book was probably written while the author was high. Avoid it. It stinks."},{"Title":"Scimitar SL-2","review":"I really enjoy all of Robinson's books. Although he does get a bit wordy at times and seems to go off plot; the basic tenets off his stories, although incredibly UNbelievable (certainly when compared with a Clancy or even Larry Bond), are still entertaining to read. But he uses the adjective \\"great\\" way too many times --> \\"the great ship cast off into the great sea with the great man at the helm\\", its way too much.But in \\"Scimitar\\" what went really over the edge was his nonsensical descriptions of Ted Kennedy as some kind of \\"great\\" patriot who only thinks about what's good for this \\"great\\" nation. That is total bunk. Ted Kennedy has voted time after time after time to gut the military; only support its use when its for the political advantage of Democrats. Ted Kennedy is a complete disgrace, for Robinson to show him in \\"postively\\" especially in regards to national security is shameful. I'm sure they're both best buddies on Cape Cod, but this caricature is insulting to those of us who truly care about this nation's security."},{"Title":"Scimitar SL-2","review":"I'm French and enjoy reading in English, particularly when submarines are involved. I was to start off with very dissappointed, since Mr Robinson usual brings you into the depth of the oceans. However here the plot is different and after some 40 pages the end is guessable. It is then just how interesting the read is... That's where pages after pages my dissappointement came, since there was no substance and moreover some kinds of juvenile political claims that I found irritating both as a French citizen and a pro American. The author's vision on the capacities of Democrats to run the US is a case of shortsighteness and when it gets to France, it's pathetic. For the author's information Gaston is a First name that has not been used in France for over 60 years, but that is a reflection of how well the author is documented. I could develop for pages on... it is a nice demonstration of american imperialism... is the book sponsored by the Bush family ?Does anyone think that should islamic terrorists be in possession of a nuclear submarine and nuclear weapons that they would sail around the world blowing apart a few volcanoes before starting up a mega tsunami that could wipe out the East Coast of the US... I think they would go straight for the big blow.I have enjoyed Patrick Robinson's prior books but this one is not to be remembered.

If you are one to enjoy fiction based on reality without questioning factual integrity, then you'll love this book. I loved the book and listened to the audio-book as well. I rate it a 4 but give the prequel a 5 star."},{"Title":"Scimitar SL-2","review":"The vast majority of readers who pick up Patrick Robinson's latest novel will immediately know what to expect. A tightly written, well paced adventure story, that, although occasionally defying the belief of the reader, can be forgiven in return for a well crafted story. Typical readers of Mr. Robinson's books already have an interest in military hardware and tactics, but will expect to obtain new insights into some of the more obscure features of today's war machines.However these readers will be surprised by Scimitar SL-2. And not in a good way. This novel falls short of being a techno-thriller. Instead, this novel seems nothing more than a forrum for Mr. Robinson to vent his ultra-republican views. In this story all the republican characters instantly appreciate the danger their country is under, whereas any character that the author telegraphs as a liberal is ignorant, obtuse, and stagnant. The author leaves no grey areas in his characterisations. He claims that all republicans are patriots, and liberals seem bent on self-destruction.Now I know what some people will be thinking: \\"Uh-oh, here's another weakling liberal who doesn't acknowledge the danger that the US is constantly under and just doesn't understand that the only way to ensure safety is through force, with the miltary being the ultimate force\\". I will refute this. As a New Zealand citizen I claim that I am politically agnostic when it comes to affairs of the US. Indeed, I'll admit that I even had to look up the terms 'republican' and 'liberal' to understand what the author was taking exception to. However Mr. Robinson managed to offend me with his one-dimensional colourisation of the world.But the overt, closed-minded politics are not the only failings of this book. As entertainment this book fails. The book (re)introduces a set of unlikable characters - none of which progress through any form of arc. Oddly enough, the central Arnold Morgan character seems to be the alter ego that Mr. Robinson wishes he could be. Maybe he is the Superman for the over 50s. There is a lack of ambiguity throughout the story: Whenever one opponent attempts a strategy the opposing side quickly speculates that this is the one and only course they can take, which is simply not true (this speculation often appears on the very next page). The pacing, while starting off well, quickly degenerates to dwell on the inconsequential. Ironically, the climax of the book is anti-climactic. The third act occupies only the last five pages of the 374 page book. (I can only theorise that the toner in Mr. Robinson's printer was running out.) The dialog and prose never engage the reader in this section. And worst of all, this is the only military conflict in the book.There have been other posts on this site about the technical inaccuracies in Scimitar SL-2. But as a fan of techno-thrillers I feel cheated by these. To give potential readers an indication of the types of inaccuracies they will find I will give a few here. If you do not take exception to these then you may find this book more rewarding than I did:(Beware that there are potential spoilers in here:)A submarine rounds Cape Horn from the Pacific to the Atlantic following course 270.A missile is shot down with an ASROC missile.A torpedo is dropped from a helicopter and immediately explodes agains the hull of an enemy.Three frigates detect a submarine (using radar) but the submarine does not detect the radar sweeps or the cavatating frigates on sonar.A character is a former US Army Master Chief.Over all I found this book not only a waste of time, but aggravating and occasionally offensive - I can only assume that the blatant racism of the \\"heros\\" is shared by Robinson. Also his lack of respect for democracy baffles me. I would not recommend this book unless you are an avid Robinson fan (and share his political views).\\"I don't know, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe its a terrible tragedy\\" - Tyler Durden"},{"Title":"Scimitar SL-2","review":"I picked this book up in a used bookstore for a buck in hardcover, still a waste of money.

I read this while lounging on a beach in Oregon, almost caused a tsunami, I think. Previous reviewers have detailed many of the technical faults, so I won't go into them again. Other reviewers have mentioned the two-dimensional characters; one-dimensional is more like it. On a note not mentioned by other reviewers, the author in his Acknowledgements at the end of the book, wrote that he had the assistance of several former Special Ops soldiers and eminent scientists, all of whom he declined to identify.

Compared with his previous work, the plot is unoriginal, thin, and the characters boring, and hardly developed at all. In fact, his imagination was so strained that has re-visited topics raised in earlier works. If you want a really good read, pick Nimitz Class or Kilo Class. The rest are rubbish."},{"Title":"Scimitar SL-2","review":"I have read all of Mr. Robinson's novels so far. About two back, the details such as naval ratings, types of aircraft, etc., began to be completely erroneus. While he has some interesting plots and characters, the devil is in the detail. In Scimitar SL-2, Robinson hits new lows! A character is a former US Army Master Chief? Which US Army is this? Chief Warrant maybe, but Master Chief? Not unless USN or USCG. Chief Master Sargeant in the air force but not the Army. Same goes for another character who is a USN Ensign junior grade. Yeah right. Or a Bell AH1Z Super Cobra with a crew of 3 and room for a passenger! How about an F-15 Tomcat, or a Secretary of State for Defense?? While these are small details, they are things I know about. It makes the things I don't know much about suspect, such as his research on nuclear weaponry and volcanoes, etc. Maybe he is starting to use ghostwriters, like some of the other authors of this genre. Too many mistakes in his research or lack of it."},{"Title":"Scimitar SL-2","review":"I would give this zero stars if possible.Others have commented on the political viewpoint, so I'll leave that part alone, except to comment that anybody who blames a lack of 9/11 vigilance on the Democrats clearly isn't paying attention.The plot is very random.We have a sub commander who deliberately takes his sub between the aleutians and the coast of Alaska when just to get to the Columbia river.We have a terrorist who conducts a sneak attack on Mt. St. Helens, not killing many people and not creating any terror because it's not a publicized attack.We have an absolutely ridiculous scene where the mastermind terrorist gives out important mission details to a random person at the airport, purportedly because the mastermind is very tired, despite the fact that he's been on a submarine with nothing to do for at least the last two weeks.And finally, we have a plot that is thwarted because the attack can only take place at a specific place and time.Technical issues are rampant. The North Korean weapons plant is totally unknown to outsiders, despite the fact that it would have taken years of heavy construction to create and tremendous logistical support to keep going. Reactor containment vessels are made of lead, a very good guard against radiation but a pretty useless metal from a strength standpoint. Nuclear weapons look like MIRV reentry vehicles (very technically advanced designs) even if they are destined to be in cruise missiles.

Way too much emphasis on describing the characters, their idiosyncrasies, moods, and what they're frickin eating. I want action. If I want to read about food I'd buy a cook book. Change brands of that Scotch Whiskey, Patrick, and go back to your old one and write like you once did, with conviction. Hopefully I'll see it in Hunter Killer."},{"Title":"Scimitar SL-2","review":"I have to say that the storyline kept me reading, but the technical errors were very distracting.Set in 2009, Radical Islamists buy a nuclear sub, complete with missles and atomic warheads, with the intent to bring the United States to its knees. The mechanism? A massive tsunami generated by a missle-activated volcano eruption. The actor? An arabic former British SAS officer re-converting to an Islamic extremist.The newly-elected U. S. president adds to the risk through his hard-headed adherence to his party's dogmatic theory that the U.S. is to blame for all of the problems of the mid-east.Admiral Arnold Morgan, recently fired by the new president's secretary, cannot simply walk away. He must deal with the president and his minions, find the sub and stop the largest disaster the U.S. has ever contemplated.It's an interesting story, and the use of volcanos as weapons is clearly explained. The effect of an east-coast Tsunami is outlined in frightening detail.However, every time I got involved in the story line, some silly error popped up. Clancy virtually always got the details right. Robinson often misses by an obvious mile.F-15 Tomcat? The F-15 is the Air Force's Eagle. The Tomcat is an F-14. Even allowing for a typo, it has been known for years that the Navy was phasing out the Tomcats for the F/A-18 Super Hornet. They would have been gone well before the 2009 setting of this novel. Captains commanding FFGs (Guided Missle Frigates)? SENIOR Captains? Not in the U.S. Navy. FFGs are captained by Commanders. That's only a short selection.Maybe I'm being too picky, and maybe I know too much about the Navy. But, readers of techno-thrillers tend to be knowledgeable and observant. We don't need unnecessary distraction.A decent no-brain read, but not a great book."},{"Title":"Scimitar SL-2","review":"The real question you have to ask about this book is, \\"Would the explosion of a nuke really cause a volcano eruption that would in turn cause the most destructive mega-tsunami in history.\\" I don't know. Mount St. Helens blew with a force estimated at 24 megatons. That's about 2,000 times the Hiroshima blast. \\"Mike\\" the first US H-bomb was 15 megatons.Mount St. Helens was triggered by an earthquake that caused a landslide that effectively removed the cap off of a high pressure chamber under the middle of the mountain. So yes, a fairly small nuke might releive the pressure on a volcano that is getting ready to blow anyway. Cause a tsunami, I think the volcano needs to be under water. Most destructive, if it hit New York, yup.With that as a start, then this book begins to make sense. After this you start to get into other questions like how to deliver the weapon, where to place it, and so on. If you're a navy fiction writer, then you've got to use a boat to deliver the device, and simply putting it into a cargo container wouldn't be very cool. And of course your adversary has to be another navy man.OK, now I've told you the story. Is it a good story? I liked it. To be sure there are some technical mistakes like a missile going near the speed of light - well the author meant sound. That's no worse than so many mysteries where revolvers have safeties and never, never fail to go off when they are dropped on the ground. The characters are supermen. They're kind of like people you wish could go solve problems rather than the politicians that we get into office.This book is an easy, fast read, not bad for a cold winter weekend."},{"Title":"Scimitar SL-2","review":"Mr. Robinson does an outstanding job researching and building characters and plots. He researched this story well, drawing on the potential threat of the mega-tsunami from the Cumbre Vieja volcano. The story is backed by scientific publications and is a very good story. However it is sprinkled with polemics. On page 12 he refers to the new Democratic administration in terms reflecting his personal political sentiments.On page 182 Robinson refers to \\"...dovish Secretary of State for Defense, Milt Schlemmer,...\\". Mr. Robinson, there is no \\"Secretary of State for Defense.\\" The story is centered on an ultimatum made by terrorists to an unconcerned President (who recently won the election by a narrow margin). The military had a serious concern about the ultimatum. In plotting the coup, the military shows their contempt for Congress when General Scannell on page 247 states, \\"...there is no provision for Martial Law being declared without the whole rigmarole going though Congress. And we don't have time for that.\\" Then Morgan chimes in on page 248, \\"...we don't have time to sit and wait while those damned Congressmen twitter around like a bunch of schoolgirls.\\" Then retired Admiral Morgan holds a coup-d'etat by placing Marine guards in the White House to cut off phone lines and intimidates the President to resign. There is no sign of the Secret Service that protects the President. The absurdity continues on pages 267-268, \\"The High Command of the United States Armed Forces was trusted implicitly to tell the truth and to operate objectively, free from political or civilian agendas. The members of the Supreme Court understood that perfectly [the coup].\\" The next paragraph he mentions Morgan informing Senator Edward Kennedy of the \\"palace coup.\\" Then Senator Kennedy is portrayed as some how convincing the other [ninety nine] senators that the coup d'etat is in the best interest of the country and their agreeing is sheer nonsense. There are no members in the House of Representatives involved in this process, namely the Speaker of the House, just the Senate. Then retired Admiral Morgan interprets the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution for the Congress and U.S. Supreme Court on page 268. There are other absurd scenarios, like where the de facto dictator of the United States, retired Admiral Morgan, tells the President of France where he can go.On page 376 Mr. Robinson writes, \\"...since the Patriot was traveling as close to the speed of light as possible.\\" That would be a very fast missile indeed if it approached the speed of light!This would have been an excellent work if Robinson had left out the discussing the U.S. government and his politics. The whole ridiculous scenario of the coup and discussing opinions on political and social issues detracts from a techno-thriller and ruined a good story."},{"Title":"Scimitar SL-2","review":"If this were merely a bad book(which it is)a review would be easy to write. However, the author seems to be pushing a dangerous agenda. He is also out of touch with the reality of the US military. In fact, I wonder how much he really knows about our constitution. And, in an irony of sorts, he acknowledges the help of a British naval expert in writing this book, while totally discounting the UK and its ability to help America in this outlandish scenario.But first, the agenda...several quotes from the book are in order:\\"We[the military]are the permanent guardians of this nation. And I think you'll find that the people of the United States trust us more than a politician.\\"\\"The High Command of the United States Armed Forces was trusted implicitly to tell the truth and to operate objectively,free from political or civilian agendas.\\"\\"It had been a military coup...\\"Furthermore Robinson seems to be caught in some sort of ethnic fantasyland with the key \\"good guys.\\" Oh, and I do mean guys, since women play no role on the US side, except for the trophy wife of Admiral Morgan. I have read lots of military/political fiction, and this aforementioned stuff is the worst I've ever encountered.His treatment of the French response(while not even mentioning the rest of Europe, including the UK)was tired, cliched and silly. And his treatment of the Israeli response is downright preposterous!The editing is poor. The scenario is ridiculous, and for someone to claim he did research, it shows a lack of understanding for the capabilities of the NSA, Cheyenne Mountain et al.lastly, the dialogue is right out of a bad tv movie, and I must say, the Morgan character has beome very unlikable, to say the least!His treatment of a duly elected President is ridiculous, and his characterizations of the obviously Democrat White House staff are lame and insulting.And his inclusion and characterization of a famous and powerful senator would probably drive that famed legislator to drink...Everything about this book is bad...and troubling!"},{"Title":"Scimitar SL-2","review":"Robinson's techno-thrillers have a certain two-dimensionality that Tom Clancy's don't. Clancy's are longer, better researched and more realistic in reflecting a large and complex world. Robinson's are shallower, written more like conventional popular paperbacks. They make it a little harder to suspend one's disbelief.I share reviewer Gaines' criticism of Robinson's conflicting and confusing tsunami details. It's never made clear to me how a tidal wave can go as far inland, maintain height and speed over thousands of miles, and pose as much of a threat to the entire Eastern seacoast, as Robinson suggests one might.Robinson's writing has always been clunky. He doesn't write Americans very well, constantly allowing Britishisms to slip into their speech. (Although the Australian-reared intelligence analyst Jimmy Ramshawe's colloquialisms are amusing.) His American characters tend to have British level fixations upon roast beef (Morgan's invariable lunch sandwich filling). He uses entirely too many acronyms and too much technical jargon, making long lists of weapons of which no further description is made. Nothing is added to the book and the jargon slows it down. Arnold Morgan is an amusing curmudgeon but a better writer would do more with his being Texan. A native of such a colorful state is capable of doing far more than just shouting and swearing a lot.Robinson's formula is simpler than Clancy's. The world is always being saved by the same few people, primarily Morgan, Ramshawe and NSA head George Morris.(Do they ever feel overworked?)All these misgivings aside, Scimitar SL2 is a good, although not exceptional, read. Robinson takes his time slowly bringing the terrorist submarine \\"Barracuda\\" silently around the world. He has a certain appreciation for the human qualities of his main terrorist, Ravi Rashood, and his supporting characters; they don't make your skin crawl and you occasionally like them - when you're not reflecting, say, upon their cold-blooded killing of a volcano expert early in the book. I wondered how Robinson would do the showdown; I found the ending convincing enough.Robinson plays the Republican-good-guys, Democratic-bad-guys card with a heavier hand than I remember from earlier books, perhaps too much. His clueless liberal president is an unlikely election winner, albeit essential to the plot in dismissing and ignoring the terrorist threat long enough to allow the dramatic crisis to develop.And the single exception to the Democrats-are-dangerous-morons rule, Sen. Teddy Kennedy, is drawn in such glowing terms one guesses the Irish-resident Robinson is either sentimentally drawn to the Kennedys, a personal friend, or both.The book's flaws notwithstanding, last winter's tragedy makes the tsunami device quite timely. Robinson wrote this book before the real threat posed by an unstable Canary Islands volcano became widely reported upon. Great anticipation on his part. I keep reading his submarine thrillers; I'd like them better if they were a little better edited."},{"Title":"Scimitar SL-2","review":"The story may be a little wild but the future is open game. I really think the political part if the story is extremely shallow and shows a complete lack of understanding of the US constitution and how our system works. But anything that pokes fun at the libs is fine by me. Last I knew it, Ted Kennedy has pretty much voted for EVERY single military budget reduction and and pretty much completely lacks giving support for the military.The technical glitches are the most annoying, since any even half-competent editor with even a clue about the modern military would spot these just like me. US Naval ships use the Standard SM-1 or SM-2 missile for anti-air engagement and they have for over 40 years. Harpoons are relatively slow sea-skimming ship killers and ASROCs fire a rocket assisted torpedo. (In the 50s and 60s these were firing nuclear depth charges). Soviet missiles of the aledged caliber of this one ALWAYS use inertial navigation or terrain mapping as a secondary system and do not need GPS. In fact, the whole concept of a foreign military using GPS is funny, since the US does not need to turn it OFF, they just need to change the crypto keys to enable only the most rough calcuation of position. In Gulf War 1, they put an error in the position repeaters of about 300 meters which could only be correctly resolved by changing the crypto key (which all the military units did do).The most irritating error is one made in the last two books. He talks about a Super Cobra helicopter which has a crew of three and can carry passengers. The Cobra is a two seat attack helicopter which has looked the same since the late sixties. The US Marines are the only outfit to still fly it and if one even bothers to browse for a picture of it will clearly see it only carries two people. If this had said Super Huey I might even buy it, but again the technical details in a book like this make it or break it. The whole story becomes ungainly if you cannot get the hardware right. There is even mention somewhere of a US helicopter mounting three 12.7mm machine guns. As far as I ever knew the US used .50 cal Browning M2 machine guns and the USSR and Eastern Bloc used the 12.7mm. The English/Metric conversion of calibers does NOT work both ways, these are different weapons. I just wish that the technical editing were up to the same par as the imagination and storyline of the writer. These books seem like they are banged out at a weekend beer party rather than researched even a little bit. If I were going to write a book about Ireland, I would at least attempt to become familiar with it...."},{"Title":"Scimitar SL-2","review":"I loved Robinson's first 2 or 3 books.

I'm not done with it yet, I'll certainly finish it, but I doubt I'll go looking for more books by Robinson unless I find them as bargain close-out books, as I did this one. It's so full of stereotypes that sometimes I wonder if this was done intentionally as a joke - somebody let me know if I missed something. One in particular that really gets me is how often one of the main characters, former National Security Advisor Arnold Morgan, uses the word \\"towelhead\\" to describe the Middle Eastern antagonists in the story. He flings the word around like it's totally acceptable - is he some Aryan Master Race Skinhead White Power KKK member or something? Yeah, the world today has a lot of problems and at the root of many of them are extremists from that part of the world, but to fling a word around like that reeks of racism, pure and simple, and to be honest, I can't recall reading any other techno-thriller that has ever stooped to such a low level. If this is suppose to insinuate that it's a perfectly acceptable word to use, then I really do wonder about the author. Nothing like a good book to promote intolerance in this day and age.

HMS Unseen, USS Seawolf and The Shark Mutiny were all strong and entertaining books.But his Barracuda series (Barracuda 945 and Scimitar SL-2) are surprisingly poorly done.First the implausible. Robinson wants us to believe the US would have elected an ultra-liberal, anti-military President after all that America went through in Barracuda. The American people knew its west coast got attacked by an enemy. There's just no way an anti-military President would have been elected so soon after those attacks. He makes this President way more incompetent than is plausible. It's funny how many times this book seems to totally ignore the events from Barracuda (Scimiatar is an immediate sequel).Robinson seems to be struggling with adding length to this novel. He keeps repeating stuff. Several times he reminds the reader of the devestation a tsunami would cause to America's East coast. We got it after the first time. He re-explains it at least 5 times in this novel. Then there's the incredible boring details of how the east coast is evacuating. And the implausible detail that Adm. Morgan would actually spend time on overseeing artwork and statues being moved.When we finally get to the final showdown it's so brief that it makes me glad I skimmed major sections of this book.If you're a Patrick Robinson fan I guess you have to read this one but don't be expecting much."},{"Title":"Scimitar SL-2","review":"I first heard the book abridged on audio CD.

He is opposed my many, learned man and layman alike, who claim that such attempt is a folly that will only end in disaster. Jocelyn's will remains unshaken however, for he firmly believes that he is doing God's work, resorting to coercion and manipulation to force the unwilling collaboration of others in order to fulfil his vision. As the spire rises, tensions do so as well to a boiling point.This is a very demanding novel due to its narration style (it is written in the style of stream of conscience, but solely from Jocelyn's perspective) as well as its heavy symbolism and imagery. However, it is immensely rewarding due to the immersive prose. The apocalyptic, maddening and at times horrific imagery is conveyed perfectly through Golding's excellent narration skills, the dialogue between Jocelyn and his contenders riveting and the symbolism comes across crystal clear.So, even if the narration is somewhat difficult at times, ultimately it is a very addictive and immersive read.I had only read his most famed novel \\"Lord of the Flies\\" (which I adored) and since him his primarily known for that work, I feared his other novels might not be as engaging. However, after reading \\"The Spire\\" there is hardly a doubt in my mind that his other works are worth seeking out."},{"Title":"The Spire","review":"I was very disappointed by William Golding's novel The Spire. Golding, whose most famous book is Lord of the Flies, tells in The Spire the story of an Dean Jocelin's obsession to add a 400-foot tall spire to his English Cathedral. All, including the builder, tell Jocelin that this is impossible, as the building lacks adequate foundation. Nonetheless, Jocelin persists, going mad in the process. While much of the writing and language of this book is first-rate, I found it difficult to either pay attention or follow the plot. I found myself rereading many parts of the book with no greater comprehension than the first time through. For me, this was one of those books which I was thankful was short."},{"Title":"The Spire","review":"\\"The Spire\\" manages to brush up against the successful elements of Golding's best work. Although it never reaches the heights of the brilliant \\"The Lord of the Flies,\\" it does paint vivid and fragmented pictures of man come undone.William Golding, after seeing the horrors of war firsthand, rejected the foundational thought of humanism that \\"man is basically good.\\" In \\"The Lord of the Flies,\\" he used concise language and haunting symbolism to validate his thoughts. And, by creating sympathetic characters, he drew us into his viewpoint. Few of his other novels create such sympathy. It is as though he bought into his own philosophy so deeply that he no longer found value in his fellow man. \\"Pincher Martin\\" and \\"Free Fall\\" left me impressed with his skills, but intellectually unmoved.In \\"The Spire,\\" he moves me again. At first, his protagonist--an anti-hero in every sense--is hard to sympathize with in any fashion. The man, Dean Jocelin, is driven to the point of obsession and insanity by his need to serve God, or, ultimately his need to feel worthy in God's sight. He demands obedience and servitude from those around him, driving them to complete his vision of a 400 ft spire above his cathedral. In the process, some will die, others will lose faith, hope, and love. Only as Jocelin comes to terms with his fallibility do we begin to care about the doomed outcome of his dream. Only as he admits his own pride and stubborness do we hope for his absolution, deserved or not.This book is an ode to all those who become obsessed by religion and love, who strive for something to the point of sacrificing everything of true value along the way. Here, finally, Golding once again finds a way to show the madness of humanity while still proferring a glimmer of hope."},{"Title":"The Spire","review":"Golding constructs a fictional account around a real occurrence, the building of a tall spire at Salisbury Cathedral, near where Golding lived.It is Golding's \\"Macbeth\\", whereas \\"Flies\\" may be seen as \\"Hamlet\\". Short, impressionistic, unrelenting, \\"The Spire\\" is writing at its best. There is a lack of physical description, leaving that to the reader's imagination, but much fine dialogue. This is why I have always thought it would make a sensational film (I have always seen Alec Guiness in the role of Jocelyn).Characters are well drawn, there are inter and intra personal conflicts between Roger, the Master Builder, and Jocelyn, who thinks he is doing God's work and that Roger's skills are his instrument.Jocelyn, who rose rapidly to become Dean of the Church, is resented by others who had been there longer. At the end, Roger is a drunken wreck, and Jocelyn finds out the truth about his appointment as Dean. It is a crushing revelation, which finally kills him. On his deathbed, he asks to be helped up so that he can see the Spire, which has finally been completed. It took a terrible toll in human life, but this tribute to God is still standing today and can be seen for miles on the flat Salisbury Plain.This is a much less symbolic story than \\"Flies\\", and a lot less heavy handed, and that is why I feel it is much superior. It is a very human story of hubris, obsession, false hope, and ultimate ruination, and Golding accomplishes all this in a very short book. It is like a long epic poem, and while its writing style may take a little getting used to, it is well worth the effort.To me, this book is a bona fide classic. Do yourself a favor and read it. You will never forget it."},{"Title":"The Spire","review":"William Golding's reach in this novel is prodigious. Not only does he demonstrate that the one historical constant is human nature, he also manages to flesh out the scope of behaviour admitted in one particlar human being. The novel takes the reader back in time and to an historically, as well as geographically, foreign place. It deals with how human beings cope with pain, loss, ambition, vision and the tenderest of feelings. The novel is a tour de force."},{"Title":"The Spire","review":"I stumbled upon this book by accident, and decided to read it due to Golding's reputation as author of the wonderful, \\"Lord of the Flies\\". \\"The Spire\\" is likewise a fairly quick read, and every bit as engaging. Even arguably superior.Briefly, it is the story of a cleric, Dean Jocelin, who embarks on an over-ambitious building project at the cathedral he oversees. The time and the place is not important, and indeed could be 21st century America (the book seems to be set in 19th century England). The project is the addition of a 400 foot spire. Jocelin is single-minded regarding the project, as he decorously steamrolls the project along under color of devotion to God. The result is disastrous.I respectfully differ with the several other reviewers that see the spire project as misdirected devotion to glorifying God. There is much evidence in the story that Jocelin is a megalomaniac. The structure is to be self-glorifying. To boot, he is also apparently a closet lecher. He prays, and seems to rationalize the project as an act of devotion - but I think he is really all about self-promotion.Always woven into the storytelling is the church building itself. Golding paints a vivid picture of the old stone pillars audibly protesting under the ever increasing weight of the spire that slowly grows above them, the construction of the spire, the majesty but the tension, and the feeling of looming catastrophe. Wonderful writing.This is a great piece of work. It is well worth the quick read and it will stay with you. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Spire","review":"Reverend Jocelin, Dean of the Cathedral of the Virgin Mary, becomes obsessed with building a 400-foot spire atop the church; the builders warn him that the church's foundation is not strong enough to support the weight of such a spire, but Jocelin insists it be built because of \\"a vision\\" he has had. Jocelin loses interest in everything not connected with the spire and truly becomes a man possessed; even religious services are suspended in order for the construction to take place, and people die as it is being built. (The power of this obsession is reminiscent of Captain Ahab and his obsession with Moby Dick.) What might have been a religious inspiration for the churchgoers becomes a personal mania for Jocelin. Sure enough after the spire is completed the building collapses and Jocelin is killed, but amazingly the spire remains upright. Golding captures perfectly the madness in Jocelin's \\"vision,\\" and it's my favorite of his books - and the one most accessible."},{"Title":"The Spire","review":"This book is a masterpiece , Golding really has the Knack of personifying his characters and Ideas in a way that the reader can relate to.

Inspiring..."},{"Title":"The Spire","review":"This is written in a \\"stream of consciousness\\" style which makes is somewhat inaccessible and difficult to follow. The book is written as the thoughts of the insane bishop building the spire.What interested me in the book is actually visiting Salisbury cathedral in England and seeing the impossible spire myself. Golding taught at the school attached to Salisbury cathedral and this inspired his story. The hubris of building the tallest tower and stone spire in England on top of thin pillars never meant to hold the weight, themselves built on 4' deep foundations set on wet gravel is amazing. The fact this this was done in the thirteen hundreds is amazing and might inspire one to faith.Read this classic and then go to see that cathedral that has been continually about to fall since the middle ages."},{"Title":"The Spire","review":"\\"The Spire,\\" is quite a different novel from Golding's more famous debut novel \\"Lord of the Flies,\\" except that it, too, demonstrates something about the capacity of individuals to drag others along as they respond to their baser motivations (power, vanity--the list could go on). It concerns a priest named Jocelin, dean of a cathedral somewhere in England, who has a vision that convinces him he must add to the building a soaring spire. This, he says, is to glorify God and the cathedral, but there is a large measure of personal vanity at work as well, since Dean Jocelin is convinced that he is the man who must do it, that this is his particular vocation. If the master builder, Roger Mason, tells him that the building has no foundation and therefore cannot support such a structure, technical details and the experience of builders must move aside for the realization of Jocelin's vision. Jocelin feels at times inspired (by God), at times bewitched (by a woman), at times opposed (by Roger Mason), at times belittled (by everyone). He never doubts his vision, even when it threatens to destroy the cathedral and some of the lives that pass through it--even when it becomes widely derided as Jocelin's Folly. Whether or not the spire will remain standing, Jocelin himself is brought low by the madness of his faith. But this may be seen as a cautionary tale in more than one way: all vanity is blind, but is not all faith also to a certain degree madness? Golding's psychologically-complex tale is both moving and sobering."},{"Title":"The Spire","review":"With this powerhouse metaphor,Golding has given us a chilling tale of a man and a monumental building project. It takes us into the mind of obsession and drives deep into the foundational relationship between beauty and depravity. Evil may be concealed with elaborate artifice, but it will out - from the soul of a man or the soul of a building. This is a memorably dark exploration of the schitzophrenic condition,the coercion of the good as a means to an end and the ultimate tragedy of power abused. Not a lovely story, but truly well crafted. I was happy to finish reading it, but I can't stop thinking about it. It's scenes replay in my mind unveiling deeper truths. Find it...read it."},{"Title":"The Spire","review":"William Golding, British Nobel Prize winner, is of course best known for \\"The Lord of the Flies\\", but he was primarily a historical novelist, his works ranging from \\"The Inheritors\\", which is set far back in the mists of prehistory (and is in my opinion one of the greatest novels ever written), through \\"The Scorpion God\\", set in ancient Egypt, \\"The Double Tongue\\", his last novel, set in classical Greece, to the wonderful \\"Rites of Passage\\" trilogy, set in the 18th century. His one novel set in medieval times is \\"The Spire\\".Jocelin, Lord Dean of the (unnamed) cathedral, has a dream, a dream based on a vision, for he is above all else a mystic, a dream of adding a soaring spire to the great cathedral.The dream becomes an obsession: he will not listen to words of warning and advice from such as the sacrist, Father Anselm, who voted against it in Chapter and was overruled (and now refers to it as Jocelin's Folly), and Roger Mason, the master-builder, who tells the Dean there are no proper foundations and is told in return to have faith and believe in miracles.At first, he knows that he must not focus on the spire to the exclusion of all else. \\"And I must remember that the spire isn't everything! I must do, as far as possible, exactly what I have always done.\\" But this becomes impossible as the drama builds up.There is human drama, too, a personal drama also approaching a terrible climax. This revolves around Goody Pagnall, an orphan and ward of the cathedral chapter, Jocelin's \\"daughter in God\\" (as he puts it), now a red-haired beauty who has become \\"entirely a woman\\". There is a small affair, a small tragedy; and yet in a sense it is the greater tragedy, for can there be one greater than love, and the death of the beloved, of beauty?Golding poses the question, should a God-obsessed mystic be entrusted with temporal authority, be thrust into a situation where people depend on the decisions he will make - and suddenly tells us how Jocelin really came to be appointed Lord Dean in the first place.Beautifully written, of course, a wonderful novel, a classic, Golding at his best, and to be read by everyone interested in the Age of Belief, when the great cathedrals which still have us craning our necks backwards in awed disbelief, were built by hand and on faith.Thirteen-Card Spread (The Marian MacElpin Esoteric Medieval Mysteries)"},{"Title":"Trouble with Girls","review":"Trouble With Girls is a super collection of stories that flow together to form what reads like a novel. The stories tell (the majority of) the life of Parker Hayes, starting at age thirteen at a little league baseball game through to his mid-thirties, all the while telling of his (lack of) readiness to handle the tasks of life, and more specifically, the task of landing the perfect woman.Set in the 1970's and 1980's we see Parker grow from a child to a man, stumbling from one learning lesson to another (all in a hilarious manner), with each story thrown against the backdrop of the rock music of the days (msuic being his escape, we get a good dose of that backdrop).The stories are written in a such a way that you will recall your own fumblings of youth and find yourself laughing with him along the way. The female characters here (and there are many) tend be a tad stereotypical (and a tad repetitive) but the reader will quickly see Parker is drawn to the same types, doomed to repeat his mistakes.

By poignantly revealing the ennervated soul of the post-modern American male, he creates a protagonist that we want to grab by the collar and shake (&quot;You're blowing it!) and yet sympathetically cheer on to find fulfillment. Propelled by prose both Proustian in its circumlocuitous convolutions and yet obviously contemporary in diction and manner, these stories unfold in sequences reminescent of the slo-mo scenes of your favorite relationship car crash. Boswell knows his material--boys and girls, the seventies, eighties, and nineties as the threshing floor of American malehood, dating, grad school, &quot;the real world&quot;--and in these ten pieces, he uses that knowledge to engage the reader fully in the plight of his narrator's movement from naivety to experienced naivety. A great book."},{"Title":"Trouble with Girls","review":"a delightful,insightful, entertaining coming of age story that will resurrect a ton of memories from your adolescence to young adulthood.You should read/watch this rising young fiction star -- he will eventually fill a whole shelf on your bookcase."},{"Title":"Trouble with Girls","review":"The ten stories in Boswell's debut book of fiction had me howling with laughter and sympathy from the first page. Uncannily, through ten interrelated stories, Boswell manages to capture the feel - exactly - of growing up in a certain time period, in a certain part of the country (not too close to the action, not too far), while listening to certain forms of pop music.And the music is important, forming as it does a motif that appears in practically every story, charting not only the central character's taste but also establishing what is \\"in\\" as the years click by - a cultural gauge made all the more heart-wrenching by Parker's repeated failure to connect to that volatile \\"coolness.\\"Novelistic in its scope, the underlying theme of the story collection seems to be nothing less than the sexual initiation and maturity of the hero. The first story, \\"Ready Position,\\" begins with puberty (and brings to mind David Foster Wallace's \\"Forever Overhead\\"), and the last story, \\"Spanish Omens,\\" ends with marriage. Along the way, our hero is launched from the comfortable but unsatisfying nest of his childhood home into the world of sexual warfare, the hero always \\"in between\\" the latest romantic disaster and the next still-idealistic, hopefully tranquil union. An impressive read.Brings to mind Nick Hornby's High Fidelity and also early Updike, specifically Pigeon Feathers. Also plays on some of the themes in Philip Roth's My Life as a Man."},{"Title":"Trouble with Girls","review":"This is a well-written but inconsistent collection of short stories, intended to be read in order and therefore attempting a form somewhere in between an anthology and a novel. But I think other books that have used this form or something like it have executed the concept more successfully, in particular Charles Baxter's The Feast of Love and David Schickler's Kissing in Manhattan. Some of the stories here work quite well by themselves, but the device of connecting them to a book-length narrative adds nothing. Besides featuring the same protagonist, an introspective but unremarkable dud of an everyman named Parker Hayes whose life the book tracks in chronological order, there is no continuity. Parker is given such meager characterization and his adventures synthesize so poorly that each story may as well have given him a different name and been presented independently. Other than Parker, only one character appears in more than one story (and she in only two), and no other common threads link the stories together. Sometimes this just seems careless. In one story, Parker has a pet cat, which subsequently disappears altogether, leaving readers silently to question every so often, \\"Whatever happened to the cat?\\" (Maybe this cat is Schroedinger's Cat, dramatically sealed in a box disclosing no certain facts about its fate.)Fortunately, readers who resolve to approach each story as its own individual work will be rewarded by several clever and perceptive pieces. \\"New Wave\\" was clearly written by someone who has forgotten none of the salient sociological facts of high-school life. The story is a funny and touching account of the teenage tendency to assert one's individuality by thoughtlessly gravitating towards one or another cliquish movement (often based on musical taste) and the existential angst suffered when these affectations challenge one's authentic personality. (I would be remiss not to note a passage running from page 81-82 that hilariously captures the arbitrary allegiances of rock-and-roll fandom. Read the whole story for this bit, if for nothing else.) The other two highlights in this collection for me were \\"Grub Worm\\" and \\"Between Things.\\" The former is a story of modern heartbreak with the usual accompanying self-pity, but Parker picks up almost enough self-knowledge to soften the blues. \\"Between Things\\" chronicles another staple of contemporary romance, the post-relationship relationship with the same person with whom one has ostensibly broken up. Which stories resonate best with any given reader will depend on the nature of his own troubles with girls. Female readers may be irritated by the one-dimensional characterizations of the women in Parker's life, some of whom appear to have been written according to Jack Nicholson's advice from As Good As It Gets: \\"I think of a man, and I take away reason and accountability.\\" But Boswell doesn't breathe much life into characters of either gender, and the one-dimensional supporting women prove far more captivating than the zero-dimensional Parker Hayes. Boswell's insights into human relationships would have succeeded more vividly had he developed a persona to which readers could actually relate."},{"Title":"Trouble with Girls","review":"Marshall Boswell's collection of stories is simply wonderful, but they are wonderful in a painfully poignant sort of way. They focus on the life of a likeable young man alternately struggling and delighting in the quakes and throes of youth in Memphis, Tennessee during the eighties. These stories give the reader a jolt of pleasure and recognition--they take you back to those days, whether you were a parent, a child or an ageless hanger-on. There is not a whiff of false nostalgia here, either. Boswell is such a careful observer that one is translated back in almost Proustian fashion--swiftly, indelibly, body and soul. The tone, true to the collection's protagonist, is unassuming, cautious and at the same time full-blooded. But brooding over the work is Boswell himself, who knows very well--as his protagonist does not yet--that those aches and terrors of teenhood are worth the price that must be paid. The story \\"Born Again\\" is a masterpiece. To read it is to yearn mightily to return to one's youth, eyes and heart wide-open.

Ross Haney, our protagonist, isn't that interesting, another one of L'Amour's typical cookie-cutter heroes, cartoonishly hyper-masculine to the point of self-parody at times. The story's value is in its descriptions of the Old Southwest and its atmosphere. Descriptions of stunning landscapes, beautiful horses, saloons, the grizzled old barkeep that doesn't want shotgun shells wrecking his place, that's what keeps you interested. And Sherry Vernon, the strongest female lead I've seen so far in L'Amour's stories. She shines, a bold, humorous, and athletic horsewoman. Ross Haney is much more interesting when he has to deal with her wit and comebacks. There are some annoying moments of Sherry yielding to the villain's nefarious plot, but she's never forced exactly into the unbearable \\"damsel in distress\\" role.

The numerous articles included in this volume represent some of the leading scholarship on gender in society, and introduces readers to the theoretical and methodological works of numerous researchers.This anthology is important and essential to scholars, feminists, and teachers. This is an excellent book for graduate student and undergraduate students alike."},{"Title":"Gender Through The Prism Of Difference","review":"Overall I have enjoyed reading this book, much more so than the other assigned text for my Sociology of Gender class. However, as a student with a background in editing, I've often been jolted out of concentration by the numerous typos and spelling errors in this text. When reading academically, my goal is to read as quickly as possible while still processing the information. I've had to stop and reread multiple sentences in this book, such as this example on pg. 420: \\"...although she acknowledges that the feet that she was known to be a graduate student...\\" What, what, what? Feet? Stripper feet? Oh, I see, you meant fact, but you just can't write. Having spent at least an hour a day reading this text for class, the lack of editing makes my head spin.

(available at Amazon.com) I personally think that everyone should read it. Her philosophy on life is so down-to-earth and practical. She's no whiner, I'll tell ya! Neither does she suffer fools gladly. Zarin has been a poster to various online message boards for quite some time now, contributing and helping people whenever she can. I've included a few quotes from the book below:'Living in fear is what we are socially conditioned to accept. Afraid we weill not make that mortgage payment, afraid we will lose our job. Afraid. We fear everything, we hope we will not have to face being alone because we are afraid of being lonely.Wake up! You ARE alone. Accept that. There is nothing to be afraid of. We are born alone and when we die, we die alone, taking nothing with us. Start paying attention to yourself. You have only one life to live. Live it! Make time for yourself. Maybe we do not realise it, but we all need time alone. Time to reflect on who we are and where our fulfillment lies.''Having PSD and PCD means I need to take blood thinners that work by effectively blocking the Vitamin K function of the blood, thereby creating a situation where the body is unable to clot. Basically, on blood thinners one becomes a drug-induced haemophiliac. Any cut can be potentially dangerous. The blood has to be monitored constantly to maintain a balance so one does not run the risk of internal bleeding. It is the only means allopathic medicine has to prevent further blood clots from forming and creating dangerous situations. However, the so-called prevention is worse than the condition, especially for someone like me who has adverse reactions to the drugs.''In this book I want to share with everyone my personal experiences in the hope that it will give strength to each and everyone to live life to the fullest. This is a story about human endurance and triumph of the human spirit against impossible odds.Life is a leaky bucket.

All three books are somewhat autobiographical, but carry the message that no matter how down you are, remember there is still something that can be done.In Life is a Leaky Bucket I talk about my fight to conquer a debilitating blood disorder. Along the way I share the lessons I learnt about life.In Reclaiming My Soul I talk about loss and how I am coping with loss. Anyone who has lost family members or friends will understand what a hole it creates in ones soul. This is my journey to find the missing piece of my soul.In Ten Years of Total Silence I talk about the loss of a lifestyle. With the onset of my disease, I had to give up my career as a journalist. Before I fell ill I was a very high profile figure in the media world. I had to loose all that in order to gain life.I will give you an example. One day I bumped into a newscaster at a society function and I said to him,&quot;Hi long time no see&quot; and he turned around and said to me &quot;But Darling you are no longer on the social scene&quot;!

Wallowing in the kind of salacious, dime novel prose he so willingly condemns the press for using to create the Manson-as-icon, he takes on that annoyingly presumptuous &quot;voice of the characters&quot; style of journalism that hypnotizes mass market readers. Surprisingly, as a quickie-cash-in, the only factual errors he makes are very minor, but Manson scholars will find only silliness here and no one but pure collectors need consider it a necessary buy, unless you happen upon a 1970 1st edition of course."},{"Title":"A Child's Treasury of Poems","review":"For almost 17 years or so now, I have loved this book.

In Eternal Impact, Phil Downer shows how men can leave a legacy that will endure forever-the lasting fruit of spiritual reproducers.This legacy is built through discipling and mentoring, helping men discover Jesus Christ's role in marriage, fathering and relationships, and then become effective in fulfilling His command to make disciples. Eternal Impact offers men a realistic, step-by-step guide for building men to become change agents in the world around them through discipleship.It's filled with dynamic examples of discipleship in action, straight-forward advice, and genuine openness. Each chapter is followed by questions for discussion, ideal for in-depth personal and small-group interactions...I can't give it five stars because there's a little fluff in it, but the main message is strong.

Set in an evocatively depicted 1950s Hong Kong, this book is a devastatingly funny account of Chinese culture and family life. In many ways it remains acccurate even today.The Monkey King contains many many wonderful insights into colonialism, Confucianism and family politics. This is a humane, arch and beautifully-written piece of social and human analysis blended with touches of whimsy and magical realism.Like Sun Wu Kong the famous Monkey King of &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, Wallace uses his brains, sleight of hand and force of imagination to eventually pull success from the jaws of failure. However, the disturbing ending of the book points to deeper and darker forces at work within this sunny and good-humored tale.Some people may have a problem with the &quot;dialect&quot; that Mo has his Cantonese-speaking characters use when they are speaking &quot;Chinglish&quot;, personally I think it's a marvellous use of an artistic convention to confront speakers of standard English with the fact that local dialect adaptations of English (not elite-sanctioned text-book varieties) are the standard method of communication in many different places.Despite the official pronouncements, this book is actually alive and well and available through the UK Amazon site. It is published by Mo's own Paddleless Press which he set up in 1995 after he sacked Random House as his publisher."},{"Title":"Monkey King","review":"This story of a Cantonese family in Hong Kong is filled with warmth and humor. It tracks the relationship between Wallace, a clever young man of Portuguese-Cantonese descent, and the family's shrewd, miserly, tyrannical patriarch. Perhaps it's a bit of a fairy tale that works out too smoothly in the end. But Mo writes so well about families - and is so good at capturing the magic of people finding somewhat unexpectedly that they love each other - that it doesn't matter. The scenes between Wallace and his surprisingly resourceful wife May Ling -- and between Wallace and his beloved nephews -- are simply a joy to read."},{"Title":"Monkey King","review":"I first read this novel, set in 1950's Hong Kong, while living in Hong Kong in the nineteen nineties - a cracking good read.An eccentric Chinese family living in a crumbling, atmospheric town house (of the kind that has, alas, been utterly swept away by remorseless development) is slowly revealed to the reader in absorbing, fascinating detail. I was amazed, as a Hong Kong resident, at how many of the actions and attitudes of Mr Mo's fictional family were still to be encountered in nineteen nineties Hong Kong (and no doubt today). I felt I met these people, or observed them, many times while living there.A sad, funny, ironic book that gains in strength by not becoming sentimental about Hong Kong, nor pulling any punches. Like other accurate reads about Hong Kong (such as Paul Theroux's Kowloon Tong - read it if you like this one), Monkey King tended to put a bee in the bonnet of some readers, chiefly those types so well-described by Mr Mo herein, and may be a painful read for some. But the detached reader has in store for him an excellent story, great characters and (an added plus) a book that is very informative about the Hong Kong of reality."},{"Title":"Monkey King","review":"Several times i laughed out loud. It wasn't a comfortable laughter, though, because all people in this Hongkong-Chinese family novel (with a mild outsider as main actor) are unsympathetic - just everyone. Mo also makes them talk a Pidgin English that feels degenerate in written form. Anyway it is nice to observe family life. In the books first half nothing much goes on; if a household member dies, the problem is calmly approached with some cerenomy and less emotion.There are interesting, mildly bizarre intercultural encounters, seen with Chinese eyes. Side figures bear cute names such as Mabel Yip or Pippy da Souza - you gotta love it. The novel is clearly split in several parts: town - village - back to town. The second half has a few weird ongoings which probably only Chinese or old Hongkong hands will fully treasure.Mo English sounds energetic, erudite and non-judgementally sarcastic, I found his tone rather gripping. To me as a non-native English reader, he is certainly more difficult than say Naipaul or Theroux; but he's never dull.The Hongkong novels I liked most so far are Suzie Wong and Kowloon Tong - both written from a westerners point of view. Not bad I thought was A Many Splendoured Thing, with a more Chinese angle."},{"Title":"Monkey King","review":"I am not going to relate what is in the book - there are enough descripitons of it's contents - and I am not going to analyse it. I only wanted to write, that I could not put the book down. It is a great read!"},{"Title":"Monkey King","review":"Timothy Mo, the twice Booker Prize nominated writer of part Chinese descent, writes with confidence and authority about the marriage of an outsider (Wallace) into a Cantonese family and his eventual acceptance by the patriach who breaks with tradition and hands the reins over to him when he dies. The first third of the novel is undeniably captivating and often hilarious in its authentic account of Chinese customs and beliefs and in its characterisation of the various members of the Poon family, from the loutish Ah Lung to the two unmarried sisters, the elder of whom makes a thunderous noise when she washes in the morning. Mabel is another unforgettable character. But as soon as Wallace and May Ling are packed off to Mainland China, the pace starts to slacken and I found myself quickly losing interest. Things didn't improve much even when the scene shifted back to Hong Kong for the final third of the novel. I found myself skimming the pages and looking forward to its end. It was a major source of irritation for me that Mo makes all his characters speak in the weirdest past tense, an attempt no doubt to capture in dialogue the ungrammatical English used by Hongkongers, but it only comes across as cute and condescending. &quot;The Monkey King&quot; reads like the real thing for the most part but is ultimately disappointing."},{"Title":"Applied System Identification","review":"The book has been well written.

It is full of fascinating, detailed information and insightful comments about the songs nominated for the Oscar in the first 25 years of the award.I found this \`page-turner' very hard to put down. It's wonderful to dip into, and it will settle any argument you may have about the great songs from the movies. It is full of information that, up until now, was not easily accessible. For example, I learned from 'Best Songs' that there were two songs called \`Linda'. I was intrigued to learn about the Oscar nominated \`other Linda' and the movie in which it appeared. I challenge you to sing this song!It seems there's not much interest in the Best Song Oscars these days but this book makes it clear that this was not always so. The fascinating introduction shows the historical process by which changes in popular music have led to a decline in the significance of the Best Song Oscar.It's very clear that the author has meticulously researched the subject. The book has a very attractive design with well-chosen stills from many of the movies discussed. The Appendix, giving biographical details on all the songwriters mentioned in the book, is especially valuable.'Best Songs of the Movies' is a delight to dip into and an indispensable guide for movie buffs and anyone who has any interest in American popular music. If you want to impress your friends with your comprehensive knowledge of popular music, you should get \`Best Songs of the Movies' (but, don't tell them about the book!)."},{"Title":"Best Songs of the Movies: Academy Award Nominees and Winners, 1934-1958","review":"I just recently obtained this book. It is quite fun and most informative. I am choosing to read this book in random order. In other words, I am randomly selecting various years and songs that are most interesting to me, and am reading it in that manner. Mr. Funnell's book really succeeds on two fundamental levels. On the one hand it is a genuinely informative, insightful, and probative study of a vitally importart body of American music. I believe that , in time, it will be regarded as one of the essential books on this topic. Yet, as valuable as the book is to the study of this important sub-genre of the American Songbook, it never bogs down into the pseduo-intellectual type of rhetoric that unfortunately typifies a lot of \\"serious\\" works on popular culture. \\"Best Songs of the Movies\\" is an engaging and lively book. This is just the sort of book that prompts one to want to curl up in a comfy chair , put on a cd of \\"That's Entertainment\\" or other suitable movie musical compilation, and read through the vaious years and songs profiled in the book. By the way, I especially appreciate Appendix 1, which provides brief capsule bios on the songwriters. Of course, we know to expect to see Irving Berlin, Harold Arlen, Harry Warren, etc. However, it is also nice to see such lesser lights as Ralph Freed, Johnny Marvin, and Allie Wrubel sharing space with the aforementioned luminaries.In sum, this is one of the best books on American music and American movies to reach publication in quite some time."},{"Title":"Best Songs of the Movies: Academy Award Nominees and Winners, 1934-1958","review":"Our club chose this book to study for this year. It had great potential for our music club to showcase our singers and pianists. After reading the book, I wrote a One Act play including songs that won an Oscar. Members of the club took the five parts to be spoken; others took the singing parts. I believe that this will produce an enjoyable evening for our musicians and those who appreciate music. Some of our members will not know any of the songs, while others will know most of them. The National Course of Study chair approved it and we're off to a musical evening!For someone just desiring a good read, this is excellent for anyone who lived any time between 1934 and 1956 - the scope of the book. It lists the songs nominated for the Oscar with some interesting details about each one, then tells the winner. All in all, it's just fun to read."},{"Title":"Cops Don't Cry: A Book of Help and Hope for Police Families","review":"This book is not what I expected. It is basically two hundred pages of a police officer's wife complaining about being a police officer's wife. Now, certainly, venting one's stress is important, and perhaps sharing one's feelings with others in the same situation has some degree of merit. However, the book claimed to be &quot;a book of help and hope for police families.&quot; Well, I guess my main point is I didn't find too much help and hope. I felt like the book offered very little insight and the author dwelled on her complaints about her life."},{"Title":"Cops Don't Cry: A Book of Help and Hope for Police Families","review":"Too often, communities take our police forces and their protection of society for granted. &quot;Cops Don't Cry&quot; is a story that needs to be told, for both the families of police officers and the public they serve, and who better to tell it than the wife of a cop. In collecting testimonies from cops and their spouses across North America along with anecdotes of her own experience, Vali Stone has uncovered the main reason for the high divorce rate among cops. It is a breakdown in communication. To show how this happens, Vali takes her readers through every step of a cop's life, from training and the stress of the daily beat to the loss of a comrade. She also shares the spouse's roller-coaster ride of emotions, from the sexual appeal of a romantic partner in uniform to pride in their job to fear that every good-bye kiss may be their last. Vali's conversational style of writing makes her feel like a friend to her readers. By the end of the book, she not only provides police families with help and hope, she also offers insights and sensible tips for all couples experiencing problems communicating with each other."},{"Title":"Cops Don't Cry: A Book of Help and Hope for Police Families","review":"This is a well-written, easy reading book with a strong message.

Doing nothing about it will not make it &quot;go away&quot; &amp; will, ultimately, ensure defeat of your marriage.COPS DON'T CRY is a serious &amp; good book, no matter which profession you or your spouse is in. Listening to what spouses have said about being married to a policeman, is both engaging &amp; eye-opening.

Koning does not delight in debunking the myth, nor does he gloat in the exose'; rather the tone is one of moral despair over the actual facts. Essentially the Christian Spaniards slaughtered and enslaved as they plundered the New World. Convinced he had found the fabled way to Cathay ahead of the rival Portuguese, Columbus appears every bit the avaricious social climber of his era. Skilled and daring, he was also venal and petty. Koning's portrait is not a pretty one, but then we've had enough of those.Koning takes the revered Samuel Eliot Morrison to task for his sanitized portrait of the Great Explorer. Most reprehensive, in Koning's view, is Morrison's utter disregard for the death and destruction left in Columbus's wake and to which he was a party. Seemingly, Morrison's brand of biographical myopia represents a particularly deadly brand of Western ideology at work, one that cleans up the official record on behalf of the powers that be.Perhaps most praiseworthy in Koning's tratment are the succinct moral parallels he draws between the civilizing forces of Spain in the New World and their 20th century American counterparts in Vietnam, where additional tens of thousands were slaughtered resisting Western conquest. A book like this exposes unmistakably the self-serving mythology that surrounds so much of our official history. Such versions are not misleading by accident, instead they work to a purpose and there seems no better word for describing that purpose than ideological. They are distortions that preserve current institutions of power; namely, those political and economic arrangements that also happen to be products of Columbus's bloody wake. It's interesting to speculate the direction our polity would take were Koning's book, rather than the traditional sanitized versions, required reading in the nation's high schools. Be that as it may, don't expect to see Koning in a Columbus Day parade any time soon."},{"Title":"Columbus: His Enterprise: Exploding the Myth","review":"Koning gives a very valid speculation on Columbus' life and voyages. Thoughout the years, the story of Columbus has been twisted and glamourized, making the people of America believe that he was a hero. Koning goes in to great detail when explaining the truths behind all these mythological ideals. It is an easy read as well as a very good piece of writing."},{"Title":"Columbus: His Enterprise: Exploding the Myth","review":"Excellent book and well written, though very short. Impossible to put down once you begin reading. I recommend, however, reading other Columbus books to give yourself a more balanced view. This book is very subjective and highly opinionated. All content is anti-Columbus. The book contains many details you'll never find in other history books or public school texts in America. After reading, you'll hunger for more information."},{"Title":"Hesiod: The Homeric hymns and Homerica (The Loeb classical library)","review":"Like all Loeb Classics, this edition is presented with the ancient greek text on the left page, and its english translation on the right, giving students of classical greek an easy cross-reference. The translations are easy to read and not too difficult to comprehend, while still at the same time accurately rendered (unlike many Loeb translations, which are frequently too literal a translation to be readable).But what makes this book of keen interest is not the attention paid to Hesiod's Theogony and Works &amp; Days, nor the anonymous &quot;Homeric&quot; Hymns, but rather to its meticulous compedium of the lesser-known works it presents. Especially, for those works for which no complete version has survived, only fragments and occassional (later) commentaries.In this volume you discover a wonderful epic poem called The Catalogue of Women and Eoie, of which only about half survives scattered among a hundred or so fragments. You also discover The Shield of Hercules, which some attribute to Hesiod. But most fascinating of all are the fragments of the Epic Cycle, poems written as a sort of &quot;history&quot; of the Greek people, of which the two great works by Homer (The Iliad and The Odyssey) were the most well-known and the only ones to survive intact. As far as I know, this is the only volume in english which gathers all of these fragments together and attempts to sort them out in some kind of order; for those interested in the ancient epics, this alone makes the edition worth the price.This book is a sobering reminder of just how much has been lost over the centuries, of just how little actually has survived. Sadly, this is now probably the closest anyone will ever get to being able to read The Cypriad or The Melampodia again, and that's a shame."},{"Title":"Hesiod: The Homeric hymns and Homerica (The Loeb classical library)","review":"Sometimes when consulting the Loeb Library for a translation of a greek text one finds a version wildly different than the original. This volume of the Loeb niether betrays the text, nor translates with arcane vocabulary (e.g. thou, thee, etc.). All in all, a very useful tool."},{"Title":"Passage to Egypt: The Life of Lucie Duff Gordon","review":"Frank's account of the life of Lady Gordon is an interesting addition to the previous work by Lucie's great-grandson, Gordon Waterfield. Frank brings in elements not touched on by the 1937 bio, although Waterfield's account is equally as interesting. Both books do an admirable job of conveying the story of this remarkable and unconventional Victorian. If they pique your interest, be sure to seek out Lucie's own works. Gordon Waterfield's 1969 reissue of &quot;Letters From Egypt&quot; contains more of Lucie's letters than the original publication did. Lucie's daughter Janet also wrote bios of the family and her own autobiography, &quot;Fourth Generation&quot; is interesting in its self-portrait of Lucie's very odd eldest daughter."},{"Title":"Passage to Egypt: The Life of Lucie Duff Gordon","review":"Lucie Duff Gordon was raised unconventionally in an age that placed great premium on convention.

Good story, unlike any graphic novel I have read before."},{"Title":"JLA (Book 7): Tower of Babel","review":"After a long run by Grant Morrison on JLA (too long), it was good to see a new writer take over and make the series their own, and he did it with a bang! Tower of Babel is easily my favorite JLA story to date. No mystery here, just an old fashioned \\"we are coming to get you\\" story. Ra's Al Ghoul has stolen Batman's secret files on the JLA's weaknesses, and uses them to rain destruction upon the League. When all is said and done and Ra's is defeated, it's interesting to see how the League as well as the Titans and Young Justice handle Batman and his wards (everyone thinks all of them are keeping secret files on their respective team mates as well). Solid story (although a lot like the Batman Beyond episode \\"Babel\\" as far as Ra's plot, not sure which came first), great dialogue, wonderful art, this book has it all. Wasn't too thrilled with the intro story with the Atom (didn't really seem to fit in anywhere and a bit rehashed), but criticism aside, it's a great book and a good look inside Batman's paranoia."},{"Title":"JLA (Book 7): Tower of Babel","review":"These were originally published as JLA #42-#46, JLA Secret Files #3 and JLA 80 page Giant #1.Similar to how J'onn the Martian Manhunter kept files on all of the JLAers in the beginning, Batman has investigated each of them. But apparently Bats has gone further, developing methods to defeat each of the JLAers, ostensibly if someone or something takes over their minds or bodies.One of Batman's arch enemies, Ra' al Ghul, uses his daughter to get into Bruce Wayne/Batman's life, and steal these files, using them to defeat each one of the JLAers. And uses what he thinks is Batman's own weakness (i.e., his parents) against him.JLA wins again, as they always do, through teamwork. But they then kick Batman out of the JLA for his actions, as they can no longer feel they can trust him.This is why the JLA is one of the best graphic series around. The interaction of the heroes, each with their own strengths and flaws, shines through. Batman has long stood on his own, aloof from the rest of the League, and now he is out...at least until the next story.Fav panel: page 67, Superman and the Red Kyptonite. Now that's gotta hurt."},{"Title":"JLA (Book 7): Tower of Babel","review":"I throughly enjoyed this story. As other reviewers have written this story shows the brillance and genuis of the only non-superpowered member of the team - The Batman! But did Batman betray his team mates? Nope! Not in my book! I think he was jusitfied in coming up with ways of stopping the most powerful beings in the DC Universe - and in not telling them.Have we forgotten how many times Superman has gone rogue because of someone taking over his mind? And we must not forget Hal Jordan's (the former Green Lantern now the new Spectre)transformation into Parallax.Yep in my opinon Bats was right in devising ways to stop them - just in case. And in the context of the characters they should have acknowleded this. They know from experience how right Batman usually is. Where was their trust in him? But I have to admit when it comes to The Batman I am biased. He is my all time favorite.But this story does show that Batman must not ever be underestimated. It would also be nice to see a story that shows how right Batman was in designing ways to stop the JLA and not telling them.Okay back to the real world. This was a great story. Buy it!!"},{"Title":"JLA (Book 7): Tower of Babel","review":"This book helps explain why Superman views Batman (who has no super powers) as the most dangerous person on earth. It's exactly because he's a normal human being that he creates methods to defeat each of his super powered allies in the justice league. He knows he doesn't have the luxury of blind faith in his teammates, with out pragmatic planning he and the rest of the world would be at there mercy should they ever go rogue. It's a kind of selflessness that he denies himself the bonds that his allies share so that he is prepared to protect humanity even from them.However there is an inherent danger in the creation of these plans that is explored in Tower of Babel and the animated adaptation Justice League:DOOM. What if a super villain got a hold of these detailed plans? The world would now be at their mercy and only Batman could turn the tide. This is the story explored by Mark Waid. This premise alone makes the book worth reading, but is also an excellently crafted story and shows great understanding of the various heroes and villains personalities. It's a must read for Batman fans and highlights a dark but intriguing aspect of the character."},{"Title":"JLA (Book 7): Tower of Babel","review":"This book contains four stories of which the main one, Tower of Babel is definitely the best of all four stories and possibly one of the best stories ever told.It is about Batman and discovering that he kept a record of weaknesses and traps for all the Leaguers in case something happened to them that made them turn against humanity. The discovery was only made after these records fell on an enemy's hand and he was using them against them. It is interesting to see everyone's weaknesses since we always see the invincible side of each Leaguer. It is also interesting to see if they can conquer these traps and what they will do to Batman afterwards.The first short story is basically a JLA incredible shrinking man story where they are shrunk to battle disease in a sick boy's body. It is somewhat interesting but not a whole lot.The third story is possibly the weakest one where Batman tries to find out if Superman is quilty of murder. Starts out strong but ends very quick and disappointedly.The fourth is the shortest story of all where we find out a secret Aquaman has been hiding."},{"Title":"JLA (Book 7): Tower of Babel","review":"Batman is cool. Yes, we all know this. In this issue his enemy Raz has gotten hold on information he had on his fellow league members. Info on how to take them down{in case they switch sides,turn evil exe}. Raz used the info and literally #%$ed them all up, leaving only Batman left to make things right again. In the end they voted him out. I don't blame them. I know EXACTLY where Batman was coming from {his colleages are extremely powerful} but anyone who could do that behind their friends backs doesn't belong in a group.{Keep in mind, the info was how to KILL the other league members ! Meaning Bruce actually took time to sit in his cave and devise a way to to kill every last one of them. {It was some crucial stuff too} You don't just forget about that. Clark knew the business but everyone else was totally shocked and hurt by Batman's secret. I like Batman fine {as an individual} What he did doesn't make Batman look bad. But it makes Bruce look HORRIBLE. Its Bat MAN, not Batmachine ! The JLA is a TEAM. Bruce needs to get with it or get out."},{"Title":"JLA (Book 7): Tower of Babel","review":"this book is so good i read it in a day and 1/2.it is filled with lots of action and has a great plot.one of batmans foes getsa hold of his files on the jla and how to take them out.then sets his plan into motion.batman is so sneaky he takes bits of information on his friends and turns it on them.it wouldn't be so bad if he'd let them know about the files,but he doesn't.he kind of comes off as a twisted man in this book,but i see his point of having a plan in place incase on of the jla turns evil(ala hal jordan).i have been debating the ethics of his actions since i got done reading it.on one hand i agree whith his plan tobe ready to stop on of the jla and not tell them.if they know he has a plan to stop them when the turn evil they will be ready for it.on the other hand how could you do this to (a.)your teammates who trust you. (b.)betray your friends and alow your files to fall into evil hands.this book is one of my favorites.i'd place it in my top ten favorites list.you will not be disapointed!"},{"Title":"JLA (Book 7): Tower of Babel","review":"Such a dismantling of the greatest team of superheroes on Earth...all by the mind of one of their own. This collects one of the biggest stories of the comic world in 2000. Also includes issue #42 and the JLA Giant 80 page edition. The story itself is top notch (Mark Waid at his finest...check out Kingdom Come if you want more proof of his finest). The story is logical makes sense (well, as much sense as you can be with this plot).The art can get bland at times, but it suits its purpose of moving the story along and conveying the action. And it's very economical, considering back issues would be twice the price (at least!). I would recommend this to anyone who has a interest in superhero comics or just want to read a interesting tale."},{"Title":"JLA (Book 7): Tower of Babel","review":"Seriously... this is the ONLY comic of any sort that I own.... You just have to buy it and read it.... NOW!!!!!"},{"Title":"JLA (Book 7): Tower of Babel","review":"Batman is not known for playing well with others or really trusting anyone. This story has contingency plans Batman made, in case Justice Leaguers went rogue, stolen and used against them. It is a very enjoyable story and well plotted. The art is not much to talk about, but is by no means poor. If you end up enjoying the book, there is a DC Animated adaptation, title Justice League Doom, that s pretty good."},{"Title":"JLA (Book 7): Tower of Babel","review":"The idea that Batman has a plan for dealing with each person in the Justice League is cool. Batman keeping tabs on everyone is believeable but the way he is going to deal with each person is not logical or very Batmanish. His plans are too cartoonish. The League of Assassins use of these plans is also silly. How does the League of Assassins not kill the supers when they have the chance, it just seems like the sort of thing they would do."},{"Title":"JLA (Book 7): Tower of Babel","review":"tpbwiki.com says the tpb collects JLA #42-46, JLA Secret Files 3, JLA 80-Page Giant #1. However, this would be a lot more pages than the 160 pages in Amazon's description. The 4 official JLA issues of this story (JLA 43 - 46) are ~92 pages by themselves. So I'm guessing JLA 42, JLA Secret Files 3, and JLA 80-Page Giant must only be reproduced in portions within the TPB.Anyway, I read the 4 main JLA issues, 43 - 46, not the TPB. I really liked the concept - Batman keeps secret files on how to defeat each JLA member just in case they go bad (in a previous story their bodies and powers had been taken over by villains). Ra's al Ghul is able to obtain Batman's files and use them to defeat the entire JLA as a distraction while he is unleashing chaos on the world in his latest attempt to right-size the human race. First off, I didn't like the artwork - it was too cartoonish for me, and I thought the faces were kind of misshapen; it just wasn't to my taste I guess. More importantly, I didn't care for the story's development - I felt it wasn't very suspenseful. I read the story already knowing about the main concept, and while I didn't yet know the details of how each member would be defeated, I knew generally what to expect. Unfortunately, I thought it played out pretty linearly, without adding much in the way of plot twists or surprises to build up the story or make it suspenseful. I actually found it kind of boring. Perhaps the other issues outside of the main 43 - 46 would have helped to add some additional interest, such as character development, plot complexity, or suspense?? Be that as it may, my take on the main 4 issues were that they were simplistic and didn't live up to the potential of their main concept. Maybe the upcoming movie adaption will be better."},{"Title":"JLA (Book 7): Tower of Babel","review":"If you ever wondered how paranoid Batman is and what it would cost the Heroes he fights crime with. Then \\"Tower of Babel\\" is going to make for a good Read and the art of this story will make you wanna finish the story on the spot and since I dont wanna spoil anything."},{"Title":"JLA (Book 7): Tower of Babel","review":"First Impressions:Recently checked out the JLA Tower of Babel graphic novel from 2001, originally single issued from JLA 42-46, JLA Secret Files 3, and the JLA 80 Page Giant from the 1998-2000 era of DC Comics!Stories and Plots:Cracked it open and enjoyed the first story written well by Dan Curtis Johnson, \\"Half a Mind to Save a World.\\" This story takes place inside a boy who is suffering from a life-threatening item in his brain. Except the surgery will have to wait since there is a microscopic world inside his head!That's what I like about DC: these weird, unusual and imaginative stories that have no stand on reality but the clear metaphors of honor, team-work, respect for all kinds of life as well as political greed and selfishness is very evident.The bacterial (germ?) people don't believe that there is another world beyond there's, except for a few dissidents who oppose their government. This theme has been done before, (as in Superman's origin story - Jor-El knows Krypton is going to go boom and the scientists dismiss him as a fraud) except we have the entire Justice League being beat up!The second and more vibrant story is about Batman, written in several parts by Mark Waid, with artists Howard Porter and Drew Geraci doing a great job!I've always liked Ras aGhul, his psychotic daughter and the intermix with Batman is just too intense for words. Others have written better, detailed reviews than myself, so I'm only going to say that Batman, distrustful as always, has in his Batcave the secrets of beating all of his Justice League members in case things get out of hand.Unfortunately the bad guys get a hold of this information and use it against the Justice League with horrific results. Who would have thought there would be yet another type of Kryptonite, or that the Green Lantern would not be able to form with his ring if blind (this is the Kyle Rainer version). Can you imagine Aquaman with a fear of water?Bottom Line:The story gets even better when the bad guys are beat and the League ponders whether to keep Batman on board. The ending for me was rushed and didn't totally close for me, but still, this graphic novel is well worth picking up!"},{"Title":"JLA (Book 7): Tower of Babel","review":"I bought this book because Batman was the central charater.

Now Mark Waid is a man who knows how to write comics! After over 40 issues under the helm of Grant Morrison, this book collects the first issues written by Mark Waid. With the talents of Mark Waid, the stories are more personal and smaller in scope. Gone are the masses of JLA members. (No Zauriel, no Steel, no Huntress, etc.) Mark Waid uses the main members, and we get to know them a bit better. (Wonder Woman is finally put to good use again!) The stories are not wild nonsense. They don't ramble on just to sell more issues. Each incident is there for a purpose. This tightly told story tells of Batman's fall from grace from the JLA. It also includes a few one-off issues, the best of which features only Aquaman and Wonder Woman. My favorite line is by Aquaman to Wonder Woman while he's holding her lasso, \\"Actually, I think you're a little vapid and boring -- and often more than a little Pollyanna-ish.

The Third Bounes Story is Revelations, which includes Aquaman and Wonder Women teaming up."},{"Title":"JLA (Book 7): Tower of Babel","review":"When people ask me, why I like Batman. I tell them because he's a business man. He thinks and acts like a business man. He is ruthless, single minded and cunning. And nowhere is this more apparent than in this title.Normally when we think of Batman we think of a vigilante who haunts the night trying to bring down the bad guys. I believe that he is much more complex than this. Batman is a man who, having suffered tragedy at a very young age, Has vowed never to be life's victim again. And thus, he does everything in his power to strategize and manipulate in order to make sure that he comes out on top. Like any successful man of power he plans all the way to end. Considering every possibility...everything that could and can go wrong in a given scenario. Batman is the sort of hero Machiavelli would admire because he is willing to do ugly things (short of murder) to accomplish his objectives.Law #2 in the 48 Laws of Power (by Robert Greene), says \\"never put too much trust in friends\\". And this is essentially what is behind Batman's actions in this book. Batman is well aware of what lies behind men's hearts. He knows how fickle they can be. They can be loyal to you one minute and betray you the next. This is what has driven Batman to accumulate information on each JLA member. He has studied each member their character, their powers and has devised a stratagem to bring each one down. Should one of them turn to evil in the future.Unfortunately Ra's Al Ghul (translated as The Deamons Head) Batman's foe. Has discovered the information that Batman has been keeping in his lair. And has used it to disable each member of the JLA so that he can carry out his plan to \\"purify\\" the earth.When the members of the JLA find out that the heart of their misfortune originated with Batman. They vote to expel him. Not only because of what Ra's has done. But also because they all feel that he has betrayed their friendship. By keeping information on each one of them, Batman has essentially shown that he did not think very highly of his teammates in the JLA...when they trusted and admired him. When Batman is cast out I think it registers on him how badly he has been mistaken about friendship. And sometimes there is far more to getting a job done than the \\"business is business\\" philosophy.I am not a JLA fan but this really is a very good story. And I liked it because it provided a very good study to Batman. For all of Batman's strategising. He never considered what would happen if the information got into the wrong hands. He never stopped to consider how hurt his friends would be. When Batman is expelled he doesn't simply walk away and shrug his shoulders. He actually looks hurt that his teamates have cast him aside for what he has done. It shows a different aspect to Batman than him simply being an arrogant loner. It shows that he actually cares about what other people think of him. And the loss of friendship.Mark Waid has done a good job on this story."},{"Title":"JLA (Book 7): Tower of Babel","review":"Batman is the weakest of all the members of the Justice League, because he is simply a human being with no powers. Yet, he is the best and most dangerous superhero out of all of them. That is awesome!!!Tower of Babel show exactly why Batman is not a man to be looked over, but feared. He compulsively fight crime to the nth degree no matter the cost or who he alienates. Probably the most amazing attribute about Batman is his amazing brain. Forever strategizing how to maintain the upper hand over his enemies... and his friends.Batman keeps a cool distance over his friends because deep down he believes that one day there is a strong chance he will have to take them out. Does it make him a bad, untrustworthy person? That is the issue the members of the Justice League have to come to terms with.Batman's ingenious ways to defeat all of the JLA have fallen into the hands of one of his worst enemies, Ras Al Ghul. Every JLA member is incapacitated, and Batman is to blame.A great read with dire consequences in the end. The question ultimately is... is Batman wrong for doing it? It is for you to decide. Enjoy."},{"Title":"JLA (Book 7): Tower of Babel","review":"When I came into this book, especially after reading the Amazon.com reviews, I was expecting something epic. When I heard that this book dealt with Batman's ultimate plans against the rest of the JLA in the case of a superhero gone rogue, I was anticipating some brilliant ways to take down the most powerful beings in the universe that only Batman could devise.I have to admit, when I read this book, I was let down a little. Let's just say that I was let down enough to write my first Amazon.com review so I could at least provide a counter to what most of the reviews say.Now let me say WHY I was underwhelmed by this trade, without spoiling things beyond what is listed the back of the book. First, let me explain the premise of the book. The bottom line is, in his typical always-prepared style, Batman has collected a dossier on each Justice League member with detailed information on how to defeat that member. This idea is similar to the \\"Xavier Protocols\\" on the X-men which spawned a similar story. Basically this information falls into the wrong hands (Namely Ra's al Ghul) and is used against the league.The first thing that bothered me was the simple fact that this information was leaked AT ALL. We are talking about the Batman here. The single most intelligent, prepared, and secretive person on the planet. You don't just walk up and ask him for these files. The fact that anyone even knew these files existed was never explained. Batman is just too damned careful to let anyone take these files. I understand it had to happen to advance the story, but it never sat right with me.Now some of the methods used against the JLA were pretty cool, and I was satisfied with them. However, some of them were downright ridiculous (I won't give much away). For example, what reason on earth would someone who is trying to kill Superman have to use ANYTHING other than green kryptonite against him? There is none. It is never really stated why someone would choose to simply incapacitate Supes instead of trying to kill him. It doesn't add up for me. Similarly, the methods used against Green Lantern and the Flash are a little \\"out there\\", and I feel like Mark Waid could have thought of better ways to take them out.In the end, the league loses trust in Batman, and votes whether or not to kick him out of the league. I feel like this was an unnecessary plot point, seeing as how historically Batman is known for this type of stuff. Hell, the man carries green Kryptonite with him wherever he goes. It doesn't make sense that they were surprised at all by this development. I chalk it up to poor writing in the end.One more reason that I gave this book a 3/5 stars was the art. It was very cartoonish looking for the serious nature the writing tried to convey. The art pretty much bothered me throughout the book.Overall, it is a solid entry into JLA history, but it will always bug me the way Batman was infiltrated so easily and that his methods were very non-batman-like. I hope that makes sense."},{"Title":"JLA (Book 7): Tower of Babel","review":"This is among the best of JLA!Classic tale of batman's contingency plans falling in the hands of Ra's Al Ghul and how he neutralises all the gun guns of JLA (Superman, Wonderwoman, Green Lantern, Flash, Aquaman, Plasticman and Martian Manhunter.Talia, the daugher of Ra's is potrayed as an efficient slealth soldier who focuses on one JLA-er at a time, taking him/her down based on the batman files. Talia's character is also fleshed out depicting her as the uneasy assasin torn between her father's totalistic measures and her relationship with the dark detective.This story holds significance with the recent OMAC Project where another of batman's plans backfire."},{"Title":"JLA (Book 7): Tower of Babel","review":"If I wanted to be chintzy and point out all the logical flaws, etc that plague this series, it would only be three stars. But I believe that given the fact that I've reread this story 20 or 30 times,means the overall story overcomes those inadequacies.So much spoiler information has been given away already, I won't contribute further. Let's just say that this is one of the most important Batman stories anyone's EVER done. We receive more insight into his mind's inner workings, and get a hint that he's not that far removed from a guy named Frank Castle. Except for the &quot;no killing&quot; thing.This story is also important because it both sets up and is influenced by Miller's The Dark Knight Returns. The reverberations continued through to JLA Divided We Fall and in other DC books in months to follow. This is an indispensible book."},{"Title":"JLA (Book 7): Tower of Babel","review":"I've been reading JLA graphic novel for a number of years, and I thought that KINGDOME COME and JLA: EARTH 2 were the best I've read.....UNTIL I read THIS one. Only Batman would think of something this deadly....but it makes perfect sense. Being the only super-hero without any super speed, flying powers, etc., why NOT protect yourself and others if the rest of the JLA went rogue? Personally, I think Batman knows that he doesn't need the JLA, but they most definitely need him. Suffice to say, if you get only one novel, get THIS ONE!"},{"Title":"JLA (Book 7): Tower of Babel","review":"This book is a MUST read for any fan of Batman because it really shows you how deadly Batman can be and how much a genius he truly is! Basically, the book is about Batman making protocols to take down the JLA just in case they go rogue (turn into bad guys) but that's all I'll say. Mark Waid who is my favorite comicbook writer did an excellent job with this storyline and he adds a lot of great surprises to it as well. The art work in this comic could've been better but it good enough. I rate it a 5 because of the storyline though."},{"Title":"JLA (Book 7): Tower of Babel","review":"The JLA is nearly destroyed. Batman has accumulated data of how to incapacitate or even kill each Justice League member. Ras Al Ghul has stolen this information and is using it. The League is ambushed with cold, calculating efficiency.Al Ghul has decided that instead of global flood, he will create a language barrier. He has created a device that makes all communication unintelligible. Without language, the human race will kill one another in chaos.After a close aversion to crisis, the JLA must decide whether or not Batman will remain a member.I think that Batman is well within his rights; here are people with god-like powers that could conquer the world if they so desire. He is without powers; were he required to fight one of them he would easily be killed. He needs an upper hand.This storyline points out that the JLA has had, to some degree, a \\"superpowers only\\" membership policy. It is a sort of unwritten law, but this storyline uncovers the tension that exists between superheroes and ordinary humans. Though he is very capable, Batman is still an ordinary human. There is a constant uneasiness between Batman and Superman.I got it mainly because Batman was the central character. I was not disappointed."},{"Title":"JLA (Book 7): Tower of Babel","review":"If you've read any of the other reviews, you already know the premise of the story. The idea is that Ra's al Ghul has stolen Batman's handiwork, and used his secret plans to demolish the JLA expeditiously. However, the problem with the story is that Batman's plans range from ludicrous to heartless, and the League of Assassins fails to make some very basic changes to the plans that would have made them much, much more effective.SPOILER ALERTI'm going to give a quick run-down on each character, so if you want the plans to be a surprise, don't read this section.Martian Manhunter: Hit him with thousands of nanites that are composed of magnesium, so, when exposed to oxygen, he bursts into flames. Nasty, nasty. Apparently Batman is willing to murder J'onn, even though he goes well out of his way to avoid killing people like Two-Face and the Joker.Aquaman: Dose him with Scarecrow's fear gas to give him a terrible phobia of water, which Aquaman needs to survive. The problem, of course, is that he can still whomp on you while you wait for him to dry out.Plastic Man: Freeze him with liquid nitrogen, then shatter him with a hammer. The only problem is that the JLA manages to bring him back to life, so he's still around.Wonder Woman: Send a tiny machine into her inner ear that causes her to hallucinate and believe she's in a never-ending battle, eventually leading to cardiac arrest. Not a bad idea, but again, Batman seems to be all too willing to kill Leaguers.Flash: Use a \\"vibro-bullet,\\" fired into Flash's spine, to cause light-speed seizures. Somehow the Flash isn't maimed or killed by this, but this seems almost more like a method of torture than a manner of simply immobilizing him. Also, I'm pretty sure twenty minutes of super-siezures would probably kill him.Green Lantern: The biggest logical problem is the plan to stop Green Lantern. It is as follows: Sneak into his apartment at night, put the Power Ring on his finger, then implant a post-hypnotic suggestion that causes him to subconsciously use the ring to blind himself. Complicated, weird, and ignores the fact that as long as you're there, why not just STEAL THE FREAKING POWER RING?Superman: Of all the Leaguers, Superman should have been the easiest to kill. Just hand him a chunk of kryptonite and be done with it. Instead, Batman goes to the trouble of creating a non-lethal form of kryptonite, and the League of Assassins goes to the extra trouble of making a duplicate of it. Why? Why is Ra's al Ghul so concerned about not killing Superman?It all boils down to this: Most of Batman's secret plans don't make any sense. He's extremely willing to kill most of the Justice League, but goes to tremendous lengths to avoid killing others. Then, when the League of Assassins get their hands on the few non-lethal plans, they don't change them at all. Basically, if their plans had worked, they'd be left with a lot of dead Justice Leaguers and one MAJORLY mad Superman. And Batman, too, because after luring Bats away from his team, they really didn't have a plan to stop him other than \\"send a bunch of nameless thugs after him.\\" Because that always works. Finally, something that was not addressed in the story: what's to stop the League of Assassins from re-using these plans? Sure, the JLA would be ready for them, but setting the Martian manhunter on fire would kill him just as effectively.I like Mark Waid, but this whole storyline needs a serious re-write. The characters are written just fine, in fact they're written quite well, but the premise has some tremendous problems that spoiled the story for me."},{"Title":"JLA (Book 7): Tower of Babel","review":"You would think that a series revolving around Batman's designs to take out the other members of the JLA if necessary would be great? The overall story structure is a great idea: Batman, with no superpowers, is worried about the possibility of any of the JLA going rogue, so he devises methods to neutralize them if such a situation occurs. What if Batman or anyone else started to use those methods to neutralize the JLA and how would the other members feel if they found out that Batman had such a list? Well, you will find out here. Just be warned that his storyline has more in common with the animated superhero movies than it does with the adult graphic novels like The Killing Joke, The Long Halloween, or Hush. Basically, don't expect a long, drawn out detailed storyline involving the methodical takedown of the JLA, it all happens really quick and with mid-level details and is all ages friendly. I found the book to be both good (the JLA's reaction to what Batman has done) and bad (method for taking down the Green Lantern. Last time I checked, the GL didn't need to carry a picture book with him to use his ring). I am giving this a 3/5 not because the book is bad, but because it is just average, especially considering the story good really could have been great if developed properly."},{"Title":"JLA (Book 7): Tower of Babel","review":"I got this trade paper back because I have heard a lot about this story over the years and though I should read it before the animated movie based off of it came out.The trade starts with a story that while interesting on its own has nothing to do with the core store. After the core story is over there are a couple \\"short story\\" pages with some team up stuff that also has nothing to do with the core story.The Tower of Babel story itself felt rushed and not well thought out. Part of this could be because I knew the premise of the plot before I started, but it doesn't excuse the plot holes (mentioned in other reviews).I'd gladly give the Tower of Babel story itself a 3 star (although it be a low 3 star), but the fact that the compilation also had a lot of extra stuff just to fill out the book seems wasteful to me in a lot of ways. So it gets a 2 star rating."},{"Title":"JLA (Book 7): Tower of Babel","review":"First, the weapons Batman designed that were used against the other heroes were incredibly complex. There is no way he would have had the time, expertise, and facilities to build all those intricate weapons. I know it is science fiction, but each of the super-heroes are defined by their own limitations, that's why you have a story. Otherwise Superman could just fly around and save everybody and Bruce Wayne could just finance reparations and they would live in a perfect world. This one pushed even comic book credibility a little too far. Also, the Lazarus Pits are used to regenerate Ras Al Ghul when he is nearly dead or recently dead, they should not have been much of a threat to Bruce Wayne's parents bodies. Other than that, the concepts of trust and betrayal made a thought provoking story. I do like stories that show Batman as the preeminent member of the JLA."},{"Title":"JLA (Book 7): Tower of Babel","review":"Don't get me wrong. I love Mark Waid's writing, and on it's own merits, this is a good, solid story. Unfortunately, Waid has the unenviable task of following in the footsteps of Grant Morrison, who breathed new life into the JLA. I was a bit spoiled, and would HIGHLY recommend that you seek out the Morrison JLA books before getting these, or buying &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; and Waid's &quot;Flash&quot; books to see what Mark Waid is really capable of..."},{"Title":"Good Intentions (Arabesque)","review":"Ivy Daniels is getting married, but just before she and her father are to walk down the aisle, she changes her mind. Ivy wanted to do some soul searching. Deep down in her heart she knew she didn't love Keith Jamison. Her mother kept telling her what a great catch he is and she was lucky to be marrying him.She catches the train and her wedding gown gets caught and this is where she meets Ben Stephens. Ben helped her get her dress and veil free. Ben is an easy going kind of guy. Ben invites Ivy to a baseball game. When they return she finds Keith impatiently waiting for her in front of her apartment. He feels humilated that she stood him up. She explains that she doesn't really love him, but I guess he just didn't get it. He still tries to pursue her. Meanwhile, Ivy and Ben become closer. She just wanted to be his friend and he agrees. Ben knew that he was falling for Ivy spending so much time with her.Good Intentions was an easy read. Once I started, I wanted to see how it ended. Ms. Wilson-Harris put a couple surprises in this book. It made the book more intriguing and made me think, I wonder when she is going to find out about the real Keith.Ivy learned that her life was her own. She needed to do things and make decisions that made her happy. If you want a book that is kind of easy going, this is a good one."},{"Title":"Good Intentions (Arabesque)","review":"All i have to say is that i feel sorry that sweet nice Ben ended up with such a fickle and not too right in the head woman.

I found this novel to be a huge disappointment. Ivy Daniels, on her wedding day decides to not to marry, Keith, a guy she's been dating for years, as she realizes she doesn't love him and runs from the church in full wedding attire only to run into a complete stranger (Ben Stephens) she meets on the subway and then proceeds to go to baseball game with him just so she doesn't have to go home and face the music. Ivy's friendship with Ben eventually blossoms into something special in a very short period of time. After forming a relationship with Ben, Ivy discovers she's already pregnant by Keith, the guy she was going to marry and now decides in the best interest of baby she should try and work it out with Keith by attempting to tie the knot once again. Give me a break!! The biggest mistake one can make is to enter into a loveless marriage, even if a child is involved. Sure a child should be raised by two parents but by two parents who are willing to go the distance. Fortunately Ivy realizes her error and once again backs out of marrying Keith.

I wanted to give it 0 stars, because it simply doesn't deserve any. Unfortunately the author has done a poor job of trying to get this story across. EVERYTHING was too unrealistic. First, you do NOT pick up a stranger on the subway, no matter if he's white, yellow, or indigo! Second, you do NOT allow this man to climb into your apartment to open your door! Third, when this man comes back the next day, you do NOT open the door for him, you instead reach for the phone and dial 9-1-1!! I haven't even finished this book yet and I'm debating if I even should (I'm in the middle). I agree with the other reviewers who said a black, educated, female will not run out on her wedding. I understand that Ivy realized she didn't love this man anymore (hey, it happens), but to handle it in such a immature fashion is not characteristic of an educated adult. Next, a mature, educated, black, woman is not going to go to a baseball game right after this incident!! Give me a break!! And another thing, I don't get Ben? Is he black or white, on the cover he's white, but why does her ex-fiance call him &quot;light-skinned&quot;? Of course I haven't finshed the book, so maybe that issue of light-skinned vs. white is resolved. Also, I was a little bothered by Ben's comment about &quot;I'm just tryin' to help a sista out&quot;, where does he get off saying something like that?! Did anyone else feel that Ben was just a bit too pushy? I'm sorry to be tackless but...Ms. Wilson-Harris, please give it another try."},{"Title":"Good Intentions (Arabesque)","review":"Personally, I did not like the story, I thought it really did not have any substance. The female was so unsure of herself, and it almost ruined her life and someone elses. This is something that can be a problem in reality no need to make it a fantasy.

I don't think so..... that was a bit much...."},{"Title":"Good Intentions (Arabesque)","review":"I was expecting this book to be an interracial romance. I was left not knowing if it was or not.

When she realizes she cannot go through with the vows, Ivy runs from the church. The shoe is definitely on the other foot in this book. Usually, the woman is left at the altar being jilted by the groom. However, Keith was in for a shock. Keith, the business executive, who wanted to uphold his image would do anything to right his failed wedding day. However, Ivy had other intentions.After realizing that she did not love Keith enough for a lifetime commitment, Ivy thought she was doing what was best for both of them by not following through with the wedding. When she left the church, on her ride home, she stumbles on the train and into the path of Ben Stephens, a teacher and kind hearted man. Was Ben the soul mate Ivy was destined to meet? Their relationship starts off on a fast track. What was supposed to be her wedding day, turned out to be a day spent at the ball park with Ben. Was Ivy thinking clearly or did her mind become rattled from her mad dash from the church and perhaps the bumpy train ride? Whatever, this sophisticated, young woman dropped everything and went to a baseball game! Was she looking for another catch that quick after striking out Keith? This scene at the beginning was a little far-fetched.Ben seems to be a fairly decent person, but was his life destined for major changes when Ivy popped into his life. Mindful of the warnings by his mother and sisters, Ben plunges into his relationship with Ivy.Keith is deceitful and manipulative. He says he wants to marry Ivy, but what exactly is his reasons for wanting marriage? He seems possessed with Ivy, but he is also intrigued with someone else close to Ivy. When the discovery is made, Keith tries to worm his way out of the situation and act like nothing of importance happened.Several things happen in this book. Ivy runs away from the church on her wedding day into the waiting arms of a stranger. A couple of weeks later she discovers she is pregnant with Keith's child. After the baby is born and several months later, Ivy agrees to marry Keith a second time around. However, at the last minute, Ivy decides she does not love Keith enough to marry him. She goes to the church to find Keith and uncovers not only Keith, but Keith's little indiscretion. Needless to say, this does not affect Ivy and she breaks the news to Keith that she does not love him and cannot marry him. Once again, Ivy bolts from the church and runs looking for Ben, her true love and soulmate."},{"Title":"Good Intentions (Arabesque)","review":"I READ THIS BOOK WHEN IT FIRST CAN OUT.

It was unbelievable that a sista would wait until just before the wedding ceremony to run away. Weddings cost too much money for that kind of foolishness!

Trudea takes it all in stride and comes up with some great polictical and social satire."},{"Title":"Peace Out, Dawg! Tales from Ground Zero","review":"Another great book fom the best Political Cartoonist around today and also for a long time. I used to read many Comics for years,but the only one I follow these days is Doonesbury. There have been several in the past that were giants in their day My favourites were L'il Abner by Al Capp,remember the Schmoo (SocialSecurity) and Sadie Hawkin's Day;Pogo ,By Walt Kelly,and his take on Joe McCarthy; and of course Dick Tracy,by Chester Gould,when a crime meant punishment, not a social issue. My local papers no longer carry it,but thanks to the Net,I can still follow it.Capp's replacements give it the old college try,but it lacks the zing of the master. I sure hope Trudeau keeps it up;it would leave a huge gap if didn't.This book covers the very tumultuous time time from May 28,2001 to June 29 2002. What a year with 9/11,international stuff like Terrorism,Afghanastan and all,then at home with Enron. And then there's all the other Doonesbury issues like Mr.Butts,Walden College and the ever present shenanigans around White House politics;with of course Trudeau's humorous take on it all. These books are great to read a few years after the fact;and bring back wonderful memories of the past strips.Trudeau's artwork continues to amaze me. In this period his portrayal of the destruction at the WTC on 9/11 is outstanding.The only shortcoming in the book is that all the strips should have been in color. Black and white just doesn't do his artwork the justice it deserves."},{"Title":"Peace Out, Dawg! Tales from Ground Zero","review":"Your wisest move is to eyeball the first page of the book (courtesy of Amazon) and sample the inventiveness that accompany the cartoonist's forays into social analysis and world events. The topic is enslavement to the computer + the resultant generation gap penalizing hapless parents, and the 3 strips shown (out of 30 in the book) are a good springboard to his wide range. A good bulk of the collection is devoted to whacky spinoffs of the aftermath of 9/11, with plenty of side attention to president Bush's White House conferences with advisors, with Bush an unwitting court jester who needs things simplified and then patiently explained to him in semi-baby talk. We also find ourselves amidst the swirl of Afghanistan violence on the ground, with warlords changing sides multiple times & working hand in glove with the amoral, globe trotting CIA pragmatist sent from Washington. Other topics are the $500,000 artistic grant given to a \\"performance artist\\" who glues together broken crockery smeared with rancid mayonnaise and \\"makes a statement\\" about globalism and saturated fat by hurling a fire extinguisher through a MacDonald's window --- the grant money is an aid because now she can make bail in the future. There's a fun episode on hepped up CIA recuitment after 9/11 + plenty of other topics besides the aftermath of 9/11 that get the priceless Trudeau treatment.This collection is especially good and wide ranging. It isn't dated --- and won't ever be."},{"Title":"Peace Out, Dawg!

Yet that is what a modern university education in liberal arts has to offer. Having used this book in a course taken, I came away with a feeling of having learned very little and having been poisoned by much unnecessary cynicism. Ever since, I have never been able to so much as read the paper without some sense of embarrassment at being an American. Then when I would for once work as a temp in the warehouse for the company of this very website, I would see the assumptions of Marx contradicted right in front of my eyes. For as it appeared from casual conversations at breaktime, the workers having been forced by the dialectic of necessity to work long hours with their feet sore from bending, stooping, pushing carts did not wish to strike. Instead each thought, as it were, in terms of exchange of value for value, money, their careers, and climbing the corporate ladder of success, such bourgeois attitudes which even the Clintonians must appeal to in order to get votes, yet it would have disgusted Marx and Lenin would have denounced it as reformism. It is something I have wanted too, yet frustra. Then again, reading Thomas Sowell has recently given me a view of economics, and seemingly of anthropology, that is actually useful; for it has allowed me to feel like I am finally getting the well-rounded education I had missed in school. Thus I learn that the market, through the simple mechanism of price coordination as if by magic, takes care of all the gazillion emic and etic factors which the central planners couldn't possibly imagine, no matter how many fieldworkers they employ. Which must be a sore warning to all interferers and meddlers lest they should think to impose their biased values on the rest of us."},{"Title":"Examkrackers 101 Passages in MCAT Verbal Reasoning","review":"I studied this book solely for my MCAT and found it invaluable.

(Needless to say, I use this book in my course.) The writer accurately captures most aspects of the real exam, including passage length, question wording, distribution of question types, and ambiguity of the correct answers. The only major flaw that I find with this book is that some answer choices are not well supported (even taking into account the fact that the correct answers on the MCAT are supposed to be somewhat ambiguous). In some cases, there are blatant errors in the question stem or stated correct answers, or, more rarely, two equally correct answer choices. For this reason, I would rate this book 4.5 stars, but since Amazon doesn't let me do that, I will give it 5 stars. :) On the actual MCAT, the incorrect answer choices are usually a little more differentiated from the correct answer. These mistakes and imperfections are frequent enough to be a little annoying, but not abundant or major enough to topple this book off the pedestal of being the best VR preparation book out there. Kaplan's and Princeton Review's materials do not quite compare (especially Kaplan's, which contain too many explicit detail questions). Keep in mind that the questions in this book are probably going to be slightly more difficult than the real MCAT questions, which are not quite as tricky. Have fun and good luck."},{"Title":"Examkrackers 101 Passages in MCAT Verbal Reasoning","review":"I purchased this book in hopes of preparing for the Aug 04 MCAT. I had previously been studying Verbal Reasoning with Kaplan, but wished to see what another company had to offer.Pros:The book certainly as an excellent number of passages. I have yet to find another book that provides the sheer quantity of passages Examkrackers offers. The book aims for an accurate simulation of the Verbal MCAT, providing tear-away sheets for you to fill out ovals as you finish one of the eveven full length tests. The passages are from a good range of topics.Cons:The passages themselves do not contain many hard words, nor are the sentence structures as difficult they should be. I consider myself with only mediocre Verbal Reasoning skills, yet I found that in very few the passages was I confused. I feel there is a lack of abstract passages - which often appear on the MCAT.The greatest setback of the book are the explanations at the back of the book; many explanations for questions are simply direct quotes from the text, and do not provide an in depth analysis. I feel this approach does not adequate fulfill an explanation's role - if a simple quote could make me understand the reasoning, I likely would have understood the reasoning in the first place!Nonetheless, the sheer amount of practice you get from this book will provide a test-taker with a sound foundation for tackling the MCAT."},{"Title":"Examkrackers 101 Passages in MCAT Verbal Reasoning","review":"Given the usually high profiled stuff from ExamKrackers, this book was for me a disappointment. Let me just say that if you want to score high on verbal, more practice is a must, therefore it's logical to get this book. However, if you are looking for a very clean practice, this book doesn't deliver. While i recognize that verbal section on the MCAT can easily allude to personal bias and subjective opinions, on the actual MCAT the 'correct' answer should be easily justified from the 'inccorect' answers. Around a little over 2/3 of the questions in this book fit that description, everything else is full of ambiguous and unsupported answers, many passages tho interesting are abstract and difficult to read. This can get extremely frustrating if you are expecting to see concrete improvements. However, by dealing with these flaws, and sometimes overly difficult (downright impossible or simply incorrect) questions, you might still gain something that will give u an extra edge on the actual MCAT, which could be sufficently more clear and precise given that it is the verbal section."},{"Title":"Examkrackers 101 Passages in MCAT Verbal Reasoning","review":"This book has perhaps bridged the gap between me and medical school. In July I bought 101 Passages and diligently took a full length verbal section about once every three days as part of my preparation and it made the difference between medical school in the Carribean and becoming a viable candidate for some first tier U.S. medical schools. I also carefully studied Jon's advice in his Verbal Reasoning study guide and followed it religiously. It helped improve my score substantially. So why is this book so great? First, the text is identical in size and font to real thing, so you feel perfectly comfortable and familiar with the appearance of actual passages, question stems, and answers on test day. Second, the passage topics were right on the money -boring (cabinet making, charitable trust management, etc.), irrelevent to medicine, and challenging enough. Third, passage length was identical to that which you encounter on the real thing. Fourth, the answer choices are ambigious and you never really feel good about your answers -that is the essence of MCAT verbal. Dave perfectly captures that in 101 Passages. Fifth, there are 11 full length practice sections, which help you master your timing and slowly but surely improve you score. Sixth, Jon is pretty helpful on his website and will respond to most of your questions and give you that personal support that makes him kind of seem like a coach whose on your side. Lastly, there's nothing else out there that comes close to 101 Passages. Get this book to improve you verbal score. To really ace the verbal, carefully study the lectures in the thinner Examkracker's Verbal Reasoning study guide. Force yourself to adopt Jon's strategy. It will help you. If you do nothing else, remember these two points of advice: (1) finish the verbal sections no matter what you do, and (2) read for the main idea and be sure you have it in your head before you look at the questions. Jon covers that in depth in the thin Verbal Reasoning Study Guide in addition to about five or six other tips that really make the difference.

I just did Test 7-9 and saw multiple, somewhat glaring typos, lack of pronunciation, etc. in the passage, in the answer key, and in the explanations sections.The cons are that the questions are either 1) way too simplistic and can be easily deduced due to answer choices directly quoting passage, therefore not requiring an understanding of the passage, 2) don't cover the range of the types of questions asked on the MCAT (such as main idea, global questions), 3) answers are just plain wrong - for example: page 367, question 20, question asks, \\"According to the passage, Freud's theory of psychosexual development most clearly resulted in:\\" and the answer according to the book is \\"diminishing punishment for homosexual behavior\\" although the explanation says that \\"There is no implication that Freud's theory resulted in any diminishing of punishment\\" - therefore answer is blatantly wrong, and misleading, and definitely made me think I was completely blind and stupid for a little bit.Someone said it before, that if you're practicing the verbal section using this book, don't expect your scores to increase as you keep practicing because some of the questions are just wonky.

I am not sure that any mortal can read only &quot;Bright Air&quot; and really understand what Edelman is talking about.The claim that Edelman's Theory of Neuronal Group Selection (TNGS) &quot;does not appear to have the potential to really crack the problem&quot; of how a brain makes a mind is a claim that is often made without any suggestion of exactly what Edelman might have missed. These claims are like people in the 1940's saying, &quot;a rocket does not have what it takes to get to the moon.&quot; Certainly a 1940's rocket could not reach the moon, and certainly Edelman's TNGS is not a complete theory of mind, but Edelman, like von Braun, was visionary in being able to see that with future improvements, the path to the desired future was in sight. The claim that no correct materialistic theory of mind will ever be found is now nearly as impossible to defend as the claim that &quot;men will never walk on the moon&quot; would have been in 1965.Speculation about why Edelman's books so annoy and infuriate his critics: 1) Edelman has constructed an new language which he uses to describe his theory mind. He provides no glossary with definitions of his terms. This alone is a horrible tactical error that can only alienate his readers. 2) Edelman builds his theory from a foundation that is unfamiliar to most of his critics.People like Crick, Dennett, and Johnson have never read the literature of &quot;topobiology&quot; and they are also not able to conceptualize how synapse regulation rules must be integrated into the proper types of neural networks in order to allow for learning and memory. 3) Philosophers of Mind, in particular, the many who are &quot;Functionalists&quot; as well as the huge swarm of Parallel Distributed Processing connectionists are shown by Edelman to be taking an inferior approach to mind. Having your professional career side-swiped by an interloper from Biolgy is enough to enrage most philosophers and AI researchers.New species arise from subtle recombinations of mutations and their birth is a fragile process. The fundamentally correct components of Neural Edelmanism will survive the memetic selection process within the Science of Mind. In the next century Edelman will be viewed in much the same way biologists of this century now view Gregor Mendel and Charles Darwin: men who published their ideas well before science as a whole was ready."},{"Title":"Bright Air, Brilliant Fire: On The Matter Of The Mind","review":"In Bright Air, Brilliant Fire, Gerald M. Edelman accomplishes what seems to be an almost impossible task: He helps the non-scientist to understand the connections between what is known about the mind with what is beginning to be known about the brain. For Edelman, this subject \\"is the most important one imaginable\\" because it is charged \\"with the excitement of being on the threshold of knowing how we know.\\" At the outset, he poses \\"some commonsense notions\\":1. Things do not have minds.2. Normal humans have minds; some animals act as if they do.3. Beings with minds can refer to other beings or things; things without minds do not refer to beings or things.The book is divided into four main parts (Problems, Origins, Proposals, and Harmonies), concluding with \\"Mind Without Biology: A Critical Postscript\\" in which Edelman dispels the notion that the mind can be understood in the absence of biology. Stated another way (in Chapter 2), \\"There must be ways to put the mind back into nature that are concordant with how it got there in the first place.\\"Obviously, this is not a book for browsers, for grasshoppers, or for dilettantes. It makes great demands on the mind (and patience) of its reader. But consider Edelman's original objective: to explore the connections between what is known about the mind with what is beginning to be known about the brain. For him, this subject is (to reiterate) &quot;the most important one imaginable\\" because it is charged \\"with the excitement of being on the threshold of knowing how we know.\\"Is there any other knowledge of greater importance?"},{"Title":"Bright Air, Brilliant Fire: On The Matter Of The Mind","review":"Dr. Edelman has many critics, who all sound the same in their attacks on his work. First, a sly remark about his personality, his egomania, his obsession with grandeur. Then they claim that he cannot write clearly, that he obscures with his highly technical language. And then you get the usual complaint about the lack of empirical evidence, etc., etc. finally, they claim that they, even being the experts that they are, cannot understand Edelman at all. All these critisms seem convincing enough until one reads Edelman's recent book. Yes, he is highly ambitious, attempting to construct a complex theory of consciousness. But he is a clear and direct writer, who exposes the problems at every step instead of hiding them; he is modest, generously acknowledging his debts to earlier work, providing a helpful bibliography for the interested reader. As to his theory, I find it more convincing than all the theories offered by his critics. That is not to say that it's flawless. Edelman himself, in fact, explicitly says that many aspects of the theory are in need of further revision based on empirical evidence. But his work, clearly the product of a powerful and erudite mind, seems to me the best there is in this immature theoretical field. It needs criticism, but not stupid cricism, as offered by his current critics (e.g. Crick, Dennett, Johnson, etc.), who are obviously off the mark. It would be interesting to speculate why Edelman's books so annoy and infuriate them; after all, it is just another theory, why all the sound and fury when most people in the neuroscience community haven't even read the new book, or any of the previous ones. Is it dangerous--to certain people, for certain unknown reason? Now I hope that Dr. Edelman will continue his line of work, writing more enlightening books that will gradually engage the specific problems he mentioned in his previous work."},{"Title":"Bright Air, Brilliant Fire: On The Matter Of The Mind","review":"I am a huge fan of Edelman, but I regretted having bought this book; I would say this is a kind of half-successful attempt at vulgarizing what he explained so well elsewhere: there is nothing to be found here that wasn\`t already explained in more detail in &quot;Neural Darwinism&quot; and &quot;The Remembered Present&quot;. So stay away from this one if you read the others. If you never read anything by him, go for his &quot;Neural Darwinism&quot;.

There is no &quot;royal road&quot; to the truth, either in mathematics, as the old tale has it, or in philosophy and science. Ethically, you can struggle through the basics and talk about your conclusions; or you should shut up. If you have no inkling about the Theory of Neuronal Group Selection, you have no inkling about consciousness. Go back and do your homework. So Edelman's books are tough going? Did you expect to understand calculus without taking algebra? I read &quot;Neural Darwinism&quot; right after it was published, and gagged. My biology background is thin; one college course. I looked up &quot;natural selection&quot; and found Dawkins; I read all of his books and knew something about genetics. I read &quot;ND&quot; again, understanding a bit more, especially the part about &quot;ground-breaking&quot; ... When &quot;Topobiology&quot; appeared, I read it. I had to reread &quot;ND&quot; to get through it, but I began to understand the vocabulary, the ideas, the logic, the structure. Same thing with &quot;Remembered Present&quot;. At that point I was working in a university psychology department (strictly as a hardware specialist, never having had a single psychology course). I mentioned this exciting work to a few professors in developmental psych who might have been expected to look at it; none of them did. Not till 1999, when a visiting professor offered a course in &quot;Consciousness&quot; based on &quot;The Remembered Present&quot;, was there any hint that Edelman had some relevance for those researching the development of the mind. Draw your own conclusions. If you're not afraid to know the facts, if you really want to know the answers to the hard questions (What is life? Why is the universe only 4-dimensional? Where does thought come from?), dig for them; they do exist. Start with Edelman."},{"Title":"Bright Air, Brilliant Fire: On The Matter Of The Mind","review":"Having read this book roughly twice, I'm still not sure I'm up to offering a review but that may, itself, be an important comment because clarity often reflects theoretical adequacy. The book's main thesis seems to boil down to this: Brains are a product of what Edleman calls selectional events, reflecting an operational principle specific to living systems. In this he draws a distinction at the very outset between the hit or miss outcomes of evolutionary development by random selection (which produce species differentiation by changing the individual members of species over time) and the instructional development people cause to happen via algorithms (step by step procedures for getting things done, either by describing the steps needed to get things done to one another, by following such steps, or by producing those steps in computational code which can then be translated into the digitized electronic signals we think of as 0's and 1's that govern computer operations).Selection, of course, is serendipitous, whatever blueprint establishes each individual being the result of eons of trial and error in the selectional process that preceded it. Edelman takes this idea and applies it to how individual brains operate on a daily, and instant by instant, basis. Extending the idea of selection, as he has previously identified it in human immune systems (where antibodies in our bloodstreams selectively bond with invading agents, based on their \\"fit\\", and those which bond more closely out-produce those which don't, thus increasing the \\"right\\" type of antibodies in the bloodstream), Edleman suggests that the waxing and waning of the brain linkages (which, he claims, embody our mental processes) occurs in roughly the same way.This is somewhat controversial because of 1) its implications (it challenges more accepted functionalist accounts which liken brain operations to algorithms such as those a computer can perform); and because of 2) its failure to fully account for how the selecting actually alters the strengths of the linkages or how the linkages themselves give us the features we associate with consciousness (things like awareness, intentionality, understanding, etc.). And yet, given that he has so thoroughly laid out his case for this kind of biological mechanism driving brains, and that he seems to have covered the obvious operational issues as they apply to what we presently know about brains, his thesis has a certain plausiblity. But it remains highly complex and even controversial because it boils down, in the end, to a number of somewhat abstruse and not intuitively apparent claims.It's really all about memory in the end, Edelman says, though he defines this function so broadly that it's no longer recognizable as what we call memory in ourselves. Memory at its most basic level is the capacity of a self-contained, self-replicating system to retain changes and, via self-replication, to pass them on to descendent systems. Of course, \\"memory\\" also means the ability of a computational system to recover stored coded data and, in us, the ability to summon up past images, thoughts, associations, etc. Are these all the same thing? Edelman suggests they are and claims that it is the increasing systemic complexity and resultant sophistication that makes the primitive memory we find in relatively simple systems and their components (including the capacity to reproduce progeny with like \\"fits\\" as we find in immune systems) into the kinds of things we call memory in ourselves. It is this memory principle, a product of the selectionist dynamic (or perhaps the reason that selection manages to occur?) that, on his view, is the foundation of the kinds of features we recognize as consciousness in ourselves.Alas, Edelman's thesis is anything but simple (which I'm guessing, is already apparent from my efforts here). In the end it seems to amount to the claim that brains, being organic and the result of the previously described selectional processes, are uniquely complex in structure and operation in the universe, each uniquely differentiated from all other brains (because even twins' brains, constructed on a shared blueprint, will have changed in their lifetimes in ways unique to each individual). It is this complexity of structure, this \\"morphology\\", he tells us, that is responsible for the things brains do. Consciousness, he argues, is built on levels of operation in the brain and primary or animal level consciousness (which itself has levels) forms the necessary foundation for higher level consciousness in which self-awareness and self-reflexiveness become possible. These levels are only possible because of the intrinsic complexity of brain morphology.Edelman lays out a picture of how the different parts of the brain are responsible for different features and notes how many of the features we treat as unitary in ourselves (e.g., memory, perception, conception, etc.) may be best understood, upon reflection, to really be the result of the elaborate collaboration, through cross brain linking of neuronal groups in different brain centers responsible for different things. These combine to produce the various constituent operations that, when further joined through what he calls \\"reentrant loops\\", become the features we recognize in ourselves like awareness, understanding, remembering, intentionality, conceptualizing, believing, etc. He calls his model of how brains work, built on all of this, the Theory of Neuronal Group Selection (TNGS), because, he explains, different neuronal groups (not individual neurons) must operate together through the cross-brain linkages already mentioned to produce each instance of consciousness in ourselves. Such instances are thus complex occurrences and not the simple unified phenomena they appear to be on introspection.Human memory, for instance, he describes as a complex phenomenon that differs from the relatively simple memory function which computers rely on. What we recognize as memory in ourselves is never exact, he points out, because it consists of a bunch of different linked constituent elements running in parallel and impinging on one another, albeit never exactly in the same way, each time a remembered item is summoned up. Unlike computational memory, which involves the exact replication of a coded instruction in each instance (a failure of this level of precision being a failure of the computational memory function), human memory is seen to be rough, approximate and ever-changing (think Roshomon or the related phenomenon of \\"false memory\\" as described by modern psychology). This feature of our memory happens because remembering in us is a function of a complex reconstruction process that depends on the relative strengths and linkages of the connecting loops between the implicated neuronal groups. As such this makes creativity and metaphor possible but it also means that each instance of recall introduces changes through new associations.It's because of his claim that brains are uniquely complex (more like a jungle than a powerplant as he puts it) that he insists that computationalism, the thesis that consciousness can be replicated on computers, is unsound. We need brains he says, because consciousness is a biological product requiring the complex morphology and historical development, reflecting selection, that only organic systems can achieve. On this last point, though, I think he may well be mistaken.Edelman often uses \\"consciousness\\" in a relatively unsophisticated way and seems to be under the impression that computations, as performed by computers, are purely abstract without, as John Searle (whom he cites) puts it, causal efficacy in the world. In fact, computers are as physically instantiated as brains and computational processes on computers as physical as they must be in human brains. But his answer as to whether a computer can be conscious does not stop with this claim about the abstract nature of computational processes. He makes the further point that computers, running on logic, are instructionally based whereas our brains, running on \\"selection\\", are not. In this he seems to disregard the notion that selection in evolution itself provides its own set of instructions (our genomes), even if they're not conceived in advance by any mind. Similarly he seems to overlook the obvious fact that the genetic mechanism, itself, appears to be a form of information processing just as computations in computers are (though genetic information processing may, in fact, be more complex).Moreover, if what constitutes consciousness in us is a range of features which occur together (awareness, intentionality, understanding, perception, conception, etc.), then the real question is not whether brains and computers can accomplish the production of these features in the same way but whether they can both achieve the same functional output at all. If computers can produce the features we associate with consciousness, how they do it is likely to be less important than that they can and his argument that computers can never be expected to do what brains do would be wrong.Nevertheless, he has offered a very compelling picture of the incredible complexity that confronts us (especially if you're a computationalist) in endeavoring to achieve the goal of creating synthetic minds. For Edelman, everything hinges on his argument for uniqueness and complexity, which he derives from the principle of selection that, he tells us, is unique to self-contained, self-perpetuating systems like living things. Computers, on the other hand, are pre-set operational functions (\\"syntactical\\" systems, again echoing another of Searle's famous criticisms) which are guided by an outside mind (the programmer) and therefore unable to react to an open-ended world of unpredictable and ever changing inputs. But in claiming this, he presumes that computers lack the ability to be open-ended because they are programmed though this is by no means clear -- or likely to be any truer than his related claim that consciously programmed computational machines are qualitatively different from organic machines that have evolved over eons as a result of a selectional mechanism. After all, does it really matter where the programming comes from, as long as there's programming there?Edelman's underlying position is that the genetic programming of evolutionary selection leads to an open-ended tangle of unpredicted, and unpredictable, synaptic connections -- and their more macro neuronal group links which strengthen and weaken according to their ongoing interaction with external stimuli. It is this waxing and waning of the neuronal group pathways between the different brain centers and their sub-parts that gives rise to the facets of consciousness on his view -- an activity that is nothing like the computational processing of machines as found on computers.Yet, in this he seems to be disregarding the fact that computational programs can also involve multiple sub-systems doing different, interrelated things, and that such systems can be designed to implement open-ended reactions to an unpredicted world of stimuli once basic parameters are set. Such parameters need be no more obtrusive than our own evolution-driven genetic codes, after all.Edelman's thesis is worth thinking about and may well offer some interesting directions for understanding how brains work and for developing new thinking machines that may depart from the standard computational model we rely on today (the universal Turing machine). Unfortunately Edelman's writing is not up to the level of the ideas presented (on my view). It may be the case that the complexity of Edelman's thesis would not admit of any more succinct or precisely written text than he has provided but, in spite of my own difficulties here in explicating his ideas, I rather think he could have (and should have) been clearer. Certainly his failure to be clear is at least a prima facie reason to question the potency of the underlying ideas.SWM"},{"Title":"Bright Air, Brilliant Fire: On The Matter Of The Mind","review":"More than a quarter of a century ago, Edelman was distinguished with a Nobel Price for his research on the immunity system. Later he switched to neurology. He sees a parallel between the way the immunity system is programmed and the way the brain is programmed. These procedures have much in common with Darwins process of evolution by way of natural selection. Edelman speaks of &quot;neural Darwinism&quot;.When you just think about it, after reading the arguments Edelman brings forward, you will see that evolution could hardly have produced something as complex as the human brain (or even more simple animal brains) by any other means. A lot has to be investigated yet, of course, but I think Edelman has shown the way to a deeper understanding of our brain.It is a pity Edelman and Daniel Dennet get along so badly. Edelman never mentions Dennet, and Dennet is extremely critical in the few remarks he makes about Edelmans work. I think their approaches are complementary, not contradictory.Yes, the human brain is a computer of sorts. Edelman has the clearest ideas about the structure of this computer, but he denies that the metaphor of the computer is valid. I think that, even taking Edelmans ideas about the deeper structure in account, the metaphor remains valid, up to a point at least. Really, Edelman has much more in common with Dennet (whom he seems to despise) than with the &quot;mysterian&quot; Searle, whom he praises."},{"Title":"Bright Air, Brilliant Fire: On The Matter Of The Mind","review":"Edelman's detailed reasoning may be beyond the abilities of a layperson to follow, but his concepts are clear and logically sequenced. Single cells communicate internally by diffusion, multi-celled organisms need specialist linking cells from one remote part to another because diffusion through successsive cell walls is too slow. Hence the beginning of a neural net. Evolutionary pressure gives a benefit from storing records of responses to stimuli in a specialist area of this net, access in due course to these records give Primary Consciousness. As a consequence of homo sapiens' upright gait, a unique construction over the windpipe to prevent food falling into the lungs coincidentally allows a far greater range of noises to be made in response to stimuli - enough different noises for a very fine degree of specialisation. Not merely &quot;woof woof&quot; = danger but &quot;tree falling&quot; = specific danger. A data store of the words associated with the responses permits them to be called up separately from the occurrences that crteated them - hence an ability to imagine and plan with Higher Consciousness. An interesting idea associated with this developmental scheme is that many animals (up to, say, lobsters) may have no consciousness at all and are merely machines. Better minds than mine may say that Edelman's details do not stand up to rigorous examination, but the concepts form the most persuasive explanation of consciousness that this reader has come across."},{"Title":"Bright Air, Brilliant Fire: On The Matter Of The Mind","review":"Wow. Obviously we've emerged from the dark ages into the light and....wait, Plato already made this analogy. Anyway, its always edifying to see people, anyone, confirm in print what we all already know but are afraid, for political reasons I guess, to utter. It's a material world. Edelman takes off on this theme and proceeds to deliver the underlying neural blueprints for ego, soul, cognition, and a host of other mystical magical metaphysics, minus the meta. Edelman makes some gratuitous forays into philosophy in this book, but by and large sticks to the point and discusses his work on axonal feedback/forward pathways and TNGS; the theory of neuronal group selection, an evolutionary take on neurobiology. It's always nice, in my view, when researchers deign to wtite these pop-sci books to share with us plebes what we could never encounter in our own pedestrian lives. I can't really evaluate if this is a &quot;good&quot; piece of literature, but anyone remotely interested in who and what they and the people they know are simply must devour evey morsel of this neurophysiology primer."},{"Title":"Bright Air, Brilliant Fire: On The Matter Of The Mind","review":"I didn't know Edelman and his books till last year.I had to write a thesis for my degree and i only was looking for ideas related to IA and cognitive processes.

Its a must for all people searching new kind of theories , both in philisophics both in neuroscience field."},{"Title":"Bright Air, Brilliant Fire: On The Matter Of The Mind","review":"Edelman is absolutely right to approach the problems of consciousness in the manner he does. Consciousness is a biological phenomena which can only be understood in terms of it's biological, evolutionary, and developmental context. The compleation of Darwin's Program is a must if consciousness is to be integrated into the larger body of scientific knowledge that is biology. While the Theory of Neuronal Group Selection is only in it's tenative stages, the approach has shown a light on the path that may ultimately lead to a comprehensible theory that is consistent with the rest of the sciences. Gerald Edelman will be to future generations of neuroscientists and lay-persons alike what Charles Darwin is to us today."},{"Title":"Bright Air, Brilliant Fire: On The Matter Of The Mind","review":"This is a very important book.It proves convincingly that consciousness is a matter of ... matter (the biological matter of the brain) and that it is the outcome of a long history of biological adaptations.It also proves that the mind is not a computer or a Turing machine, that human language is not a computer language and that physics is not sufficient to explain its working. The morphology of the brain goes deep, but not as deep as to attain the quantum level.On the contrary, Edelman explains clearly that the mind is a process that operates in a 4 dimensional world; that it doesn't have a perfect memory or doesn't order events or objects logically. It is subject to mutation in order to select and to adapt and creates itself aspects of the reality by cultural and language interaction. Into the bargain, the biological structure of the brain is different for every individual.Edelman's theory has also far reaching philosophical implications. It is the death of essentialism (there are no 'essences', only populations with different individuals) and of idealism (the world was there before the mind).Is Edelman's TNGS (theory of neural group selection) the end of the story? Absolutely not. It is only the beginning. It forms the basis for further investigations. But it clearly indicates which way to follow and which ways not.I have only one reservation: Edelman's nearly unconditional admiration for Freud.This is an essential read."},{"Title":"Bright Air, Brilliant Fire: On The Matter Of The Mind","review":"This book is my introduction to Dr. Edelman, and I was stunned. Yes, I understand that this is a synopsis of his overall trilogy, and I am thankful for that. Now I can go to those volumes to dig deeper, if I don't move on to more recent works. I read this as a result of a recommendation in response to someone reviewing Steven Pinker's How the Mind Works (see my review of of that, if they'll print it). Edelman is clear, concise, and informative (and I like his wry humor). He shows all the marks of a great teacher, especially by patiently walking us through the tough neurologic stuff. I call this review Brilliantly Sobering because, once I had absorbed and understood his Theory of Neuronal Group Selection, the whole thought process business (and evolutionary and developmental progression of same) made sense for a change (unlike with Pinker's lame computational analog), and that actually startled me into thinking about HOW I think (and then, as a result, how I act -- what a change of pace for a student of Buddhism). Like I said, sobering. So next thing I did was pick up a copy of The Symbolic Quest: Basic Concepts of Analytical Psychology by Edward C. Whitmont (highly recommended) to help figure out WHY I think the way I think. Anyway, thank you, Dr. Edelman, I look forward to following you to where you've gone next. Meanwhile, I think I think I'll have a beer."},{"Title":"Bright Air, Brilliant Fire: On The Matter Of The Mind","review":"Nobel laureate Edelman describes the biological substrate for the human mind that accounts for its range, adaptability, and imaginative character while advancing a scientific theory of the highest order.

So I confess- I bought this book with high hopes. The authors are the leaders of Proverbs 31 ministries- a nation-wide ministry to women.First the positive- Jaynes and Terkeurst discuss seven principles for women to organize their lives around. In summary, these principles are:1) Your faith2) Your marriage3) Your children4) Your home5) Your resources (time, money)6) Your friends7) Your ministryI found these to be a very easy non-stressful way to think about the various areas of my life. Frankly, as 21st century women, we have so many competing priorities in our lives! I think they've provided a helpful framework for us to help prioritize what is truly important in our lives.The drawbacks to this book is that1) the authors really do not delve deeply into Scripture. A lot of their reasoning is based on personal experience and anecdotes. These can be helpful examples- but personally I would have liked to see the authors explain biblically why each of these principles is important and is a mark of a godly women.2) Sometimes I left a section of the book without a clear understanding as to how I could make these principles work in my life. For example, in the section on making God our number one priority, the authors gave a short acrostic about setting apart time with God, but really left things at that. There was no explaination about how to set up a quiet time, how to read your Bible, or pray.3) I thought one area that was lacking is that really, the Proverbs 31 woman would also take care of herself. Chapters on exercise or diet would have been beneficial.All in all, the authors have a good message. This book is a good starting point for those who want to pursue being a woman of excellence. I would recommend following up on each of these principles by reading various books in those arenas for further study.Other recommended authors on this topic: Elizabeth George, Cynthia Heald, Carolyn Mahaney, Pat Ennis, Elaine Getz, Martha Peace, Barbara Hughes, Anne Ortlund, Susan Hunt, Nancy Leigh DeMoss"},{"Title":"A Woman's Secret to a Balanced Life: Finding God's Refreshing Priorities for You","review":"&#65279;A Woman's Secret to a Balanced Life is a wellspring of practical, powerful, and pertinent Biblical counsel about what it means to be a godly woman.

Hinson approaches spiritual formation from the very best sense of classic Christian praxis and the academe. His passion and energy communicate throughout the narrative. I'd call it &quot;cutting edge&quot; but Hinson stays within the great and forgotten traditions of the church universal.Perhaps most telling is the way in which Hinson illustrates spiritual practices by writing of his own experience. For example, in writing about keeping a spiritual journal Hinson excerpts from his journal two very different responses as they illumine his spiritual journey: the first entry concerns the horror and revulsion experienced in a visit to Auschwitz and the questions concerning suffering and God; the second entry concerns an ecumenical gathering in Jerusalem. Throughout the book, Hinson weaves praxis and theory, offering the best kind of spiritual teaching.His work is gentle. His teaching is kind. This book is a treasure for any who would lead the church."},{"Title":"Spiritual Preparation for Christian Leadership","review":"Many Christian Leaders, lay or ordained, professional or volunteer, want to enrich their Spiritual Lives, but do not know how. They read books and attend seminars, but are still hungering for a complete answer to their questions, whether formulated or still lingering at the unconscious level. E. Glenn Hinson's new book \\" Spiritual Preparation for Christian Leadership\\" seems to have satisfied this void. In his usual simple but very profound style, Hinson faces Christian Leadership's main problem squarely in the eye: a problem of leadership burnout, a spiritual exhaustion due to a very stressful vocation, and extremely high expectations imposed on them as well as by them. His miracle remedy: Be attentive to God, develop a relationship with God, and learn to know God, not just about God. An encompassing view of Church History teaches us how the Church has previously dealt with this issue. Hinson then goes on to the issue of misuse, under-use and over-use of time and the need for collectedness in order to maintain a balance of experiential, intellectual, social, and institutional elements. Hinson insists on the dire need to be sustained spiritually because \\"by not paying enough attention to self-care, you may become a casualty of wounds self-inflicted from your dedication\\". The first step towards the sustenance of spiritual life is made by being accountable of its progress. He explains the many rewards of keeping a journal. He devotes three chapters to the sustenance of the spiritual life per se. One explains the sustenance through \`spiritual reading, listening and seeing'. Grace, he explains, is much more than the traditional Protestant view of unmerited favor. It is \\"God's gift of Godself, God's presence, the Holy Spirit\\" which first can be found in the Scriptures but also in various Spiritual classics, which he lists. Grace can also be found through the mediums using \`seeing' such as art, architecture and contemporary movies, or in mediums using \`touching, tasting and smelling'. Another sustaining option is retreats of which he describes the various possibilities, as well as a retreat plan he himself practices. The last offered sustenance method is through spiritual friendship, or the sharing of one's journey. His concluding chapter states that what the world and the church need most are Saints: Those \`persons whose lives have been irradiated by Grace'.

First Year. So, my needs are quite specific at this stage: I want a book which will give me very practical ways to develop a structure for what will one day perhaps culminate in a tome called my PHD.The problem with this book is that it does not have much ambition. It is perhaps useful for STUDENTS OF SCIENCE beginning the Masters . First year; in other words fresh out of college.I give it a very low rating because it offers one diagram about how to develop a graduate research structure; this diagram is then referred to in every chapter ad nauseum as if it was actually going to help the perplexed student in some way. The diagram is so basic that it made me wonder if I had drawn it-- in college. The diagram was useful to the extent that it told me things I already knew about developing a structure.So, for those still reading: This book is not really meant for students who have tuned in to Amazon.com for the purpose of finding a GRADUATE level research GUIDEBOOK which is meant to help the researcher build a structure.It doesn't ask the right questions to help the researcher ask the right questions.Not worth the time spent rubbing your hands in anticipation for the book to land in your mailbox.Signed with a great deal of first year jitters, A Squid in Tokyo"},{"Title":"Rain Catchment and Water Supply in Rural Africa: A Manual","review":"A very well written handbook for simple solutions to rain catchment, water storage, water filtration, etc in rural areas.

Late 19th-century Chicago blusters and glimmers, and we know that it was a very different time than the one we live in. Roles and types abound in Dreiser's world; a nice place to visit, no doubt, but who would want to live in it?"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"Somewhere in the depths of time a critic once labeled playwright Eugene O'Neill a genius with no talent. It's a description that could just as easily fit Theodore Dreiser, an uneducated, mercurial man who, while still in his twenties, and with virtually no experience composing fiction, managed to crank out what I consider one of the greatest novels in American literature. Very few authors have ever managed to generate the raw power that Dreiser does over the 500 or so pages of &quot;Sister Carrie.&quot; It is amazing how much of the human experience he has put into this book, how well he understands the hopes, fears, and desires--mysterious and contradictory as they often are--that drive ordinary people.The conventional judgment on Dreiser puts him in the naturalistic, social-realist tradition of Zola and Hardy. There is much in this; but I think his real strength lies in depicting character--Carrie, Hurstwood, and Drouet really come alive in these pages. His characters possess a depth and complexity of feeling that one rarely finds in fiction. Dreiser has a melancholy, fatalistic sense that the world may be too vast and impersonal for people to live in it comfortably, and yet his world is vibrantly human as well.I personally find Carrie a more likable heroine (if you could call her that) than many readers have. She is self-absorbed, yes, but also capable of compassion for others, and she is never intentionally cruel. Like all of Dreiser's characters she is somewhere between the angels and the devils.This is by no means a perfect book. Dreiser's rhetorical flourishes can become absolutely ridiculous, and so can his habit of injecting philosophical commentary into the texture of the narrative. But the total effect of &quot;Sister Carrie&quot; is powerful, and more than compensates for any defects in the novel."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"It is no mystery why Frank Norris praised to high heaven Theodore Dreiser's 1900 novel \\"Sister Carrie.\\" Norris, one of America's great naturalist writers, saw in Dreiser's tale about a young woman on the make a reflection of the same bleak vistas he wrote about in \\"Vandover and the Brute,\\" \\"The Octopus,\\" and \\"McTeague.\\" When Dreiser submitted his book for publication, it was Norris who read the book and made a glowing recommendation to the publisher. There were immense problems with \\"Sister Carrie\\" from that point forward: the wife of the publisher hated the story and worked hard behind the scenes to prevent its release. With a contract already signed, Dreiser's book did become a reality but the publishing house refused to support it with any marketing. The story languished for years in a paper limbo before finally emerging to great success and acclaim. Thank goodness it did because this may be one of the most powerful books ever written about social climbing and the perils of bad morals. Dreiser went on to publish more novels (American Tragedy, The Financier) before dropping out of the literary scene and converting to communism before his death in 1945.\\"Sister Carrie\\" doesn't promise much at the beginning. In fact, this is yet another story about a rural person arriving in the big city seeking fame and fortune. In this case, it is Carrie Meeber, a young woman moving to Chicago to live with her sister and her husband while she tries to find work. Carrie quickly discovers big city life is tough; her sister's home life bores her to death, the work she finds in a shoe factory is pure drudgery, and she doesn't have enough money to buy decent clothes because she has to pay her sister four dollars a week for rent. Carrie hates her base co-workers and spends most of her free time watching people pass on the street outside of her sister's apartment. When Carrie loses her job after an illness, it looks like she will have to return home to Columbia City and forget about her dreams in Chicago.Enter George Drouet, a semi-successful salesman with a voracious appetite for the ladies. George finagled Carrie's address when he met her on the train into Chicago, and now the two meet again by chance. The results of this meeting shape the rest of the book. Carrie abandons her sister's lodgings and becomes \\"kept\\" by George. It is during this period that Carrie meets George Hurstwood, the wealthy manager of a fancy Chicago tavern and friend of Drouet. Through a series of misunderstandings about the marriage status of Carrie and Hurstwood, and serious lapses in moral judgments, Hurstwood and Carrie move on to bigger and better things in New York City.It is at this point that Norris must have began enthusing, for Dreiser embarks on a harrowing tour through the destruction of a human being's body and soul. Just when you think a person could sink no lower, Dreiser yanks you back to reality and illustrates for you just how bad things can get before the inevitable occurs. When the author contrasts the utter humiliation of one character with the elevation in status of another, the tension becomes too much to bear. This novel is painful to read, but at the same time it is so riveting it is nearly impossible to put it down. We've all seen or known people who suffered the fates revealed in this story, or at least I have, and that makes it even more chillingly realistic. How Dreiser managed to capture the feel of his characters' lives is a mystery, but that is what makes this book great literature; it is timeless in its examination of the inner workings of the human soul.\\"Sister Carrie\\" is classic literature, but that does not mean there are not problems with the story. Dreiser's prose takes some getting used to before it starts to flow. In fact, this may be the best book I have ever read where the prose is often mediocre. I told one person that the author's style reminded me of an intoxicated welder, and I still believe that to be the case for most of the book. Dreiser has a tendency to jam his sentences together into an unwieldy mix of clauses and commas. After a few hundred pages this hardly seems to matter but it could provide a reason for someone just starting the book to quit reading it. Do not quit, however, because the story ends up being so good that the stylistic problems quickly fade into insignificance.Another difficulty involves the middle portion of the story, when Carrie, Drouet, and Hurstwood vie for position with each other. These chapters appreciably drag while providing no clues about the goldmine that soon follows. Looking at the story as a whole, I understand now why these chapters were necessary but I didn't while I was reading them. Again, do not give up too soon lest you miss out on the extraordinary buildup to the soul shattering conclusion.Ultimately, the messages conveyed by Dreiser outweigh the dual problems of prose and a few plodding chapters. The scandalous behavior the author wrote about angered many during his time because people believed that divorce, infidelity, loose morals, and social positioning were things better talked about privately than brought out in the open. The fact that Dreiser wrote such things without delivering a blistering rebuke about such behaviors also stunned society. Perhaps it is not too far off to say that Theodore Dreiser was the Jerry Springer of his generation, merely revealing things that everyone knew happened behind closed doors. Whatever the case may be, \\"Sister Carrie\\" is sheer brilliance. I was so fired up after reading this book that I went right out and got \\"American Tragedy.\\" I now understand why Frank Norris went into paroxysms of delight about Dreiser's book."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"This edition, which was prepared by volunteers, contains numerous errors, dropped words and punctuations, misspellings, wrong tenses, etc. It was so annoying to read that I purchased the Modern Library edition ($3.50) after about 75 pages.

The quality great!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"Living an average middle-class life, I have always wondered how the very rich and the very poor get where they are. Sister Carrie is a beautifully written and fascinating tale of how one climbs and descends the social ladder of life. I am aware that some readers have criticized this book stating that Dreiser did not develop the characters very well and that Carrie was not very likeable. Well, it is my thought that Dreiser never intended for us to become solely wrapped within the characters. He meant for us to become enveloped in the circumstance. The two main characters, Carrie and Hurstwood, are truly victims of circumstance - Carrie's never-ending unhappiness and Hurstwood's downward spiral. As we go through life, there are so many events and choices that will guide our lives to what they are. When one stops and thinks about this, it is really quite fascinating. I believe Dreiser r was aware of this aspect of life and he wanted to write a novel that would effect the lives of everyone who reads it. I read the entire book in 3 days. I simply could not put it down. I recommend Sister Carrie to everyone. It will leave you thinking and thinking and thinking."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"The constant typos in this edition ruin Dreiser's literary style. I got what I paid for."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"I sometimes fear that novels heralded as &quot;classics&quot; may have been great in their time, but no longer have as much wallop. That was my prejudice approaching &quot;Sister Carrie.&quot; I'd read &quot;An American Tragedy&quot; years ago and was impressed, though not as much as I'd been led to believe. Thus, I wondered whether Dreiser's &quot;second most famous&quot; novel would be worth the effort. It was. Although firmly set in its time, it is not dated, and the book moves briskly from start to finish. The characters are well drawn, and I found myself drawn into their stories and the choices they made, with the consequences laid out as the novel progresses. Dreiser manages to convey the gritty reality of living in Chicago and New York at the turn of the last century, with the contrasts between wealth and poverty so pronounced. His attention to detail makes the scenes come alive, and he tells the story without being didactic or preachy. For example, there is an episode involving a streetcar strike, which the author tells in a way that makes clear his own political views, yet those views are not crammed down the reader's throat.This one is worth the effort."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"As I have aged, and become aware of the time left in life, I have returned to reading classic books that I read in high school, or overlooked for popular fiction works of today. And am I glad I did. When in high school, we read Dreiser's American Tragedy, and I remember being one of the few who loved it. I felt it reached me as a teenager as no other book ever had, and to this day it is one of my few favorite books of all time (then again I love American Romantic Period paintings, and not many people I know do, so maybe it's just my taste). Anyway, Sister Carrie is new to me, and I love it. Of all the books that explain women's true feelings that I have read, this is one of the best. I think it still holds true for many women...circumstances may be different, but the feelings remain the same. If you want to understand the woman in your life, study Carrie. And the path of the male character is astoundingly real, even today. It is a thoughtful book that warrants everyone's attention. And added benefit...the language is beautiful. Writers from our past used words in ways to describe the world that I have rarely read in modern times...you can feel the wind through the trees, sense the depression of winter days, understand the inner feelings of characters far better than much put into books today provides. I have read far too many books today in which action takes precedence over character. Read Dreiser, or Dickens, or Hardy, or Austen and then try a modern book..its shocking how little the new books can hold you after the experience. SISTER CARRIE is worth your time."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"I just finished reading the book \\"Sister Carrie\\" by Theodore Dreiser (1900). This book was a good, easy read and is strangely still current, even though it was written over a hundred years ago. With the economy the way it is it seems that not much has changed, except perhaps the value of money. Carrie's desire to be in the city, as well as her experiences with men who claim they love her are realistic, modern and honest. I recommend this book to people interested in realistic fiction and coming of age stories; also to people who like reading stories about the mid-west-- Carrie is from Wisconsin and moves to Chicago, then travels to New York City by way of Detroit."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"My mother told me to read this book about ten years ago when I was the same age as Carrie. I rarely listened to her, (I do now, always listen to your mother!) so she read me the first few lines, and I had to pick it up: something about a girl of eighteen and how she might fare alone in nineteenth century Chicago intrigued me. There was a hint that she might go bad! So of course I had to pick it up. Besides, I'll read almost anything, which you can see from my various reviews. I found I couldn't put it down.This is a great melodrama about a harsh and sprawling metropolis at the turn of the century, and like Dreiser's other work, it's also a story of the viciousness Darwinian nature of capitalism. In this case, he looks at the story through the eyes of a pretty young woman who comes to the city by herself-young Carrie, called \\"sister Carrie\\" in homey fashion by her rural family, to show the sweet origins of what ultimately becomes a not-so-respectable woman.Carrie, trying to become an \\"actress\\", relies on sexuality to survive. It's suggested that she doesn't have much of a choice, and that everyone is for sale in the city. Preyed on by more sophisticated men, she ultimately becomes successful in her own right. This leaves us with a sort of confusion-we've grown to symapthize with Carrie and understand her behavior is a survival mechanism, but she is also callous and begins to change from victim to conniver. At the end, we aren't sure whether to cheer her triumph, or feel bad for those she's left in her wake.Another entertaning, great Dreiser story that will teach you about American urban history, not to mention keep you turning the pages in great suspense as to what will become of lovely young Carrie. Thanks, Mom!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"\\"Sister Carrie\\" by Theodore Dreiser was too scandalous in 1900 when it was originally published in a somewhat pared down version. Since then, Dreiser's original story has been restored and is hardly as scandalous by today's standards. It is a landmark work of naturalism, showing the rise of characters from poverty and the fall of the rich into despair due to egotistical decision making.Oddly enough, the title does not do the book justice, for the book is not solely about Carrie Meeber, a young woman from Wisconsin who hopes for a better life in Chicago. After securing factory work, she soon finds herself a kept woman, the mistress of Charles Drouet, a traveling salesman who routinely ingratiates himself with pretty women. While Carrie has more than she ever hoped for, she constantly yearns for greater things. When Drouet introduces her to his friend George Hurstwood, Hurstwood becomes obsessed with winning Carrie over. He is successful in his venture but not without injuring her through deceit and forever changing the course his life will follow. The rest of the novel is devoted to the hardships that Carrie and Hurstwood face when they move to New York and how the tide of fortunes change for both of them.Dreiser's story goes on far longer than it needs to, due to his moralizing strands inserted in an effort to pacify the more scandalous elements of his prose - an unmarried man and woman living together, shocking indeed for its time. Yet by the time the initial crisis of Carrie choosing between the two men arrives, it feels as if all of the story has been told. The middle section of the novel drags and while it is an easy read, it is not easy to keep reading. The reader will care little about Carrie or the two men in her life. She is vapid and two-dimensional, driven by lust for wealth and fame, while the men are just as empty-headed and egotistical, conscious only of what a beautiful woman will do for their own ego.Dreiser managed to capture a lot of history in his novel, from Chicago's World Fair to strikes in the poor sections of New York City. He truly shows how environment determines one's fate and how it could be possible for one to rise above their station but not consider themselves happy or successful."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"There's nothing like good ol' American literature that you can just sink your teeth into. A brilliant illustration of a period in history with characters and situations that not only give meaning to today, but also embody a dark period in American History (the Gilded Age of Robber Barons and sweatshops). Carrie becomes the toy of two men, whom she eventually uses as her stepping stones out of the sweatshop and onto the stage and a life of ease and rich trinkets. The world of poverty and the \\"walled city\\" of riches are portrayed as symbols of the breakdown and failure of the American Dream for the first time in American history. Driesler's novel is no moral tale, but a naturalistic, amoral illustration of American lives. Brilliant novel, wonderful prose, introspective into fascinating and realistic characters against a desperate, tragic, urban landscape of the end of the 19th Century."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"The narrator who reads this book uses very little inflection and has an irritating voice to boot. Being an auditory learner, I prefer to listen to books over reading the words; this reader makes it almost painful. Since the material itself is far from scintillating, the reader could make up the difference with a good reading with lots of inflection and characterization, but she doesn't. Blah!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"\\"Sister Carrie\\", to begin with, is written in a most curious fashion. Theodore Dreiser, an author I'd never heard of before, writes in a very interesting and distinct style. Some would probably feel frustrated with it, as well as his rather blunt way of writing, but it's rather different and certainly good.A story of a girl's slow and steady rise, \\"Sister Carrie\\" will capture readers first with its intrigue. Obviously, the idea of young Carrie whisked away to the city and within moments as a wealthier man's \\"wife\\", will have raised a few eyebrows. The way her life progresses is interesting too, from extremely low, to good, to almost better off, to bad, to better, and then finally to excellent. Her personality, though relatively static, is curious to follow as well. At first, as a meek, shy, pretty girl, she gives off the very image of chastity. At the end, she is a strong, independent woman. The change is slow, and yet Carrie does not ultimately change all that much.Above all, though, it's a great read. It's written in such a way that's easy to read, and though there are the usual dry spots of an early 20th century novel, it reads well. Characters are impressive in their realistic qualities - their weaknesses, their faults, their virtues and their beliefs. The story progresses smoothly and will keep the reader hooked.A great read, cool writing, and a curious story. All in all, a pretty awesome book. I wish I'd found it sooner. Recommended!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"Here is a snapshot, written by a journalist, of Chicago and New York of 110 years ago. Dreiser had never read American \\"naturalist\\" novels before he wrote this one, but had been heavily influenced by his newspaper reporting and by Balzac. What we have here is social and political messages delivered in the context of the life of a young, idealistic woman who comes to Chicago to escape the boredom of a small town and to make her way in the world. I'm reminded of the book Devil in the White City and how it emphasizes all the young women who flocked to Chicago in the 1880s and 1890s, in awe of that booming city's majesty and bustle and life. What Carrie finds, however, is utter indifference and misery until a man sets her up in a \\"love nest.\\" What a scandal! This story was controversial in its day and portions of the original manuscript were cut in order to prevent an even bigger outcry. Soon Carrie grows weary of her lover and is taken with the true tragic figure in this story, a successful married man named Hurstwood. Hurstwood falls in love with Carrie and blows his whole life up for that love. All of this is based on the true story of Dreiser's own sister, but Dreiser has embellished this squalid little tale to give us the demise of a man in minute and realistic detail, all the while commenting on the meaning of success, material well being, and what happiness is all about. This would all be trite if it weren't framed in journalistic realism. Carrie ends up a smashing \\"success\\" in the theater, but never finds true contentment, nor do any of the main characters. Question: What is the good life? Answer: It comes from internal sources, not external materialistic ones. But money, nevertheless, helps along the way to provide the leisure time to even contemplate this question.Dreiser gives us an excellent portrait of what women's choices were at the turn of the nineteenth century. Without looks, talent, or extraordinary intellect, women were out of luck. Even with such assets, women depended entirely on men for their financial well being. Dreiser makes this crystal clear in this work, which was way ahead of its time.The corrosive depression that Hurstwood suffers in the last third of this work is haunting, but the scenes of old New York hark to today's downtown New York, south of 34th Street, where you can still see the buildings Dreiser describes as well as the hard-luck homeless in the streets.This is a unique American novel, not to be missed."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"Wow! My family book club read Sister Carrie immediately after finishing a book about another Carrie -- Carol Kennicott of Main Street. What a great pair of books to read together.I found Sister Carrie to be even more readable than Main Street. To me, this book read much like a soap opera. The girl who \\"works\\" her way from rags to riches, the tormented (or tormenting?) men she leaves behind.This is a GREAT book for discussion, because we found that what we thought about these characters changed with each chapter. We also spent some time trying to figure out what the chapter titles. The \\"tinder box\\" theme was especially delicious.Sister Carrie was the type of book that you have a hard time putting down. What will happen next? Our group predicted and changed our minds a hundred times.I think this novel about a young woman's venture from country life into the city and all of the people she affects is definitely one most anyone would enjoy. I especially recommend reading it in comparison to Main Street, in which the opposite happens - a girl moves from Minneapolis to rural Minnesota.Also like Main Street, Dreiser uses personal experiences in Sister Carrie. In fact, the introduction by Richard Lingeman in the Signet edition was especially interesting to me. I recommend reading it after you've read Sister Carrie. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"This book is an interesting commentary on class relations at the beginning of the 20th century. Having been written at the time, I never got the impression that the author was stretching to capture the ethos of the period. The story of a girl leaving home life to escape poverty and experiencing many changes is one that can also be seen in Hardy's Tess D'Ubervilles and Shaw's Pigmalion. In fact, the author was influenced by those authors. The evolution of the characters is delicately written and extremely convincing. My one complaint would be that the characters are somewhat transparent in terms of their emotions and desires."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"Dreiser was only in his 20's when he created &quot;Sister Carrie&quot; - that is what, perhaps, amazes me the most. At such a young age he has already learned what many take much longer to surmise (e.g. the characters in this book), and some never learn for as long as they live. It's difficult to consider Carrie the protagonist in my view, as her shallowness was the main contributer to the utter and complete downfall one of the more likable characters in the book: George Hurstwood, whose love of her let to ultimate poverty. That is, in fact, my one complaint and what has prevented this work from being a &quot;5 star&quot; novel. I simply had trouble believing that the cunning, charming, affluent, and brilliant Hurstwood would not only rob Fitzgerald and Moy, but that he would eventually dissolve into utter laziness, as if a man of his worldliness couldn't have overcome the relatively benign obstacles placed before him. He was a horse one chapter, and a lazy mutt the next. There needed to be a longer and more believable transition period, but beyond that - this is an enjoyable yarn, a &quot;must&quot; for those whose interest lies in turn of the century literature."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"Theodore Dreiser's Sister Carrie is a wonderful novel to read, especially for those interested in stories about the past and women. This turn of the century novel, which was highly controversial at its time, contains truths that pertain to people at all times and for all ages. Dreiser does an excellent job of making the reader feel as if he is a part of the industrialized, late 19th century America. But he does an even better job of creating a sense of the details of the setting. Everything a character is seeing the reader is able to see just as well. Dreiser uses a great deal of imagery to communicate the characters' visions of even the finest details. This can also be said in regard to the characters' feelings and thoughts. Dreiser carries the reader into the deepest realms of the minds of the central characters. For this, Dreiser uses many symbols and metaphors to follow the characters' successes, failures, and motives. Although Dreiser is inarticulate at times and far too wordy at others, the effect of the novel still comes through. Dreiser also inserts many of his own philosophies into the novel and at times they come across as lectures to the reader. But by doing this, Dreiser has clearly become just as involved with his characters as he makes the reader. This is one of those books in which it's message, more than presentation, will stay with the reader for weeks after its completion. So despite the nagging criticisms of Dreiser's critical contemporaries, he still skillfully wrote the story of a young girl's struggle to succeed in America and her attempts to overcome any obstacles that would try to stop her."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"I finally got around to reading something by Dreiser, namely Sister Carrie. A friend raved it up about 20 years ago. The pink-covered old battered Bantam paperback he read is the same one I'm reading now. I'm only half-way through it, but I'm enjoying its grim working out of these characters' destinies. They are a rather hopeless bunch, but what fascinates me is how Dreiser brilliantly evokes the state of unhappiness and how quickly happiness can go sour and how impossible it is to hold onto happiness for any length of time, especially when people seek to base it on empty premises, as these characters do. Incidentally, I began to wonder if the great Tennessee Williams was inspired by Sister Carrie's opening when he wrote A Streetcar Named Desire. The early scenes are eerily like the one where poor Blanche DuBois steps off the streetcar and looks for the tenement where her sister lives. The big-city atmospherics, the weather, the buildings, the lonely crowds in Sister Carrie are very well done, very vivid. Dreiser is a real clutz of a writer, stylistically, and yet he manages to bring all of this off with undeniable hellish power. It's fun, now and then, to read one of these naturalistic, turn-of-the-century grim, doomy books. It's amazing how little human behavior changes. We see the same materialistic grasping, the self-centered greed and lust, and the same sorts people with so little insight into themselves in wandering lost in todays' world. That's another good reason for reading Sister Carrie. I'd recommend it."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"A twisted novel with the usual great writing Theodore Dreiser presents.

It delves into a number of serious themes: poverty, loss of wealth, role of women in society, urban culture. The characters, particularly Carrie herself, are well drawn and memorable.However, the book is not the easiest read nor is the language the most elegant. An important, if not imperative, read-"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"Claims to the heavyweight title, to the all-consuming, all-powerful, \\"Great American Novel\\", perforce, must needs involve orgiastic consumption, sex, passion, commerce, on the grand scale. There can be no veiled gesture, no muted note, no conversational tone, in either discussion of the work in consideration, or in the work itself. Americans, eternal children that they are, in a cultural sense, will only be satisfied by the very biggest big-top, the grandstanding-est grandstand, the three-ringiest of three ring affairs. At this point, whatever P.T. Barnum quote springs to mind first may be mentally inserted by you, dear reader.Seen through such eyes -- that is, the wide-eyed ones of the American Child -- something like \\"Sister Carrie\\" may very well be \\"The Great American Novel.\\" For certainly, no one has ever painted the themes of MONEY, SEX, and CLASS, with a broader brush, or heavier strokes. Flannery O'Connor says that when Henry James received a manuscript that he did not like, he would return it to the sender with the remark, \\"You have chosen a good subject and are treating it in a straightforward manner.\\" The poor dolt on the receiving end of such a critique would go away thinking that his effort had been praised, unaware that the good subject is never properly disposed of in a straightforward manner. James's remark is particularly apropos of Dreiser's manner, which is straightforward in the way that a charging bull is so. Along the way, he shatters all of the china in the shop, crunching the medium-sized pieces into smaller ones under his massive heels. There is little or no art in his approach, and much of the book feels like \\"chaff\\".It particularly drags in those sections where he describes a single action by a character over the course of tens, or dozens, of pages. Two particularly egregious examples are Carrie's initial search for work, and then Hirstwood's subsequent search to the same end later in the book. Both of these episodes, although they are important to character development, could have had the same impact at about a third to a half of their unedited length. This same comment could be leveled at the work as a whole.In all, it is not surprising that Dreiser's reputation has shed much of the bloat that his novels never will."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"I finished it last weekend, it is not that difficult to read word wise but after you read it you have to digest all they Dreiser is saying. He is sending many messages through the plot that I realized at the end, you could really discuss the book forever because (published in 1900) it deals with all of the many changes in society.Some think of Carrie as a heroine but I dont think so. I did not really like her throughout the book until the end because she is sort of punished in a way (dont want to spoil it). She really was not proactive and destoryed almost everyone in her path.I like how sometimes at the end of chapters and at the ednd of the tome Dreiser will generally speak about the message he is deliverering.IF YOU ARE VACILLATING on wether (sp?) to read this or not, question your motives and what type of lit you like. It was interesting becuase I haven't read much from this time period.

Yes, times were difficult for a single woman who had to go it alone; I will give that point. However, I don't see that as excuse to throw morality out the door, to use and be used by other people, and be constantly on the prowl for somebody better or more, prettier \\"things\\". I had a dislike of Carrie from early on. Dreiser repeatedly tries to portray her as a little country innocent when she was, in fact, a shallow, dull, weak-minded but evidently physically attractive woman. She uses her sister then dumps her; she uses her first \\"live in\\" boyfriend, then dumps him for a married man; she uses the married man but is on the lookout for another. She is always looking for happiness by latching on to someone else's money and finery. Wouldn't you know it, she manages to become a self-supporting actress after using everybody along the way. Oh, but she is innocent and naive the whole time--yeah right. Dreiser uses Carrie as a vehicle to attempt to show capitalism as being vulgar, selfish, and self-destructing. If Carrie were typical, he would have a point.The book is a little over-the-top, in my opinion. Carrie is just too pretty, too \\"innocent\\"; the men are incredibly stupid to be lead around by the nose by this creature. The married man's collapse and ruin over his failure with Carrie is over done. The characters are all dislikable and hard to identify with.

The total American life, taking its toll on the ones that haven't been able to handle success."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"Theodore Dreiser, more than any other novelist of the first half of the twentieth century,captured the brutish, corrupting power of large American cities, particularly Chicago, and most notably in Sister Carrie, based on the personal experiences of his older sister. Dreiser, like Stephen Crane whose body of work preceded Carrie by only a few years,was repelled but strangely drawn to the underbelly of large, impersonal urban centers beckoning young writers from the hinterland. In the case of Stephen Crane who consorted with the demimonde of New York's Lower East Side, and may in fact harbored desires of becoming one of the lost souls he portrayed, Dreiser observes the city with the dispassionate and clinically detached eye of a surgeon. He is interested in the social forces that compel man; Hurstwood's fumbling, faint-hearted attempt to remove money from his employer's safe only to have the safe door slam shut at the moment he begins to reconsider the consequences of his actions, suggests that man is powerless before the &quot;larger forces&quot; of nature which is a persistent theme found in Dreiser's best work. Sister Carrie and American Tragedy are representative novels of ambition, lust, greed,and envy in all its corrupting excess. The final scenes of Hurstwood shambling through the darkened streets of Manhattan during a raging blizzard, are among the most powerful and thought provoking images to be found in all of literature. A tour de force from one of America's greatest novelists, albeit one of its most politically Quixotic."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"I liked the literature aspect of this book and the picutre it presented from that period of time in US.

It's depressing, not cathartic. So it's depressing for no reason. They should attach a packet of Prozac to the last page. The characters are hopeless. You actually wind up rooting for Carrie, just because there is no one else to root for. The book is SO pompous and chauvenist, I could barely stand it. Every female in the story is either cold and materialistic, or young, materialistic and stupid. I haven't encountered such blatant sexism in a &quot;classic&quot; since Howell's &quot;Editha.&quot; I will say, though, that Dreiser's actual writing talent is incredible, he has a mystical and dark way with words; too bad he had to waste it on this. My life actually would have been better without reading this."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"Theodore Dreiser is considered to be the leading American practitioner of Naturalism--which consists of writing about sex and violence in the lower classes in order to reveal what I gather were supposed to be shattering truths about the bleak aspects of modern industrial urban life. To that end, Sister Carrie tells the story of a pretty small town girl who uses her feminine wiles to sleep her way from the factories and saloons of Chicago to the New York stage. Along the way, the tavern owning married man who stole to fund their escape to Chicago, kills himself after being abandoned by Carrie and ending up in Bowery flophouses. Meanwhile, An American Tragedy tells the story, based on a sensational true crime, of a young man who is working his way towards the American dream and refuses to let a pregnant former girlfriend stand in the way of his chance for romance with a wealthy woman. He takes the slattern out in a boat &amp; clobbers her, but is tried and executed for the crime.It is an open secret that even critics who admire Dreiser, consider him to be a horrible writer technically. American Tragedy has been called &quot;the worst-written great novel in the world&quot; and the otherwise loathsome Garrison Keillor has an amusing column about how bad he finds Sister Carrie on rereading it. His books have all the literary grace of the phone book.Thus, his reputation rests solely on the agreement of Left wing critics with his hatred of American capitalism. Well, 100 years on, I think we can safely say that the American system has served us pretty well and the Sister Carrie's of the world are not simply insignificant but, worse for a writer, uninteresting.GRADE: F"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"THIS IS POSITIVELY ONE OF THE WORST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ - AND I WOULD NEVER HAVE READ IT IF I DIDN'T HAVE TO FOR A SCHOOL PROJECT.

From the very first page I was immediately so caught up in the story that I read 220 pages the first night and only stopped reading when I was too sleepy to continue. This is a fine story that keeps getting better and better as it progresses. I loved every word of it!There are three memorable characters in the book. The first is Carrie herself, a young woman who comes to the big city of Chicago at the age of 18. Her quest for a job and the challenges of working in a factory are clearly brought to light. I pitied her situation and was actually rather glad when the prosperous salesman, Drouet seduces her and she seems to better herself. He's not into marrying her but he supports her and treats her well. She even gets a chance to take part in a play that his lodge is putting on. There's another man who is interested in her though, Hurstwood. He is a manager of a prosperous restaurant-bar and has a good life. Even though he is married, he courts her. How this all turns out is the stuff of real drama.This book has it all, but most especially it is a deep exploration of character. Each of them is sympathetic in his or her own way. And they are depicted so well that I could view the world through their eyes and actually get under their skin. This is a powerful emotional story. It is as real as it can get and the cities of Chicago and New York are presented in ways that clearly impact the characters and the challenges they face.Don't miss this book if you can help it. It is a lush and real treat!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"The novel, Sister Carrie, came about when the 28-year-old Theodore Dreiser wrote the words \\"Sister Carrie\\" on a sheet of paper, then composed the novel to figure out what it meant.It is the story of a young woman who moves to Chicago. Longing for clothing, leisure and privilege, she soon takes up with Drouet, a man willing to support her if she'll consent to live together, unmarried. From there, she develops an attraction for a married man, Hurstwood, and the power and privilege he possesses. Their relations and the result of their decisions constitute much of the book.This novel presented scandalous scenarios of a young, impressionable, and not especially moral woman in a rather dispassionate tone. It was a rebellious scenario for the times and worth reading for the glimpse it provides into American big city life in the early 20th century.The writing, however, is unsophisticated, especially in the first half and the characters are superficial. Readers aren't allowed a deeper look into their minds and motivations. Except at one point, when Hurstwood engages in serious deception, the book lacks the tension and strong plot that drive American Tragedy.For those who haven't read Dreiser before, American Tragedy is a better place to start. But for those who want to read more of his work, Sister Carrie offers a interesting look into morality, family, and urban life."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"With his first novel \\"Sister Carrie\\", writer Theodore Dreiser put his name on the map. Much of his following success is due to this book. Much of what he wrote in this novel is based on facts that happened to his sisters. When he submitted the work to a publisher he almost got a contract - if not a publisher's wife had read the book and found it immoral.For being so candid about controversial issues, Dreiser was label as immoral - but, as a matter of fact, he was frank, touching current issues that other writers and society used to (or still do) avoid. This is one of the main reason for reading \\"Sister Carrie\\". Being an X-Ray of time like nothing else made this interesting book survive through time. And nowadays it is considered one of America's greatest classics. It is such an important book, that many critics and scholars consider it a the first modern American novel and has influenced writers like Hemmingway and Fitzgerald.Thematic was not the writer's main concern in \\"Sister Carrie\\". The use of language was ahead of its time. Dreiser was not afraid of incorporating slang to his text. For that, the book is a portrait of its time, how people behaved and talked - what makes the reading more interesting for contemporary readers. Although the language used was the one current when the novel was written it is never difficult for contemporary audiences. Moreover, the interesting plot and developed characters only make \\"Sister Carrie\\" very accessible.The plot tells the story of young Carrie, a girl who leaves her hometown to move to Chicago to live with her sister and find a decent job. But she has other plans. After attempting unglamorous jobs, she flees to live with a womanizer. But that is just the beginning of Carrie's journey down then up.Were it written by someone less talented, \\"Sister Carrie\\" would easily have become a soap opera. But Dreiser bring depth to his characters and situations. Carrie could have been only another 'a-star-is-born' type of character, but she is much more than that.So is Dreiser. With his following work (mostly with \\"An American Tragedy\\") he proved that \\"Sister Carrie\\" was not a fluke, but the conscious work of a talented writer. More than a hundred years later, his first novel is still read and very important to Literature."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"This is the first Theodore Dreiser novel that I have read, and this proved to be a good place to start, being his debut work, written at the turn of the 20th century. Dreiser writes in a florid, descriptive type of way that takes a little getting accustomed to, but then establishes a groove. Let me give a word of warning: this is a very engrossing novel. It tells the story of Carrie, a young and impressionable girl of 18, who moves away from her small hometown to stay with her settled sister and brother-in-law in Chicago, and almost immediately (in fact, on the train journey to Chicago) makes an impression on a man, Drouet, with whom she would eventually develop a romantic relationship. That relationship sours when a more attractive prospect of a man appears within her sights, and she is in turn pursued by that man, Hurstwood. Both men are upper middle class achievers, both more than a little pretentious, but both smitten by Carrie, a plain Jane who becomes a beauty.The story encompasses her struggles with poverty and hardship, wanting desperately, having, and then losing it, only to regain it by her own pluck and ambition. We are, of course, referring to material gain. The themes in this story run very deep. We witness, in a very well told manner, the trappings of wealth, the comfort and predictability of it, and then the rapid decline in fortunes that Carrie endures with Hurstwood, a proud man who fails, and is struck down by both his obsession for, indifference to, and then ultimate reliance on Carrie, which would have seemed incredible in the early stages of their relationship. I found the story of Hurstwood to be moving in that he had been financially comfortable, married (albeit a predictable and dull marriage), with teenage children; and then out of perhaps boredom, a little arrogance and a feeling of \\"just because he could\\", he pursued Carrie, the circumstances of which led to his ruination. His business endeavours sour, and he is too proud to seek positions below those to which he had become accustomed. Dreiser writes very movingly about Hurstwood's declining financial status and the shifting sandbars on which he maroons himself. He becomes a morose, inert, and powerless individual, when there once was power. He is cast off by the type of people over whom he had previously had power. Surviving New York on 15 cents a day, even in 1900, must have been near impossible. In the end, for Hurstwood, it was. His indolence and pride destroyed him as a man.Carrie, in the meantime, achieves the kind of success that seemed fantastical when she had been but a poor shopgirl struggling for $4.50 a week in Chicago. She is ultimately dissatisfied with her new-found wealth and celebrity. She knows that her work is easy and her success not achieved by hard work or years of labour; her failure in both relationships (albeit with men a good deal older than herself) has made her guarded and lonely. She keeps longing for that which is \\"ideal\\" but which is just out of her grasp. She is always something of an outsider, elusive and therefore desirable to those around her.In the end, she is as tentative and alone as when the story began; as the author writes \\"In your rocking chair, by your window, shall you long, alone. In your rocking chair, by your window, shall you dream such happiness as you may never feel.\\""},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"Classic story of small town girl comes to the big city to make her fortune.

Fortunately for Carrie she possesses characteristics that will help her-charm and beauty. She is immediately sought out by a fast talking salesman who takes Carrie in and introduces her to a glimpse of the good life. Through Charley Druitt, Carrie meets and becomes romantically involved with George Hurstwood, a successful yet married, businessman.George gives up all for Carrie and spirits her away from Chicago; eventually to New York where they settle.

Read this book !"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"I hate to reiterate a common point made by many reviewers but I feel it's necessary to say (once again!) that the middle of the book was some hard reading. It wasn't hard, vocabulary-wise, but because Dreiser went into *great* detail about Carrie and Hurstwood, separately and as a couple (among many other things) - so much so that it could have been its own novel. It has the potential to lose people who are short on patience. Perhaps five chapters could have been combined into two (if that!).Be that as it may, roughing it through the middle makes getting to the end feel as if you've accomplished the impossible, and your effort will be rewarded.The ending was unconventional, to say the least. Not to give it away but if a potential reader believes that Dreiser tied things up quite nicely, think again! Such an ending is a present-day writing teacher's nightmare.I must confess that as I was reading the book I was simultaneously checking out the reviews here on Amazon and was prepared to feel really sorry for Hurstwood. From what I understand, Hurstwood's deterioration is the main attraction of the book (and of the movie adaptation made in the 1950s). After seeing how he tricked Carrie into leaving Chicago with him - first going to Canada and then settling in New York, how he was a bigamist (throwing that in Carrie's face at the appropriate moment), and how utterly unprepared he was to fight his wife and live a new life in a new town, I wound up not feeling as sorry for Hurstwood as is expected to be. His lack of motivation and the lies on which he built his life with Carrie were of his own doing and, in a sense, he got what he deserved in the end.Carrie, on the other hand, has been portrayed as this vixen who gladly used married men for her own gain and nothing could be farther from the truth. She didn't even know Hurstwood was married until Drouet sprang that bit of trivia upon her (after he was informed by a maid of Carrie's frequent outings with Hurstwood). Also, Drouet was not married (but they did live together as an unmarried couple in a day when that was unthinkable!).To me, Carrie is the most identifiable character here, not because she's the title character but because of her need to overcome a repetitive life full of drudgery, routine, and never making her ends meet. This was summed up perfectly on Page 31 of this edition: \\"Unless Carrie submitted to a solemn round of industry and saw the need of hard work without longing for play, how was her coming to the city to profit (her sister and her husband)?\\"Carrie's attitude regarding work and her outlook on life is, on the surface, very frivolous and not at all of an adult: \\"Carrie ... bent over her work. She felt as though she could hardly endure such a life. Her idea of work had been so entirely different\\" (Page 38). She wanted more out of life than what the industrial 1890s had to offer, and anyone can identify with that sentiment (especially today in the hyper 21st Century. What are supposed to be 9-5 office jobs turn out to be something we practically live with 24/7 and then you're fired (or \\"laid off\\"), without warning, for reasons that wouldn't make sense to a preschooler. And, for our troubles, we die of cancer in the end. Translation: Nothing much has changed in one hundred-plus years in this country).Carrie had advantages (like men wanting to take care of her) that others don't have (nor ever get) but, when the going got tough in New York City, she put her feet to the pavement and found work (something Hurstwood was always putting off).Whether one feels Carrie deserved her fame courtesy of hard work or through sheer luck (of being at the right place at the right time), Ames's thought sums up the reason for her success: \\"The world is always struggling to express itself ... Most people are not capable of voicing their feelings. They depend upon others. That is what genius is for. One man expresses their desires for them in music; another one in poetry; another one in a play. Sometimes nature does it in a face - it makes the face representative of all desire. That's what has happened in your case\\" (Page 429).Did the good guy/gal win here? That's up for debate. One thing is for sure is that \\"Sister Carrie\\" is definitely not your conventional tale and is a fine representation of good American literature.One final note: It's worth checking out the scholarship at the beginning of Barnes and Noble Classics Editions (as well as other editions that offer the same). While I find the overall scholarship to be biased majority of the time, it is, nonetheless, helpful and aids in your reading of the text. - Donna Di Giacomo"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"This novel is a highly entertaining, soap-operatic critique of all that was wrong with the Industrial Revolution. Climb onboard for an emotional trainwreck through the bowels of the urban frontier. Imagine Henry James as a Marxist with a keen eye for fashion, high on caffeine and getting paid by the word, and you'll get a fairly accurate impression of this book. Though Carrie is naive, materialistic, and misguided, she is also compassionate, determined, and ultimately likeable. By making us care about his anchorless shopaholic waif, Dreiser sets us up for a delightfully bumpy ride. The slightly sagging middle chapters are small penance for the many bracing rewards."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"Theodore Dreiser, an American novelist of the \\"naturalist school\\" published this, his first novel, in 1900, to limited acclaim. The wife of the publisher, Mrs. Doubleday, was adamantly opposed to its publication since, in her opinion, \\"immorality,\\" by which she means, Carrie's relationship with men, was not clearly punished. At the end of my \\"Barnes & Noble Classics\\" copy, there is a spot-on retort from a review in the \\"San Francisco Argonaut\\": \\"But these critics will have little to say in condemnation of the immorality of a commercial system which offers young girls a wage of three or four dollars a week in payment for labor as destructive to the mind as to the body.\\" As with numerous other American novelists, their merit was first recognized in Europe, and then reflected back to the States. The novel was re-issued in 1907, to a much more receptive public. Dreiser grew up in Indiana, and went to Chicago as a newspaperman. The principal character, Carrie, is based on his sister, who, in the novel, went from Wisconsin to Chicago. Though re-issued in the same year that Upton Sinclair published his famous muck-raking novelThe Jungle, also set in Chicago, Dreiser's novel is actually set in the 1880's - \`90's. In terms of the social classes, the two novels both complement and contrast the classes depicted, and there is a dash of some social mobility thrown in.Carrie is a classic country girl, fleeing a big family, for the lights of the big city. On the train to Chicago she meets Drouet, a smooth-talking salesman. Carrie's domestic situation, living with her sister and brother-in-law is not a happy one, and she soon takes up \\"domestic arrangements\\" with Drouet. And in the much more sedate time of what was the Victorian era in England, that is all you learn: the panting, puffing and groping are all carefully excised. Hurstwood, a married man of some property, and limited propriety, and an erstwhile friend of Drouet, also takes an unseeming interest in Carrie, which borders on Maugham'sOf Human Bondage. With this essential dynamic, the novel is propelled forward, with the inevitable vicissitudes in the human interactions as well as the social standing of the main characters. Roughly half the novel is set in New York City, so the reader gains an appreciation of the two largest American cities in the post-Civil War period, an event that is never mentioned.\\"Naturalism\\" means a realistic account life in the aforementioned cities. No \\"stream of consciousness\\" or other innovative story-telling techniques. Just a straightforward story, an easy read. I felt that the characterizations of the men, both Drouet and Hurstwood, seemed to be more insightful. Carrie is depicted as a strong women, with an independent streak, but she is also simply swept along by events, and her motivation at times is difficult to understand. The economics of the times is also realistically portrayed, including the grinding poverty that was the fate of most. Unemployment, underemployment, many of the same themes that dominant today's economy were highly operative then. Carrie \\"made it,\\" at least in terms of achieving success as an actress, but as Dreiser said, in terms of her relationship to Hurstwood: \\"She forgot her youth and her beauty. The handicap of age she did not, in her enthusiasm, perceive.\\" She achieved \\"success,\\" but not happiness. But that was not enough for Mrs. Doubleday, even though Dreiser says: \\"It is but natural that when the world which they represented no longer allured her, its ambassadors should be discredited...In your rocking-chair, by your window, shall you dream such happiness as you may never feel.\\"Regrettably, this is the first novel of Dreiser's that I have read. His other major work, published a quarter century later,An American Tragedyis now on the \\"to-read list.\\" In terms of the characters, and the setting, it is an important American novel, relevant both then, and in our own troubled economic times. 5-stars."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"Carrie Meeber leaves her small-town home in Wisconsin to try to make a life in Chicago. After unsuccessfully searching for steady employment, she gives up and becomes the \\"kept woman\\" of a male acquaintance, Charles Drouet. She finds her life with Drouet satisfactory for a while, but when she meets his friend George Hurstwood, a wealthier and more sophisticated gentleman, she begins a secret love affair with this older, married man.I'm a big fan of the naturalist novel, and Dreiser is renowned as one of the best American practitioners of this literary style. Even so, I was disappointed with this book. Though Dreiser, like an exemplary naturalist, brilliantly captures the naked reality of social conditions and human behavior, that alone doesn't make a great novel. A great novel requires characters that the reader actually cares about, and that's what I felt was lacking from this book. It's unfortunate that Dreiser chose a female protagonist, because he doesn't display a whole lot of insight into the feminine mind. Based on this book alone, one would think his conception of womankind could be summed up in the phrase, \\"They like shiny things.\\" Carrie comes across as shallow and stupid from chapter one. She continually makes life-changing decisions based on her desire for fancier clothing. In the second half of the book we gain more respect for her as she shows some competence in her chosen vocation, but it's too little too late, and her basic nature doesn't change. Hurstwood is a far more sympathetic character, but he exhibits his own frustrating assortment of unforgivable faults.The best portions of the book succeed in spite of the characters and plot, rather than because of them. The expository comments Dreiser makes on human nature are far more insightful than anything being acted out by the book's cast. The more documentary portions of the book are brilliantly drawn, for example an account of a transit workers' strike, or the portrayal of the plight of the homeless. Unfortunately it's difficult to feel much pathos for the one poor character in the book because his fall from riches to rags is brought about by extraordinarily bad decisions. Instead of a \\"this could happen to anyone\\" feeling toward poverty, the tragic downfall of the character leaves the reader with the attitude of \\"that would never happen to me\\" and \\"serves him right.\\"Sister Carrie is to be commended for its groundbreaking lack of sentimentality and its disregard for the puritanical morality of its day. Its liberating influence on American literature is unquestionable. Enough moments of brilliance shine through this flawed book to show me that Dreiser did have the great American novel within him, and I'm going to keep reading his work until I find it."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"'Tis a pity to see how some do not know what a wonderful book is in its own form.

Dreiser has created a fascinating heroine. She, like Zola's Nana, makes her living off of other people. However, Carrie is a sympathetic character where Nana is not.

Carrie has only a few more virtues and redeeming qualities than did Nana, but I at least was just as overjoyed at Carrie's success in the theatre as I was satisfied at Nana's revolting end. This is a sign of how well written Sister Carrie is. Dreiser has taken a potentially weak or even vile (with different writing) character, and made her into quite the heroine! A wonderful read-I sat down one night and finished it at three in the morning-I couldn't put it down! The only problem I had was that Carrie never really overcame her bad characteristics, and she did ruin a few lives, but her ending was perfect.

We follow in this novel two seemingly irreversible life flows: Carrie uses her beauty and ambition to rise in life, and Hurstwood falls from his secure position of middle-aged, upper-middle-class success to utter failure, all for the love of a woman half his age. It's the stuff of melodrama to some, but not when handled by Dreiser, who takes the reader into a vividly realized urban world with well-drawn characters whose virtues and vices are equally on display.

If you've read any of these famous home-wrecking novels, where a young beautiful girl gets involved with an older man, and wondered if suicide always had to be the answer, here's your book. But surprisingly, the ending makes you sort of long for the good old suicide ending. Sister Carrie isn't bad, but a lot of the insights into human nature and society are expressed in the language of a talk-show self-help psychiatrist rather than a great author. There are better versions of this formula (Updike, Tolstoy, Wharton, Austen) but there is still something in Sister Carrie that makes it worth reading. Despite its title, the better character depiction in the book belongs to the lover rather than the heroine of the title. Like Updike, Dreiser makes you feel for the plight of the upper-middle class white man.

Sister Carrie gets off to a slow start, but the reader is able to connect with the events that unfold. Dreiser's talent lies in the fact that he was able to describe life as he saw it, tragic.

The now fading archetype of the travelling salesman as the dangerously seductive dandy despoiling virtuous young women comes to life here.Sound corny? Not in the least. Because Dreiser gets inside these people's heads, and they're just as interesting as anyone gracing the pages of People Magazine.The novel starts with a timeless theme, young girl goes to the big city and gets seduced by smooth travelling salesman. Every made for TV movie variation on this theme nowadays reduces this to a morality tale to warn young viewers.Not Dreiser. He turns this into what I'd argue is one of the first and least politically tainted feminist novels of the 20th century. Buy this book.

After a brief, unhappy stay with her cheerless sister, she lights upon a drummer named Drouet happy to show Carrie a better life in exchange for her becoming his unmarried lover. The result is a happy one for Carrie, but two things threaten her ersatz domesticity: the possibility of a career on the stage, and the attentions of a philandering resort manager named Hurstwood.\\"Why, I should think that you would be very happy,\\" she tells Hurstwood at one point. \\"You know so much of the world.\\"\\"That is it,\\" he answers. \\"I know too much of the world.\\"First published (and famously suppressed) in 1900, \\"Sister Carrie\\" was infamous not only for the sordidness of Carrie's circumstances, but the utterly naturalistic approach Dreiser took to describing them. Like Darwin with a fossil bone, Dreiser finds broader implications for his minute observations on the lifestyle of Carrie and her friends, implications he often expounds upon at length.\\"It was not for her to see the wellspring of human passion,\\" he writes. \\"A real flame of love is a subtle thing. It burns as a will-o'-the-wisp, dancing onward to fairylands of delight. It roars as a furnace. Too often jealousy is the quality upon which it feeds.\\"Dreiser's point-of-view is rooted enough in reality to command respect, but the thin plot is a detriment as are the uninvolving characters at the center. Carrie is a strangely dull flower who is seen forever staring out at windows, content to float along on the tides of others' passions with only her beauty to save her. She generates no sympathy. Nor do Drouet and Hurstwood, the latter of whom seems especially ill-presented as a relentless go-getter one minute and lazy lounger the next. The then-29-year-old Dreiser presents this as the matter-of-fact result of turning 43.Positives of \\"Sister Carrie\\" include a Chicago so real you can smell the stockyards and the flophouse drunks, a treatment of Carrie's stage career that provides necessary diversion from the main storyline, and some mildly amusing glimpses at Hurstwood's loveless marriage. \\"Sister Carrie\\" lacks for humor generally, which along with the robotic characters make the book a dull read despite the fact it is written in a plain and accessible style, unlike Dreiser's later \\"An American Tragedy.\\"I really enjoyed \\"American Tragedy;\\" which benefitted from a masterfully-spun plot and engaging people. If the idea of someone actually benefitting from sex before marriage wasn't so objectionable at the time, I doubt \\"Sister Carrie\\" would enjoy the cultural standing it does today.

The year is 1889. \\"She was eighteen years of age, bright, timid and full of the illusions of ignorance and youth.\\"Carrie is soon overwhelmed by the difficulty of finding work, especially since she has no previous experience as a wage earner. When she finally does get a job on an assembly line at a shoe factory for $3.50 per week, she is exhausted by long hours of standing and poor working conditions. \\"Not the slightest provision had been made for the comfort of the employees, the idea being that something was gained by giving them as little as possible.\\" \\"The wash rooms and lavatories were disagreeable, crude, if not foul places, and the whole atmosphere was one of hard contract.\\"Carrie does well in spite of these hardships, but she must pay her sister's husband almost her entire salary for her room and board. With winter coming and the chill winds of a Chicago autumn upon her, Carrie has no money for a coat, hat, nor even an umbrella. She is absolutely wretched. Then she meets a young salesman, Charles Drouet, whom she had become slightly acquainted with on the train to the city. She is eventually tricked into living with him - seduced by his offers of marriage, and the economic security and comparative independence he provides her. She is still a girl and is motivated by impulses and her passive, overly trusting nature.Carrie makes another serious mistake when she allows herself to be deceived a second time by a well-to-do, married saloon manager twice her age, Mr. Hurstwood. Drouet, showing off, had introduced Carrie to his socially superior friend, and also thought to shine in Hurstwood's eyes by presenting him to his attractive, young \\"wife.\\"Disillusioned after a few years with Drouet, who loves her in his fashion but has proved to be irresponsible and flighty, Carrie believes Hurstwood to be single and herself to be in love with him. Hurstwood, a respectable gentleman who has never been a philanderer, is himself quite enamored with Carrie - enough to leave his family. He persuades her to flee Chicago and move with him to New York. He does this by outright lying to the young woman in his desperation to have her.Given the period when the novel was published and the morality and mores of the time, \\"Sister Carrie\\" was not only poorly received, the novel scandalized polite society. The heroine, a young woman who comes to the city, forms two out-of-wedlock relationships, eventually becomes successful in her own right, rising to fame and respectability. She is rewarded rather than punished for her moral lapses.Originally a newspaperman, Theodore Dreiser writes with a blunt journalistic style. In \\"Sister Carrie\\" and his other work, he deals with the gritty reality of life and is known as an outstanding representative of naturalism - a movement in literature and the arts where real life subjects are portrayed as they exist in the real world - with all their blemishes and defects.I originally read \\"Sister Carrie\\" 25 years ago and thought to revisit it when I found it in one of my book trunks. I loved the novel back then, but now I really appreciate what a great American novel this is. The characters are outstanding in their depth and realism. The story is compelling, and the portrait of American life as seen through Dreiser's eyes is exceptional. Highly recommended!JANA"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"Sister Carrie is probably best known for being the American example of the Naturalist school of writing. Centering around Carrie, a girl who comes to Chicago to live the good life in the big city, it follows her action from being a factory worker, to a 'companion', to a housewife, and finally to fame and fortune on the stage in New York City.Dreiser sets the measure of the game early, on the first page, with the statement that all women are provided two options in life. One is to work hard, live, and have children. The other is to fall into a life of sin.For those who don't hold with that line of reasoning, the book will be a bit hard to swallow. Dreiser operates along the same line of logic that Emile Zola set down when creating this genre. Every action Carrie makes is predestined, in Dreiser's eyes, by her surroundings. She will not and cannot make any decision contrary to her 'nature'.While this is all very well and good for Dreiser, it is not so for Naturalism. Thomas Hardy's famous Tess, and Jude, make decisions contrary to their nature all the time, it is society that is at odds with the characters and not the other way around. Carrie's society seems perfectly willing to accept her, but it is her decisions that one finds appalling. The feeling is more like being on a careening freight train, with the outcome inevitable and predestined but terrible nonetheless. There is none of the same despair and void that one finds in Hardy, and somehow that is the books biggest flaw.Hardy's novels, that were written a full forty years before Sister Carrie, explore naturalism in such a way as to make the character the hero and society the villain. Dreiser's Carrie is no such hero, she is just the unfortunate victim of circumstance."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"Maybe I'm just not as unforgiving as the other reviewers, but I found this edition to read just fine. Yes, there were a few errors, but not nearly as many as the other reviewers claimed. Aside from that, it's a great piece of literature from that era. It is a story of life in the factories of late 19th century Chicago, a story of an \\"immoral\\" girl being taken care of by men to escape the factory life, and the misery she caused them. Evidently, this book was considered scandalous in its day, as Carrie never suffers any consequences for her immorality. A good read."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"A girl named Carrie moves from Wisconsin to Chicago to become something. She gets in a love triangle with two men--the kind, but \\"inferior\\" Charles Drouet and the worldly, wealthy George Hurstwood. Carrie picks one of the two, and we see a reverse of good fortune. Carrie rises in society while her significant other, through a series of bad decisions, falls in society. Carrie uses these men to get what she wants, but I wouldn't exactly call her a maneater. Through failure and success and exposure to harsh reality, Carrie matures and toughens. She grows; though some may argue she becomes a worse person, not a better one.This was Theodore Dreiser's first novel. It is a very good story and a very easy read.Sister Carrie also delves into the cutthroat conditions of the late 1890's. The ease at which someone became homeless and was at the mercy of other people's compassion was very scary. This book made me deathly afraid of becoming homeless. I can't tell you how paranoid I was. Some people seem to think everyone who is homeless asked for it by being lazy or indulging in bad habits. But if we realized how quickly good fortune could change, maybe we could be a little more sensitive and sympathetic to people who find themselves on the street. It could easily be us: even those of us who aren't stupid or frivolous with our money."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"Sister Carrie, by Theodore Dreiser, is, in short, the tale of a small-town country girl's attempts to rise to aristocracy in the cutthroat world of the early 20th century. After many adventures, and some trials and tribulations, Carrie does find the affluence and financial success that she desired more than anything else in the world - but there is more to it than that.Carrie from the beginning seems to be the very emblem of a consumer driven materialistic society, and there seems to be no doubt about this as the book continues on. She seems possessed by the inanimate, and seems to completely disregard anything other than the right clothes, the right place to work, and her appearance. Carrie is seemingly vapid, and, as she struggles to \\"make it\\" by letting Drouet take care of her and give her his money, she hardly acknowledges the fact that he has helped pull her out of poverty. Once she is able, she throws him away in order to be with Hurstwood, a man of even more wealth and connection. However, it needs to be said that Carrie is not stupid. As materialistic and shallow as she seems to be, she is intriguing nonetheless. She knows how to get what she wants, how to manipulate others into giving her what she wants, and there is something about her that even the men of the novel seem to find irresistible. She is most definitely worth a deeper analysis.The fact remains, however, that none of the characters seem likeable. They all lack depth, don't seem to have agency, and remain basically static throughout the entirety of the novel. But this is brilliance on Dreiser's part, because it seems to serve as a commentary of the society in which the characters are a part. They seem to perfectly represent a world which also seems to lack in depth and focuses solely on exterior, surface-level qualities.Dreiser's novel is a powerful and accurate portrayal of a materialistic society and the ways in which living such a shallow life can ultimately lead to the downward spiral and complete end of a person, like Hurstwood, or the forever unfulfilled and never-quite-satisfied attitude of Carrie's. But Beware: the prose tends to positively drag in many places, mostly through the middle section of the book, moving at an almost ridiculously slow pace. Nonetheless, it is still worth the time."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"This equisite novel quickly worked its way onto my favorite books of all time list, ranking among Anna Karenina. Hurstwood's character reminded me much of a male version of Anna, and I believe Dreiser did an EXCELLENT job at writing his demise. The novel drips irony off every page. Hurstwood and Carrie have more or less switched social positions by the end of the novel. In order to understand the full value of the novel, and why it is so daring and ahead of its time, the reader MUST remove himself from today's time period. I compare this novel to Anna Karenina because much like Tolstoy wrote of Anna's demise in society, Dreiser writes of Hurstwood's demise in society: the new industrial America. On the other hand, Carrie was achieving unspeakable status all on her own. This was unheard of by a woman at the turn of the century.The second half of the novel Dreiser develops the theme of chance, and how it led Carrie, Hurstwood, and Drouet to where they are in life. Unfortunately, he does not ever return to Carrie's sister. I would have liked to learn a little more about her and her family as well as where times took them.Dreiser also explores Carrie's fascination with materialism. Probably one of my favorite parts of the novel was when Carrie realized money wouldn't buy her happiness. Here Dreiser reflects Camus' ideas of happiness versus reality. No matter what she bought, it was never enough, and Carrie was never able to achieve the happiness she dreamed of. &quot;In your rocking-chair, by your window, shall you dream such happiness as you may never feel.&quot;All in all, this book is an excellent read. Anyone wishing to find a book to fall in love with-- the characters, the setting, plot, etc.-- this book is a must. It is an easy and quick read filled with much more than what merely appears on the surface. Sister Carrie is a story of love, deceit, greed, violence, and much more. Definitely read it."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"I readAn American Tragedymany years ago. I do not remember very much about it. I remember that it moved me, but that I forgot it quickly. Sister Carrie is my second book by Dreiser.I was dreading the book, at least a little bit. It seems to be universally damned with faint praise. I have heard readers describe the prose as awkward and overblown. I remember a Salon column snarking about it some years ago. I have heard that Dreiser's prose improved with the other novels, and have been told that it was possible to skip Carrie. And so on.I loved it. That's a little bit lacking in nuance-- there *were* places that I got the criticism. At times I might have wished for other pacing. It has little flaws in the execution, and I suspect that you have to be able to swallow Dreiser's overall style. He's not lithe and little and zippy. His writing is sort of like a hoop skirt-- elegant from some angles, ponderous from others, not really very practical all around.This said, I have rarely read a novel that treats so very well with character in time and place. Caroline Meeber is the kind of woman I find utterly unsympathetic. Her literary heirs generally fill me with irritation and vague revulsion, no matter how sympathetically portrayed. You know what I mean-- the lovely young animal, the woman who wants but doesn't think, the actress. Dreiser does a remarkable thing. He doesn't really make her sympathetic, exactly, but he makes her understandable. He makes a type of person who rarely seems human very human indeed. And a product of her time. The book is as much about the fragility of success in the early industrial era as it is about the individuals involved. Carrie comes through the mill unhappy but unscathed. George Hurstwood breaks himself in the traps of the time, forgetting that by serving the wealthy he does not actually become invincible. Terrible and true.I believe that the strength with character in the text outweighs any flaws in the prose style. Perhaps I will be less impressed with a later reading, but right now, I would recommend it.(Sister Carrie has an odd publishing background, by the way. There are several published versions of the book. I read the Penguin Classics unexpurgated version, and it seems to make a real difference if you get the earlier published versions which Dreiser self-censored in order to get the book printed. If in doubt, take a quick look--not enough to spoil your ending!-- at the last few pages. If it ends with Carrie, you've got a bowdlerized edition. If it ends with Hurstwood, you've got one of the unexpurgated or repaired editions. I found the foreword of my edition by Alfred Kazin helpful in understanding the publishing history.)"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"hello all, my review for this book is based entirely on the quality of this text, not on the novel/story.

But despite it all, my interest never waned from the first page to the last. Yes, Dreiser's super-duper liberal (although liberal back in 1900 is a tad different than what we consider liberal today), but this man could sure write beautifully! At times, he's almost a poet, as I found myself reading some sentences and paragraphs two to three times over for their sublime brilliance.Dreiser's prose is both honest and brave. He develops his characters beautifully, at a slow, methodic pace, carefully unraveling the mysterious air of each of the three main characters until the very last pages. Yes, he's iconoclastic. Yes, he gets a bit too preachy toward the end of the novel. Yes, he's a bit dark and discouraging. Yes he's a bit too liberal for many folks. And yes, his bitter, but many times brilliant observations are a tad too cluttered with sarcasm and irony. Yet for me, I just couldn't put this one down, nor forget about it when I finally did.Carrie, Carrie, Carrie ... it is so easy for all of us to sit back and judge you. You slept your way to the top in many people's eyes. You sold your soul to become successful in our material world. Yet most people who have become successful in our society have led far worse lives than Dreiser's \\"Sister Carrie\\" and many of them are lionized. We have to ask ourselves, is it our jealous, judgmental nature that makes many of us go tisk-tisk about the lack of this gal's morals? My glass house is waaaay too thin to do this. Yet, I do not advocate in any way, shape or form using others to get what you want in life. The pursuit of materialism should never mean the sacrifice of one's ethics, morals and values. However, I do believe that Carrie was coming to this realization toward the end of the novel. In order to not disclose too much to those who haven't read this yet, I will say no more.As I stated above, this classic definitely isn't without its imperfections. If you are a staunch conservative, there's a good chance this writer will irk you a bit. I also thought Dreiser was a bit too harsh in regards to the fate of the book's male protagonist, perhaps punishing him for being the quintessential all-American, conservative Capitalist that he represented early on. He also is a writer who tends to be idealistic to a fault, getting way too preachy and sanctimonious for most of us mere, marred mortals to handle at times.Overall though, I really, really dug this classic novel. This is the first time I have read Dreiser, and I greatly admire his compelling, penetrative style. The story is well written, no real action, very little plot, mostly a character study of some very realistic people whom we all have known in life. The beauty of this simplistic story is the way it plays on just about every emotion imaginable, which made it for me, never a dull moment.I loved it. 5 Stars!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"Sister Carrie is my favorite novel of all time. I have read it at least twenty times in the past sixteen years. I'll spare you the literary review, which I'm sure you can read anywhere, and tell you why it still holds interest for the modern reader.Theodore Dreiser's attention to detail was definitely one of his major strengths as a writer. I've always found the details of late 1800's Chicago and New York fascinating in this novel. If you are particularly interested in this time period, you may want to read this novel for the everyday historical details alone.The coming-of-age theme is also one that modern readers can relate to, even though Carrie is from a different time. She leaves behind her small town and her family at the age of eighteen and is dazzled by city life. We can all relate to the degradation and desperation she feels as she seeks out her first job, and her desire for independence. Ultimately, she is successful, at least in a material sense, and the journey the reader follows her on is engaging.I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but I would highly recommend Sister Carrie. I have read most of Dreiser's other novels and several of his short stories.

Don't bother."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"Theodore Dreiser's &quot;Sister Carrie&quot; is a complex novel of linear events. It is a study in cause and effect -- how a character's environment, or change of environment, affects his or her values, especially with regard to money and the iniquity it brings.18-year-old Caroline &quot;Carrie&quot; Meeber, bored with her life in a small Wisconsin town, comes to Chicago in 1889 to live with her sister Minnie. The only employment she can get is a laborious, low-paying job in a shoe factory, and when she loses it and wears out her welcome with her sister's family, a well-to-do young man named Charles Drouet, whom she met on the train to Chicago, sets her up in an apartment where they pretend to be married.Drouet has a friend named George Hurstwood, a man in his late thirties and the manager at a local upscale bar. Hurstwood's home life is stagnant and empty; he has a self-centered wife whom he ceased loving long ago and two materialistic children around Carrie's age. He is going through what many decades later would be called a midlife crisis.Through Drouet, Hurstwood meets Carrie and they form a mutual attraction. Unlike Drouet, to whom life is all about social status, Hurstwood does not patronize Carrie; he makes her feel intelligent and important, and Carrie exhibits Hurstwood's ideals of youth and beauty. When Hurstwood's wife gets wise to her husband's affair and sues him for divorce, Hurstwood succumbs to the temptation to steal money from his employer and tricks Carrie into leaving Chicago with him. They go to New York and experience curious reversals of fortune -- Carrie becomes a rich and famous showgirl while Hurstwood drifts into inescapable poverty and a bitter end.This is no Cinderella story for Carrie. It may seem like she is being rewarded for her innocence and integrity, but since she realizes that her success is more the result of luck than talent, her new life is not as fulfilling as she thought it might be. I found myself surprisingly engaged by the story because Dreiser presents his characters as real people with unsolvable problems and doesn't try to teach a morality lesson. I finished the novel feeling miserable about the world, which is not something that many novels can do to me. My only complaint is that Dreiser's prose is a little awkward and excessively wordy without the benefit of clarity; it longs for the smoother touch of D.H. Lawrence or Somerset Maugham."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"Dreiser describes the psyche and actions of Carrie Meeber, a young woman trying to succeed in the late nineteenth century in America, and others she meets to show the struggle of young women trying to succeed in the newly industrialized America. When Dreiser first published Sister Carrie, his publisher censored the book due to its shocking content. Dreiser unfortunately has a tendency to ramble about some topics. Although Dreiser uses lengthy descriptions at times, he still manages to get across the horrible injustices that befell many Americans during this time. The book seems to revolve around chance. Although Dreiser shows the inevitability in the characters' lives and that everything led to death, he also shows that much of the events occurred by chance. The characters meet each other by chance, and the events that lead to Carrie's downfall happened by chance. Dreiser shows the world he lived in to the reader. Everything in the book is not random chance. It accurately displays life at that time in America. Dreiser took his story from Horatio Alger. Alger told of virtuous and ambitious men, however. Dreiser took a woman and allowed her to succeed. This added to the shock value of the novel. Another novel of shock value during this industrialization period is The Jungle by Upton Sinclair. This novel showed the horrors of the meat-packing industry. Sister Carrie spent some time exploiting sweat shops although that was not the primary focus of the novel. However, if one likes Sister Carrie, The Jungle would be a good book to read to learn more of the lives of the working class during the industrialization period in American history."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"Achieving happiness through worldly goods is a mistake that is often made in society today. In his novel, Sister Carrie, Theodore Dreiser explores this situation. Dreiser uses many different symbols, themes, and contrasts to teach the moral lesson that happiness lies not in worldly goods, especially when achieved by immoral means. Drieser beautifully states the cycle of Carrie's emotions, which involve first Carrie's aspirations, then her achievement, and then her unhappiness, which makes her aspire to do more. This cycle repeats throughout the novel, and through this cycle Carrie systematically climbs up the social ladder. Therefore, Carrie is the embodiment of the &quot;American Dream&quot; of rags-to-riches which was prevalent in the late 1800's. Dreiser also explores the idea that too much of a longing for something leads to disaster, but desire for the unknown or for improvement is hope, innocence or even a form of redemption. This contrast is shown later in the novel between Carrie and Hurstwood. Dreiser's main point in the novel is a contrast between material goods and true happiness or fulfilment. Because of Dreiser's beautifully created characters, the book has a sense of true reality due to the characteristics of each person in the novel. Carrie is susceptible to bribes, while Hurstwood is the typical working-class husband. Dreiser recounts the contrast of Hurstwood's decline into utter poverty and Carrie's rise to stardom, which becomes a central irony of the book. These two characters, along with all of the rest, are very easy to relate to and help to create a more powerful story. This book is a must read for anyone who enjoys stories of the past and of the struggle of women to find their place in society. This is without a doubt one of my favorite novels. The powerful reality and moral lesson of the story made a lasting impact."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"This book was a lesson in the journey from poor to rich and how even though moving up the ladder of success, Sister Carrie never achieved the peace and happiness she thought success and money would bring.

This was not as good but-still-it is Dreiser and he is a great author."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"This turned out to be a surprisingly powerful novel. It starts out as a tale of a \\"fallen woman,\\" but ends up being the story of a broken man. Dreiser answers the question: what happens to a man who acts on his midlife crisis? Although the eponymous heroine is the catalyst for many events in the novel and the character through whom Dreiser explores the effects of materialistic culture upon the developing personality, this novel is really about George Hurstwood, a man who leaves behind his comfortable life, job and family and runs off with Carrie, a beautiful younger woman.The novel is set in the late 1800s, early 1900s. Young Carrie Meeber is a Wisconsin country girl determined to start a new life who one day boards a train heading for Chicago. It is the first time she has ever left her small town. Carrie's personality is unformed. She is impressionable and easily swayed -- but ambitious. As a character, she is interesting mostly for the effects she produces on the various men she meets and for the way in which her personality is molded by the attitudes of those around her. Carrie quickly realizes that money is everything in the big city. Material possessions define the man or woman. Money determines social status. Money enhances beauty. A person who does not have the best clothes, a beautiful home, and the wherewithal to dine in the best restaurants and to visit the hottest nightspots is not really much of a person, Carrie concludes. This is one of the major themes running through the novel, the idea that our very essence is defined by others and how they perceive us (with the depressing corollary that others judge us based upon our income). The strongest, suavest, most self-confident personality may be broken down to nothing if deprived of wealth and its appurtenances. Conversely, money has the power to catapult a nonentity to the highest social echelons. There is one character, Bob Ames, who attempts to dispute this worldview. Bob is an intellectual who appears at intervals throughout the novel, each time telling Carrie that noble deeds are more important than money, that she should read Balzac and Hardy instead of trashy novels, that she needs to contribute something substantive to the world instead of falling for the meretricious charms of the high rollers. Yeah, whatever, Bob. Yawn. I think that Dreiser intended for Bob Ames to be a pivotal figure in the novel, a person of depth battling for Carrie's soul against the claims of the material world, but Bob's arguments are not very convincing in light of the story's bleak ending. Although Dreiser leaves open the possibility that Carrie will eventually embrace Bob's philosophy, it seems unlikely. Why should Carrie listen to Bob when everything with which she is surrounded exhorts her to favor superficial appearances over internal substance?There are two brilliant portraits of men in this novel. Charles Drouet, a \\"genial egotist\\" and Carrie's first lover, is the spitting image of one of my ex-boyfriends. I suspect that most women have a Charles Drouet in their pasts because he's the type of man who holds great appeal at a certain time of life: the dashing, well-dressed, ridiculously self-confident ladies' man who is committed to nothing except his own pleasure, who genuinely likes women (on a shallow, self-serving level) and wounds them only inadvertently - that is, he does not maliciously seek to hurt anyone; he does so only as an unintended side effect of his self-absorption. The most masterful portrait, though, is that of George Hurstwood. The last third of the novel details his decline from wealth into seediness and finally into poverty, and it's some of the best writing I've encountered in a long time. (Drusier's style in the first two-thirds of the novel is bombastic - truly tedious at times -- but the last third more than makes up for it.) Anyone who has ever been unemployed for a long period of time will relate to the description of the lethargy and depression that sets in as Hurstwood's prospects grow dimmer, the self-doubt that takes hold and begins to emanate from his pores. I was on the edge of my seat during this part of the novel. It is SO GOOD. It is wrenching to see how Hurstwood's personality changes in response to his altered position in the world. When he is no longer accorded the respect that goes along with having money, he becomes a different man. Through Carrie's eyes - \\"the eyes of the world,\\" Carrie being both a product of society and its standard bearer - we watch as he is transformed from someone worthy of respect into an object of contempt.\\"Sister Carrie\\" was controversial when it first came out due to its profanity and sexual references, and it was released in numerous \\"edited versions.\\" I read the Penguin \\"unexpurgated edition.\\" It is disappointingly tame (for example, the sexual references are so oblique that I was unable to detect any of them), but I recommend the unexpurgated edition because other versions change the ending and cut out whole passages.This is a great novel.

All over the world, a process started of people abandoning their old homes and heading for the bright lights and the lure of fortune in town. It's still going on in much of the world. Similarly, writers of many nations traced the stories of such people, writers like Zola, Balzac, Dickens, and even Horatio Alger, who made a clich&eacute; out of it. (Nice work, Horatio !) Theodore Dreiser wrote this classic novel at the beginning of the 20th century, about a girl who leaves a Wisconsin backwater for Chicago. Unable to make ends meet through the drudgery of factory or shop work, she winds up as mistress to two men, the second of whom gives up home, good job, and family for her, committing a crime along the way. They flee to New York, where, as the long story unfolds, Carrie becomes a successful actress while Hurstwood, her star-crossed lover, slowly hits bottom, becoming a scab in a street car strike, having gambled away what little money he possessed.This gripping tale will take you time. It is couched in 19th century terms, that is, while it is about sex and power relationships between men and women, it is anything but explicit. Carrie at first is just a kept woman, but after an unexpected success in an amateur theatrical, she gains power. The themes of instinct vs. reason and raw desire vs. understanding suffuse the book. Carrie seldom thinks her way out of any situation, she isn't a schemer, rather more of a dreamer; she falls into everything almost by accident, but uses her sexuality to succeed and climb out of poverty.Unlike most literature of the time, and certainly unlike much of Hollywood's products over the years, a life of \\"sin\\" does pay here. Carrie climbs the social and economic ladder, despite her discontent with Hurstwood's lack of gumption. It's all quite the opposite of the American dream of Lincoln-like figures succeeding by dint of their hard work, study, and dedication. She merely longs for pleasure and luxury and through sex, clothes, and looks, plus taking advantage of small 'breaks', reaches her goals. She realizes along the way, though, that there is more to life, but she cannot conceive of what that might be. We leave her at last, a lonely, but successful figure, sitting at the window.This is one of America's classic novels. It goes without saying that it's worth five stars. Great story, great writing; it evokes the times so well, you feel as if you knew them yourself."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"Written at a time when women still lacked the right to vote, Sister Carrie offers an uncommon (and not initially accepted) commentary on women and independence. It also addresses that timeless theme of how the city changes the individual. Dreiser's turn of the century novel chronicles the young adult life of Carrie Meeber, who leaves her small town home for a more exciting life of Chicago. Taking residence at her sister Minnie's meager apartment, Carrie is immediately plunged into a pit of lower class struggles; to pull her weight she takes a job as a factory girl in a shoe shop for wages that can barely afford her basic necessities let alone the simple pleasures of Chicago life. Not quite used to the rigorous demands of intense manual labor, she yearns for something greater. By chance, she bumps into a wealthy, flirtatious gentleman - Drouet - whom she had previously met on her train ride into Chicago. His initial courting is unsuccessful but he eventually takes Carrie on as a kept mistress. Their relationship is at best superficial. He offers material things and compliments to her beauty.Without spoiling the rest of the story, Carrie's raw and innocent drive for success takes her on a series of relationships and adventures first in Chicago and later in New York. As a historical piece, Dreiser provides vivid descriptions of these two cities right down to the street level. He treats the city as a state of mind, with narrative insights weaved between powerful stretches of dialogue.100 years later, present-day readers might see Carrie as a heroine, despite her unabashed materialism. This was the very reason for its lack of marketing support; the historical fact is that the wife of Doubleday's CEO was upset by Carrie's bachelorette success going \\"unpunished\\" by the author.As was mentioned above, the \\"city\\" has transformed her into a woman who is set in her ambitions. Dreiser's style allows us to see things from the point of view of many characters and not just Carrie's. There are snippets of moralizing here and there which give the reader a sense that Dreiser was in some ways a prophet - he foresaw the unbridled potential of American individuality, its drawbacks, and how it is generally actualized in the American city. And for the time period, this was a paradox for women. But Carrie shamelessly lives her life they way she wants to. Classism and sexism aside, Carrie Meeber carries on the American dream."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"I had to read this book in college for a Modern Novel course. With the cover and title and length (and with 7 other novels to read that looked pretty good - except for Beloved, which is trash), I had to admit that this book looked like a huge bore to me. But from the beginning pages, you become part of Carrie's world, from her downfalls to her triumphs. This book showed me a bit of life that I knew little about and the story, plot, and writing style are excellent. I assume most people nowadays will only get the opportunity to read this some sort of class where it is required, but it will be well worth it! Surprise yourself with how good a book this is."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"In my opinion, there is no american author (with the exception of Steinbeck) who can create such powerfully moving stories like Theodore Dreiser. In Sister Carrie, Dreiser tells the tale of a girl who is disenchanted with her small town life, so she moves to Chicago in search of bigger and better things. The story is an amazing portrayal of a woman's life at the beginning of the twentieth century. Dreiser, through his characters, shows the difficulty of living as a single female trying to earn a living as well as maintain relationships. Throughout the book there seems to be a rather dark, somber mood, as if there is always an internal struggle and the dire need to improve one's life, but never achieving the goal. The romance, heartbreak, emotion, and power that are portrayed through the characters and their struggles are combined masterfully to make Sister Carrie one of the best works of fiction ever penned."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"&quot;Sister Carrie&quot;, first published 100 years ago, is Theodore Dreiser's ironic story of the acquisition and loss of wealth in a country devoted to commerce and pleasure. No one ever accused Dreiser of being sparkling -- one of my reference books calls him &quot;ponderous&quot; -- but he had the strength of his convictions, and he was convinced that American materialism was the root of American unhappiness. Caroline Meeber is a country mouse who, coming to Chicago in search of work, is pounced upon by big-city cats, including a flashy traveling salesman straight out of back-room jokes. When Charles Drouet seduces Carrie, it seems more like he's adopting a pet, she's so innocently compliant. And when she becomes involved with his friend George Hurstwood, it seems incredible she doesn't suspect that this middle-aged affluent man is probably married (or that Drouet doesn't reveal it to her long before he does). It is Hurstwood's abandonment of his family and embezzlement from his employers that is the plot's turning point. With his stolen money, Hurstwood and Carrie escape to New York, he to ultimate destitution, she to stardom on the stage. All this is interesting but terribly dry, like flowers pressed in a book. The main problem in &quot;Sister Carrie&quot; is Carrie herself, who's such a passive character it's difficult to feel much for her. Even her success in the theatre seems to just sort of happen. (But, a reader may ask, if Carrie is so boring, how does she become a popular star? Well, turn on prime time TV for ten minutes and there's your answer.) Of course, there is no guarantee that Carrie's alluring situation is going to last -- I kept thinking of Evelyn Nesbit Thaw -- and Dreiser only hints at the fine line between stage work and prostitution a century ago. &quot;Sister Carrie&quot; is worth reading because it's a serious novel of life in a dichotomous society. Dreiser details with equal skill the drudgery of daily toil (not to mention the search for daily toil) and the glittering pursuits of those who can afford Michigan Boulevard and Fifth Avenue. If his style seems a little -- well, ponderous -- it should be remembered he was writing strictly from the brain. Dreiser really seemed to have no warm sympathy for the vagaries of capitalism."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"It's a shame such a great novel has been digitized so poorly.

I had read an American Tragedy and did not enjoy the read at all. This one had a few advantages over that one. 1- it is only about half as long 2- it has a theater twist and 3- was in a Lit analysis class as i was reading it and it was fun to see what each critical approach (feminist, marxist, psychoanalytic, and formalist) brought out in the book. Dreiser is a thorough enough author that reading this book through any lens brings new issues and view points to the surface. It would be fine to read just straight through, in fact still enriching and enjoyable, but for a good book to read with literary theory in mind or write a paper on this is a good one to choose..."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"'Sister Carrie' is about a naive girl from the boonies, circa 1890, who travels to Chicago to find more out of life. She runs into men, gets swept into going to New York where her life goes through great changes when the man she is with, who happens to be her sole provider, completely unravels emotionally, spiritually and financially. Carrie's life proceeds in a manner very atypical of heroines of that era. The story builds to a very fine conclusion.My only complaint with 'Sister Carrie' is that it does take some time to \\"warm up\\", and the author's writing style not especially fluid. I also felt after reading the book I never completely understood Carrie or the men in her life, ... but maybe the author left it to the reader ponder over afterwards??Bottom line: certainly a remarkable piece of literature in its day, and thankfully the material hasn't aged a bit.

The &quot;fallen&quot; part comes into play where fame and wealth isn't quite what she had thought it would be. It's a well written book about ambition that takes a new twist with a fallen heroine."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"This was one of the most absorbing classic works I've read in a long time. Dreiser artfully tells of the rise and fall of two of the novels central characters The contrast of each characters very different beginnings and subsequent rise and demise of each is quite fascinating. The novel is written in very simple and straightforward language which is a departure from the more wordy and heady classics that I've begun to tackle. A real gem of a novel. Read it."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"I stumbled on Dreiser in a used book store years ago. What a find! His vivid descriptions made me feel like I was in turn-of-the-century Chicago. And his character development was so real that Carrie and Hurstwood became people I know. Dreiser writes about real life and real relationships and about the choices we make and their effects. He writes about life without the romantic heroism of Hemingway or the aristocratic ex-pat view of Fitzgerald. I love those authors, too, but in Dreiser, I've found a writer whose characters speak to me.Read Sister Carrie. Savor Sister Carrie. But don't stop there: read _An American Tragedy_ and his other books, too."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"Am I ever happy I was assigned this by my english teacher! Dreiser is indeed a fabulous writer in the sense that he has thought of something this brilliant. Carrie's adventures through her young-adult life fascinated me beyond belief, and I could never tell where in the world it would lead her next. There is nothing that I can give bad criticism in this story, except for the fact that some of the characters were disagreeable to me. But that is the beauty of Dreiser's work: you don't know who in the world to like or to hate, to believe or to not, for that is realism. A great read!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"The pursuit of happiness may be the dominating adventure in the life of all men. For over three centuries, Americans have linked happiness with wealth and success. In Dreiser's Sister Carrie, Carrie is consistently seeking out this &quot;American Dream.&quot; Dreiser forces the reader to confront the question-- &quot;What will bring man fulfillment?&quot; This novel is devoted to pointing out that fulfillment does not come from material objects, but from honest labor. Sister Carrie follows the life of Carrie, in the last part of the 19th century, as she moves up from a small town girl to a Broadway star. Dreiser's simple style makes this book easy to understand. Due to Dreiser's lack of formal education, the language is a bit choppy. This lack of education, however, does not interfere with the power of this story. He reiterates his theme of materialism versus fulfillment with many metaphors. For example, he compares fortune to an organism--something that draws on the strength of outside sources. Dreiser's use of metaphors and his intense character developments makes this book enjoyable. It is a rags to riches story that does not lead to inner satisfaction. If you enjoy long books about women of the past, you must read this. It is not only valuable for its revelations of timeless truths, but also its history."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"Sister Carrie is an epic story of destruction and dissatisfaction when a person's self is centered around possessions. Dreiser tells the story fo Carrie's rise from rags to riches beautifully by incorporating vivid similes and metephors that capture the wealth Carrie yearns for. The main theme throughout the novel is the pursuit of happiness and the endless dissatisfaction that occurs when you base your self on wealth and status. We follow Carrie as she dreams of a higher position, receives it, is not quite happy, dreams of an even higher position, receives it, and the cycle continues never finding Carrie content. Dreiser developes the characters so beautifully you feel you truly know them. Life is presented as it really is. Dreiser gives very detailed accounts of the setting and continually gives insightful comments on situations, society, and character motives to effectively pull in the reader. Another important theme running through the novel is one of creating society as a show or play. Everyone is an actor. This is really effective as Dreiser illustrates the fact that people become what they must in order to get what they want. However, this theme is presented in a setting where the city becomes symbolic for all the corruption that occurs when presented with luxury. I loved this book and could really identify with the characters. In the latter half of the novel, Dreiser's juxtapostion of one character's assent to fame and the another's decent into poverty was so moving I do not believe I will ever forget it. The idea that the pursuit of happiness through worldly goods will lead to endless dissatisfaction was very insightful and moving throughout the novel. I would suggest this book to anyone, especially to those would love to be swept away by a beautiful yet realistic tale of wealth and corruption."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"This book was written at the turn of the century and it is a great portrait of American life and ideals at that time. It is the story of a young girl named Carrie who leaves her small town to go to Chicago to live with her sister and find work. She soon finds that living with her sister and her husband is very boring and that work is hard and dull. Soon she is a mistress of a pretty wealthy man, and the rest of the book is the story of her rise in society.One of the main themes of this book is materialism, and how people would do anything for money. During the book I could see how innocent Carrie becomes a victim of circumstances as she tries to fit into the environment around her and becomes swallowed by the anonymity of the city. I love Dreiser's style, although he goes off on unneccessary little lectures at times, and I really liked following the plot. The characters were drawn so well that I would forget they weren't real. This is a great book to read and it accurately portrays American cities at the rise of industrialism and materialism."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"I really enjoyed the first 495 pages of the book, with Dreiser's excellent descriptions, analyses, and an excellent plot.

Doctorow, author of \\"Ragtime.\\" It was helpful to read his description of Theodore Dreiser as a son of German immigrants who eventually finds his way from Indiana to Chicago where he worked in a variety of odd jobs from dishwasher,shipping clerk, truck driver, and bill collector. The inspiration for Sister Carrie came in part from his life experiences and those of his family--his sister ran off to Toronto with a married man. This story is of a young woman from a small midwestern town who comes to Chicago to stay with her married sister and find work. She soon finds it difficult to live in a cloistered environment with her brother-in-law who is overly protective and puritanical, and the sister with a small baby who is always tired and not much company for Carrie. Her first job in a sweatshop punching eyelets in shoes is grueling with long hours and in the company of girls who are silly and uneducated. When she feels like her life is becoming unbearable she encounters a man named Drouet that she met on the train who persuades her to abandon her place and let him help her. Helping her out eventually leads to both of them living together. Drouet also introduces another gentlemen named Hurstwood, who owns a saloon, is married with a grown son and daughter(unbeknownst to Carrie!) and is fairly successful except he has a cold, domineering wife. Now Carrie has two men at her disposal and increasingly spends more time with Hurstwood who seems more caring, understanding of her emotional needs, and much more polished than the travelling salesman, huckster, Drouet. Life for Carrie becomes even more interesting as she is persuaded by Drouet to take a role in a small production which gives her some feelings of confidence and ability. This is where the turning point occurs in this book as Carrie's existence becomes even more complicated as she ends up leaving Chicago in a somewhat coerced manner and eventually ending up in New York and being with Hurstwood who has left Chicago under some suspicious circumstances. Once again there is the challenge of making their ways in New York which leads ultimately to Hurstwood's downfall and Carrie's rise to fame. We are shown the cruel environment of New York's seedy side along with streetcar driver strikes, terrible poverty and the feeling of despair that one must have experiencing those circumstances. For a man like Hurstwood it's especially bad because he was once successful and is having to look for menial work which he feels is not only beneath him but it's work that requires skills that he doesn't have. Carrie's successes become greater but she is still left with very little that is meaningful in her life and she ends up alone once again. Dreiser's writing is very descriptive of the times although the characters' conversations seem very stilted and unnatural. The characters for the most part are very dry and lifeless. The only one that stands out as someone who has a clear perspective of the world and a sense of values is the young man, Ames, who finally takes an interest in Carrie and sees much more than just acting skills--she has an air of sympathy and he can see it in her eyes and mouth. Sadly he doesn't appear until almost at the end of the book!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"Great local color regarding Chicago at the turn of the century (1890). Very descriptive. Modern in that the woman doesn't get punished for being superficial and materialistic."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"This book is classic American literature for the way it portrayed a young woman who climbed via a combination of feminine wiles, theatrical ability, and liaisons with different men - a daring theme for a book published in 1900. The story centers on young Carrie Meeber, who arrives in Chicago to live with her sister and brother-in-law. Carrie is expected by her hosts to work full-time, turn over her pay, and basically sit quietly in her free time. Thankfully, she rebels against such strictures and soon leaves. Carries soon finds herself rising via incredible talent on the theatrical stage and affairs with a couple of men. In time she leaves for New York City with Hurstwood, whom she splits up with (he ends his days in flophouses) when the time is appropriate.I found this book a bit less engaging than most reviewers, yet it is clearly worth reading. Author Theodore Dreiser (1871-1945) attacked the way women were made to be dependent on men, and his sympathetic portrayal of Carrie was considered highly controversial in 1900. As such Dreiser found his book banned and then published over a decade later with several sections omitted."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"In my English 3 honors class, we had to pick a novel out of a list, and then do a big project on it. I chose this book, because the summary that my teacher gave me made it look very interesting. This book took me so long to read, but I still enjoyed it! It ends totally different from the how it starts and there was no way to predict what was going to happen. I'd heard that this book was banned by some when it came out, I didn't find it offensive at all. Maybe women were'nt allowed to have affairs back then?! Overall, I enjoyed this novel and would recommend it to any book lover!"},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"Sister Carrie is more a book of its times than universal appeal. The descriptions of Chicago and New York in turn of the 19th century are fascinating, and the industrial lens through which we see Chicago and the dazzling glamour through which we see New York mirror well Carrie's journey. From small town girl to brief hard labor to kept woman to playing at housewife to famous stage actress, Carrie is at times the protaganist but most often than not the passive participant that life and those around her act upon.You can almost see Dreiser's fearsome awe of the big city, Chicago, and later especially New York, through Carrie's eyes. And Carrie's evolution from country girl to renowned actress somehow had to start in Chicago and end up in New York. Chicago is depicted as a maturing city where young men and women in search of \\"bigger things\\" are often swallowed up by the industrial complex of the city. But at the same, Chicago is still small and collegial enough that a few bright luminaries can congregate at posh bars and dominate the social scene. In Chicago, Carrie rejects hard, manual labor and essentially allows herself to be bought by Drouet as pampered mistress. For a couple of years, as Carrie refines her graces, she gradually realizes that not only will Drouet never marry her but that she doesn't want to marry him. She has grown beyond him and grown weary of her living situation with him.Enter Hurstwood, a more sophisticated man who, unbeknownst to Carrie, is married with two children. Hurstwood has lived all his life by the rules, acquiring status marrying an attractive woman, having two promising children, and slowly amassing wealth -- all goals pursued and attained. He meets Carrie, who makes him realize how unhappy his marriage is and how unnecessary his presence at home is. His children barely respect him, let alone love him. They start a love affair that is discovered accidentally by Mrs. Hurstwood and Drouet. Once Drouet tells Carrie Hurstwood is married, she's hit by the harsh reality of her unhappy situation with the feckless Drouet and the lying Hurstwood. She yearns to leave Chicago to start again.In a sense, Hurstwood and Carrie are each other's impetus for eventually fleeing for New York. But whereas the young and vital Carrie ultimately finds independence and success in New York, the much older Hurstwood discovers belatedly that New York is the beginning of a physical and mental decline for him.There are many explorations of intriguing human foibles in this novel: ego (Carrie's ego tells her she is \\"better\\" than the factory girls she worked with, better than her sister and brother-in-law, and thus her belief that she should not be forced to do hard labor; to some extent Drouet's ego which occasionally deludes him into thinking he will do the honorable thing and marry Carrie but which ultimately convinces him that he is too charming to settle down with just one woman; Hurstwood's ego which stops him from seeking work beneath his dignified position in Chicago and leads him to lingering unemployment and finally poverty and despair), the fascinating mental descent of, happiness and the moving goalpost by which happiness is defined.Also interesting is Carrie's singlehood after achieving independence. She has at this point found her ideal man, but Dreiser doesn't allow his heroine to find love at the end of the story. Why? Is Carrie afraid that she'll be disillusioned yet again by her latest idea of the perfect man or is she somehow not allowed to find happiness?What many have declared as revolutionary is Carrie's success (but not happiness) at the end of the book despite her amorality as defined by 19th century society. I suppose Dreiser's refusal to punish Carrie, as Tolstoy does to Anna Karenin, is a major departure from literature as the final judgment on failed characters. However, the story is almost too indifferent to societal criticisms. A modern reader of today wouldn't be shocked terribly by Carrie's decisions. So in order to understand fully how revolutionary the book is, the reader has to keep in mind the times in which the book was written. What might have been more effective would have been for Dreiser to heap occasional societal scorn on Carrie but ultimately allow her to succeed despite society's disapproval.Overall though, the book is very well written and completely engaging."},{"Title":"Sister Carrie (The Dollar library of American fiction)","review":"Be careful what you wish for, you just might get it is an oldsaying that everyone should take heed of. Carrie is a girl who desires money and new apparel. She comes from an average financial family and feels this isn't sufficient enough for her. She uses two men, Drouet and Hurstwood to achieve her dreams. All the characters of the novel were real and dealt with real life problems. Carrie, in the beginning, needed to pay board and get a job. Although she did not like the job, she still had to have the money to live. This was also true with most of the othercharacters. They were very relatable because you can identify with their problems. Even though they had they share of predicaments, there was not any suspense or major problem that had to be dealt with. Basically, thiswas a novel about the story of Carrie's life away from home. Sure, she had little troubles but nothing that would make you read on the edge of your seat. Even though at the end of the novel she was without problems and had what she wanted, she was not happy. She wished for money and to be like the upper class, and unquestionably she got it, but she didn't have anyone to share it with. Theodore Dreiser's, Sister Carrie, had no real plot or suspense in it.
