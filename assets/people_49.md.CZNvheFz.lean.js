The second one, the one that I read but didn't review was Killing Floor. That was the first novel Lee Child wrote with Jack Reacher.One Shot starts with a sniper killing five people in an Indiana town. The evidence is rock solid against an ex-military sniper who only tells his lawyer to \\"find Jack Reacher.\\" Reacher, as some of you may know, is ex-Military Police, a loner, wanderer. He sees the news of the killings on TV and heads to Indiana from Miami. Apparently, the sniper, James Barr, and Reacher's paths crossed in Kuwait City while both were in the service. Reacher comes to town to bury him. But the evidence against Barr troubles Reacher (even though it is an open and shut case) and he needs to know more. It is the digging for more that lands him in trouble with the police and some nasty, unknown characters. But Reacher can more than handle himself, and everyone misjudges him. That makes for a really entertaining read. Another excellent novel from Lee Child.This is a must read. Lee Child crafts an excellent mystery and Reacher is a great character. I read the last chapter a couple of times, the action and dialog was that good."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"We need a Jack Reacher in real life! This story had me almost cheering on my feet in parts (and I was sitting down reading the book). Jack is a no-nonsense, cut-through-the-garbage, get-to-the-bottom, clean-it-all-up and-set-things-right kind of guy. My kind of guy. I am always delighted to read of Jack's adventures, and this is a great one. I couldn't put it down, which irritated my co-workers to no end. I'm the boss, so tough apples. I continued reading anyway. Wonderful book, wonderful story, an exciting adventure that I hope is never made into a movie. Movies take away the reader's ability to imagine and replace it with someone else's. Who can frighten us better than ourselves. Give this book as a Christmas present to a very good friend who loves action stories. A great book!"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I've read all of Child's 'Jack Reacher' series and I find them one of the best series of thrillers I've come across. But the reviews I've read of his books, comparing Reacher to other characters in mystery fiction, such as Spenser, Travis McGee, and Mike Hammer, miss the essence of Jack Reacher. Reacher is a new version of Robert Howard's 'Conan the Barbarian' set in modern times. He's bigger, badder, and scarier than anyone he runs across, and one is always waiting for the moment when his adversary starts to realize that Reacher is not civilized opponent, but a giant, primitive savage with the instincts of a jungle tiger who will not be stopped or deflected by the niceties of civilized villainy.It's nice to see Conan the Wanderer back again in the guise of Jack Reacher, larger than life, striding through a present day Hyperborean landscape, on his way to....?"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Five people die of gunshots as they leave work and the blame rests on a former military man trained as a sniper. The only person he asks to see is Jack Reacher. No one can find him, but not to worry for Jack is on his way to see the suspect. Jack happened to see the story on television and he's come to fulfill a promise he made the shooter, a man named James Barr.Jack soon realizes that there's more going on here and he decides to find out what it is. It puts him in danger as there are some nasty characters involved in this. It's a tale that keeps you on your toes and eagerly flipping pages to find out how Jack will get out the mess he's in this time. It's a good read, but I've liked a few of the other Reacher books better."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"ONE SHOT is the fifth Lee Child novel that I have read. Although it isn't the best of the bunch, it's definitely a very good read.The plot of the novel is straightforward. A sniper has killed several people in a small city in Indiana. Jack Reacher, the hero of the novel, has a past connection with the sniper, and travels to the city to involve himself in the case. What happens next is a relatively interesting murder mystery.Whether you like this novel depends on whether you like Child's writing style. His books are fun and exciting, but the plotlines are often ludicrous. For example, a key character in the story just happens to develop amnesia at a key moment to advance the storyline. There's also a top marine sharpshooter who just happens to be in the same city and is willing to help Reacher fight the bad guys. And there are at three beautiful women that throw themselves at Reacher in the meantime. Chances of this happening in real life? Less than zero. But that's okay, because the books are not meant to be realistic, anymore than a James Bond movie is realistic.Child also writes in a staccato, rather repetitive style. Characters often \\"say nothing\\" or shrug their shoulders a lot. I don't mind this writing style at all, but I know it bugs some readers quite a bit.All in all, Child's books are pure escapist fun. If you enjoy thrillers, I think you should at least try at least one Jack Reacher novel. ONE SHOT is not a bad choice, although I personally prefer KILLING FLOOR (the first book in the series) or ECHO BURNING (the fifth book)."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. Great job of misleading the reader, without insulting the reader's intelligence.The story started off fast, and never stopped. He had me guessing over and over - what happened?The ending is a climax worth waiting for.Child is a great writer, with a great character."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I was looking for the new Spenser book in my local bullseye-themed maxi-mart, since I was there anyway and had to kill time while my spouse tried on and retried swimsuits. Shockingly, they didn't have it, but they did have this little jewel by Lee Child.I had heard of Child, vaguely, but never read him (in fact, I thought he was a woman). But I had read a review or a blurb or a sentence somewhere indicating that the Jack Reacher books were violent bloodbaths and that appealed to me, so I decided to solace myself with \\"One Shot\\".It was good, people. Jack Reacher is just the right combination of sly, smart and impossibly tough. He is Spenser without the smarminess of Susan. He is Phillip Marlowe, only meaner than the streets he walks. He is The Punisher without the stupid costume. He is a can of whoopass.The plot centers vaguely on a completely unbelievable scenario, a lone sniper killing that unfolds into something more. Once you find out the \\"more\\" you may end up shaking your head and saying to yourself \\"No, that just won't do\\". But if you wanted crisp, seamless plots you wouldn't be reading men's thrillers, would you? So toss that objection aside and just immerse yourself in the coolness that is Jack Reacher and the writing machine that is Lee Child."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"The first-third of the novel was fairly ordinary, set-up plot. I found the second-third quite riveting though. The author has a certain cadence and style that a reader can become accustomed to...like an old episode of Dragnet. The final-third however reads like a made-for-TV movie: heroic journalist; gritty lawyer; dependale buddy; easy-to-kill bad guys, etc.I don't know. If you're heading for the beach, this may entertain you but you'll be hard-pressed to remember a word of this book two days later. I agree with the previous reviewer though...the endlessly repeated phrase \\"Reacher said nothing\\" becomes maddening."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I have loved every one of the Jack Reacher series by Lee Child.He is the ultimate investigator and good guy gunslinger.The only thing that is wrong is that they have picked Tom Cruise to star in the first movie.

He can only stand on a very large box for so long before he falls off.I for one love the books and I will stay away from the movie.This is kind of the same thing that killed the Bourne Identity movies for me.No relation to the book what so ever.So sorry Hollywood has to do this."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I have all the Jack Reacher books. One Shot is a movie set for Fall release starring Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher. Is it me or is this very bad casting. We all know the constant reminders of Jack Reacher and his height and build.

I checked out the audio-book from a local library.The content--story line, Reacher character, and so forth, is great. So is the reader, Dick Hill, when he is just reading the book.The problem is when in the book a woman is talking. Instead of just reading what she says, Mr. Hill tries to imitate her voice. It doesn't work. Mr. Hill sounds like most guys do when they try to imitate a woman's voice: sarcastic, demeaning, annoying. REALLY annoying! Why this was allowed to stand in otherwise very good audio-book I do not understand.It would be better to get the Kindle version of the e-book and let your Kindle read it. You won't have a fine book spoiled by the sound of an amateurish attempt at a man imitating a woman. 2 stars off for that."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"In a small town in Indiana, a sniper kills five people from his perch in a parking garage and sets up former marine sniper, James Barr, for the killings. When questioned, Barr refuses to say anything but finally tells his attorney to get Jack Reacher.Reacher arrives but has no love for Barr. He knows that Barr killed a number of people during his time in the marines. Even though the people he killed in Kuwait City may have deserved thier fate, Reacher arrives with the goal of helping the prosecution.The defense attorney, Helen Rodin, is up against her father, as the prosecutor. Her father has a strong conviction rate and advises his daughter not to take the case.Helen doesn't listen and elects to defend Barr and then convinces Reacher to look at the evidence. When he does, he feels that the evidence is just too good to be true. Then, he begins to systematically discet each part of the evidence against Barr.Reacher was still somewhat adverse to helping Barr but when he leaves Helen's office, someone tries to set him up for a beating. He turns the tables on his attackers and becomes more interested in helping Helen defend Barr.Reacher has the ingredients that a central protagonist of a thriller needs. His military training as a homicide investigator makes him more analytical and his physical size and skills with weapons gives him the tools he needs to overcome his adversaries.This is a well plotted novel. Lee Child has the ability to make the person that Reacher is helping into a sympathetic character and Reacher is the savior that the reader would applaud.There is good character development in particular with the antagonist, The Zek who had been in a Soviet prison, and with Gregor Linsky, a Russian sharp shooter.Parts of the story were predictable and this made me give the novel a lower rating but the novel kept me entertained and wanting to keep turning the pages in order to see how Reacher could overcome an almost impossible objective.Readers will enjoy this novel and cheer Reacher on as he analyzes the situation and figures out a way to save an innocent victim."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"PLOT:In Indiana a former soldier kills 5 people in a crowded plaza and leaves plenty of evidence. Only 6 hours later he is arrested, the evidence is fool proof. The sniper only says that they got the wrong man and wants them to find Jack Reacher. And Reacher is coming anyway because more than a decade ago he made a deadly promise to the sniper. But sometimes even solid cases have holes...OK I admit that I really like this Reacher character so that I can hardly wait for his next book to be published. In general it is always fun to follow Reacher unravelling mysteries. Unfortunately a great character with great investigative skills does not guarantee a great story.How do you find holes in an iron-clad case? That's the starting point for Reacher. Actually a pretty good one but unfortunately what is made out of it is not great as well in this case.Since the police have overwhelming evidence and the sniper is arrested after only 30 pages I wondered what is supposed to happen during the remaining +400! The hunt for the truth is the answer but this search is awfully long and not really too thrilling.During this search you will discover some freakish bad guy characters that you normally only find in books from Carl Hiaasen. To me they were not really believable - especially in the final chapters of the book.There are other flaws in the story that have to be mentioned:Strange but it seems as if Reacher can always walk into anybody's office to get every information he wants to. Nobody ever denies him anything. Why not tell all the evidence there is right to the press? Seems absurd that a simple public person like Reacher is permitted e. g. to the evidence laboratory at the police station.Furthermore it stroke me as odd that I had to read more than half of the book before somebody asks about the motive to shoot these particular victims. The question if it was a random shooting or a specific kill never cam up before. (Reminds me of the flaw in \\"Without Fail\\".)The biggest flaw of the book is its solution. So much trouble and planning for that?! There should have been easier solutions for the bad guys. I don't find it believable.Sorry Lee Child but you can do a lot better.Bottom line:The book is easy to read but not too thrilling. The pace is really slow and overall there is not much happening. The book could be shortened about 100 pages easily.Better read Lee Child's \\"Killing Floor\\", \\"The Visitor\\", \\"Without Fail\\" or even \\"The Enemy\\" instead."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Lee Child's Jack Reacher series continues to grow, remaining vibrant and surprising into Book #8, \\"One Shot.\\" Reacher continues to walk the earth, seeking the solace of not-having-a-plan that only frustrated career military man can know. This time, Reacher is in Miami, enjoying the sights and the female company, when he hears a name of his past on the evening news, James Barr. Seems James Barr shot five innocents in Indiana for no apparent reason. Five head shots, six bullets. So Reacher high-tails it to Indiana, intent on keeping a promise to make James Barr suffer for this sin and a prior one. And this will be a painful reunion for Barr.But Reacher will be astounded that Barr's only statement after being caught as red-handed as red-handed could be is, \\"You've got the wrong guy. Get me Jack Reacher.\\"Reacher finds himself caught up in a diabolical plot involving murder, civic corruption, blackmail, extortion, and the Russian mob. Once again, Child gives Reacher ample opportunities to use his big brain and his bigger fists to blow up a fiendish conspiracy, and thanks to Child's skill, it's not always clear whether its more fun to watch Reacher solve a problem with intellect, a rifle, or raw brawn.Despite some of the rave reviews, I didn't warm up to \\"One Shot\\" as much as I enjoyed some of the other Reacher books. More so than other stories, Reacher stands just outside this one -- Reacher has no affection for Mr. Barr, and his motivation in \\"One Shot\\" is more of a \\"you've made me angry, and you won't like me when I'm angry\\" rather than an emotional connection with the innocent victims - a motivation that Child has used to great effect in other books.That's a minor quibble, I suppose. All the usual high marks of a Lee Child novel are present, including his villain, \\"the Zec.\\" An 80-year old Soviet gulag survivor, the Zec passed insanity a long time ago, but he still has an eye out for profit the old fashioned way, civic corruption. The Zec is such a scary individual that when one of his henchmen screws up one time too often, the henchman willingly digs his own grave and blows his own head off (with a gun handed to him by the Zec) rather than try to escape. Heroes are generally measured by their villains, and Child always gives the reader a doozy.A must-read for fans of Jack Reacher, but if you are new to the series, don't read \\"One Shot\\" until you've read the first seven novels, starting with \\"Killing Floor.\\""},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Jack Reacher as Commander-in-Chief? That has a nice ring to it. Ok, ok, he's only a fictional character and he wouldn't be politically correct. But wouldn't it be fun to see Reacher, who can break cervical spines as easily as you or I scratch, in the same room with the leader of some Third World toilet that insists on baiting the U.S.? Eat your heart out, Dubya.Here, in some anonymous small Indiana city, a sniper goes on a shooting spree killing five, while leaving a trail of evidence so ironclad that the police pick up the shooter, James Barr, six hours after the last shot. Barr's only words under interrogation are \\"They got the wrong guy\\" and \\"Get Jack Reacher for me.\\"Jack is already on his way from Florida, a one night stand with a Norwegian dancer interrupted when he hears Barr's name mentioned on the nightly news. Reacher knows the man well. Years before, when Jack was an MP officer in Kuwait during the First Gulf War, he investigated a nearly identical killing spree involving four Army noncoms. The killer proved to be Army sniper Barr. But James not only got off, but he received an honorable discharge. The dead proved to be American soldiers gone bad, robbing and raping the locals, and the Pentagon needed a cover-up for PR's sake. But Reacher vowed to Barr that, if the latter ever went wrong again, he'd take him down. So, Jack arrives in town to keep his promise if conventional justice fails this time around.ONE SHOT is arguably Lee Child's best Reacher thriller ever; I, for one, won't argue the premise. Jack has always kicked butt and taken names, but here his criminal investigative talents, matched with his phenomenal killing skills and street smarts, combine to yield a literary hero that's truly an unstoppable force. And the main antagonist is no patsy either but The Zec, an old, physically and emotionally maimed Russian whose hardness was honed in Soviet military penal battallions and the Siberian Gulag dating back to the Battle of Stalingrad.In the early 50s TV western series THE LONE RANGER, Clayton Moore's character arrived in town from nowhere, defeated the Bad Guy of the week, and rode out of town to nowhere leaving the grateful citizenry to ask, \\"Who was that masked man?\\" True, Jack doesn't wear any face covering, but the dedicated Reacher fan is perhaps left to ponder much the same after each violent episode in Jack's peripatetic, transient existence below the radar of official America. ONE SHOT is deserving of more stars than this website's rating system will allow, and I'm keen to purchase the next installment, THE HARD WAY."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I knew this day would unfortunately come... I'm now caught up on all the Jack Reacher novels with the completion of Lee Child's One Shot. Another excellent story in the series...A sniper sets up in a parking garage and kills five people as they come out of an office building in a small mid-western town. There's an abundance of evidence left behind, and in short order the police have arrested a retired military veteran who refuses to talk about the crime. His sister is about the only person who believes him innocent, and the only thing he'll say in his defense is to find Jack Reacher. Reacher happens to see the story on CNN and travels to the town because he knows the guy. But it makes no sense that the sniper would want to see Reacher, as it's not the first time he's killed like this. And Reacher promised him that if anything like this ever happened again, he'd personally deal out the punishment. Reacher's ready to help them tie the noose until he starts to wonder why all the evidence so perfectly points back to this guy. And when someone tries to set him up to be \\"silenced\\", it only serves to make him dig deeper. Reacher is convinced there's someone else pulling the strings, but it's all murky as to why. So the question is whether he'll find out the truth before he gets killed, and who in the small town is trying to cover up reality?As with all of Child's novels, the plot twists just keep coming. What is obvious isn't reality, and what's reality isn't obvious. Reacher is able to draw inferences from the smallest observations along with his experience, and then it's a matter of trying to figure why the story doesn't match the observation. I'm never quite sure \\"who dun it\\" until the end, and I keep putting other things off in order to finish the book. One Shot was as good a read as I've had in quite awhile, and I'm sorry that I finally caught up with all the books in the series. The only bright spot is that his next installment is due in May... :)"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"This is, for the most part, typical Jack Reacher, which is not a bad thing. Plenty of action, plenty of mystery. It does not matter if you know who the bad guy is - or, if you think you know - because only one man can figure it out. You guessed it, Jack Reacher.Reacher has a quality that I loved in the earliest Ellery Queen novels. You have all the same facts as Reacher does, yet he is able to see a clue where no one else can. He is a tad more muscular than Queen or Sherlock Holmes, to say the least, so you also get winning fisticuffs and knife and gun fights. He is also braver, or at least has nothing to lose, so you also get spine-tingling sequences when he puts himself at risk. There is rarely nobility when he takes these tasks on. He is doing what he needs to do for himself with the knowledge that no one else can or would do the task. It never seems to matter too much to Reacher why he takes the risks he does, except that it fits into his single-minded principles.Like all the other Reacher novels, this one has those familiar elements as well as Reacher's innate ability to always enlist the aid of a gorgeous woman. Add to it very dry wit and it all adds up to a winning combination.This novel had more police procedural elements than prior Child novels which made it more thoughtful than some. On the down, or at least different, side, Reacher shows a certain cruelty in a few scenes that transcended his previous coldness.Like any of these ovels, you need not read them in order. They each stand alone well.This is the usual fast-paced action mystery Child does so well.

This is my first Reacher yarn, and what a compelling bad-ass he is, heading after the bad guys with the shirt on his back, the shoes on his feet, and killer hands.

He's a loner with a borderline case of &quot;not my problem&quot; attitude. But when he gets pulled in, he puts himself all in and goes all out. He's a sort of hero, not by choice but by carreer. He's left the army, he's no longer enforcing the law but it's in his blood. So when he sees injustice, he gets involved.In this book, Reacher gets involved when he sees a news clip and recognizes a man he once made a promise to : Step out of line again and I will find you.

That six foot five inch not so handsome hunk who weighs 220 pounds.Why on earth would you put Tom Cruise in this role when he had to wear high heeled shoes when photographed next to both his former wives.Shame on you Lee for letting this happen."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"This was my first Jack Reacher novel (after reading it, I have since read all of the rest of them too) and I had picked up curious enough. I really enjoyed it and could not put it down. What an interestly likeable character--you got to be rooting for the guy. The story itself was very different from most crime mystery and you never knew what was going to happen--except that it appeared to be wrapped up in the first ten pages of the book as to who had committed the murders and it is hard to distract from it with the evidence to hand. But, Jack Reacher is involved and not only is it exciting but thought provoking. You'll like it! I hear that it is coming out as a movie with Tom Cruise later this year--can't wait!"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Another good read, not my favorite Teacher story but an entertaining read that should translate to the big screen well."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Great read.

Tom cruise will never BE Reacher. The cover picture was a real turnoff. The book is excellent if you can get past the picture."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I've now read this book twice. I read it some time ago and when I found out that this is the book that they made the Tom Cruise movie &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; about, I read it again. Now most books are better than the movies they make about them so the fact that this one fits into the same category is no surprise. But Jack Reacher is such a great character, and his physicality is such a part of it, that the little Tom Cruise is just not up to the task! Anyway, this review is about the book, and like most of the Lee Child Jack Reacher books, it's just terrific."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I enjoyed the book immensely Jack is my kind of guy, but I never could figure out where he got his money for food, lodging & other expenses. If it's from his savings where did he keep it under his pillow? Also, picking Tom Cruise for this character is terribly miscast."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Child continues to set the bar for action with Jack Reacher.

THEY ARE FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!SHERRILL SESSIONS"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"2 words that describe the book--Action Thriller3 setting where the book took place or characters I met* Setting: Indianapolis, Indiana, present day* Jack Reacher--stud and former military investigator--is getting to intimately know a dancer from a cruise ship in South Beach, Miami when he catches a CNN report about a sniper shooting in Indianapolis. Six shots fired, and five left dead. The reported gunman? James Barr. The name is familiar to Reacher--so much so that he immediately makes his way to Indianapolis (via bus ... Reacher lives off the grid and doesn't have a car). Once there, he presents himself to the District Attorney--and is startled to find out the defense team has already been looking for him. It seems that, before lapsing into a coma brought on by a prison fight, Barr asked for Reacher by name. Puzzled by this request because Reacher has not come on friendly terms, Reacher makes his way to the defense attorney's office.* Helen Rodin is James Barr's lawyer--hired by his sister Rosemary who adamantly denies that her brother could not have been the shooter. Despite what appears to be a slam-dunk case against Barr, Rodin reluctantly agrees to help Rosemary defend Barr--despite the mountains of incriminating evidence against him. After all, a newly minted lawyer can't be too choosy about her cases. Oh ... and one other thing: the DA that is prosecuting Barr happens to be Helen's father. When Reacher appears in her office, they begin examining the evidence and find some things that don't quite add up.4 things I liked or disliked about the book* I'm always up for a good thriller so when Sandy at You've GOTTA Read This! recently extolled the virtues of Lee Child's Jack Reacher series, I thought I'd give a try. I wasn't disappointed. The book moves along at a face pace, and reading it was like going to see an action movie. And goody for me ... there are 15 Jack Reacher books out there for the picking. (One Shot happened to be the 9th book, but Sandy said it was OK to read them out of order.)* If you like a little hubba hubba in your action heroes, then Jack Reacher is your man. He's quite the ladies man, with at least two hook-ups in this book and one implied. For a clue as to why he's such a stud, here is the description provided on the Lee Child/Jack Reacher web site. (Note: It is worth going over there to check out the photos of both Child and Reacher in the site header. Lee Child is pretty good-looking, and there is a nice little shot of \\"Reacher\\" walking down a road in jeans and with his abs showing. Just saying!)Measurements: 6'5\\", 220-250 lbs., 50\\" chestHair: Dirty-blondEyes: Ice blueClothing: 3XLT coat, 95 cm. pants' inseam* It cracked me up to have an action hero who gets to the action via Greyhound Bus and who has to walk everywhere. Although this is my first Reacher book, it is implied the Reacher doesn't have a home base and can't be tracked down unless he wants you to find him. I'm sure this is explained in one of the books, but it made for a bit of a chuckle from me as he was forever taking these epic walks to get places.* As with most books of this type, it is best not to think too hard about the plot and to just go with it. Of course everything is stacked against our hero. Of course there are evil forces at work that need to be uncovered and unmasked. Of course this is a bit of mystery as to who exactly is working for the bad guys. I thought the plot was pretty decent as far as these books go, and there were some exciting action sequences. But if you're looking for something more than just escapist action, you're not going to find it here.5 stars or less for my rating:I'm giving the book 3.5 stars. Would I read another Jack Reacher book again? Yes indeed. Do I think this is a book I'm going to remember in two months? Not a chance! But that isn't the point of these types of books, is it? If you're looking for a fast-paced thriller with lots of action and a studly hero, this book would be an excellent choice. It is the quintessential \\"airplane\\" book and a good one to read between heavier books. And, if you have a reluctant male reader in your home, he might like this too."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Didn't do a whole lot for me. Reacher spends a ton of time in this book walking around, talking to people, just hangin'. Seemed too long, with a lot of padding. Sleep-inducing second act. Nice resolution, I thought, but I felt I like I had waited forever for it. Hope the movie moves a lot quicker..."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Very quick and easy read, Yet very exciting and captivating. Recommend it to anyone who likes a good mystery book."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"One of the best Reacher novels I've read for a while. Really enjoy the suspense Child creates from page to page and this is no exception. Always want more of Reacher due to Child's ability to keep you engaged and interested in both the character and the plot as it unfolds. Looking forward to the next Reacher experience."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Lee Child is one of the greatest writers of this genre, and who not only so deserves all the great acclaim that he receives but also is an author whose books deserve to be on your bookshelves. Often seen as an American writer, for he includes such idioms of the American thriller, his skill and accomplished ability as a master of his craft is apparent. Jack Reacher is Child's 9th thriller based on this particular character, and similarly to the others within this series it does not disappoint! Full of excitement, drama and electric tension this is a story that you will loose yourself within; although one must be careful so as not to get swept away by the terrifying psychopathic killer...In a heartland city thrown into terror, Jack Reacher is soon at the scene of the crime where an accused gunman waits, asking for HIM. Jack is not always looking for trouble and tries to remain as inconspicuous as possible, however trouble sometimes inevitably seeks him out and in this case he is unable to avoid it. When a psychopathic killer and a ex-military cop are linked together, the cogs within Jack's brain begin to move as he endeavors to work out why.Lee Child's thrillers are inventive, with One Shot being totally original and distinctive in its storyline that similarly to authors such as Dick Francis for example, have a whole list of works that are each individual as the next one. Questions such as why Barr kills five people with six shots to then leave a trail of evidence behind, as well as then asking for Reacher. As you delve back into Jack Reacher's past one then is able to connect the bizarre happenings with other events, which ultimately piece together this puzzle. An example would be such as when Reacher was a military policeman, where politics at the time stopped him from pursuing Barr. Why now has Barr forgotten everything? Lee Child is a master of the perverse solution to the set of questions no-one dared to ever ask in quite that way before, and the macho yet sensitive Jack Reacher is one of the more interesting series characters in thrillers. One Shot is a smart set of puzzles which strings the reader along to false conclusions, and a sense of real danger. It also, like its hero, has a heart and is a book that you will totally love.*There is also a film tie-in edition of this book, for the release of the movie (starring Tom Cruise) that is out on Boxing Day 2012*"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"i so love jack reacher his books are never dissapointing but always keep you in suspense bad grammar also but still read able"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"After reading my first Lee Child book I found them fast paced, detailed & action packed.

I wasn't aware of Lee Child or Jack Reacher until I saw the movie but enjoyed both and will continue to read the Jack Reacher series. The novel I read ONE SHOT was enjoyable- easy to follow, enough action to be exciting but not so much I became bored with it.

I read both this book and the previous one in two long, consecutive sittings (easy when you are obliged to rest to recover from a minor injury!) and it was entertaining, undemanding and enjoyable.

Names only and maybe a slight premise of what the book is about but that's all. The book was enjoyable, once I got into it I couldn't put it down.

It appears to be a slam dunk until the suspect asks for Jack Reacher.ONE SHOT has everything that fans of this terrific series have come to expect: a sensational premise, techni-colorful characters, specific settings, a complicated storyline and a strong and bloody climax.There are some bumps in the road here. A female Brigadier General shows up just long enough for a gratuitous sex scene, for instance. And crime/action junkies will get way out in front of plot to easily identify the \\"Mr. Big\\" who's pulling the levers.Nonetheless, the bad guys are utterly terrifying here and Reacher continues to fascinate.

Well done."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I SAW THE PREVIE LAST NIGHT, GREAT MOVIE, the shooouts etc. are top notch, but tom cruise is NO JACK REACHER, the movie loosley follows the book of course, the audio is many times as long as the movie, so there are some consolodations, and there are many camera trix to make TC look taller than his midget self, the wisecracks are GREAT, LOL , Great car chases, and DuVall is his usual experienced self, thank god he's in it!"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"One Shot is pretty standard fare for a Jack Reacher novel. Fortunately for enthusiasts the standard is high. Childs always gives the reader a great story full of characters you actually care about. This story is about a former military sniper who had a serious run in with Reacher years ago. However, when the sniper is arrested for killing 5 Reacher is the person he reaches out to help him.If you are already a Reacher fan you will not be disappointed. If you are not yet a fan do yourself a favor and read this book. You will probably join the legions of us who are hooked."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Same as otherReacher novels but different story.

High quality writing, suspense, thrill, an absolutely smashing plot, and most importantly, fantastic character development. Even in the alpha male world of Reacher, the female characters hold on their own. And even being the alpha male, Reacher is human enough. Even being a tank of a man, Reacher beats the odd only with some responsible help.One may think the Reacher series is all about Reacher the one-man-army, but as with the others in the series, and more so in this installment, the suspenseful plot is the real star. So seemingly disjointed, only to gradually converge into a smashing climax! I have heard this novel has now been turned into a major motion picture, but I can guarantee the movie won't even come close to the thrill of this read.If you ever wanted to sample a Reacher novel, make sure it is this one."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"ONE SHOT (Pub. 2005) is Lee Child's ninth novel and my favorite book in the Jack Reacher series.What I like most is the intricately woven facets surrounding a 'who done it'. Lee layers interesting plot points with subtle but constant tension.Reacher is at his absolute best in this story. He's called into a heinous crime scene in a backwards way. The sniper arrested for killing six people in a public courtyard tells the cops, \\"You got the wrong guy.\\" Then he says, \\"Get Reacher for me.\\"'Reacher's reluctance to help the accused sniper is overshadowed by his certainty that something is not right. I love the way Reacher methodically and ingeniously unwinds the DA's airtight case.Lee manages to give us non-stop tension, an intriguing mystery along with a couple scoops of romance and some cool factoids while he makes Reacher fight and think in his classic Reacher way.

When the smoke clears, five bystanders are dead. Quickly taken into custody, the suspect refuses to answer any questions or offer any explanation. All he will say is \\"Get Jack Reacher.\\"One Shot is filled with the kind of pulse-pounding action and thrills Child writes with the skill of a master. Reacher, one of the most popular characters in contemporary thrillers, is the perfect hero for the action movie audience -- loved by women, feared by men and respected by all.Although Reacher novels are not exactly realistic, you don't read a book like One Shot for reality. You read it to escape from reality. Child helps readers do that better than just about anyone else."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"this was a little slow. All talk talk talk. No action until the end. It wasn't Mr. Child's best effort, in my opinion. that in no way implies that I won't read the next one, because I'll always by a Reacher book, but I'd get this one from the library."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I've read all of the Reacher novels and, up until now, have done so with great pleasure and admiration. In this novel, however, I feel that Reacher has gone over the line from confident to cocksure, from independent to arrogant, and from emotionally elusive to emotionally vacant. All or most of the elements from the other Reacher novels are here, and the result is still very readable, but it's not very compelling. Reacher repeatedly dismisses the dangers posed to him by his adversaries, as though tempting fate, but his low opinion of them proves justified. They're only a little more interesting than the usual central casting Russian mafiosi, familiar types from TV, movie, and literary thrillers of recent decades. On the other side, Reacher gathers together a veritable gaggle of allies, but never appears, and never proves, attached at all to any of them. Three possible love interests appear, but each gets handed off quickly and unceremoniously. One jets in and jets out. Another gets too caught up in her own personal problems. A third shows up late, and is left hanging when Reacher pulls his Lone Ranger exit. In short, there's little here to make for strong suspense, little sense of greater issues at play, and no sense of Reacher being tested or forced to discover new depths to his own character. It's just another episode in his long career of proving himself tougher and smarter than anyone else around - and this time he seems just to be going through the overly familiar motions. With Reacher aging well past his tough guy prime, Child might want to find a way for him to settle down or retire, as gracefully as his violent destiny will let him."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I will not buy Lee Child's books agian they are too ghastly.

Actually I do have to stop occasionally because I'm laughing too hard to read. This one is no exception. Gaping plot holes as usual. Why the heck had Chenko/Charlie been friends with Barr and going shooting with him for years? Just on the off chance he someday needed a sub-par sniper to be a fall guy? And a former Marine (not ex-Marine, Child, you nitwit) who owns and runs a shooting range and only owns one gun?

Jack Reacher (the main character)is unique. The details and speed in which the plot develops haunts you even when you have finished and put it down. ONE SHOT is true to Child's form.

This would make a good movie."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I started with Tripwire and it hooked me, but with the Reacher story you can start with just about any one of them. Just be aware not all of Lee Child's Reacher novels fill in the blanks about the character completely. You have to read several to start getting the full background on him. Very much like the James Bond character took time to flesh-out. Reacher is no James Bond he is much better, more graphically violent, and the kind of un-sophisticated, un-PC guy we all would want to be like if we stopped conforming to society's expectations, plus he is ex-military which always draws me into a character. We'll see if they ever get the movies made that I have heard are in the works. Hopefully it will be the darker style of the books and not cheese version that Hollywood has done with other action figures. Reacher is a good guy, but he does things his way which aren't always the \\"proper way\\" and is what I like about him. Also if you ever wanted to \\"drop-off the face of the earth\\" yet still live life your way, then the Jack Reacher stories are for you."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Great thriller as usual from Lee Child I loved it.

For the police and the D.A. it looks as though luck is on their side with any number of pieces of evidence left behind by the killer. So it doesn't take them long to haul in former army sniper James Barr.Barr says very little to anyone except for making one important request to his lawyer, \\"Get Jack Reacher for me.\\"But Reacher's already on his way from Florida, having seen the drama reported on the news. Surprisingly though, he isn't coming to help Barr. In fact, he's coming to bury him at least, that's the intention when he first hits town. But he's about to find that there's a lot more to this story than first meets the eye.This is a cracking thriller that once again displays Reacher's skills of detective work, intimidation and evasion off to great advantage. He becomes immersed in a convoluted plot that brings him up against an unknown, unseen enemy. He actually only finds out that he has an enemy just before it's too late - and when he does, the fun really begins.The Jack Reacher books are all full of fast action, clever plot twists and headed by an ultra competent protagonist. One Shot falls directly into line with this and fans of the earlier books can rest assured that this is more of the same."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Because the best line in the book is towards the begining when Reacher first comes on the scene.

While ONE SHOT may not be his best, it is very, very good, and remember--Lee Child's next best is way ahead of the rest of the pack. I am always impressed by this native of Cumbria's ability to nail the American landscape. He can do the desert southwest or coastal Maine. This time out Jack is in Indiana.The 'mystery' is not deep or convoluted and the plot is not complex and deeply imagined, but the story is crisp, the characters are interesting, and there are no wasted words. As always, one simply cannot stop reading once one has started. Lee Child owes his entire readership a good night's sleep and we all owe him our thanks for delivering so dependably."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Although PERSUADER has,(seriously) one of the greatest first chapters EVER written in this genre, - and if you don't believe me, ask anyone -- ONE SHOT is another stellar entry in the Reacher series....although not as violent, and not as descriptive in the militaristic/ballistic/forensic detail, this novel will have you racing to the end.I hate the fact that I will have to wait another year for the next installment.Kudos Lee.

Highly recommend for a great summer read!"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"After the first third of this book I was thinking this was going to be Child's greatest. However, as I kept going, the rating dropped. I know Reacher is the superhero in Child's novels but a few things have gotten ridiculous after this many books featuring our main character...As noted before, \\"Reacher said nothing\\", is prominent throughout. Reacher gives the impression more in this novel than any other that he is just a hump on a log without a personality. Has this guy become a dud or what? In the beginning he's bouncing some broad in the Carribean! How did he ever pull that one off!Maybe my memory is off since I read it so long ago, but I remember in Persuader when he fought that guy on steroids that Reacher referred to himself as tall and lanky. Now he seems like the one on steroids. There is no way a guy of his size would have the agility to do a one man raid on a fortified mansion at the end of this novel. No way. It would be like trying to drive an 18 wheeler through Main Street in first gear with nobody noticing!Another thing that is completely ridiculous and has only gotten worse in the Reacher realm is his ability to have a 100% success rate when he has a hunch. \\"There's a puppet master, the lawyer is a bad guy, so and so wasn't the shooter, the mansion probably has infrared cameras.... and on and on.\\"I expect these kind of theatrics and melodramatic endings in movies that last an hour and half, not out of a 460 page novel."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Lee Child is one of the best at this crime novel game, and Jack Reacher is one of the best characters of his type. Child makes him just short of superhuman but never crosses the line to the comic book hero baloney. This is a book with a high speed readability and a plot that satisfies. It's almost as if Child took each bend in the plot and correctly decided just how much difficulty to give Reacher so the reader is perfectly balanced in the tension between Reacher's ability and the vagaries of fate. Really an impressive and satisfying read; a beacon of the genre."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Don't worry. This isn't going to be a summary of the plot.I'm left with a burning question: What in the world were these Russian thugs doing in Indiana? I would have appreciated some explanation. Child leads the reader along with potential ties to the DA with Russian heritage, but it simply becomes too obvious for there to be the connection--simply because of the Russian thing. Anyhow, the plot lacked the simple believability of Persuader--whose quality, frankly, will be hard to match down the road.A major distraction was the non-stop Yankees-based alias system Reacher employed throughout the novel. A minor detail, yes, but it strained me to buy into the notion that Reacher, smart as he is, would waste his time memorizing the MIDDLE NAMES of Yankees players from the 1940s. Give me a break. A guy who can't stand to waste time, and he knows lifetime averages and middle names of all those players? Who is he when we're not visiting him in Child's pages? A freelance sports writer?"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"A lot of books say they will keep you up all night reading.

Overall, the story is far-fetched, particularly the involvement of the TV reporter.

It's the first time I have read anything by Lee Child and I will read everything he has written as fast as I can order the books!His plot is intelligently complex; his story line moves forward at an extremely fast clip; his hero is VERY intelligent, and I would love to meet the guy. (hehe..I'm too old for him) However, he is very believable and wired for suspense and super, very enjoyable reading."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"so far, mr. child only proved that he's a such a talented writer as most talented writers should be. by creating a memorable hero as reacher, some minor flaws (sometimes not so minor) should be forgetable and forgivable. i've found out so many not too logical flaws in all of mr. child's jack reacher series, but those stories are still ingenious. the only letdown during reading of this series is the annoying stack up sentences almost scattered around on every page since his first killing floor, sometimes a bit too pretentious as being the writing style of the author, but once you leaned how to skip them over just get to the barebone of the storyline and scenario, then it's fine. well done again, sir. keep jack reacher from aging too fast, he doesn't have to be like you and us who simply have to become older and older every day, month and, well, year. so keeping him from becoming too old to do some goodwill killings might keep us all to slow the aging process too."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Lee Child is one of my favorite authors when I want to read an exciting adventure.

After questioning the 'sniper' who asks them to find Jack Reacher, Reacher is found on South Beach in Miami with a Norwegian cruise chorus girl. Perfect!!!!! :DLee Child writes a tight storyline and your attention does not waver from side to side at any moment. Reacher gathers together a little clique to help him (including 2 women). The most interesting one is a former Marine named Cash who is one mighty big help to Reacher. Their little banter when they meet was typical Army/Marine. Hope to see this character in future novels.

NOPE! There are pointless conversations, information is revealed by having Reacher explain very basic concepts to people who SHOULD already know these things, everybody ever said nothing - and these are just the stylistic concerns. There's the plot itself - never mind who pays for parking, who befriends an ex-sniper and goes to the range with him for years and pretends to be a s***ty shot in the random event his crazy ass sniper ways might be of use later??I gave the book two stars because I *was* entertained - it's just that my entertainment consisted of passing the book back and forth with my partner while we both screamed at the top of our lungs how bad it is, and drank waaaaaaaaay too much vodka for every time someone said nothing."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Lee Child books keep me up all night and I get nothing done until I've read the whole thing.

Now it's all on Reacher to get to the bottom of things...if he can keep himself alive!This is the ninth Jack Reacher novel, and the best that I have read so far.

I thought the scenario to be unimaginative at first, and then I saw them being featured on the NYT Bestseller list year after year. When I finally decided to give him a shot, I downloaded the sample for The Killing Floor on my kindle. I got to the end and wasn't gripped. I decided I was right all along.Then I heard rumors about a movie based on the series being made with action big shot Tom Cruise. My ears (eyes?) perked up when I read an article that the book that the movie was based on was \\"One Shot (Book 8)\\" not \\"The Killing Floor (Book 1)\\".Perhaps the first book was a fluke, I thought. \\"one Shot\\" must be good!So I gave it a shot (no pun intended), and I loved it. Bought a old used paperback and read it cover to cover in less than two weeks. I started out reading it for 15 minutes on the subway to and from work, and would up lunching alone so I could finish a chapter and then another and another. I finished the second half of the book in a day-and-a-half, thanks to a super long lunch and turned down offers to hang out with my friends. The book was that good.Buy it today. Get it right now."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I have been reading my way through the Reacher series from the beginning, and One Shot was one I had previously read. I would give this one a 9 on the engrossing scale, even the second time around. There are many twists and turns in the plot, and there is no more than the usual Reacher level of violence involved. The connections (and reconnections) Reacher makes with people \\"feel\\" real, and the entire story, while a bit farfetched, is believable."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Have to confess I've only read 7 of the 18 so far, but this really bent my bucket.

Too bad the movie's going to give Tom Cruise -- worst casting choice ever."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9) is another Lee Child book that keeps you interested through the entire story. I am curious as to how Tom Cruise will play the role of Jack as they are so different physically. The Jack Reacher series keeps me coming back for more."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Warning: television comparisons ahead -I'd give this book a 3.5 if I could. This is the first Jack Reacher novel I've ever read, despite it being the ninth in the series. After hearing recent casting news for the upcoming One Shot film, I decided to read it, assuming it was the first. Apparently the author, Lee Child, wrote these books with the intention that they could be read in any order. Mission Accomplished! I had no idea this wasn't the first book.And that segues us into my review. Following former military MP Jack Reacher as he gets embroiled in a murder case in Indiana wherein 5 people are shot in the opening pages, I found enough twists and turns to keep me fairly riveted for 500 pages.BUT, I have a feeling that this series is the literary equivalent of the tv show House. Every book will be good, but also static. I suppose it's the nature of the beast when attempting to wrote what is, at the end of the day, good airport fiction, but I'm going to have to take big breaks between novels. And I will read more, if for no other reason than that I like the novelty of some books being in third person while other are first.Since I haven't specifically talked about THIS book: I see the appeal. Reacher is Jack Bauer if he was MORE confident, meaner, and strong enough to crush an angry Russian to death with his bare hands. That kind of guy is fun as he'll to read about.The two strongest points of this book are the unexpected twists to the Solve A Murder plot, as well as the extremely satisfying climax. The weakest points are how intent the author is in making as aware that Jack Reacher is a Stoic Man. With Gravitas. I get it. He's quiet. Ok. Move on.Also, some of the red herring sidelines seemed a little meandering, but being red herrings, this wasn't completely apparent until I had read the whole thing.Overall I can confidently recommend this book for anyone who is looking for a fun crime novel, anyone who likes protagonists that can't be beaten, and anyone who liked 24.Tl;dr - a solid, fun read that won't take much of your time and may introduce you to a new action psuedohero.Or just wait for the movie."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"But the last fifty are terrible.Reacher's character is defined by his relentless forward motion. You can see how his adversaries make mistakes. He's always coming at them. They are frustrated, angry, confused, and trying to catch up.That makes Reacher a great character to follow. The plot twists and turns inventively. The prose style is clean and efficient.But then the author has to set up a conventional slambang thriller ending, and forces his characters to make one preposterous decision after another. You may wince. You may cringe. What had been a novel turns into a puppet show.If you can't entirely suspend logic and common sense, you may reach the end of 'One Shot' as annoyed as I was."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"After a weak effort with book number 8 in Lee Child's Jack Reacher series, Child comes back much stronger with book number 9, One Shot. Read by Dick Hill, One Shot was entertaining and suspenseful and made a long car ride seem much shorter.Former MP Jack Reacher is in Miami when he hears news that James Barr was arrested for killing 5 people in Indiana. Barr was a former Army sniper who picked off these innocent victims as they filed out of work for the day. The case looks like a slam-dunk and the police are thrilled that there is so much evidence against Barr. Barr won't tell his lawyer anything except to contact Jack Reacher. Reacher and Barr had some unpleasant past history in the Army, and Reacher warned Barr that if he ever got into trouble, Reacher would hunt him down. So Reacher travels to Indiana and starts looking at the case. Something nags at Reacher as the evidence is just too perfect. Still, this isn't Reacher's fight and he's ready to leave town until someone tries to scare him off the case. Reacher finds himself up against a Russian mob that has some inside help from law enforcement. There is danger for all involved, and the Russians will stop at nothing to protect their interests.One Shot is vintage Lee Child with twists and turns and a high-paced plot. Now if only we can get Reacher to carry at least a change of clothes with him in addition to his travel toothbrush."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Tom Cruise is NOT & should'nt be Reacher!!! Please God... find someone else; preferably an unknown who'll potentially be willing to be typecast as Reacher forever."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"\\"One Shot\\" is Lee Child's ninth installment of his mystery/suspense series featuring Jack Reacher, an ex-Army MP. Five people are killed by a sniper as they leave their office on a Friday afternoon. The police investigate and all the evidence leads to a former Army sniper, James Barr. Reacher investigates and finds that the evidence against Barr is, in fact, too reliable and that Barr was probably set up. The rest of the book involves Reacher's pursuit of the bad guys and the bad guys trying to eliminate him.As usual, Reacher is always prepared when the villains attack and he easily eludes his pursuers whenever he needs to. The other characters are typical for this series, including an ex-Marine who tests Reacher's ability to still hit a bulls-eye at three hundred yards. If you're reading Child for the first time, \\"One Shot\\" may not be your cup of tea. Fans of the series will enjoy it, even though it doesn't have the intensity and complexity of some of the other books."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"We've read all eight of the Jack Reacher books and absolutely love this singular character. And in \\"One Shot\\" we found one of the best books we've ever read -- how's that for high praise! First, Reacher is perhaps the best new leading man of this decade: as smart as Nero Wolfe; as honest and personable as a Dick Francis hero; and as physically fit and resourceful as Arnold Schwarzenegger, with the type of will that enables him to break a bad guy's neck without a second of indecision. Second, Child has created a plot with such gripping suspense, we stayed up till 3 a.m. to finish this -- we can't even remember the last time we were up much past midnight! And the supporting cast, including two women, were so appealing, with characters crafted so well, we'd almost like to see more of them as well.The story gets off to a hot start when a sniper mows down (with six rifle shots) five random people innocently leaving their place of work. The guy seems to have expertly planned his attack, yet leaves behind such a wealth of forensic evidence that even a CSI rookie could have followed the trail and snagged the killer, as did the local Indiana small city cops just hours later that night. The arrested man, James Barr, who turns out to be a Gulf War Army sniper, says almost nothing, but finally denies his guilt and asks for Jack Reacher. Reacher hears about the deed on national TV and sets out for the town before he knew he had been tangentially involved. Meanwhile Barr gets almost killed in prison overnight and is in a coma in the hospital. When Reacher shows up and sees the case from the police side, he is also convinced it's open and shut -- and we're left wondering where this is all going. Answer -- into one great story that tracks down the truth from the tiniest of inconsistencies, with little more than caring people to keep the search going strong. When Reacher gets hit on by some bad guys after a setup from a cute townie girl, and then the girl gets brutally offed, he's in the game for good now; and as usual, enraged enough morally to relentlessly chase -- mostly on foot (he doesn't own a car or anything else for that matter!) -- the villains. Finally, it may be that a crooked cop or DA (the defense lawyer's father of all people) may be part of the problem, only adding to the tension! Cap this off with a fabulous ending that leaves everybody happy and satisfied, especially we readers, and what more can we ask for in a novel!We rarely effuse to this extent about a \\"mere\\" thriller, but Lee Child has written a truly great book -- one that grabs our hearts and minds, keeps us involved as the pages fly by, and rams home several hours of first class entertainment. For fiction fans, THE MUST READ OF THE YEAR !!"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Lee Child's main character, Jack Reacher, is the modern day equivalent of a gunslinger. The idea of a man of honor, who served honorably and well in the military of his country, coming back to roam the country unfettered by traditional lifestyles or bonds....well, it makes for compelling plotting (and takes me back to my childhood, with all those westerns in black and white). I've been a fan since the beginning of this series, despite Child's early lack of in depth research and some significant editing problems. In this, Reacher's 9th outing, the newest book, \\"One Shot\\", Child serves up more delicious action as Reacher is drawn into a small city incident of what appears to be terrorism.The sniper shoots and kills six people. He takes few pains at hiding his identity, and he's picked up in a police probe that is a slam dunk. The evidence against him is so compelling that only his sister holds out any hope for the fact that he is innocent. Reacher doesn't want to save him. He arrives on the scene to cement the thought that the man is capable of such an act, citing an earlier act of conduct while in the military that seems to echo in the current shootings. But it doesn't take long for Reacher to become uncomfortable with the circumstances, and with the clumsy efforts of some force, some unknown powers who are framing the sniper and running scared that Reacher will find out.The climax of the story is without parallel, and, once again, Reacher compels the reader by both his various \\"tough guy\\" idiosyncrasies and his ability to extricate himself and others from tense and action packed situations.Now, don't get me wrong, the villains in question are way over the top, both in their plotting and in their identities and foibles. That's pretty much stock in trade for the foes that Reacher comes across in his pursuit of living an anonymous life of a crime buster in these United States. And while Child won't win any awards for his prose, he is, without a doubt, a master of mounting tension and that ephemeral quality of writing so compelling that the book can't be put down. One of the best in this nine book series, you'll enjoy \\"One Shot\\" whether you've run across Reacher before, or not. If you haven't read the series, this book may lead you to do just that.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"If there is a contemporary writer offering more thrills than Lee Child, and a hero more compelling than Child's Jack Reacher, I've yet to find it. \\"One Shot\\", the ninth installment in the Reacher series, is another hard-hitting mystery/thriller true to Child's lean, embellished style. A few seconds of seemingly random violence from a sniper's rifle puts an unnamed Midwestern city in panic. But impeccable police work has the perp in irons within the day, as the forensics lead to Army vet (and former Desert Storm sniper) James Barr. Barr's one request: find Jack Reacher - he'll prove my innocence despite what appears to be a slam-dunk case for the prosecution. The story unfolds, unveiling a prior history between Barr and Reacher, while the initially straightforward case becomes less certain. So engrossing is the mystery that the hardcore Reacher fan may overlook the fact that almost 100 pages have turned before Reacher actually hurts anyone. Momentum builds steadily, taking a few twists while leading to an unforgettable climax guaranteed to knock your socks off.So while there may be nothing extraordinary about the basic plot - it's been done in a million variations - what is extraordinary is the visceral appeal of loner Jack Reacher - the ultimate cross between Clint Eastwood's \`man without a name\\" and Sherlock Holmes. Reacher is justice personified, an irreverent avenging angel who shuns all material possessions in exchange for total independence. Also extraordinary is Child's ability to tell spin a yarn in clear, concise, stripped down prose that keeps the story clean, the dialogue lean, and the pages turning. You'll get no ambiguity from Child (or Reacher, for that matter): black and white, good and evil, and when there is evil, dispatch it quickly and brutally.In short, \\"One Shot\\" is about as good as action fiction gets. The only drawback is that Child only writes one novel a year - it's a long wait till the next rush."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Lee Child's ninth Jack Reacher story begins not with one shot, but with six. A sniper has opened fire on office workers in an Indiana town, leaving five dead. The local police force, through extraordinarily meticulous detective work, finds their man. They have mounds of evidence, the local prosecutor is delighted, the problem is solved. But when they interview the suspect, he says only two things: \\"You have the wrong man\\"; and \\"get Jack Reacher\\". And the problems are just beginning. First, it's no easy task to \\"get Jack Reacher\\". A former military policeman, Reacher has left the Army for a life of wandering; he has no ties to any place or any person - it's not that simple, even for the police, to find a man who has no address, no phone, no tax records. In this case, however, Reacher is already on his way to Indiana; he's seen the news reports of the incident and has his own reasons for wanting to talk to the prisoner. And that's the second problem; from the moment Reacher arrives in Indiana we, and everyone else involved, discover that nothing is as it appears. And Reacher, as always, is determined to do the right thing at any cost.From the first paragraph to the last, this book is a thrilling ride, containing all the wonderful elements readers have come to expect from Lee Child's writing: meticulous plotting, riveting action, unexpected humor, and of course, Jack Reacher - one terrific hero."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"As my rating indicates, I found this thriller by Lee Child to be not only extremely compelling as the story rushed towards its crescendo, but also extraordinarily enjoyable as well. The factor that most differentiated ONE SHOT from the majority of other thrillers was the author's wonderful use of seemingly minor details to bring his central character Jack Reacher (and a few of the other characters as seen through Reacher's eyes) into extremely sharp focus for me as a reader. This is the first novel by Lee Childs which I have read, so I cannot compare to the previous eight entries in the series. Instead, I will have to leave it to Child's fans to comment upon whether the formula has gotten stale and repetitive for readers of the series; on the other hand maybe the author has gradually improved as he has honed his skills and perhaps I happen to stumble upon the volume which represents his arrival into the circle of the superior writers of this genre. In any event, this novel is very engrossing on a standalone basis as a ONE SHOT read; during the course of the story the author certainly inserts the necessary background material concerning Reacher's past to provide sufficient context for a reader to fully understand the context of Reacher's actions. There is no tedious detail, it is simply worked into the story; I also appreciated the lack of references to past exploits which can so frequently frustrate readers who attempt to read a recent entry in a long running series with which they are unfamiliar. While I applaud the author for this feature, it is also made easier for him to accomplish by the fact that Jack Reacher is a man who lives off the grid - in effect a man with no face, no forwarding address, and seemingly a man who has effectively ceased to exist. To paraphrase his comment to the detective who doesn't believe his alibi, maybe he really is Joe Gordon. (Yes baseball fans, that is the Joe Gordon who you think it is.)The storyline is simplicity itself. A typical Midwestern city in the heartland of Indiana is briefly plunged into chaos when a sniper fires six shots into the crowd exiting a city plaza during the evening rush hour. However the panic is defused when incredibly thorough and very speedy police work by the crime scene investigators allow them to arrest a suspect (James Barr) within hours of the deaths of the five victims of the apparently deranged gunman. The police believe that the case is ironclad; Barr won't say anything until his sister Rosemary finds a lawyer to represent him. He then utters two brief sentences \\"They got the wrong guy\\" and \\"Get Jack Reacher for me\\". While his request provides insurmountable difficulties for the defense team since they cannot even determine who Reacher is, Reacher fortuitously learns of the events in downtown \\"heartland city, Indiana\\" and heads there not to help Barr but with the intent of making sure that he is convicted of the horrible crime of which he is accused. Imagine how shocked he is when he arrives there and discovers that Barr has requested his presence despite the knowledge which he possesses concerning the highly classified secrets of Barr's past. However, he becomes suspicious when it becomes clear that the rush to arrest someone for the crime has left several inconsistencies despite the supposedly airtight case. The more he learns, the more these questions gnaw at him. Thus, he decides to briefly stsay around and work in the shadows alongside Barr's young and inexperienced new counsel (hired after Rosemary realized that her brother's original lawyer was interested in a quick disposition of the case rather than defending her brother). An interesting twist is that Barr's new lawyer is Helen Rodin, the daughter of DA Alex Rodin, whose caution in choosing which cases to try means that he has never lost a major prosecution which he has undertaken. Reacher gradually begins to unravel the complexities surrounding the supposedly random shootings; then his shadowy opponents manage to limit his flexibility by diverting him from Barr's case through the need to prove himself innocent of a heinous crime of which he is soon accused.Most of the character development is limited to the extent needed to make the story internally consistent, but the major villains (Linsky and the Zec) certainly are interesting and the characters of Gunny Cash (who was featured in a small but essential part) and Ann Yanni (in a crucial and quite substantial supporting role) were sufficiently developed to be very enjoyable. In fact, the interchange between Reacher and Yanni concerning George Orwell which developed into a brief episode of dueling quotations was one of the unexpected small touches which made this book so enjoyable for me. And long time fans of the series even get to meet an individual from Reacher's Army past, (now) Brigadier General Eileen Hutton, who is one of the links in the chain that might tie former Army sniper Barr to Reacher as well as these shootings.Is this story realistic? Of course not! Would the series of coincidences combined with Reacher's extraordinary powers and unbelievable investigative ability strain your credulity if you sat back to analyze this book as you were reading it? Of course! In this regard this shares the attributes of all great thrillers, they suck the reader into the story - the action is so fast paced and forces of evil opposing the lone hero seem so the powerful that the reader is captivated by the flow of events and his desire to learn how good will triumph in the end and who will have died along the way. The great thing about this book is that it accomplishes its goal while Reacher is still managing to have fun. He attempts to romance his former superior officer, then later he flirts outrageously with Ann Yanni despite the deadly game in progress. His methodology for choosing his identities and the background role of sports in this book will delight all sports fans and was the touch that caused me to add a plus to my rating of five stars to indicate my total enjoyment of this book,So this is a thriller with a superhero as the central character - a police procedural with an investigator of unmatched abilities - and finally an action story detailing how Reacher's hastily assembled army of irregulars (including Ann Yanni and Helen Rodin) supplemented by ex- Marine Gunny Cash fulfill their assigned roles and allow him to execute his fiendishly clever plan for righting the wrongs which have so offended his sense of justice and morality. ONE SHOT hit all the right notes for me, and while may of the nuances which I enjoyed so much may not be quite as appealing to a broad range of readers, I think that most individuals who enjoy this genre will agree that this is a well above average entry in that category. Finally, this is not a book to be skimmed for the plot - both the enjoyment and the genius is in the details. And when you reach the conclusion you will understand the applicability of the title, despite the fact that six shots were fired on that fatal day that set all this Jack Reacher adventure in motion.Tucker Andersen"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"The gun man fired six shots, killing four males, one female, and one miss with the five KIAs all shot with precision in the head. Law enforcement believes a military trained sniper caused the massacre. The military database leads to nearby resident, ex Infantry Specialist James Barr. Warrants allow the cops to search Barr's property where further proof surface. Within six hours, James is arrested for mass murder.James fails to respond to any inquiry from the DA except to calmly and quietly whisper they got the wrong guy but also demands they get him Reacher. Hearing the news of the slaughter and subsequent arrest, Reacher is on the way to the city even before Barr's strange request. He knows that Barr has done this before, and there is cause to see the man executed this time around as Barr escaped with no real punishment with the previous incident. To his chagrin, Reacher believes Barr's plea of innocence, and joins the defense team trying to prove the impossible as their client refuses to accept an insanity plea.Though there seems an obvious conflict of interests between the two legal teams and Reacher's disdain for the accused, who he considers the ENEMY, it leaves him less frenzied than normal. ONE SHOT is a fabulous investigative legal thriller. The story line is action-packed as all Reacher tales are while the hero struggles with an ethical dilemma that slows his normal wacky pace yet makes him seem more human. The climax will blow away the audience as Lee Child provides a powerful thriller that fans of the series will relish.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"When you're in a tight spot...... being handed a bad rap...... and need someone who, once committed to your case, will relentlessly pursue the truth, the man to call on is Jack Reacher.Large in physical stature, expert in weaponry and hand to hand combat, an ex-military investigator with an analytical mind and the deductive powers to ferret out the truth no matter how convoluted the clues, Reacher is a man to be reckoned with.A man's man; he's a strong, silent, low-maintenance kind of guy, who travels the country with just the clothes on his back, a few bucks in his pocket, and a penchant for checking into hotels and registering under the names of obscure baseball players. The fact that he wears each set of clothes for four days and then buys new duds at a local second hand store may be a bit of a turn off for the ladies in the audience......but the females in the story don't seem to have a problem with his personal hygiene.Called upon by a defense attorney to investigate what appears to be a random act of violence committed by a sniper, he slowly becomes convinced that the air tight, slam-dunk case the cops have built against the accused is just a little too perfect and proceeds, in typical Reacher fashion, to chip away at the \\"details.The story itself really strains at the bounds of credibility.....but we're here to be amused and entertained, and author, Lee Child delivers on that count. He manages to occupy our interest, keep us engaged, and in the process gives his readers a lot of \\"bang for the buck\\".Oh yes, one last thing.........if you think I was exaggerating when I said that Reacher was the strong, silent type.......count how many times you read the phrase \\"Reacher said nothing\\" in this book!!!"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"... and Lee Child delivers.What a relief. A book in a continuing series that lives up to the tradition of its predecessors. Some of my favorite suspense and crime fiction authors seem to be \\"phoning it in\\" on the later books in their series, but Lee Child isn't one of them. \\"One Shot\\" is a very good book.Jack Reacher, the continuing character. If you haven't met him, you should. He's a man's man and woman's man, um, too, if you know what I mean. Child manages to build Reacher as both the ideal macho man and a guy intelligent and moral enough to treat the women in his life with respect (and a little bit of lovin').The plot of this book revolves around a ghost from Reacher's MP past. A mass murder is committed and the obvious culprit calls for Jack Reacher before the culprit lapses into amnesia. No one knows who Reacher is or how to get in touch with him but, no matter, Reacher is already on his way. He has a promise to keep and Reacher always keeps his promises.If you step back and ask yourself, after reading, just how much of the plot is actually plausible (especially the fantastic yet satisfying ending), the answer is, not a whole heck of a lot.I wasn't asking myself those pesky plausibilty questions while I was reading, though. I was turning each page as quickly as I could to see what happened next and yes, that's good suspense fiction.Lee Child makes his readers happy. I do hope that writing these books makes Child happy and that he won't start phoning them in any time soon.My only regret is having read the 9th Reacher in hardcover and having so long to wait for next one."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Lee Child rocks. Jack Reacher is definitely not your typical serial hero. Much tougher than nails, smarter than whips, and almost utterly without emotion except a strong urge for \\"just\\" revenge. Reacher, in short, is the perfect cop - his abilities are super and they are well detached from fine sensibilities. Like Dirty Harry on a combination of espresso and testosterone, Reacher shows up on the scene to right wrongs, but he never pre-judges the outcomes of his investigations. Too much usually happens, and he knows it does, to make the obvious solution often the right one.Child is not the most sensitive of writers (if you want beautiful prose with your cops and murders, buy James Lee Burke), but he is a superb plotter. Though the other characters are often not well developed (how can they be when they die so prematurely, so often?), they do have a certain ring of authenticity to them. And Reacher is a gem -- the kind of guy you think and hope to God the U.S. military is actually full of -- supremely competent, brutal beyond belief and yet intrinsically decent. Lee Child, a Brit, has given us the quintessential American hero. God help us all."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"In one of the best Jack Reacher adventures so far, author Lee Child sends his wandering protagonist up against Russian-American Mafia villains and their high-placed American allies. Jack hears that James Barr, a former Army sniper he knows from his service in Kuwait during the first Gulf War, is accused of ambushing and killing five civilians in a Midwestern U.S. city. The evidence against Barr is concentrated, massive, and concusive. Reacher reluctantly helped cover up Barr's similar slaughter of civilians in Kuwait and is determined that Barr will not escape punishment this time.Reacher finds that police and city authorities do not want his information or his help. Worse, the Russian Mafia members and their allies want him dead. As Reacher works to clear himself from false charges and separate the guilty from the victims, he has the help of the lawyer-daughter of the prosecuting attorney, a television anchorwoman, and a former lover who is now a JAG Army general, gorgeous all--and all available. Additionally, Reacher works with detective, sniper, law, medical, and psychology experts to sort out and overcome plot puzzles and intrigues, all the while trying to protect his cohorts and himself from very real and painful dangers.The action is constant, the suspense agonizing, the plot turns are surprising, and the ending is satisfyingly complex. Child's writing style enhances the action and the suspense. He has the ability to help readers willingly suspend belief and embrace the fantasy; for example, his use of the anchorwoman in the shootout at the end of the book. It all seems so natural and inevitable as readers follow Child's hypnotic lead.Reacher is a throw-back to the lone, intriguing stranger of the cowboy novels and movies genres, even to his fading away at the end of the story. His chararacter and that of John Wayne in the film, \\"The Searchers,\\" have a lot in common.Child introduces Gunny Samuel Cash, a retired Marine sniper, who emerges as one of the best-rounded and believable characters Child has created. Cash's deliberate manner, likable persona, and quick adaptation to Reacher's ways would make him a good sidekick in future adventures."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Lee Child's recurring character Jack Reacher is such an interesting guy and the stories are great fun to listen to.I was really irked to see that Tom Cruise was cast to play him in the movie...being a bigger than average man is part of Reacher's charm"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"This was an easy read.

The e-book starts out with a well written intense scene. There is a lot of good detail in the story. Sniper, gun fire and confusion cause the story to start to unfold as you read it. I am a fan of the series with Jack Reacher as the main character even though the action takes a little bit too long to get to, for me. The Author Lee Child does a good job writing this e-book and this series but, I find myself drifting off and trying to stay with the stories. Some of the technology is questionable for the time period (phone booth). There were three typographical errors in the e-book. One of the sentences was really messed up. The copy editing was done automatically by a computer, because there were words that were spelled correctly but they were the wrong words. The formatting of the e-book was done very poorly. There were large spaces in-between words throughout the e-book. There were problems with the spacing between the paragraphs throughout the e-book. The Author Lee Child has a big name in the industry. I expected a better overall quality in the e-book seems there were a lot of short cuts taken. Feel a little cheated expected better publishing quality. Overall this is a much better than average story. This is a good well written story with good to excellent Dialog, Plot, Tension, Suspense, Character development.

I might be wrong but I suspect that that isn't Lee Child's purpose. What you get instead is a good dollop of wish-fulfilment, good writing, beautiful, intelligent and feisty females who are either integral to the development of the plot or just along for the ride, and implausible story lines! One shot is no exception - why change a winning formula? In Reacher, Child has created a character who is, perhaps, not quite the guy who every other guy wants to be (and with whom every woman wants to be?), well, at least not permanently. But it might be nice for a couple of weeks to: be able to kick ass as effectively as he does, to never be wrong, to be able, correctly, to second guess all the villains' moves and then to ride off into the sunset with a clear conscience and no dangling strings! But in common with all of its predecessors, and despite the implausibility of the plot, One Shot doesn't last a few days let alone a few weeks, it's a real page-turner. In a genre full of world weary, divorced, alcoholic, guilt ridden cops Reacher is a breathe of fresh air - the closest thing to Casey Ryback outside of the movies!"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"This is my second adventure with Jack Reacher and it has been the best so far. So good that I succumbed and have ordered all of them.The apparent villian in this book, a former army sniper by the name of James Barr has been arrested and charged with murdering five innocent people as they left work on a Friday afternoon. The arrest comes quickly after the killing. The evidence is overwhelming. They have the rifle, the clothing, the ammunition, the shoes, the vehicle and they can match everything to the crime scene. Even to the point of finding a quarter in the parking meter where the shooter parked with Barr's fingerprint on it. How much more does anyone need?None as far as the police and the DA go. Barr is not talking when he is grabbed by the police except to say \\"You've got the wrong guy\\" and \\"Get me Jack Reacher.\\"Reacher is already on the way to Indiana where the shooting took place after hearing about it and Barr's name. However, he is not coming to help Barr. He is coming to see that he is put behind bars forever.How he gets from that mind set to investigating the many facets of the crime and all the other aspects of what is going on is one great read.

STILL,I can't put the books down. I shake my head at the audacity of Child and the outrageous plots and characters and just keep reading.

An elderly reader might ask then, of a story that stresses repeated attention to descriptions of roadways:Reader: So after all of that, you do not at least say good-by to the fourteen year ago flame in your life who reappeared and risked her career for you, and more, and who you took a shower and got a hair cut for?Reacher: \\"Reacher said nothing.\\"Volume 11 of the Reacher novels: Jack Reacher takes the Greyhound to Berkeley."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I enjoyed the novel, although the plot was a little too obvious.I am also appalled by the casting of Tom Cruise as Jack in the new movie, because he does not suit the role, in either stature or character. 6'6&#34; and 250 pounds would not be my description of Tom Cruise.I believe that Hugh Jackman would have been a more appropriate choice becaue of his size and his ability to accurately portray the character who has been created and described so well by Lee Child."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Unbelievable but fun as Jack cures the evils of the world while on shanks mare.

Actually, instead of borrowing paperbacks from the library, we now are buying hardcovers of each new Child's book - which is something that in our house is never done for thrillers.And no, I am not going to tell you, what is this book about. It is suspense, after all. Just read it."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"There is something in Lee Child's novels, which I can't quite put my finger on, that I really like, that keeps me turning the pages even though I kind of sigh about them. I find them phenomenal page turners, and this was his best yet.There is the formulaic side to it - Reacher is tall, not given to baring his soul, or even discussing much - he knows what is right and wrong and prepared to walk on the wrong side of the law in order to uphold what is right. And you always know he will survive because he lives on his wits. There is almost a western quality about him, he roams America staying in hotels, his only possession seems to be a toothbrush - he doesn't carry keys, because he doesn't own anything - not even a spare change of clothes, when they need cleaning he just buys new cheap ones.One Shot starts with the set up to a sniper incident, we follow the man in , follow his steps and the shooting, and then the aftermath. The shooter is dumb enough to leave a trail and is quickly tracked down. But he isn't talking, not even for his defence attorney who has been brought in somewhat reluctantly - the only thing he says is \\"Get Jack Reacher for me\\".It is a great set up as it turns out and Reacher has his work cut out for him. Firstly because Reacher has already dealt with him before, as a Military Policeman when he was convicted of a previous sniper attack in Iraq - and secondly because the man is now in a coma after a near fatal attack while in custody and so can't talk to Reacher at all.It is left to Reacher to unravel the evidence and figure out that the evidence is just a little too air tight, that there are too many clues that point to the fact that he did it - and yet everything points to the fact that he couldn't possibly have.And someone in town is behind the set up - one of two men which Reacher has to work with - and they are being used by what seems to be a Russian underworld organisation.Lee Child is great at making near impossible situations for Reacher to get himself out of. The books are part mystery, part action/adventure sort of in the style of Robert Ludlum crossed with Wilbur Smith.The only thing I really dislike about them is the sex, it seems obligatory now for Reacher to have a bit of a bonk in each novel and they always seem corny and not quite right - maybe Child thinks we'll assume the worst of Reacher if he doesn't have a woman to 'love' in his own transient way. But I just don't feel it is necessary to an otherwise great story"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"\\"Yesterday upon the stair, I met a man who wasn't there...\\" Jack Reacher had been a major in the military police. He has become a non-person. He does not appear anywhere in the records - no driver's license, no credit cards, no permanent address or voter's registration. He travels by bus, stays in cheap motels or hotels, uses ficticious names (currently the names of second basemen from years past), pays cash, and changes clothes every four days (he does not believe in luggage). His source of income is unknown.When six people are shot in a midtown plaza, the suspect asks for Reacher, someone he had known 14 years earlier during the Gulf War in Kuwait City. The problem is that Reacher wants to put him away, so why did he ask for Reacher. Reacher shows up on his own, having seen a report on TV while playing house with an airline stewardess in Florida.All is not as it seems. The evidence in the case in ironclad, perhaps too ironclad. It implies that the suspect would have been incredibly clumsy, and does not match the actions of a trained sniper. And why only six shots?? The people killed are all seemingly non-entities - hardly the people who would be targeted by an assassin.Reacher is getting ready to leave town when he is set-up and attacked, not a good move as he is tougher than the attackers. So now he stays around. He discovers a company as mysterious as himself, operating as a subsidiary of an offshore corporation with no local listing.People with knowledge end up missing. Someone is covering their tracks. Reacher gradually unravels the case, and there are some surprises. Along the way he acquires some temporary allies, including an ex-marine and a TV news anchor. He leaves the final wrap-up to others as he fades from the scene.When last seen he was on a bus heading for Seattle. Readers will need to wait for the next case. It might be in Seattle, but he might change buses."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Lee Child's \\"One Shot\\" is the ninth in a series of action dramas featuring tough, violent, yet impartial protagonist Jack Reacher. Reacher a former crack investigator with the U.S. Army military police has been drifting around somewhat aimlessly since leaving the service. He was now shacked up with a shapely dance instructor in a Miami Beach hotel. While channel surfing the television he inadvertantly came across a CNN report of a sniper shooting killing five civilians in Indiana. The quickly apprehended alleged shooter's name James Barr set off loud alarms from within Reachers' memory.Reacher had lead a perplexing investigation back in 1991 during the Gulf War in Kuwait City. Four army personnel had been gunned down by a sniper, who turned out to be none other than James Barr. Army brass decided that due to the tawdry and criminal backgrounds of the victims the crime should be covered up and classified. Reacher with definite moralistic views of justice felt compelled to trek to Indiana to assure that Barr wouldn't get away with these new transgressions.Reacher ambles his way to Indiana and discovers after meeting with local D.A. Alex Rodin and lead police investigator Emerson that there is an airtight case against Barr. There is a plethora of physical evidence implicationg Barr. What troubles Reacher is that there is too much evidence. Fearing some kind of conspiracy he commences his own investigation of the incident.Reacher aided by Barr's sister Rosemary, Barr's attorney Helen Rodin, daughter of the D.A., local t.v. newswoman Anne Yanni and others, endeavors to find out what really happened. As Reacher closes in on the truth, more dead bodies begin to pile up and his own life becomes imperiled.The vigilantism displayed by Reacher has a great deal of righteous appeal. In Child's fictional world where bad guys pay dearly for there crimes, it's reassuring to have guardian angels like Reacher mete out justice."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"OK. What do you like about your fictional heroes?Moral OutrageFearlessnessDroll sense of humorBulk, speed and hitting THROUGH objectsSlow to anger, swift to punishLoyalExtremely analyticalUnlimited retribution if you cross HIS lineHigh intelligenceLow maintenanceOf course Reacher has all of this. Thank goodness there's another Reacher story to entertain us. But it's like a fine old Scotch, though. You want to hold off drinking it. I've had the new book for about three weeks now because I just knew when I picked it up I wouldn't be able to put it down.Here sniper fire kills 5 civilians in Indiana. The only clue for the reader is the substantial amount of forensic evidence against the man the police arrest, Barr, who happens to be a Gulf War vet and, naturally, a feared sniper. He does not break in the subsequent interrogation but finally makes just one request. Jack Reacher.What I found particularly intriguing about \\"One Shot\\" was the clues. Mr. Child leaves many around but with Gospel like promise, 'many are called but few are chosen.' He does that a lot, have you noticed? He does that with \\"Echo Burning\\" when Carmen leaves a message for Reacher that she was a \\"street stroller.\\" I missed the clue and as he later admits a few hundred pages later, so did Reacher. See Mr. Child leaves worthless clues that Reacher and we ignore, important clues that both Reacher and we get, some clues that we miss but Reacher gets, and some, I guess, that we both miss.The interesting thing about Reacher (well, one of the interesting things) is that he grows from novel to novel. This seems to produce two effects: 1) the books can stand alone but they do refer to other people in other books like his brother Joe and Jodie and General Garber. And, 2) you get to look at the whole work. It's almost (don't laugh at me here) like Dumas writing the Three Musketeers. It starts off with 1, then 2, then 3 stories but eventually grows in its entirety to become an entire piece unto its self. They're not related but they are.Jack Reacher may not be the guy you want to hang out with. Hell. He doesn't want to hang with anyone. But when the stuff is hitting the fan, there's no one else you want to have around. He's John Wayne, Steve McQueen, Clint Eastwood all in one. He's 'Whistling Dan Wheeler' bringing the airliner into California with no fuel left and Alan Ladd riding off into the sunrise with that obnoxious kid yelling after him. He da man! 5 stars. Fantastic ending. Great stuff. Larry Scantlebury"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"This is the 1st Jack Reacher book that I have read. It was interesting and was suppose to be a thriller which I usually love. However I felt as though this book fell flat.The book does move along and does unfold little by little but the entire book wraps up and exposes the truth in 2 pages.The one thing I did really like is that the main character didn&#8217;t come in to prove the bad guy didn&#8217;t do it. He was there to prove that he did do it and make sure he paid the price for it, which I found to be original.

We know who he or she is, we're familiar with that person's personality quirks and ideals. Jack Reacher is a favorite with millions.For me, it all began with The Killing Floor and I was hooked. Thanks to British author Jim Grant who writes under the pen name Lee Child I met Reacher, a stoic tough guy who has several uncanny abilities, such as knowing exactly what time it is without referring to a clock. He's a former U.S. Army Military Police Major. He's a terrific fighter with an immense technical knowledge of weaponry and prefers being alone.A movie was filmed late last year based on this novel starring Tom Cruise. My problem with that is I know Reacher is 6' 5\\" tall, weighs about 250 lbs, has blondish hair and ice blue eyes. No offense to Mr. Cruise but decided I'd simply listen to Dick Hill's compelling narration. What can I say, Hill (yes, the actor with a mantel-full of awards) has narrated 8 Reacher novels - he simply is the voice of Jack Reacher.One Shot is aptly named - six shots have been fired but only five fatalities. Well, the cops are on top of these slayings and within hours the shooter is behind bars claiming his innocence and hollering for Reacher. Well, Reacher knows this shooter and doesn't hesitate. Did I mention Reacher's intelligence? Not only does he know the shooter but is aware that the man is a trained military sniper and would not have missed a shot.One Shot is another pulse-pounding trip to an explosive finish enjoy!- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"How would anyone ever believe that a sawed off little runt like Tom Cruise could ever portray the magnificent 6 foot something Jack Reacher?

What a guy --- Triple X, Indiana Jones and Don Quixote all rolled into one. Lee Child has brought his series hero through some impossible situations, yet with each new book he maintains a level of interest and suspense that is seldom found so consistently. ONE SHOT grabs you in the first few paragraphs and doesn't let go until the last sentence.For those who haven't yet had the pleasure of meeting Jack Reacher, he is retired from a fourteen-year stint in the Army as a Major in the Military Police. He is not only a crack investigator but also a marksman, weapons expert and survivalist. In addition, he's a handsome rascal who knows how to charm women in several different languages. And, while he can be merciless toward his enemies, he is fiercely loyal to his friends and is willing to put his life on the line for anyone who has been victimized by the bad guys. However, he guards his freedom and has nothing to tie him down. No apartment, no car, no cell phone, no credit cards --- only a few sets of clothes and a toothbrush, living the totally feng shui-ed life.In ONE SHOT, our hero is enjoying the Florida sunshine with a dancer from a Norwegian cruise ship. Meanwhile, up in the heartland, a sniper has gunned down five people, and when he is caught he claims his innocence and asks for Jack Reacher. Although the shooter was never a friend, James Barr had been stationed with Reacher for several years. During that time, in a weird series of events, Barr had opened fire on a military group yet had never been indicted. Reacher heads north hoping that he can testify for the prosecution and finally see Barr brought to justice.Almost from the beginning of his involvement, Reacher's suspicions are aroused because the airtight case against James Barr appears to be too perfect. Soon Russian Mafia types are tailing him and innocent people are being killed and kidnapped. Meanwhile, the mutilated, mysterious Russian, Zec, and his henchmen always seem to be one step ahead of the police, adding another dimension of suspense.In ONE SHOT the author provides Reacher with a competent and compatible back-up team as our hero unravels the mystery. Deftly, Child holds back just enough to build tension and keep the reader from getting ahead of his characters. When the climax is reached, loose ends are tied up and the good guys win. Perfect. This is Lee Child's eighth novel, and he soon should be rocketing to overnight success."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"...as reportedly they have, along with (please, Lee, just say no) Tom Cruise.This ninth thriller in the Jack Reacher series from author Lee Child is a case in point as to how difficult it is to create a realistic, believable character and perpetuate the idea over a series of novels.I jumped into the Reacher series with The Killing Floor, and have since bounced back and forth catching up. For those who don't know, Reacher is basically an updated version of Clint Eastwood's The Drifter from Sergio Leone's seminal spaghetti western, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: He's a huge, musclebound man's man; a brilliant, ex-military cop who now wanders around America with just the clothes on his back, seeing the sights and supplimenting his government pension with the occasional odd job; righting dastardly wrongs in a new town in every new book, after which beautiful women 'ooh' and 'aah' and throw themselves at him.Child's writing has improved dramatically over the course of this series: one of my earliest problems with Child's style being his choppy prose and almost forced use of short plain sentences, to the point that he's almost dictating the seemingly endless pages of unnessesary exposition (Reacher got off the bus, feeling groggy. He walked to town. He found a restaurant that was open early. Sat with his back to the wall so he could watch the doors and the rest of the customers. The waitress came by, smacking gum. Reacher ordered an omelet. The scarred man at a table across the room stared at him menacingly.), and his fascination with precise descriptions of weapons and ammunition (Reacher ate his omelete. Drank his coffee. Put down his cup. Then he shot the scarred man between the eyes with a single bolt-action carbine M16 that uses spring-loaded, ten-gauge buckshot specifically used by the Russian army circa February of 1962...) and on and on.Okay, so that was just a silly example of my own, but not far off. And after nine books with pages and pages of prose like that, it gets distracting. And something else, while I'm on a tangent: for somebody who was supposed to be such a great investigator, Reacher just doesn't seem all that freakin' smart. He just kind of lumbers around until the bad guys jump out at him, firing with all barrels blazing.Don't get me wrong - I actually like these books. They're deftly plotted, quick and fun James Bond style summer-type reads with plenty of no-hold barred action. This is just fair warning to make sure to actively suspend your disbelief while reading them.And now, to One Shot. Here, as with all the Reacher novels, the action starts at the very first page. No slow build up - Child just dives right in. The story begins as a sniper methodically assassinates five apparently random civilians - bang, bang, bang - miss! - bang, bang. The police have a suspect and a slam-dunk case built mere hours after the killings. Reacher learns of the case - and of the killer - that night, while watching television in a hotel room (after getting picked up while tanning on a Miami beach by one of the aforementioned Beautiful Women).Reacher is once again pulled into a new web of danger because of a name out of his past, and immedately leaves for Indiana, and the site of the shootings. He wanders into town with theme music blaring (Whaa-whaa-whaa!), a la Eastwood; ready to kick ass and take names - or at least make sure the man arrested for the killings (ex-military specialist James Barr) goes down for the count. In due course, Reacher learns not everything here is exactly as it seems - Barr claimed the cops got the wrong guy, before slipping into a coma after a random beating while in prison, and now his estranged sister want justice. Reacher begins to investigate, learning that the whole thing, the whole set-up was just too slick. And eventually he sets out to find and punish the real bad guys, as only Jack Reacher can.I'll close here with a plea to Child - don't sell out to the Hollywood star machine too fast: Eastwood and Connery might be too long in the tooth for the part, but tiny little pansy-man Tom Cruise is no Jack Reacher."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I started with Lee Child's \\"The Enemy\\" and enjoyed the style of writing. It is not bogged down with too much detail, very concise and fast paced. This led me to pick up \\"One Shot\\" which was no mistake. I enjoyed this story more than the previous. Great characters and thrilling action. This one will definetly disrupt sleep patterns as each development in the story fuels your desire to dig deeper."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"One Shot moves quickly and smoothly through a complicated series of surprises. I don't think anyone comes close to writing so clearly about a complex set of characters and events.A lone sniper opens fire on people leaving an office building in a small midwestern town. Five people killed senselessly. A major manhunt fortunately results in the sniper's capture; the evidence is overwhelming. The sniper refuses to talk except to say \\"Get Jack Reacher\\"; Reacher by his own design is untraceable but is on his way already...he's seen the national news coverage. And, then the twists and turns begin. To say more would spoil the intrigue!Lee Child and Jack Reacher are so good....and in One Shot they are in top form. A great read."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Lee Child exceeded expectations again with ONE SHOT. Jack Reacher drifted into my life for the ninth time. I spent a sleepless night reading about his latest situation.Tight plotting and Lee Child's unique writing style. Jack Reacher is at the core of all of Child's books, but each novel reads like a high concept stand-alone. The kind of stories movies are made from.ONE SHOT is a page-turning-hold-your-breath novel. Smart story, well-drawn characters, and all around excellent reading. Can't wait for the next Lee Child novel!!!"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"The peripatetic Jack Reacher leaves Miami and a beautiful Norwegian woman behind to visit Indiana in \\"One Shot,\\" Lee Child's latest thriller. While watching CNN, Reacher hears that James Barr, a forty-one year old Gulf War veteran and trained sniper, has been apprehended for shooting and killing five people in a public plaza. Reacher served as a military policeman in the army for thirteen years, and he remembers Barr from an ugly incident in Kuwait City after Operation Desert Storm. Although he had committed a serious crime, Barr escaped punishment because of political considerations that came into play. Before Barr left the army, Reacher warned him to keep his nose clean for the rest of his life. Now, Reacher is in Indiana to make sure that if Barr is guilty, this time he goes down for it.After looking into the particulars of James Barr's case, Reacher is struck by the mountain of incontrovertible evidence that all points too neatly to Barr. Soon, Reacher begins to suspect that James Barr may have been set up to take the fall for someone else. Instead of bringing Barr down, Reacher proceeds to risk his life for an individual whom he once despised. Jack Reacher is still the ultimate macho man, whose toughness is tempered by his sense of fairness, his compassion, and his unshakeable integrity. He is also an expert at reconnaissance and a shrewd and tireless investigator. Reacher's brute strength, his fighting skills, and his ability to outthink his opponents come in handy when he confronts his violent and ruthless adversaries.\\"One Shot\\" has all of the trademark touches that have made the British author, Lee Child, so popular in America. The mystery elements are genuinely puzzling, and the way that Reacher finally puts all the pieces together is ingenious. There is enough danger and intrigue to please the most diehard action-adventure fan. Child knows guns, and whenever Reacher talks about weaponry, he does so with consummate authority. In addition, the author's writing style is refreshingly crisp, clear, and fast-paced.The downside is that most of the characters are one-dimensional and the villains are downright cartoonish. In addition, there are several plot elements that are too far-fetched even for a genre that is not meant to be realistic. Still, \\"One Shot\\" has enough entertainment value to please Jack Reacher's many admirers, and this engrossing novel will undoubtedly attract even more members to Lee Child's ever-growing fan base."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Lee Child's enigmatic drifter, Jack Reacher, is back and this time, he's really ticked off.A former Gulf War sniper is accused of a random killing spree in a small Indiana city. Hiding in a parking garage, someone killed six civilians during rush hour by picking them off, one at a time, in the city plaza. And a bevy of evidence supports the contention that the former sniper, James Barr, is the guilty party.Rousted out of bed in the middle of the night, Barr has only two things to say: \\"I'm innocent\\" and \\"Get Reacher\\". Having seen the crime and arrest reported on CNN, though, Reacher is already on the way. Using the classic Child formula of investigative and procedural detail, unbridled criminal brutality, and the thinking man's cold-hearted hero, One Shot is a trip on the express lane straight into the darkest corner of the heartlands.I'll be frank, this isn't Child's best novel. Not even close. Try Persuader, Running Blind or Without Fail for the penultimate Reacher stories. But Child's lesser efforts are so far above the typical \\"thriller\\" that the term seems woefully misplaced. Simply put, Child is the best action-adventure author in the business today. On my scorecard he's nine for nine. Read any of the Reacher novels, in any order, for a surefire adrenaline rush."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I couldn't wait for the audiobook and read One Shot in print last night. I think it's better than The Enemy. Held me from the beginning. I won't summarize the plot, since others have, but I started out with a high awareness of and slight irritation with Child's short little sentences pacing me from the beginning chapter, then realized about two-thirds through that I was racing along,and read the book in one sitting. The ending was fabulous, and I will listen to the audiobook, if only to review the sentence structure. Child is an exceptional writer, and there is no other character like Jack Reacher (although other authors have tried). Accept no imitations."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Lee Child turns the thriller novel on its head with the latest Jack Reacher adventure, where nothing is as it seems. ONE SHOT is fast, exciting, sexy, fun, and totally unpredicatable, much like Reacher himself. I devoured it in one sitting.Haven't read Child yet? Once you read this, you'll be a fan for life. Read Child before? Then you know you're about to surrender yourself to a master at the peak of his talent.You'll be hooked on the first page. I guarantee it."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I've read seven of the Jack Reacher books, mostly enjoying them a great deal, but this one is kind of a disaster. It passes the time well enough, to a point, but Child really pushes his luck with implausibilities for much of the book and then finally just gives up in the last 40 pages.In fact, he abandons some central truths about his signature character for no other reason than to move the plot along. It's absolutely lazy writing.For example, a minor character who shows up for only a few pages earlier in the book is suddenly called upon to risk his life, and in the process gun down people about whom he has no knowledge, and thus may be completely innocent for all he knows. And why? Because someone calls him and says, hey, come on over and shoot some people. Oh, you don't need to know why. What else were you gonna do tonight?But at least that guy can defend himself, which is better than the TV anchor lady and female lawyer that Reacher throws into the middle of a firefight simply as plot devices. By this point in the series, Child has gone to great lengths to characterize Reacher as a guy who goes out of his way to protect people who can't protect themselves, and yet he's throwing young, urban professionals into a life-and-death gun battle.None of it makes any sense. Now, nearly every Reacher book has some stuff you have to politely ignore. \\"Worth Dying For\\" is a really good read, for example, but by the end Reacher has burned down three homes, murdered several people, and left an entire small farm town on its own to clean up the mess. At least 10 people are dead, a half-dozen are crippled, organized crime is involved -- and no one is going to notice? But I still liked it. It was entertaining.\\"One Shot\\" doesn't come close to earning a similar hall pass, although I finally understand why Hollywood decided to base the Tom Cruise movie on this book: It already sucks, so they won't have to work very hard to screw it up."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I don't read Lee Child books.

I guess I must read more..."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I was led to the Jack Reacher novels by the release of the 2013 movie. The movieJack Reacheris actually based on One Shot, this 2005 9th book in Lee Child's series. One Shot was an exciting, fast, fun read, and I was thoroughly engrossed and entertained from start to finish.Reacher is a rough, tough character with a military police background. Now \\"retired\\" and for the most part a drifter, Reacher seems to be as much of a military police expert as he is an expert in finding trouble and fixing it. However, now as an \\"independent\\", unlike the traditional methods used by police, Reacher--while extremely intelligent--prefers the methods of Rambo to exact his justice.I understand that Tom Cruise did a decent job with the portrayal of Reacher in the movie, but I am looking forward to the Blu Ray release so that I can see for myself. Cruise would be a much smaller Reacher than that of the guy in the book who stands 6'5\\" and actually crushes a guy the size of Stallone in his bare hands. So we'll see how that adaptation goes.Anyway, in One Shot Jack Reacher learns that a guy that he used to be in the military with (14 years ago I think it was) is accused of an atrocious crime. So Reacher makes his way to Indiana to investigate. Turns out the guy accused of the atrocity asked the cops to \\"find Reacher\\" as one of the only statements after his arrest, because Reacher may be the only guy that could put doubt behind the accusation. This of course doesn't make him any friends in the local police department who think that they have an air-tight case, and Reacher's presence certainly wouldn't sit well with anyone trying to frame the guy. Anyone trying to frame the accused might go out of their way to make life literally difficult for Reacher, but making life difficult for Jack Reacher is usually more hazardous to the health of the bad guy than it is to Reacher.One shot was a great read. Prior to One Shot, I read the first in the series calledKilling Floorthat kind of stretched the limits of believability. One Shot, while extreme at times with its own implausibilities, is a more mature work and definitely worth reading if you like a good action/thriller.Reacher said nothing."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Love the books.

Never boring, all ways something going on. He keeps it interesting, from page to page,UNTILL the end and wraps it up in a suspenseful, gripping finish. A must read."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"As a mystery novel, Lee Child's \\"One Shot\\" is deeply satisfying, a suspenseful and taut balancing act that is delightful to read.A sniper fires six shots into a crowd on a Friday afternoon, leaving five dead. Within a few hours, in a textbook case of police detective work, the suspect is apprehended, and because the evidence arrayed against him is so overwhelming is only a trial away from the electric chair. A casual acquaintance and former enemy Jack Reacher comes into town, and with a news anchor, a lawyer, a private detective, a former marine sharpshooter, and the accused's sister as unlikely allies uncovers a deep treacherous conspiracy.While the novel tries to be as tightly close-ended as possible there are invariably a lot of loose ends and questions unresolved. The conspiracy at the heart of the novel seems a bit far-fetched and overwrought, and you have to wonder why extraordinarily cautious, experienced, and intelligent men would go to such lengths to cover up what is ultimately a stupid and unnecessary crime.Nevertheless, this is an entertaining novel, and Jack Reacher a compelling hero."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Typical Jack Reacher.

First time reading a Lee Child book and now I want to read more!"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I haven't read any other Lee Child books, I checked this one out purely because I liked the previews for the movie Jack Reacher and wanted to read the book first. I was surprised to find out this wasn't actually the first book in the series. It is in fact book number 9, (Killing Floor is the first if that's what you were after), this isn't mentioned anywhere on the Tom Cruise face version cover of the book. Saying that I had no problem understanding what was going on or understanding what the character Jack Reacher was supposed to be, this was easily read as a standalone storyline, although I have no idea if major revelations from the plot of previous novels were given away in this one. I didn't find One Shot to be anywhere near the greatest novel ever written, it was enjoyable but I won't be rushing out to read other books in the series based on the plot, although I thought the plot was a bit weak, it was good enough that I will read more by Child if I come across nothing else interesting to read from time to time. Nor will I rush to watch the movie this weekend or anything, in fact I'm quite happy after reading this to wait until it's on TV, and I hope they do a lot better job with the ending than the one in the novel. What I liked most about One Shot was the Jack Reacher character, I didn't find him to be one hundred precent realistic, but I can live with that in a fiction novel. He kind of reminded me of the Parker character from Richard Stark novels, although Parker was obviously a criminal, Reacher seems to be from this novel anyway on the other side. But they both were similar in description, huge men who could physically (and a bit unrealistically) dispatch any opponent one on one, or even one against a couple of men. They are both very street smart and not afraid of anyone and both are extremely confident in their abilities. I also liked how Reacher would add the odd witty line in a confrontation and I would be disappointed if the ones he says in here aren't in the movie, such as he tells a thug who wants to fight him to pay the cheque first as he won't be able to later. \\"You think\\" the thug says, and he replies, \\"That's the difference between us.\\"Be interesting how Tom Cruise plays Reacher since he obviously doesn't fit the guy's description. With Jack Reacher he is not only described as a massive human being, but by Reacher's own admission is not someone women in bars and the like are attracted to and approach, whereas Tom Cruise, well once had just about every woman who saw him in the street throwing themselves at him back in the 80s. Sure he's older now but even those who despise his personal life would have to acknowledge he is still not going to have a problem with the ladies. Aside from attractiveness and physical appearance, Reacher being a massive human being is extremely important for a large percentage of the plot of the novel. If he was Tom Cruise's height, those events wouldn't have happened. I'm not going to spoil it for you what they are, and I haven't seen the movie yet to know if that massive part of the book is even in there, but it seems a pretty big oversight. However Tom Cruise bought the movie rights to the series, so if he didn't do that and cast himself, fans of the books may never have ever seen the books on the big screen at all, since no one else has been interested since the first Reacher book was published in 1997? So the question then is, is a cruise played Reacher movie better than nothing?I found the writing a little bit over descriptive of at times, some parts of the plot a little ridiculous such as one involving a sprinkler. I wondered why no one would have thought of some of the places Reacher went when they were searching for him that should have been really obvious, especially since they were waiting for quite some time for him to turn up to meet someone in the day who he visits that night. Even the start with a traffic cone placed at the end of a parking spot stopping anyone from parking there doesn't happen in real life. People just move those, even when there's a cement pole obviously that could fall on their car at any time they still stupidly do so, and there were no hazards to any vehicle in this one. The ending also, I had been anticipating Reacher coming up with some brilliant plan when it looked like his death was inevitable or some other person to step up in a twist of the plot but none of this happens. The story did have some nice twists, I can see why it was selected to be made into a movie such as why Reacher was there in the first place. It was also more of a mystery than action novel that I thought it would be, but I didn't mind that."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I HAVE READ ALL 14 or 15 Jack Reacher books.

Will definetly buy more books of Lee Child.With one exception... If you know anything about Russian histlory, russian language and what Gulag actually was - you just need to disregard all those russian parts. Just pretend it is about something else as it doesn't matter that much ( should they be Columbian, Hungarian, Russian, Zimbabwian ) - as long as plot is good and writing itself is superb. Still - how much would that cost to pay for some basic consultancy wiht native speaker ? Especially considering that it is now translated to Russian, and translators have to have comments here and there that it is author mistakes :). And Gorbachev ended Gulag in 1963? come on - he probably was just out of school at that time :).Still - as I say, book itself is great detective crime story and definetely worth reading.

The book is a page turner, focused more on action than on the psychological character of its main character, Reacher. All one needs to get about Jack Reacher is is basic profile -- the strong silent type who is very observant, very street-smart, and deadly effective when under pressure. He is a 6'5&#34; guy who just wants to travel the country and mind his own business, but circumstances and his innate sense of justice always seem to pull him into conflict. Without going into the story, I can say that this book is just as effective a thriller as past and future novels by Lee Child. The movie with 5'9&#34; Tom Cruise also was quite good, but the movie-script is not exactly the same as the book, which is okay with me. I'll also add, that I was not distracted by the difference in height; Cruise is a professional and does Reacher justice in portraying him on the screen for the first time. I very much liked this book. It's not 5-stars, but 4-stars is still quite good."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I read everything written by Lee Child....can't wait for the next one..Love Jack Reacher will have to see the movie"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I started out with the first Jack Reacher book by Lee Child intending to work my way through all of them.

I appreciate that author Lee Child does not find it necessary to use profanity and gore to tell his story - book after book is one great, suspenseful read after another. I read this book for the second time, thinking that it would help me enjoy the new Jack Reacher movie. The second read was just as good as the first. What can i say? Jack is Jack: he is a hard man to describe; he is elusive; he is one cool dude; he is a reluctant hero, much like the Lone Ranger; he is alone, but apparently he is not lonely. In this latest adventure, he ends up exactly where he should be, doing something he did not plan to do. Some may think the story implausible, but in this day and age, why not? I find the story believable, typical Reacher with a story that builds and builds. I love the ending of the book, especially the last paragraph.

I have read all of the Reacher novels - this was the second time through One Shot for me. After seeing the trailer and the new movie release, I reread the book to try to confirm my initial very strong feeling that Jack Reacher is not well served by Tom Cruise's portrayal. It worked, big time!(In fairness, I rewatched TC in A Few Good Men and I thought he did a fine job in that role, as well as in Top Gun. But Jack Reacher he ain't!)By the way, the book was just as good the second time through."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Vintage Reacher. Excellent. Wish it had been longer.

One Shot is a fast paced, action packed book. Child is such a good writer, you feel, see, hear and experience each page. This thrill ride takes it's cue from the world we live in, with a random killing of five people, did I say random? The twist and turns will keep you locked down for the duration. I'm reading all the &#34;Reacher&#34; novels in order, I have yet to hit a sour note. I love each adventure, and go along for each ride. They chose this one to make the first movie for the &#34;Reacher&#34; character. For me reading the book was just as good or better, because you are given such a vivid picture of all the action, it plays on the stage of your mind. If books got academy awards, this one gets top honors.One small negative for me, is that, I get a little put off with Reacher sleeping with every beautiful female character he meets and works with. That's just me. Perhaps I think love should figure into his life more, not just getting whats available.I realize he's had a serious relationship in earlier books, and I understand the character enough that love ties are too restrictive for &#34;Reacher&#34;.All reads considered, this one is great.I intend to read them all."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"The storyline is a little far fetched , but the construction of the storyis good as is the suspense .

For future movies, dump Tom Cruise and pick someone like Tommy Lee Jones."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Jack Reacher is as apple pie as John Wayne.

No dull down time but I couldn'tbelieve how quick I was done. There should be a warning that it was a \\"Short\\" story."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Ninth in the Jack Reacher suspense series about an ex-M.P. with a strong sense of honor and one heckuva mind. This story takes place in Indiana.My TakeWhoa...it's all in what you know about the mindset of a sniper and thinking through each minute detail. Never taking a single thing for granted.Even more amazing is Reacher didn't want to do it. He's not there for the reason I'm thinking he is. But the man has honor and the most incredible mathematical mind. Sometimes I wonder if he's a supercomputer with all the arcane details he's got packed away.Hmmm, interesting bits about why Reacher quit the army. Small details that we'll just keep adding up. He mentions Panama as being a small affair which happened at the time ofThe Enemy (Jack Reacher, #8if you'll remember when a major incident occurred. He quit the army in 1997.Oh, hang on a sec', Child states that Reacher never owned a house! What was Garber's place back inTripwire (Jack Reacher, #3)andRunning Blind (Jack Reacher, #4)? Chopped liver?? Hmmm, actually, I could go for some pat&eacute; about now. I'm hungry. Why did I have to mention \\"chopped liver\\"??What I don't get is why was it so important that Linsky allow Reacher to see him? All it did was start to itch at him. It's a case of who's cockier, who's too cocky. Every move they make simply cements Reacher's thoughts. They should'a left it alone. And man, oh man, does Child play it close to the vest.There's an interesting bit in here about true amnesiacs and how the brain is organic, not computer-like. When and what length of time memory loss can cover.Reacher: \\"If it absolutely positively has to be destroyed by morning, call the United States Marine Corps\\". Ooh, clever move with the Hummer and the sprinkler system.It's a game of cat-and-mouse and so much fun to watch.The StoryShots out of nowhere on a Friday night as people are streaming home from work. Clues are practically stumbling over themselves to the cops. It's perfect.Too perfect.The CharactersJack Reacher is a fit hulk of a man, six-foot-five and 250-pounds of muscle. A man who knows how to fight and can think. Who hates luggage and laundry. Who owned a car and a home he didn't buy for a very short time. Rarely uses his own name (he's used up the presidents now). He's also angry about Barr reneging on his deal. Brigadier GeneralEileen Hutton is a former lover of Reacher's. And part of the cover-up fourteen years ago. Former Sergeant Samuel Cash runs a gun range these days and he recognizes Reacher's prone position. Former Marine. A good man to back you up. But you still shouldn't take a knife to a gun fight, LOL.Anna Yanni is a local news anchor. Anxious for her shot at fame and a better job. Sick at the massacre just outside her door.Detective Emerson is a twenty-year veteran on the Serious Crimes Squad. A.A. Rodin is the district attorney, careful to prosecute only what he can win. Bellantonio is the crime scene tech and is so bummed that the evidence is so good; he reckons he'll never get a chance to testify because Barr will plead guilty.James Barr is a Gulf War vet. A sniper honorably discharged fourteen years ago. A guy too nice for his own good. Rosemary Barr is his sister, a paralegal in an eight-man law office. Luckily, part of the benefits package includes the handling of legal matters for free. As long as it won't take long or be too notorious.Franklin is an ex-cop, now he works as a private investigator for lawyers. Helen Rodin is the DA's daughter. Fresh out of law school, she's hungry for a case, but not one that will put her down in the history books for the wrong reasons. Alan Danuta is another lawyer who specializes in veterans' issues, Dr. Mason specializes in memory loss, and Dr. Niebuhr specializes in coercion.Grigor Linsky is second-in-command for the Zec Chelovek. Vladimir, Raskin, Charlie Chenko, and Sokolov. Six against one.Sandy Dupree liked that easy money. And she paid for it. Jeb Oliver was another.The CoverThe cover is too funny...it's where Reacher spends a heckuva lotta time in this story, hiding under overpasses, behind pillars. It's a straight shot down a road beneath the overpass, the whole is slightly tilted. It's night and the sides of the road are lit-up so well that the pillars are white.The title is what it's all about--One Shot. That's all a sniper is allowed."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Great Book in the Jack Reacher series. Good plot and as always Reacher is able to take care of business.

The read was even better the second time around...especially knowing that it will soon be released on the silver screen. Lee Child never ceases to amaze with his succint, believable prose, style and flair.

If you are a fan, then you'll understand why Tom Cruise is NO Jack Reacher. Impossible. Doesn't fit the description or who I've seen in my head for all these years. Besides . . .

As soon as you finish one, you find yourself craving more Jack Reacher. So naturally you start the next one. This character is fantastic and the epitome of a hero. Lee Child does a great job of illustrating everything going on and puts you smack dab in the middle of the story. One hundred pages go by in the blink of an eye. This particular Jack Reacher novel is a good choice as the movie will soon be released. I recommend this author to everybody. Try one, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Listened to this on a road trip, and while certainly not a great novel, it was definitely entertaining. However, it was amazing how many times the sentence \\"Reacher said nothing.\\" appeared.Perhaps it's more noticeable in the audio version, but I swear it must be in there 100 times or more :-)This was my 2nd 'Reacher' novel and I think I'm done with that character."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I bought this in an airport desperate for something to read on a long flight. The book has plot holes and technical errors that, at times, require the reader to make absurd leaps of logic to be in any way invested.

Pass on this one."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I found this book at the airport, and since I enjoy Ludlum-type thrillers I decided to give this a shot. Unfortunately, I couldn't even get through the first chapter. I found Child's writing to be downright atrocious. Choppy sentences, and repetitive descriptions may work in children's books, but made this book unreadable for me. Maybe it gets better, but I was just not willing to put in the time wincing through poorly written sentences to find out. Next time I'll stick to the real thing and read a Ludlum book."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"This is his worst novel. Unexpected, since he's been on quitea run of excellent suspense writing. Slow as molasses, drearymonotone atmosphere--for no reason, since similar settings aredone so well in all his other books. It seems that One Shot wasdictated to someone who rewrote it. It has none of the vitalityof his other books, none of the energy. I was struck by it within the first or second chapter. Too bad because I adore Child's other books. The villian is poorly drawn, his sidekicksnot the least bit drawn. No one is menacing, which in a Reacherstory is weird. Little flashes here and there in the darkness.And god, the plot is sooo boring. Corruption in municipal govt...Hunh? Walking down a driveway soaked in cold water...?Not the least bit exciting.The weak dialogue drones on and on, and becomes diluted andanemic,especially compared to his dynamite stuff from the recent past.Feels like it was tossed off. Disappointing to think Childis \\"losing it\\". He should fire his editor. He's got the chops to do it"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"A man's book. Love all of Lee Child's stories."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I absolutely could not get into One Shot by Lee Child. I have never read anything by Child before, and I found that his clipped style of writing did not catch my interest. At no point did I get emotionally engaged in the story; he never made me care for any of the characters, not even his protagonist, Jack Reacher.Granted I did not finish the book, after 100 pages I decided life was too short to waste in reading a book I was not enjoying and put it down. Someone who likes the hard-boiled Sam Spade type of detective novels might enjoy this one, but I need a little more character development and engagement to get interested in a book."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I'm halfway through listening to this audiobook and have lost count of the number of times Lee Child writes \\"[Character's name] said nothing\\". This may seem trivial but, after the 50th use of this needless phrase, you'll be at your wits end too. Any editor worth his/her weight would have cut out 90% of these phrases as they are amateurish and add nothing to the book. You could practically turn these phrases into a drinking game - drink anytime you hear the phrase - guaranteed good times for all!"},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"The sentence \\"(Someone) said nothing.\\" appears in Chapters 2 to 6 almost 50 times.In Chapter 4 alone, it happens 22 times...Reacher said nothing.Reacher said nothing.Reacher said nothing.Reacher said nothing.Helen Rodin said nothing.The Zec said nothing.The Zec said nothing.Helen Rodin said nothing.She said nothing.Helen Rodin said nothing.Helen Rodin said nothing.He said nothing.Reacher said nothing.Over and over and over and over. It's usually a stand alone paragraph, so it stands out even more. Some other Amazon reviewers have noted this problem as well and have called it \\"maddening.\\" It is.I can't speculate as to why Child did this nor why his editor and publisher would let this happen. I'd heard so many great things about this writer that I was really looking forward to discovering him. If it were anything else, I would give one of his other books a chance because the police procedural was cool and the rest of the story was promising. But I'm so mad that I paid for this book that I don't think I *want* to try another. Life is too short to spend on a book that abuses my intelligence and patience this way.I'm afraid Child had \\"one shot,\\" and he blew it."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"Child's prose style is taut, thus very well suited to the Mysterious Hero theme of the Jack Reacher novels. To call his characters \\"cardboard\\" would, frankly, be insulting to cardboard, but he writes well enough that you can overlook this.*One Shot* is interesting from the start, and part of that interest is the intricate -- though unlikely -- plot. However, the plot abruptly shifts direction at a certain point in the novel. If you think about it afterwards, you realize that it doesn't make much sense. Or any sense at all, actually.So my recommendation is to read *One Shot*, enjoy it for the nice crisp writing, and don't think about it very much afterwards."},{"Title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher, No. 9)","review":"I am a big fan of Jack Reacher series and have read all the books, but Lee Child has sold us all out, to make a favorite character into a caricature. Even if you have dyslexia you cannot possibly see (5' 6\\") Tom Cruise as a big bruising 6' 5\\", 250 pound heavily muscled Jack Reacher. Nobody in right mind is going to associate puny cruise as a former military police captain."},{"Title":"The Walking Coat","review":"Remember when you were a kid and tried on your mom or dad's coat? Well if you do this book will bring back memories.Its a charming and funny little story about a boy who wears a very over sized coat. The pictures will make you smile. An easy read for second and third graders. This book appeals to Tomie De Paola fans because of the cover but Watson's style is not as engaging or amusing.I've used this book as way to open up discussions about the changing seasons, feeling overwhelmed or too little or how we feel about hand me downs. It really inspired kids to write some thoughtful and touching responses. Nice addition to your ESL shelf. Fun to read if your school is planning a coat drive."},{"Title":"FormZ Modeling for Digital Visual Effects and Animation (Graphics Series)","review":"Rindner's book is a very clear, understandable (but not condescending) manual on modeling techniques, but assumes you're already up-to-speed with the use of Form*Z.

What can I say except 'thankyou' for writing this book. I think it's the only one in the market that reveals such advanced techniques for modelling. Truly your hard-earned career experience is shared here without reservations. I could not accept FZ's claim that 'Anything you can imagine can be modelled in FZ' before, but now after seeing your working techniques, I can. My eyes are opened. Instead of simple examples that rehash the User's manual, this book's examples are quite complex, typical of real-world requirements. Learning the techniques from the Automobile chapters alone will enable one to use the concepts presented there to build any other model thereafter. Cons? Maybe absolute beginners will find this book a bit daunting, but it's stuff that every beginner must learn to progress."},{"Title":"FormZ Modeling for Digital Visual Effects and Animation (Graphics Series)","review":"Rindner has done a spendid job with this advanced book on formZ. He offers valuable process methods, advanced modeling descriptions through real world examples and how to prepare formZ for standard Animation apps.

Many design disciplines will find this book to be a strong technical resources."},{"Title":"FormZ Modeling for Digital Visual Effects and Animation (Graphics Series)","review":"Dave Ridner's book is a must-have for any FormZ modeller who wants to create organic or streamlined shapes.

This book helps in more of an indirect way then I had expected. The tutorials are relativly well written but are difficult to reproduce.

If you are a new user be prepared for some long hours."},{"Title":"FormZ Modeling for Digital Visual Effects and Animation (Graphics Series)","review":"Rinder presents complex material in a very complex yet knowledgable, get-right-to-the-point manner. I found the examples used as illustrations to be &quot;real&quot;, not watered down for purposes of simplifying the author's work.

Otherwise, very highly recommended."},{"Title":"FormZ Modeling for Digital Visual Effects and Animation (Graphics Series)","review":"This book requires that you can already work with FormZ and seems to be intended for people who are using FormZ to create models to be animated with 3DS or Electric Image. FormZ was at version 3 when this book was written (1999). The approach seems to be that of a person who makes a living building models destined for an animation production environment.The book starts with a heady discussion called &quot;Digital Production Pipeline and 3D Modeling Process&quot; and continues in the vein of managing workflow for several chapters.It then progresses to chapters containing &quot;Exercises&quot; which are follow along tutorial-style and include such things as engine exhaust nozzles, auto wheels and tires, auto interiors, and a human hand.

I would recommend this book to anyone who has conquered the basic paradigms of Form Z and is looking for intermediate to advanced methods of building flowing shapes. David provides a handful of distinct methods that are polygonal based and which he has developed uniquely for himself.

Because of that, I'm determined to read it all the way through, but even after just a few chapters I started feeling annoyed. That feeling didn't stop as I read on. The pages are filled not with objective science, but rather what seems to be angry jabs at mainstream science. Almost every sentence refers to all those who don't share the parallel worlds theory as the \\"indoctrinated\\" or likens their situation to the Emperor's New Clothes. Everything seems to be a mocking or sarcastic insult to all those mainstream scientists as though the author is angry and lashing out at all those who laughed at his ideas over the years. It grows tiresome after not too long. He could have devoted a single page on his opinion as to why mainstream physicists don't share his views and then moved onto actual scientific discussion. Instead, the entire book is filled with these opinions. It's like reading a book on evolution and really wanting to read about the science and all you get is an author's constant attacks on religion. If that's the point of the book, fine, but if you're interested in the science, those criticisms grow stale quickly. So I'm left reading this and constantly thinking to myself, \\"Fine, I get it. Who cares what mainstream scientists think. Just present YOUR case and the science behind it. What others believe or don't believe doesn't prove or disprove your ideas, so why do you keep talking about it???\\"There is also a certain aspect about the author based on some of the ideas presented in this book as well as some of his other books that suggests his physicist mind shares itself with the mindset of a new age guru.

Full of typos, brimming with grammatical errors, and seemingly intent on leaving the readers questioning if their eyes are actually deceiving them, Fred Wolf challanges your IQ to do the limbo and see how low it can go. If I was as stupid as the narritave makes me feel, I would not be delving into this sort of subject matter. What passes for sentences in this book are, in my opinion, fragmentary at best. Every sentence the author rambles out should be ashamed of it's self. If the way in which this book is written is an actual reflection of the author's thought process, this man should be degraded back to elementary school. I can hardly beleive UCLA awarded him a Phd in theoretical physics if his thesis was even remotely written in the same disordered manner.If however, you do indeed have a learning disability, and don't have a problem with reading one of the most commiserable examples of the English language I have come across in all my twenty years, I fully recommend this book."},{"Title":"Parallel Universes: The Search for Other Worlds","review":"This book's catchy title will certainly help get peopleinterested in the more offbeat aspects of modern physics.Unfortunately, the wilder shores of the book'stechnical content will then lead such readersup the garden path.The real many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanicssimply has no place for, e.g., schizophrenia being a quantuminterference of different versions of a brain.Parallel worlds *do* quantum interfere, but only if theirfuture evolutions &quot;land on top of one another&quot; in theconfiguration space of possible worlds (whereupon theamplitudes add or subtract).

But since this broad vision is still open to interpretations, I saw it as no reason to abhor reading this work. What I found inside is extremely interesting. This book explains a multitude of intertwining abstractions from conceptual infinity to quantum computers. The versimilitude of the parallel universe model erases objective free will and at the same time renders the Anthropic Principle a subjective illusion of the present kosmos. Needless to say by now, Fred tends to get very philosophical. The parallel universe, or &quot;many worlds&quot;, interpretation of quantum mechanics is juxtaposed against the construing of conventional science. Our cherished notions of time are transmogrified. The superspace of parallel universes is a realm where the future not only exists, but affects the now as much as the past does. Accordingly Fred describes phenomena as necessarily self-consistent but not causal as in former Netwonian frameworks. The structure of superspace transcends such machine-like cosmologies.I actually think the theory proposed could act as complementary meshed with Michael Talbot's concept of a Holographic Universe, both places of infinite, non-local, ghostlike outcomes where the frequencies become synonymous with the infinite number of split macrocosms and the superposition of those into our present home in space time is our 'hologram.'But to take the acausal, self-consistent trajectory of the tachynauts, we first need a phone booth and eccentric helper from the future kosmos named Rufus.

That's basically the gist of the book as it deals with time, dimensions and space. For myself, I prefer to watch Sliders.

Nevertheless, for the record: The &quot;theory&quot; of parallel universes intends to provide an alternative explanation for the famous two-slit light experiment. At best, then, it is one of at least two contending theories, and the two-slit experiment itself cannot be construed as evidence that the theory is correct. Its adherents do, however, construe that it is evidence, and, thus, they are talking in circles and reasoning fallaciously. Also: a real scientific theory is a theory that makes predictions about something that could, theoretically at least, be tested, the result of such a test we don't already know. This &quot;theory&quot; does not do this; it is tautological: if parallel universes exist we cannot know it because they do not impinge on this universe, and there is no evidence to suggest that they exist.

White, and C. S. Lewis, have shown that it is possible to write for children and still write supremely well.)"},{"Title":"Parallel Universes: The Search for Other Worlds","review":"I did find that this book somewhat repetitive, as Mr. Wolf tended to \\"over-explain\\" aspects of the theories presented in \\"Parallel Universes: The Search for Other Worlds\\". However, I strongly suspect that this quandary had more to do with the Touchstone/Simon & Schuster editor's own lack in grasping of the subject matter, resulting in virtually a word-for-word transcription of the entire original manuscript into the final book form.Considering this likelihood, this book is a true gem! For anyone interested in science and all possibilities, it is well worth a read by both the novice and the well educated. Many books are available on quantum physics, space, time as the fourth dimension, etc. To date, though, this is the only book I have been able to find that puts all of these theories into a veritable nutshell. It delves not only into possibilities, but also probabilities, which include aspects of every major discovery in physics, astronomy, and mathematics since the time of Pythagoras.It is not a book for the faint of heart, who are secure in their understanding of their every day \\"reality\\". It is, instead, for those who intuitively know that there's something more to what we perceive as reality, more than the eye can see. Sorry, there aren't any illustrations for those needing visual aids. Mr. Wolf mentions in here that one needs an imagination to be a good scientist and I happen to agree (I am not scientifically inclined, nor mathematically for that matter, but I have always had a good imagination). The problem with attempting to provide diagrams and illustrations for the topic being covered in \\"Parallel Universes\\" is that you can't draw a fourth dimension on a piece of paper.I regard Fred Alan Wolf's book as a wonderful work of science and poetry; the observer and the observed being one and the same; the fourth dimension of time broadening our understanding of the world around us, including the one most of us can't \\"see\\".

Wolf contemplates how we might perceive these parallel universes, and what it might feel like when we experience the past and future interacting with the present. The extra bonus of this adventure is that Wolf shows you how time is not the steady, measurable thing you thought it was! Time is slippery, because it can't ever be directly observed. Whereas we can measure and then verify a measurement of length or weight repeatedly, measurements of time cannot be easily confirmed. As Wolf points out so succinctly, \\"Nowhere is there a value of time associated with an observable called time. As far as the equations are concerned, time is just a convenient ordering parameter -- a way of keeping track of things placed alongside each other in a sequence.\\" Time travel may well be possible, and you might not even need a time machine to do it!

If you do not have a familiarity with the foundation of QM, I would highly recommend that you first read either &quot;Taking the Quantum Leap&quot; (also by Wolf) or some other introductory book of QM (Rober Gilmore's &quot;Alice In Quantumland&quot; would be an excellent choice).Wolf's present book deals with the Princeton physicist Hugh Everett's &quot;solution&quot; to the paradox of Schroedinger's Cat. While it is too detailed to go into any depth here, let's just say that the answer is that each collapse of the wave function by an observer &quot;creates&quot; an alternate universe. While this is an intriguing thought, it carries with it a whole lot of metaphysical baggage. Wolf takes us on a guided tour of what this baggage entails.The book also explores the possiblity of alternate universes behind the singularities of black holes. Although this is something which can never be proven, it is a thought-provoking idea nonetheless.Although I think Wolf reaches a little with his dictum of schizophrenia patients perhaps being &quot;in touch&quot; with alternate universes, this is a valuable resource for all those interested in QM. If nothing else, Wolf presents a compelling explanation of time, space and its relation to mind. A fascinating book."},{"Title":"Parallel Universes: The Search for Other Worlds","review":"Wolf's problem, demonstrated again and again in &quot;Parallel Universes&quot; and his other books, is that he is a mediocre writer. Provocative, often fascinating ideas fizzle and die in the midst of Wolf's rambling, often barely coherent sentences. He offers speculation as fact -- for example, repeatedly claiming, in no uncertain terms, that quantum physics and relativity both &quot;prove&quot; that parallel universes really exist; most of us know that the idea of parallel universes is a theory, and a controversial one at that, popular strictly among the minority of physicists. And, in presenting difficult geometrical concepts (right triangles plastered onto a sphere, geodesics on a sphere, etc.), he doesn't offer A SINGLE ILLUSTRATION to make his points.

Although the book is free of physics and mathematics, the author could have spent few chapters to concentrate on the physics of parallel universes in layman's language to make the reader understand the physical principles on which physicists want us to believe in parallel universes. The book is described in six parts related to quantum physics, relativity, cosmology, time and parallel universe, understanding of our universe (with parallel universes) and psychology. The idea of parallel universe was first conceived by Hugh Everett III in 1957; his accounting of the famous double-slit experiment and wave particle duality is that since wave is not real but it is probability wave or quantum wave function that may be associated with two particles (in two universes) and not one particle (in one universe).The author could have hammered on topics such as Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle (UP), the Observer Effect (Schr&ouml;dinger's Cat, Wigner's Friend, EPR Paradox) on split and collapse of quantum wave function, antimatter, blackholes (Einstein-Rosen Bridge), invisibility of time, and better explanation of quantum mechanics and theory of relativity (both support the existence of parallel universes) in few short chapters and stay focused on the topic without wandering to fiction or other narratives.

That is the end of the value of this book... you know about the experiment that was the basis for the theory and how the theory explains that experiment.The remainder of the book is poorly written and hard to follow. The theoretical underpinnings are put forward and contradicted at various points.For those who want a very basic introduction, not about the theory of parallel universes, but about the experiment that started it all, this is as good an introduction as any other book that I have read.

He was a very honest President, who had a very shy personality. White wrote this biography in the thirties, and knew Calvin. Even though White knew Coolidge, criticism is still present in this biography. The most damning was Coolidge not taking action to prevent the build up of credit and speculation in the stock market. All indications are there that he should have limited money at some point, but Coolidge let the market make its own correction. This was one of the reasons why the market went down so fast.White does a good job of showing how someone like Coolidge (and Harding) rose to the top of the heap. Throughout this book, Coolidge is shown as an honest politician who lived off his salary. He even stayed in boarding houses when he was Governor and Vice President. He was very shy and limited his talking. He asked people to vote for him and they did. He only lost one election, so this shows people trusted him. He worked the political system for his constituents and his beliefs. Although conservative, he backed some very liberal ideas at the time including the vote for women and opposed anti immigration efforts against the Japanese. When he told people what he was going to do, people could trust he would do it. He even made fun of himself and his personality. His personal characteristics were very admirable.White's biography is a bit dry at times, but the subject comes across in very human terms. The book is divided into four sections, so one can read bits and pieces of that history which may interest the reader. The first one hundred pages was slow going, but it gets better after that.

A complex organism should be looked upon as an assemblage of simple organisms which are the anatomical elements that live in the liquid milieu int&eacute;rieur.&quot;This book is a wonderful book for the biology student or for anyone interested in how medicinal studies and biology &quot;began.&quot; Claude Bernard introduces his idea of homeostasis in this book and he explains how and why it works, and how humans, as well as animals, could not live without such an idea.I recommend reading of this book.

There are no English notes within because it was written for native speakers of Swedish. As a result, one will find within a series of English phrases for Swedish travellers to England, which is the very opposite of what the student of Swedish will be looking for.I can, however, praise the dictionary for its fine layout, which is much more readable than that of many pocket dictionaries. Also, the Swedish listing do contain the grammatical information English-speaking students need, such as the formation of noun plurals. And in spite of my misgivings, this is one of the few pocket options for students, and is worth seeking out if you need a dictionary to travel back and forth with you to classes."},{"Title":"In Africa;: Hunting adventures in the big game country,","review":"Some of the best things about In Africa Hunting Adventures in the Big Game Country aren't just what McCutcheon writes, but the pictures that he formed in my mind about what it was really like to go on such an adventure in the early days of the 20th century.It is so easy to get trapped in our present view where travel involves packing a bag and getting on an airplane, only to arrive anywhere in the world within 24 hours. During the flight, we use our vast electronic resources to learn (we think) everything about our destination.This wasn't the Africa that John McCutcheon knew. His Africa was largely un-mapped, the game species were only loosely documented, and even getting there was an adventure.What a joy it was to ready McCutcheon's description as he opens the book with a the description of the massive logistical effort that needed to be undertaken just to get to Africa in the early 1900s. Add to that, his fantastic description of going to the British Museum during his stop in London with his safari companions so that they could review the appearance and anatomy of animals that they had never seen before, but intended to hunt. It's fascinating to think about a time that really wasn't all that long ago, yet many species of animals in Africa had yet to be photographed.History buffs will also be held captive by his descriptions of the unease that existed on the final leg of his voyage from Italy to Africa. His descriptions of the tension that existed on-board ship between the British and German passengers sent a chill up my spine. It was almost although there was a sense of foreboding borne by the sea air on that voyage. They seemed already resigned the inevitability of a Great War that was still hidden over the horizon.Once in Africa, the danger was very real. Not just the obvious danger, from the animals. McCutcheon references several times the pains they took to avoid areas that were thought to harbor \\"fevers\\". Again, from our modern world that keeps us wrapped in an antibiotic safety blanket, it's startling to think of just how big of a risk a safari was in terms of dying from illnesses that are now easily preventable and curable. It's with this danger factor in mind that I found parts of the story became even more thrilling. For example, when McCutcheon attempted to head off a giraffe on horseback by running at a full gallop across a grassy plain. On any stride, the horses hooves could have found a hole and McCutcheon would be seriously injured or (if lucky) killed outright.It seems fashionable for some readers of these accounts of safaris to preface their comments with the fact that they are against shooting animals. Especially in Africa. John McCutcheon explains in detail his views on why it is justifiable. If you read his accounts of the extreme danger and utter fairness involved in hunting elephants they way they did it--on foot and on the ground, up close and personal--it's hard to see McCutcheon in unfavorable terms. He was a sportsman of his day and of a time when the vast numbers of animals in Africa meant that the sportsman had no impact whatsoever on the health of the species.Except, perhaps, that it was the sportsmen that were increasingly raising the alarm as settlers increasingly killed off game in order to protect crops and cattle.A very entertaining, sometimes thrilling, and often thought-provoking read that shows the modern reader the details of what it was really like to go there. It was interesting for me to think about the concept of courage. Would any of us these days have the courage to travel and then to hunt dangerous game in the time, place and in the world that McCutcheon lived in?"},{"Title":"In Africa;: Hunting adventures in the big game country,","review":"Enjoyed reading this book. This was my first African hunting book I've ever read and found it relaxing and ejoyable first-person account of hunting \\"back-in-the-day\\". While it certainly isnt as exciting or a page-turner as modern writing goes, it was still an enjoyable read to gave the reader a perspective on a type of hunting that is not conducted anymore. The author was able to bring you into his story and describes the wide varity of animals his party hunted and the methods involved. I learned about the type of hunting in Africa, that I dont imagine, is much different today as it was then. The animals are the same but techniques are a bit different. If you download this book, be sure you are a patient kind of reader and don't expect a high-adventure page turner because this is not it, though it is still a relaxing and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"In Africa;: Hunting adventures in the big game country,","review":"A very entertaining and historically interesting African hunting book circa 1910.

It is merely the record of a most delightful hunting trip into those fascinating regions along the Equator, where one may still have \\"thrilling adventures\\" and live in a story book atmosphere, where the \\"roar of the lion\\" and the \\"crack of the rifle\\" are part of the every day life, and where in a few months one may store up enough material to keep the memory pleasantly occupied all the rest of a lifetime.

The characters (especially Sandy) have that gritty quality that makes them seem more real. They're not all smiles and love. The way that the author includes a bit of future history at the end (Aku the Great, etc. et al) and leaves Sandy out of it was an interesting twist.

However, thinking four years of dating is enough, he finds the courage to enter the facility only to see chaos as four women seem to be wrestling with an overweight male. Company owner Dianna West explains that they are trying to help a client get off the floor because his knees gave out while practicing to propose.Dianna knows not to get involved with a client, but finds she desires Chris. He feels the same way though he wonders why as he has a girlfriend. As fate seem to keep placing Dianna and Chris in the same environs such as a wacky restaurant scenario, both resists the temptation even if love seems the force that draws them together.Though the use of fate is overdone (what are the odds of the same restaurant in a city as big as Baltimore is?), the audience will enjoy this romantic romp reminiscent of the screwball comedies of Hepburn in the 1930s. The story line amuses the reader through the antics of the secondary cast and the humorous bantering of the lead couple. Cheryl Anne Porter provides those fans of a sparkling jesting romance with a fun time.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Popping the Question","review":"From the back cover:All those men...none of them hers.Business at Baltimore's unique marriage-proposal service, \\"Popping the Question,\\" is bustling.

What's a girl to do? Risk her business to win him? Risk her heart, only to lose him? And what about Chris? He thought he knew his heart and his mind...but then he met Dianna...When Chris finally pops the question, will it be to the right woman? And when he does...will she--can she--say \\"yes\\"?And my review:I'll admit, I wasn't sure if I'd like this, as I came into it disappointed by this author lately. But I remembered how much I'd lovedSara's Bountyby this same author, so I gamely picked up POPPING THE QUESTION, determined to give it a try.The premise is an oldie, but a goodie--a woman falls in love with a man promised to someone else. And to complicate matters, he's her client. If she falls in love with him, she could lose the business she's worked so hard to build.I think that there was a good story in there somewhere, but this book needed serious thinning. I think the author would have been better served making this about 100 pages shorter, perhaps as a category romance. Because it was very padded. Everyone rambled, all the time. It was really annoying. For example:\\"Standing on the white wrap-around porch with the overhanging eave, Chris Adams eyed Popping the Question's front door. According to the stickers attached to the glass, they took Mastercard and Visa and most other major credit cards. So, anyway, it was a nice door, as doors go. And it probably didn't warrant this much scrutiny, but he was in no hurry to go inside. What was the rush. Wow. Popping the question. A big step. One giant leap for mankind. Hence, this study of the wooden door with its inlaid oval of glass. Inside, the glass was curtained with a lacy sheer held tight at both ends by some sort of satiny tieback thing. It resembled a woman's waist but more accurately described how his guts felt, Chris decided.\\"All this rambling about a door? Get to the point already! Everything was like this. The characters practically spent five minutes just deciding if they should take their next breath. Instead of adding to the story, all it did was drag it to a near stand-still. While I like details in a story, I don't like my books to be over-written.I have one more book by this author to try. I think I'm going to put it at the very end of my long queue of to be read books. Maybe a break from this author will make things better. But after five disappointing reads vs one enjoyable one, I'm not holding out a lot of hope. This book is not recommended by this reader. If you want to read something by this author, try SARA'S BOUNTY instead."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"For a book whose narrative focuses entirely on the romantic trials of a young woman, love is an almost insignificant character in Maughm's The Painted Veil; it is a luxury that barely surfaces in Kitty Fane's family, and Kitty's own (unfortunate) experiences with it are inconclusive and unreliable. In fact, the book is about how Kitty's character develops as she laggingly acknowledges and understands her failures with men. Largely, her faults exist not because of her lack of emotional mechanics, but as a result of her inability to accept a woman's (secondary) position in her society. By the end of the book, Kitty, having learned from her 'enlightening episodes', resolves to start a new life."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"Kitty is a spoiled, self-centered woman living in Hong Kong with her husband, Walter (whom she married in a panic only after finding her younger sister engaged before herself). Walter is a bacteriologist, and is as boring as he sounds; but desperately in love with Kitty. Desperately in love, that is until the day he discovers that she is having an affair. Kitty's life is soon turned upside down as she is forced to move with Walter to the heart of a cholera epidemic, with the almost certain risk of death. As if moving away from the city to a village of death isn't enough; Kitty finally understands that Walter is purposefully trying to kill her. Once she arrives in the village, however, Kitty finds that there is a lot more to life than parties and dresses and one-sided love affairs.I really enjoyed this one. The book is very quotable, my favorite being: \\"She wished to despise him, because so long as she only hated him she knew that she was very near loving him...It is a great misfortune to have a heart.\\" Or, at least quotable to me and my shredded heart (oh, it's way past broken). Anyway, this one spoke to me and I really liked to see Kitty's growth and coming to terms with her actions.

Surrounded by death, Kitty recognizes her own poor character and undergoes a personal transformation. As her husband works to eradicate the cholera epidemic from dawn to dusk every day, Kitty is left with plenty of time for self-reflection. Eventually, she learns the benefits of hard work and comes to terms with her marriage. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. The story was quick-paced, and I connected with the strong female protagonist, especially after she gained insight into her prior shallowness. I can see why some consider this book to be a feminist work. I also enjoyed the complex relationship between Kitty and her husband. I only wish Maugham had used his exotic settings (Hong Kong and then mainland China) to more effect. Interestingly, this novel has been adapted for the screen three times (in 1934, 1957, and 2006). Read this one."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"Maugham is a master of the easy read. His novels flow so easily but have an emotional bite. Once again he writes of the frail human condition but the protaganist tries to overcome her weaknesses. There are valid ideals in Maugham's novels that propel the reader to cheer for the opppressed. This book is no exception. Don't expect to be uplifted but you will be able to relate to the situation of Kitty. Well worth the time!"},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"Just finished this book the other day. On a bit of a Maugham tear - read \\"The Razor's Edge\\" and \\"Of Human Bondage\\" over the last week or so and started on \\"Cakes and Ale\\" yesterday. I should say I'm rereading these other books after a decade or so. But somehow had missed \\"The Painted Veil\\" until now.I, like several other reviewers, was put off by Kitty's jumping into bed with Charles the minute she returns from her life-altering experiences up in the cholera-stricken area. It was hard to believe. Or, if she did take up the old relationship, it would've made a better story for her to continue and fall right back into her old ways. That would've been a cynical and disturbing storyline, but powerful.I also didn't like the way story just sort of fizzles out with her taking off to Bermuda with her weak, foolish father. Perhaps it was something that actually happened to some acquaintance of Maugham's? Truth stranger than fiction sort of thing?Waddington is a great character and a breath of fresh air. The Mother Superior was a bit much, I thought. Embarrassing stuff about her aristocratic blood poring out of every pore. Yawn. The jolly Sister - I forget her name already - was entertaining.I didn't know a film had recently been made of the book. Hence the large number of reviews. A laugh to me that people would come to Maugham via some dopey film. I can't imagine the number of copies of the book that were bought and never finished.Walter hard to believe. A fart in a bottle turned psycho.What else? The mysticism was a bit much. Again, I think it would've been better if Kitty had just returned to her old ways. Perhaps she should have miscarried and stayed out East on her pension and bonked half the guys in HK, or something. People don't change unless they become insane, and if she was such a fool at 25 she would've died one. After all, her parents are both awful - what are the chances she wouldn't be?

Not his best novel, though."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"The Painted Veil is a moving book, offering details that the movie, as is usual, does not. However, I think this is one of the few times that seeing the movie actually complements Somerset Maugham's book. There are a few differences.

Her need for affection and recognition is palpable, but Walter is so highly-strung, even for a Brit, that he can hardly hold a conversation. The plague in the remote region of China, which Walter (and later Kitty) try to alleviate, makes Kitty grow. This part is deep and moving. But Walter does not change at all; he is the same intolerable, reticent, unforgiving husband. He dies without forgiving Kitty. And that's where Ed Norton made a smart revision. His Walter does change and does forgive Kitty, and the process is real and unsentimental. The second mistake of Maugham is that when Kitty returns Beijin, she returns to the arms of her lustful, trashy lover. That right there destroys the immense growth that had taken place in her soul upon seeing the suffering of the plague's victims. Now, at the end of the novel, she hates herself. And rightly so.

She liked men fawning over her and really knew no other life. Walter on the other hand was an incredible character - and had incredible character. Though quite and socially awkward, he did truly love Kitty and provided her a comfortable home with want of nothing.As this book proceeds on to the point where Kitty is left with the decision to either marry Charles or go with Walter, this particular part of the book was quite enjoyable for me. I loved to see Kitty attempt to do what she thinks is best for herself. The result of this point of the book is really where the story takes off.With great detail I started to see a change in Kitty's character... almost a \\"By George, I think she's got it!\\" sort of change as Kitty starts to really understand life, and men, and see things in a different. softer light.In the end I was impressed with this audio and with the story line. I am so glad I went against my prejudices and went ahead with it. I would suggest this to anyone. Its not so much as a romance as it is historical fiction. Kitty is not so much flighty, as she is uneducated. As far as the early 20th century read, it did not feel outdated to me, I was able to comprehend the time and the places.Narrator Kate Reading does an amazing job of capturing the sometimes whiny voice of Kitty, the patient and paced voice of Walter, and the boisterous self assured voice of Charles."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"Kitty, a superficial socialite groomed by her ambitious mother to marry someone of political, social, and economic stature.

The principal character, Kitty is flawed but grows in the story. We experience her revelations and development, and that is main-spring of this tale set in Hong Kong and China. It is all very credible. Maugham is simple and persuasive with his characters and narrative. There are no tricks or unnecessary meanderings.Maugham is the consummate story-teller. Story-telling, I feel has become a forgotten art and is becoming under-rated. Somerset Maugham has survived. Other authors peaked during his lifetime, but are becoming forgotten (like James Joyce or William Faulkner); except by esoteric college professors. Maugham has out-lasted many of his contemporaries."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"I loved this book. I read a lot of pop fiction and it's like living in a smog-infested city. You get used to living in the smog the same as you get used to the mediocore writing of pop fiction. Then all of a sudden, you read a classic and it's like leaving the smog for the fresh country air. What a difference. The writing is just superb, the story very interesting, the characters very flawed, the premise quite shocking.

This is a great short book that uses the English language concisely and descriptively. The setting is early 1920s Hong Kong, yet the story concentrates on the personalities of the characters rather than on the story's geographical settings. It's an interesting read about humanity. This novel has as much to say as books which are much longer. It's surprising how short the time period is in which this story takes place. Before Maugham wrote The Painted Veil, he publishedOf Human Bondage (Signet Classics), which is a classic book and movie."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"I bought The Painted Veil off Amazon after watching the movie on HBO. I hadn't read any Maugham since high school so I thought this story looked interesting. I'm also attracted to stories with a Chinese influence. You'll see that more and more as I move through the list. The Painted Veil has really nothing to do with China. It's the story of poor shallow, Kitty who marries Walter in order to beat her homely, younger sister down the aisle. Walter takes her to Hong Kong where she falls in love with the charming and dapper, Charles. Her loathing of Walter only grows in proportion to her ever increasing desire for the also married Charles.Knowing Kitty has been unfaithful, Walter takes her to a remote village in China to help fight a cholera epidemic. It is here that Kitty finally grows up. Walter indirectly shows her what a cad Charles is and that the true meaning of self worth is in the care and comfort of others. Not until Walter dies, does Kitty come to know the influence he has made in her soul. We watch Kitty find meaning and dimension in her life. As readers we watch her come full circle as a woman from petty and shallow to loving and compassionate. By the end we welcome Kitty into our hearts.The Painted Veil is a classic. I rate this story 5 out of 5. If you'd like to take a trip back in time, The Painted Veil doesn't disappoint.Linda C.

Somerset Maugham is a wonderful storyteller and does not disappoint the reader once during the novel. This is not a love story but a tale of one woman's journey on the road to redemption. The protagonist, Kitty Fane reminds me of a British version of Scarlett O'Hara. Kitty's journey is not a light hearted one. The reader's heart is constantly in a state of flux as the indecisive Kitty always leans towards the wrong choice. This is a timeless work that I believe will be in my top ten of beloved novels for the rest of my life. I highly suggest picking up a copy and enjoying the vivid world left behind by Maugham."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"The story begins with the very unlikable Kitty Fane. She is selfish, vain, and is bored with her husband. After an adulterous affair, Kitty travels with her husband to an area stricken by cholera.Kitty begins to work in the nearby convent while the nuns nurse those stricken with the disease. During this time, Kitty attempts to repair her broken marriage. Just when she begins to make amends, tragedy strikes. Kitty is left alone to face her demons.I enjoyed watching Kitty's character evolve throughout the story. I first noticed the change when she began embracing the orphans in her care instead of being repulsed by them. She begins to understand that, in the face of so much suffering, her problems are very small. Kitty begins to empathize with others and make better choices. In the end, Kitty is stronger than she realizes and her tragedy is really the beginning of a new life.I was captivated from the first page to the last."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"What a beautifully written book.

This is a beautiful book."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"\\"The Painted Veil\\" is not without flaws. The central character is without a doubt silly and at times annoying, and yes, the ending is rather... poor. But then on the other hand, the writing is excellent, the characterization is realistic and believable, and I was able to relate and appreciate even those I honestly didn't like.Take Kitty, for instance. She is the main character, and is without a doubt a shallow being. And yet, that's part of the point. She's self-absorbed and selfish, but she comes off as a wholly believable person. She is not merely some obnoxious character. Townsend is a bit of a bigger problem - he is a cocky, self-centered character, much as Kitty is. However, it is more difficult to truly know him, as he is not as central a figure. Perhaps with more time? Who knows. Walter is another character who with more time could have been fully developed. He is sharp, intelligent, yet almost innocent and pitiable (or so Kitty sees him). Walter's character was my favorite, if only because he is the easiest to relate to and like. I do wish we'd have had more of him, though his timing in the novel is impeccable.The plotline is intriguing and interesting. The premise is certainly fascinating and the overall feel of the book is very good. The way back stories are told means that little time will pass and yet we'll learn a lot. The writing is without a doubt excellent - Somerset Maugham creates a perfect atmosphere but also makes sure everything is clear and readable. It is not the sort of book that will make your head hurt. It is enjoyable and interesting.From a literary standpoint, I'm sure there are far more flaws to this book. However, as nothing but a young reader, all I can say is that this book drew me in with the first page and wouldn't let me go until the end (even if the end lessened in quality just a tad). Perhaps not the greatest novel of all, requiring some work, but certainly a worthy read."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"I wanted to read this book before seeing the movie, and I must say that I enjoyed it immensely. Having read most of Maugham's short stories but none of his novels, I was taken aback by the sweep and passion of this book, its strong moral center, and above all its sensitivity to feeling. Other readers have called this a feminist work, and so in a halting way it is, in that Kitty Fane, its central character, is a woman and Maugham looks unusually deeply into her soul. But at the beginning of the book she is almost the polar opposite of feminist, having been brought up by her ambitious middle-class mother to be pretty and vapid and catch a good husband. It is only after she has passed through the climax of the story that she begins to see that there can be better goals in life for a woman.My surprise at the depth of Maugham's portrayal of Kitty is in contrast to what I have always seen as the emotional reticence of his male characters, who are portrayed rather in terms of action than of feeling; I see this as a by-product of the author's homosexuality in an era when this had to be kept hidden. Kitty's husband, Walter Fane, a young government doctor and bacteriologist in Hong Kong, though presumably heterosexual, is almost a caricature of this repressed type. Although he obviously has feelings, he is almost incapable of giving voice to them, and neither he nor Kitty can effectively communicate with one another. It is hardly surprising that Kitty should fall into an affair with a married colonial official who is all easy charm. Even when Walter discovers their liaison (masterfully evoked in the opening pages of the book), he remains cold and inscrutable; his response is to volunteer for service in a cholera-ravaged city in the Chinese interior and to take Kitty with him.As I say, I have not yet seen the movie, only the trailer.* But I was struck by how perfectly Edward Norton captures the cold correctness of Maugham's doctor; I am only surprised that this should have become a star role, since in the novel Maugham keeps Walter very much in the shadows. My other impression from the trailer, the expansive beauty of the Chinese landscape, is also strongly evoked in the book, though I suspect that the movie paints the horrors of the cholera epidemic on a larger canvas and makes more of the background of civil war, which is barely hinted at by Maugham. Instead, once the Fanes reach their destination, the novel takes on a more intimate quality, which slightly disappointed me by playing down the ever-present danger that surrounds them.But the trade-off is that the emphasis can shift to Kitty's tentative spiritual journey. Maugham's title comes from the first line of an unfinished sonnet by Shelley, \\"Lift not the painted veil which those who live call Life,\\" which implies a metaphysical intent. Here Maugham moves into territory that would later be claimed by Graham Greene; Kitty volunteers at an orphanage run by French nuns, and her first real lessons on life come from her exposure to these women so different from herself in faith and culture. By its mid-point, it seems that the novel is set to follow the familiar path of redemption through sacrifice.And so it does, for a while. But Maugham, to his credit, does not go for the easy melodramatic conclusion. By a series of events that I cannot reveal here, the novel begins to retrace its steps and to wind down from its peak intensity. Kitty is forced not only to confront change, but to recognize in herself the ways in which she has NOT changed. Maugham risks anticlimax in taking this route, and perhaps does not avoid it entirely; but all the same it makes me respect him in a way that nothing else of his that I have read ever has.[*I have now seen the movie on its first day of general release. It is handsome and well acted, but a very different experience from the book. The scenes in the Chinese interior have indeed been opened out as I surmised, and the character of Walter Fane much developed, moving into emotional territories only hinted at by Maugham. On the other hand, the earlier parts of the book are much compressed and the final sections omitted entirely. Perhaps the unusual shape of Maugham's novel would not have worked so well in movie terms, but it is still worth reading for that very reason.]"},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"\\"The Painted Veil\\" is the beautifully told story of one self-absorbed woman and what it takes for her to discover joy in loving others. Every novel should have at least one character who changes and grows even half as much as this heroine. (Scene spoiler alert: My favorite scene is the last, when Kitty realizes she's always taken her father for granted, imagines how he must be feeling, and begins - finally - to treat him as a unique individual who has wants and needs separate from hers. When she can finally do this, their love is realized.)I just saw the 2006 motion picture, and actually enjoyed it more than the book. The screenwriter enriched Somerset Maugham's classic in several ways: Kitty's husband Walter is given more depth such that his growth over the course of the story matches Kitty's. Also enriched is the backdrop. Not only is the Chinese town where much of the story takes place suffering a Cholera epidemic, but the Chinese Nationals are rising up against the British. This plot enhancement cranks up the tension of the story, and allows Walter's character to develop in a more complicated and ultimately satisfying way.I highly recommend you read the book, then see the movie. You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"The kernel of this novel dates back to 1895 when Maugham was twenty years old and stayed in Florence to learn Italian. He came across a story in which a &quot;husband suspecting his wife of adultery and afraid on account of her family to put her to death, took her down to his castle in the Maremma the noxious vapours of which he was confident would do the trick; but she took so long to die that he grew impatient and had her thrown out of the window.&quot; It is around this core (which is not exactly the plot line of the novel, don't worry) that Maugham developed the story of Kitty Fane, a woman who is vain, superficial and in need of appreciation. It is a story that plays in Hong Kong and China in the 1920s. Maugham knew both places from his extensive travels in the South East but, characteristically for him, he does not spill much ink on descriptions of the landscape or the natives, which is a pity. He is much more interested in his fictitious characters.As always, Maugham is a master of drawing characters who possess all the self-importance, weakness, and suffering that underlie human existence. His characterizations are so sardonically true that he was sued two times over the book by people in Hong Kong, and had to change the name of Hong Kong into Tching-Yen, and the name of one of the characters from Lane (innocent enough, one would think) to Fane.I was wondering why this rather obscure novel by Maugham has received nothing but glowing five-star reviews by almost exclusively female readers. The reason is that this novel is about marriage and the restraints that marriage imposes upon passion. Also, it is a classic story of a woman's spiritual awakening. Two themes that appeal to female readers to such an extent that they tolerate Maugham's biting sarcasm and his rather unromantic view of life (he is quoted as saying that &quot;habits in writing as in life are only useful if they are broken as soon as they cease to be advantageous&quot;). If there is an author who is not touchy-feely, it is W. Somerset Maugham. Marriage, he soberly concludes, is a matter of convenience. Passion, on the other hand, is a matter of inconvenience: it lurks untamed behind &quot;the painted veil which those who live call life&quot;. What is left? Faith? Maybe, I think Maugham would say, but most people are not humble enough to be truly religious (&quot;no egoism is so insufferable as that of the Christian with regard to his soul&quot; is another quote by the master).&quot;The Painted Veil&quot; is well worth reading. However, it suffers a bit from Maugham's self-assured way of portraying people and constructing a plot. It is a well-told story, but it is not a first rate novel. I think the problem is that Maugham's characters in this book are too one-dimensional which works well in a comedy of manners, but not in a book that wants to discuss matters like love, passion, marriage, life and spiritual growth in a serious way."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"With The Painted Veil, Maugham is at his most masterful. It's hard to conceive of the inspiration which led to his story line; it is brilliantly creative. Such a story line deserves masterful character development, and the reader is not disappointed. From the main protagonists to the bit players, we learn the strengths and weaknesses of each in economically structured vignettes. Character is also illuminated by Maugham's narrative, as when Kitty becomes aware just how terrifying her husband's jealousy could be: \\"It [his mind] was like a dark and ominous landscape seen by a flash of lighting and in a moment hidden again by the night. She shuddered at what she saw.\\" Kitty's lover is employed by the British Government, and is second in charge in that colony. She learns that the Government \\"doesn't want clever men ; clever men have ideas, and ideas cause trouble; they want men who have charm and tact and who can be counted on never to make a blunder.\\" Of course her lover, Charlie Townsend, does make a blunder, and it is precisely in becoming Kitty's lover. Then, in describing the differences between the French nuns and herself, she realizes: \\"They spoke a different language, not only of the tongue, but of the heart.\\" Married to a man she realizes she hardly knows, she sees them as \\"two little drops in a river that flowed silently towards the unknown; two little drops that to themselves had so much individuality, and to the onlooker were but an indistinguishable part of the river.\\" Of the separate, special motivations that each individual has, Maugham says, \\"Tao. Some of us look for the Way in opium and some in God, some of us in whiskey and some in love. It is all the same Way, and it leads nowhither.\\"Maugham exposes two shortcomings in this novel. A modern editor would not have let him get away with the use of \\"seemed\\" so frequently. In some chapters he uses it on every page, and not infrequently, twice a page. You may say that this is stylistic, but \\"seemed\\" is overused by amateur writers, and is used very sparingly by professionals. Maugham's other shortcoming is more substantive. His ending appears to be appended to the wrong book. It simply doesn't fit. The reader is treated to genius until the last chapter, Kitty's reunion with her father. We get a tearfully emotional scene between father and daughter which is entirely irrelevant to the plot, the theme, and character. The book throbs with exotic intensity until the final pages, when it becomes mundane and dreadfully boring. Had Maugham treated us to an ending which matched the brilliance of the rest of the book, employing characters about whom we have developed strong feelings, this would have become a genuine classic. It fails, but very, very narrowly, and unnecessarily."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"As usual we experience Maugham's thread of profound moral strength versus the commoner's weaknesses. In The Painted Veil, our main character Kitty (the name suggests one who is gay and flighty) has been reared only to apply her good looks to marry someone of political, social, and economic stature. After years of many social functions and rejecting numerous suitors, Kitty who senses her marital clock is ticking, marries a profoundly serious medical researcher by the name of Walter Fane.They soon move to Hong Kong, where Kitty becomes bored and distraught over her social and material standings. In the beginning, Walter provides Kitty with a plethora of love and respect; as any woman can only hope for in her marriage. But something is missing. Kitty has the moral impuissance of any commoner. Walter is forever focused on research, and spends free time at the club, which makes Kitty that much more lonely and vulnerable. Eventually she begins an affair with an up and coming political figure. As the potential exposure of the fling increases, her disdain for her husband becomes blatant.Upon discovery of this salacious affair, Walter feels betrayed and, instead of attacking the male adulterer, he serves his revenge cold and without mercy. He drags Kitty across this implied line from colonial Hong Kong's social and morally corrupt playground to Cholera plagued Mei-tan-fu, where the only initial sense of worth is in the help of others.In the end both the superficial and profound stand steadfast against one another with Kitty left straddling both. On one side we have the typical temptations of greed, power, and trysts pulling her in one direction. On the other, a sense of conscious cleansing commitment to helping the destitute amounts to somewhat of a philanthropic zealotry.Like the substance of our story, on the surface this has an easy and relatively nondescript flow. However, immediate reflection brings us a beautifully woven fabric of classic literature."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"The novel has an old-fashioned feel for the first few pages, and then it takes off. The writing and structure are crisp and modern - surprising when you consider how many decades ago Maugham was writing. A moving story; highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"To better understand Somerset Maugham's \\"The Painted Veil,\\" it's helpful to know some of the referenced literature that inspired the author. In the preface of \\"The Painted Veil\\" Maugham makes note of an interesting Italian legend of adultery and murder that first inspired the novel. Also, the title of the novel is taken from a sonnet by P. B. Shelley that begins \\"Lift not the painted veil which those who live call Life\\", which chastises people who choose to live in fear and illusion rather than embrace hope and face the reality of their imperfect relationships. The primary relationship in \\"The Painted Veil\\" is that between Kitty and Walter Fane. Kitty, a superficial socialite groomed by her ambitious mother to make a successful match, in desperation marries shy Walter. She escapes society's scorn with him in Hong Kong, where Walter has a government post as a research microbiologist. Bored with Walter's worshipful version of love, Kitty falls for the personable and politically powerful Charlie Townsend, who is married. The balance of power shifts, however, when Walter discovers Kitty's infidelity and forces her to \\"lift the veil\\" and also face some hard truths. In an act of revenge, Walter accepts a post to the dangerous city of Mei-tan-fu, beseiged by a severe cholera epidemic. Kitty can do nothing else but accompany him to what she thinks will be her death. Yet in this city of death, Kitty and Walter are changed by the people they meet: Deputy Commisioner Waddignton and his mysterious, devoted Manchu Lady, and noble Mother Superior, who left a privieged life in France to devote her life to Chinese orphans. What will be Kitty and Walter's fate and the fate of their marriage? And if one survives living in the shadow of death, is it possible to easily resume former relationships? Walter's cryptic line \\"The dog it was that died\\" holds the answer. Read the English rhyme \\"An Elegy on the Death of a Mad Dog\\" to find out what Walter means."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"In the Painted Veil we are drawn into the story of two ill-matched spouses - Kitty and Walter Fane. Kitty, who is somewhat pretty, flighty, and shallow has married the serious bacteriologist Walter Fane out of desperation and relocated to Hong Kong. While there, she has imagined herself to fall desperately in love with the Colonial Secretary, Charlie Townsend. When Walter discovers the affair, he presents an ultimatum and Kitty finds herself short on options. Walter decides to accept a position as a doctor in a remote location where a cholera epidemic is killing off large numbers of the population, and he insists Kitty go with him. Will Kitty survive? Or will she meet her demise?The tale that unfolds is a triumph of the human spirit in so many ways. The book goes beyond whether one lives or dies and leaves the message that life's important lesson is in the way one treats those who are nearest. Life is to be lived to the fullest, but not at the expense of mistreating others.Although I felt the characters were a bit predictable and not overly deep, I felt W Somerset Maugham drives home his message clearly in an easy to read, engaging manner. This book does not go into a whole lot of detail, but it gives enough detail to enable the reader to flush out what they need to make the full picture fresh in their minds.I am always amazed when a male author can so capture the feelings and emotions of a woman (or vice versa, but I really can't speak to that!), and W Somerset Maugham has really done a fine job of that in this book! I could truly relate to the emotions Kitty Fane was going through - indeed, I felt as though I would have felt the same under the same circumstances!"},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"I agree wholeheartedly with the review of \\"misplaced human\\".What I particularly liked was that the novel took such a different angle on the rather old theme of the shallow, beautiful and flighty socialite who marries a man who is far superior to her emotionally and intellectually and who stubbornly loves her toward the bitter end-despite her unworthiness. The adulterous heroine usually sees the errors of her ways and the worth of her husband very late, sometimes even too late. One the surface the book has all those plot elements-but if you look closely it is not that at all. The motivations and the hidden agenda of the characters-good and bad-are quite cleverly and subversively exposed by Maugham. None of the protagonists is what he or she seemed to be at first (with the possible exception of Kitty's \\"oily\\" lover).Kitty's husband is not the romantic, thwarted lover as one first pities him-in one of the key scenes of the novel shallow Kitty of all people is the perceptive and shrewd one in the relationship who has to explain intellectual Walter what his supposedly romantic love for her is truly about.The book might not be for everyone but one thing it is not at all (unlike one reviewer here pointed out)-a novel with one-dimensional characters. I have hardly ever seen more multi-layered characters in a book written in that time period which usually just pleasantly malign women like Kitty and put the men on a pedestal who marry them. After all who we choose to love says something about our character, too and Maugham was one of the rare authors perceptive enough to detect that!"},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"This is a superb book, dealing with multiple themes around human relationships, character development, distinguishing love and infatuation, the transcendental experience, and the meaning of existence. That sounds like a lot but this small book covers a lot of ground.Through a wide array of characters, Maugham explores the nature of human relationships. There a parental relationships where parents are overbearing and judgmental. Kitty, the protagonist of this novel, has such a relationship with her mother. She eventually marries just to escape her mother's judgments and criticisms. There are also unexamined relationships that are taken for granted and only later are seen in a new light. Such is the case with Kitty and her father. He is a judge and ample supporter for his family. Yet he is a status symbol for her mother and a source of income and support for Kitty. It isn't until Kitty gains in maturity and painful experiences that she eventually is able to even begin a genuine relationship with her father. Social roles of parent, child, mother, son, daughter, and father may often provide a social matrix for interaction but subtle violence and disregard and neglect may characterize the relationships that are seen to the outside world as loving and in fact those who dispense emotional violence and those who absorb emotional violence may never grasp the reality in which they are stuck, and thus characterize their relationships to family as loving when in fact, love is not present.Growing up in such a home, Kitty seems oblivious to the compromise she creates when she agrees to marry a socially awkward but highly intelligent bacteriologist. He falls for her but she never really reciprocates with the emotional depth of her husband. She is young and self-absorbed and shallow in many ways, yet he loves her.But Kitty has never given herself fully to another person, she has never been infatuated, she has never been out of control and in constant pain when she is away from her lover. Unfortunately for Kitty, she falls for a married diplomat who is highly self serving and manipulative. Charlie Townsend begins to dominate her every thought and she becomes lost in day-dreams of marriage to Charlie far away from the real world of their marriages. The ancient Greeks believed Jupiter gives mankind wisdom through painful experiences and Kitty is about to be educated. Having discovered that his wife is having an affair with Charlie Townsend, Dr. Walter Fane, is inwardly heart broken but he display a highly controlled exterior. He offers Kitty an ultimatum which has been carefully thought through for it helps reveal to Kitty how shallow is her relationship with Charlie. Walter insists that Kitty join him in a distant city which is being ravaged by cholera. She has no choice but to follow him. Yet this experience is the critical experience of her life as well as Walter's life.Kitty meets a minor ugly alcoholic British official, Waddington, who eventually becomes her intimate friend and one of her guides toward herself. Waddington quickly picks up that the Fane's relationship is a disaster and he helps Kitty find meaning in her life as an aide in a French Catholic orphanage. He also gradually introduces her to Taoism and the concept of desire and connection being the source of much human pain and suffering. Kitty gradually goes through multiple stages of grief and anger to begin forgetting Charlie Townsend.At the French Orphanage, Kitty also begins to grow and change in character as she cares for Chinese orphans and interacts with the highly spiritual nuns. Kitty observes that the nuns act calm and loving and gentle and supportive of all humans in all their interactions, but she sees that they are not attached. They are not emotionally bound to the children they serve, there love is a spiritual grace and transference from God to the children. They are willing conduit between God and suffering mankind. Thus they are able to love and let go, they care and then forget, moving onward to the next suffering soul. In this regard Maugham is certainly connecting the sublime nature of Christian non-attachment to the Buddhist and Taoist philosophies of detachment from the world. Kitty has several transcendental experiences, sometimes evoked by great beauty in the natural world or in vast vistas of man's interaction with nature.Thus Maugham does something outstanding. He conveys how a person may grow in character by pain and self examination as well as how a person learns to integrate or experience the mystery, the unification with the unknown, the wordless and thoughtless mind of God that changes perception.But like relationships, ever changing and growing, the transcendental experience is never complete or present at all times. Kitty longs for the serenity of the nuns, their spiritual and emotional centeredness, but finds that just like relationships, our glimpses into the mind of God are ever changing.Maugham has selected to show us that a shallow self absorbed young woman can begin to glimpse the mystery of existence, the flow of pain and desire and attachment out of the human heart. Like the Buddha, she sees a corpse in the road, the reminder of our temporary status on this earth.The test comes as Kitty realizes that Walter is in pain and that he must forgive her to move beyond the pain. She has moved and grown greatly if she now can empathize with Walter to the point that she sees fully his pain and sees the way beyond his pain. Just as Walter saw her infatuation with Charlie and the steps needed to reveal Charlie's lack of character to Kitty, she now sees that Walter has a broken heart and in his heart bears pain and anger, but more importantly, he is now willing yet to move beyond the pain and anger and move into a state of forgiveness. Kitty has reached the point of maturity that she wants this forgiveness, not for herself but for Walter. She has moved beyond herself absorption, her self definitions, and her own perceptions and like the compassionate Buddha, she sees into Walter's heart and knows how she must be healed.Unfortunately, life is not predictable and Walter falls deathly ill with cholera. As he dies she urges him to forgive her, something that she needs but also something that she clearly sees that he also needs.The resolution of the novel shows Kitty dealing with the consequences of her choices, the recognition of her own human frailty and needs, the separation from her mother's bonds, and the initiation of a genuine relationship with her father.This is an outstanding work of literature, unwinding a profound and complex theme, revealing the nature of relationship to the self, to others, to the Tao beyond. No small achievement."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"'The Painted Veil' is certainly a deceptive literary masterpiece. From a 30,000 ft view the story sounds a bit boring: spoiled British woman, circa 1920, hastily marries a total bore, moves to Hong Kong and gets into a bit of hanky-panky with married self-centered turd, then is hijacked to the boonies by hubby to help the misfortunate Chinese cope with a cholera epidemic. Yawn. And indeed the first third of 'The Painted Veil', while certainly quality literature, is hardly enthralling.Thankfully the author is simply WONDERFUL in capturing raw human emotion and how the human spirit can change. Our bratty, slutty leading lady goes through hell and is eventually transformed in remarkable, and believable ways. No, she doesn't become a saint. But her maturation is remarkable. I am left in *total awe* at how the author got away with producing a real corker of a novel in so few pages with relatively little in the way of action.Bottom line: a little known masterpiece. Brilliant."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"Set in China in the 1920s, The Painted Veil tells the story of a young couple, Dr. Walter Fane and his wife Kitty. She marries him on a whim. After enjoying various London seasons and the attention she receives from various suitors, it suddenly occurs to her that she is twenty-five and that her younger, less attractive sister has already found a husband. So, in haste, she chooses the shy and academic Dr. Fane. Walter loves her very much, but he is not very expressive, preferring to read books and doing research as a bacteriologist. They move to Hong Kong for work reasons, and there she meets a charming Englishman who becomes her lover. When Walter finds out, he takes her to a village that is in the midst of a cholera epidemic. And that's where the journey to self-discovery begins for Kitty.This is a beautiful and moving piece of fine literature. At first, I was put off with Kitty. She is so shallow -- so selfish and self-absorbed -- that it is hard to believe that someone like Walter would fall in love with her. She remains in that vain throughout the book, but her character is meant to be real -- a fleshed out and flawed human being. However, there is hope for this character. I like Walter. In spite of his reticence, and the fact that his character seems underdeveloped compared to Kitty, you can feel his love through his supposed callousness and coldness after he discovers her affair. The novel is full of symbolism, and I had to search the meaning of Walter's line \\"The dog it was that died.\\" It's taken from \\"An Elegy on the Death of a Mad Dog,\\" and I got its meaning. What an ironic, yet touching moment in this story! I haven't watched the film yet, but I hope it has done this beautiful literary work some justice. I cannot recommend The Painted Veil (the title itself is also taken from somewhere else) enough. This is the first time I read W Somerset Maugham, and it won't be the last."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"This is one of those books that is probably rated better if you haven't seen the movie with Edward Norton Jr. and Naomi Watts. The writing is effective but the problem was that I preferred the storyline of the movie over the book. Still, it's worth a read even if you have seen the movie because it fills the characters out nicely. The book portrays Kitty Fane's character more fully than others and seems to be written partly from her viewpoint.That being said, I adore the movie!The Painted Veil"},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"I'm not sure what to think of this book. It's definitely a masterful telling of growth and sorrow, but despite that I didn't feel connected with the novel. The characters are hard to like even though they are only doing what is in their nature.Kitty is a silly foolish girl interested only in frivolity and parties. She is not all to blame, her mother has made her this way in hoping that she'd make a good match for marriage. However, time flies by and soon Kitty finds herself a spinster at twenty-five, not having made a suitable match. The same is not said for her younger sister who, although not as pretty, is getting ready to marry a very notable man. Desperate not to be left behind, Kitty agrees to marry Walter, a doctor who is returning to China where his work as a bacteriologist is.After two years with him though, Kitty has discovered that they have nothing in common and does not love him at all or could even begin to. During her time she has found a lover, whom she has fantasies that she can run off and be with him forever. Her hopes are dashed though when they are finally caught by Walter and he gives her two choices. Come with him to a cholera infected area of China, or convince her lover to marry her and divorce his wife. She asks her lover and receives an unexpected answer that forces her to go with Walter in the face of certain death by cholera. It is here however, that she begins to learn and change and try to make herself a better person. The only thing holding her back is the lack of Walter's forgiveness.Kitty is definitely not a like-able character. I don't care that she does work towards becoming a better character as she cannot be consistent with it. I realize it is human nature to do the best for yourself and take the easy route, but she does it quite a bit and I find it hard to sympathize with her. I also don't feel any pity for Walter, her husband. He wasn't a very strong person and in addition to that he just has very strange mannerisms that seem unlikely in a doctor. He would have had trouble going through medical school with some of his social issues.The writing was ok. There was some description but it wasn't written very interestingly. It was in the 3rd person and mainly followed Kitty and all her day to day proceedings. Maugham does great dialogue, but he didn't do as well with making a connection to his characters in my opinion. At times I found myself skimming through some boring parts of the book hoping something would happen.This could probably be considered a classic. But that to me doesn't automatically make a book excellent. I thought this one was average, not fantastic but not poor either.The Painted VeilCopyright 1925246 pagesReview by M. Reynard 2010"},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"W. Somerset Maugham has long been one of my favorite authors. He writes without self-indulgent excess, but rather with a poet's flair coupled with an economic style that demonstrates an acute sense of his audience. His work is never dull and often overflowing with brilliant insight into the human condition, particularly our weaknesses and vanities, and how far we go to fool ourselves. In The Painted Veil, Maugham addresses infidelity and one woman's struggle with change and salvation.Like an expert surgeon, Maugham's passages of Kitty's delusional rationalizations for her adulterous behavior cut to the core of relationship woes and the cheater's mindset. The strength of his words lie in their accuracy and thus, the ability to make everyone who's ever been in the treacherous claws of devious affairs see how foolish they sound. My cheeks burned in spite of myself.Yet, with Kitty, Maugham arguably pulls off a very difficult task - making a dim-witted, selfish, and shallow woman into someone readers may care for at varying points in the novel or, at the very least, not quite as loathsome as she was at first. One of Maugham's skills is to show the humanity and depth of all people, regardless of how easily we dismiss them on the basis of superficiality. It's been said that the actions of human beings can be delineated into two categories: seeking something or avoiding something. Kitty is a woman who is seeking simple pleasures, joy, and easy laughs and avoiding her mother and the mirthless world of a loveless marriage. Ironically, she ends up with the latter and it drives her to adultery. What happens after this clandestine relationship is uncovered, i.e. Kitty's voyage of self-discovery and introspection, drives the bulk of the book.Perhaps Kitty was seeking and avoiding the wrong things. It is through this sojourn that Maugham either wins or loses your support for Kitty. For many, she's simply too vain and stupid to be given the benefit of a second chance. I'm a bit more forgiving for a lot of reasons, however, not the least of which is that I believe her punishment doesn't seem to fit the crime, especially since it is compounded over and again by her cold-blooded, albeit cuckolded husband.A short caveat: There are many derogatory references to the Chinese throughout the book, often straight-up comments about how ugly they are, particularly the children. They are often referred to more often as creatures or \\"it\\" instead of viewed as equals. How you chose to take this might influence your enjoyment of the novel. My wife is Chinese and I viewed it as the ignorance and arrogance of the British at the time, both the characters and possibly the author as well. I'm not a fan of political correctness, but it seems fair to warn the overly sensitive.The Painted Veil is a sad tale full of lost people, and yet, Maugham reminds us time and again that life continues on and there are always people who are not only suffering more, but handling it with far more grace and less self-absorbed angst than the characters who form the core of this lovely novel. Additionally, what I like the most is the ending. Many people felt it was a let-down, but I rather liked that Kitty comes to realize that the path of spirituality is not as clear of obstacles and easy to walk as she envisions. Maugham reminds us that knowing and doing are very different things and that Kitty, like most of us, will stumble a lot on the path to inner peace. Like every book I've read from this gifted author, I come out of the exercise a wiser, smarter, and more understanding person."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"A warning: Unless spoilers don't bother you, I recommend against reading Maugham's introduction to his book. I felt as though I would have preferred not knowing some of the information the introduction forced me to know in advance of reading the text.*When I had finished the first 30 percent of Veil, I was enjoying a selfish, gullible young woman get what was coming to her. After the early going, though, I began to see the book as a growing-up story--Kitty Fane began making steady progress. Whereas, initially, she had no respect for her husband, Walter, and much preferred a far less worthy man, Charlie, she seemed to be a fast learner. In fact, as I neared the mid-point I wondered if any human really learns as fast as Kitty seemed to be learning. Yet, the book moves fast. Time seems compressed, although the events don't last more than perhaps five months. Another speedy feature of the text: Most of the chapters run just a few pages, and, strangely (to me), I liked that. I was aware of no want of proper development or adequate detail.*Maugham had more in mind than dramatizing the improving maturity of a vain woman. After turning the last page, I wonder whether part of his focus was not the power that physical attraction can exert even on a woman making very substantial gains toward wisdom and maturity. But even the two elements I've described so far (getting what one deserves and the power of physical attraction) would not have made Veil for me a favorite item of literature; a third element did: What in life satisfies a human and to what extent are humans capable of achieving satisfaction? Deep in the book, Kitty asks a friend:\\"I'm looking for something and I don't quite know what it is. But I know that it's very important for me to know it, and if I did it would make all the difference.\\"The friend responds with a reference to Tao:\\"Some of us look for the Way in opium and some in God, some of us in whiskey and some in love. It is all the same Way and it leads nowhither.\\"I looked up \\"nowhither\\" to be sure what it meant: No place. All such efforts lead no place. Having turned the last page, I speculate that Maugham's underlying message is, Don't expect much from yourself. He may even be telling us, The fulfillment of modest duty may be as good as it gets."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"I had seen the movie which was based on the book.

However, if you have not yet seen the movie then you will probablly enjoy the book."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"I saw the movie version of The Painted Veil a few months ago and I loved it. I thought that it was a tragically beautiful story and enjoyed learning that it was a novel. After all the book is almost always better than the movie. When I found out that the story was written by W. Somerset Maugham I was a bit wary. I had a bad experience with a work of Maugham's back in high school and I've avoided books by him since.That said I am glad to have read this novel. I found it to be even more tragic and beautiful than the film. At the start of novel Kitty Fane is a very unsympathetic character. She marries Dr Walter Fane out of urgency to escape being put on the shelf, which was almost a certainty once her younger sister announced her engagement. Shorlty after the marriage the Fanes move to China where Walter works as a bacteriologist. Kitty finds Walter to be distant and she soon finds herself seeking affection in the arms of Charles Townsend, a married man who is part of their circle. When the affair is discovered Kitty has a choice to make: the scandal of being divorced by her husband or to travel with him to a cholera ridden area in a remote area.Kitty chooses to go with her husband and fully expects to die as a result. What she finds instead is herself. Kitty was raised by a selfish and uncaring mother and as a result never really learned to care about others. Here Kitty learns that there is more to life than herself, parties and amusements. She begins to volunteer at the local convent and discovers just want it means to care for other human beings. During her time in Mei-tan-fu, Kitty experiences a lot of personal growth, a new way of acting and looking at the world that will serve her well when tragedy hits and the life that she had built for herself changes once again.The Painted Veil is a short novel and the pages pass by quickly as the story is very engrossing. Though Kitty was unsympathetic at first she grows on the reader. As she grows and changes, the affection that the reader has for her also grows. As the novel ends, the reader is left with a sense of hope. Hope that Kitty will find happiness in her life and that the lessons that she learned in China will stay with her.In Short: A story that is as beautiful as it is tragic. Kitty Fane is both a character to be loved and disliked. This is a slow, quiet story that contains a lot of power in its pages. This is a story worth reading and one that I will recommend to others.As originally posted on my blog Ticket to Anywhere"},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"The title is a clue to what the author is attempting in this novel. It is from a poem by Shelley \\"lift not the painted veil that which we call life.\\" Another clue is the poem by Oliver Goldsmith which Walter murmurs at his death bed. Both refer to the \\"maya\\" or illusion of life. Maugham was greatly influenced by Eastern thinking and this novel showcases that thinking. Very sad and very moving book. He is one of my favorite authors."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"Maugham does a fantastic job maturing the protagonist, Kitty Fane, from her spoiled view on life, to a self realization of her actions. I was very disappointed by the end of the book, however, that after her husband dies and she regrets her affair with Charlie, she sleeps with him AGAIN. Why? She lost a lot of her growth she gained in the book when she did that. But I suppose that proves that we are human and continue to make mistakes.I did prefer the film, released in 2006. It made me CARE about Walter and his death more than I did in the book. I was horrified when one of the book characters states that he may have experimented on himself on purpose, rather than accident. I was glad that was left out in the film. I would suggest watching the film before reading the novel, because they are so different from each other. The film is LOOSELY based on the book.Despite these differences, I would highly recommend everyone interested to read this book. It's less than 200 pages and a hard book to put down. Very entertaining, well imaged and I have not \\"highlighted\\" as much as I did in this book than previous books."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"Well done I thought. Norton was very good as was Watts. I believed that they had a personal interest in the project.See 1934 version and 1957 (The Seventh Sin).All three have their own spin with (in my opinion) the book as the real story."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"Maugham's prose is often beautifully facile and his subtle efforts to place his characters carefully into scenes are often brilliant. Such is the case here, at least for the first 3rd of the book. The author invested a great deal of time and effort into developing the characters and plot. I can't escape feeling that 3/4 of the way through this story, Maugham found some distraction that he preferred to finishing this novel and simply dashed off an ending to free up his time and attention.That said, I admit to possibly being spoiled having read The Razor's Edge first.And I would still encourage readers to pick up The Painted Veil.Afterall, my opinion is just that...my opinion!"},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"Although I'm not partial to love and sex novels this one is in a different category althogether. It does contain both but in a very unusual form inasmuch that both love and sex, plus devotion, occur in the book in an unrequited form. A loveless marriage, but with respect, shown by both parties, and an unfaithful wife rejected by her lover leaving the husband with a perculier desire,apparently, to subject them both to almost certain death by volunteering his specialist services to a severe cholera outbreak in a remote area of China. The novel is interesting because of the ex-patriate people working in the area and their dialogues with the disaffected wife - this constitutes the work of a master novelist. The characters are all very real and the tension throughout the novel continues progessively to the very end of the book. The film is also worth seeing but although the characters are very recognisable from their book descriptions, even to the dialogues, the ending has a different twist. There is also slightly more to say about the husband's work and a little more emphasis on the fact that the area was governed, in the mid 1920s. by British colonial rule. Anyway, I recommend both forms of the story very highly but the book has the advantage that feelings are much more easily expressed. Colin J Brock."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"It is a relatively short novel that I had decided to read after seeing the movie.I absolutely loved the movie, and I felt that the added aspects of society and the character of Walter really added to it. The movie had breathtaking scenery and pretty good acting. It had really captured the best aspects of the novel and improved upon them immensely. The background could have been a little stronger in the novel like it had been in the movie, with conflicts between the Chinese and British. I guess it is unfair to compare it to a movie that came decades after, but if you were like me and fell in love with the movie, be prepared because the novel is different in some important ways.A few things had been irksome to me. For one, Kitty could just simply not stop crying. She was almost pathetically weak, while the Kitty in the movie had had a bit of strength. I won't give away the ending, but with all the character had gone through and learned, I was a bit disappointed with her actions and how she felt at the end. It almost carries a misogynistic tone throughout the book, while I felt that the movie had given the character more depth and strength.It had probably just been the sentiment at the time perhaps that led the author to not allow the female protagonist a little more development.That being said, the book is still worth the read for a few reasons. The descriptions are beautiful, and the quality of the writing is high. The development of the protagonist does occur, but just not in a completely satisfying way. There are some satisfying themes of acceptance and betrayal and such. The characterizations are nice and you see this almost entirely from Kitty's perspective. The plot is still decent."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"W.S.Maugham lifted the plot for this novel from Dante. A man catches his wife in adultery and exposes her to a deadly disease in order to murder her without laying a hand on her. He is a government bacteriologist in colonial Hongkong. He takes her to a cholera region in China. It is some time after 1911, the fall of the Qing dynasty. The novel was first published in 1925.Let me rephrase. WSM lifted the basic idea from Dante, not the entire story. Of course things don't go as planned by the husband. Do they ever. In the process we learn much about the family background of the wife and we can't quite like her though we understand where she comes from, poor thing. We get to know the couple fairly well. They are badly matched. WSM was a master at helping us know a person. We don't like either of them much, but we learn to sympathize with her struggles.The person that I have most difficulty with is the British official in the cholera town who begins to open Kitty's eyes about the world. He is the underdog that grows and assumes unreal proportions. Literally, I find the man (Waddington) unbelievable, even if sympathetic. His intellectuality and wisdom are the stuff that second class literature is made of. His Manchu princess' infatuation with him is also not quite plausible and I tend to ascribe it to the general spirit of superiority, typical for the colonial time and quite long after, that rests with WSM's attitude towards China.WSM's interest was in the colonial society of Hongkong, less in the country or the 'locals'. China could have been replaced by any other place in the world, that could supply a cholera epidemic. This novel is about England and its class structure. Kitty, knowing nada about the country and the people, and having declared her lack of interest, even disgust in her husband's curiosity, perceives these people as 'cruel and barbaric race'. Only gradually does she have glimpses of an alternative reality.An exposure to a French nunnery changes her. She sees her two men in a new light: the worthlessness of her lover, the strength of her husband. Too late. The possibility of a return to innocence is lost. Her thoughts when he can't seem to forgive: after all they had gone through, the scenes of horror and desolation, it seemed inept to attach importance to the ridiculous act of fornication.She gets involved with work in the orphanage. It rather annoys me how WSM can't abstain from using the word 'yellow' when referring to Chinese.WSM also didn't take too much trouble with understanding local religions. Describing a Buddhist temple, he talks about a dying belief and about withering gods. History has not quite sustained that kind of arrogance. (The Catholic nuns are a religious presence only to Kitty. They are a charity institution in the Chinese context.)WSM redeems himself a little by letting Waddington give Kitty a fairly decent introduction to the Tao. Does it make sense, she asks. When I have had enough whisky sometimes I think it does. He says, not I.An interesting book, which is not made less interesting by its flaws. It seems to me, based on just this book now, that WSM's had a tendency to over-explain. I have read much more by him, but long ago.(I have not watched the 2006 film and do not want to. I have read about it and can't see value in its change of plot. I watched some scenes on YouTube and thought it intolerable schmalz. Though I do like Naomi Watts, I think I rather go back to Greta Garbo in this case.)"},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"I saw the Greta Garbo movie of this about a week before I started reading it, and by all means the screenplay was more coherent. Some things were changed in the film (her husband is stabbed in a riot, rather than succumbing to the cholera outbreak, and there is no hint of her pregnancy, so far as I could tell). It is not clear in the film whether he is going to die, whereas in the book he definitely dies.Also, there is a dramatic scene between the Chinese military commander (played by Warner Oland, who portrayed Charlie Chan in many films) of the area and Walter (Kitty's husband). Walter tells the commander to burn down the villagers' houses to clean them of the cholera, and he hesitates, then finally orders them burned. The disorder and conflict that occurs are a nice dramatic touch, and this is not in the book at all. The screenplay was by a long shot better dramatically.Maugham spends a lot of time describing Kitty's interactions with the nuns and some with the orphans, her reactions to her environment and the countryside, but almost none on her husband, who dies out of nowhere. No time is spent on him to speak of, which is an astonishing oversight, in my opinion. If Kitty were a more interesting character, this would be justified, but she's shallow, self-absorbed, and impulsive. The worst sin a writer can commit is to leave the reader bored, and that is what he does. Why dwell on this shallow woman? Why spend so much time on the nuns?I am in agreement with the writer of another two-star review here, whose reactions were almost identical to mine:\\"I found the story uninteresting and for the most part uneventful. The Painted Veil is about a one-dimensional, self-absorbed woman. She has an affair with man just like herself. She is married to a simple, self-restrained man who could prove interesting in the story but the writing stays with this boring woman. She has a few experiences that seem to change her and makes her aware that other people in the world exist and have feelings beside her. But alas, she proves to be the same self absorbed woman that she always was but with her new realization she now feels bad about it.\\"The film is more dramatically coherent, more complete.The book leaves you oddly dissatisfied, and you feel that you have just wasted your time.Where's the moral? I don't see it.Also, many typos and odd constructions makes you wonder if the editor or author was at fault."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"Maugham created a marked contrast between the self-centeredness of the main character Kitty and the self sacrifice of both her husband and a group of French nuns working in a cholera ravaged city in China. The story revolves around Kitty and her moral dilemmas as she engages in an affair with a shallow self absorbed man that brings her own short comings into full relief. Her husband Walter Fane while initially seeming dry and uninteresting through her eyes, becomes the true hero of this novel as he tirelessly sacrifices on behalf of the local community.Maugham is always interesting and in The Painted Veil he provides a morality tale that is deeply effecting and well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"This book is a reminder of what great, classic writing has can be! Brilliant! Enjoyed every bit of this as the drama unfolded."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"The Painted Veil is the story of Kitty Fane, an Englishwoman living in Hong Kong in the 1920s. Unhappily married to Walter, a bacteriologist, Kitty embarks on a love affair with Charles Townsend, a local government official. When Walter finds out about the affair, he coerces Kitty into accompanying him to Mei-tan-fu, a town that has been struck with a cholera epidemic.What I loved about this book, and what I love about all Maugham's books, is the way he has with language. The novel is short, but each sentence he uses packs a powerful punch; from the first page I was absolutely enthralled. Kitty is an extremely shallow, materialistic character, but still she's likeable--you even understand why she does what she does. We only see Walter through Kitty's eyes, and we're given a distasteful view of him; I wish that Maugham had introduced the reader to what he was thinking. Despite its flaws, however, I was utterly captivated by The Painted Veil."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"I have not yet seen the movie, but I think Somerset Maugham deserves his place as one of the great authors of the last century. The story is inviting but not overwhelming and the author's sparse prose evoke just the right emotion of each scene. This book also has some important things to say about life and how we live it. This is an emotionally satisfying and heartfelt novel. Among the best 10 novels I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"Few writers of the past century could evoke a sense of mystery and atmosphere like W. Somerset Maugham. And while almost all readers are familiar with his major works (Of Human Bondage, Up at the Villa, The Razor's Edge, Cakes and Ale etc, the film versions of these having added to that international knowledge), few have had the pleasure of reading the rather private but equally satisfying 'feminist work', THE PAINTED VEIL. Now with the announcement that this novel, too, is soon to be released as a motion picture, hopefully many will read the book before, remembering how mesmerizingly well how Maugham can spin a tale.As with all of Maugham's novels, the stridency of class plays a role in this work. In a disturbing opening chapter Maugham places us in the room where Kitty is in the midst of seduction by Charlie Townsend and the adulterous couple shudder at the noise that would indicate that Kitty's bacteriologist husband Walter Kane may be spying on them. The intrigue is set and then the novel retraces the territory that placed the couple en flagrante in the middle of the incipient scandal that will alter the lives of all concerned. Kitty, the elder daughter of a fussy couple in London who had 'shamed' Kitty into finding a husband when Kitty's younger, unattractive sister is engaged, hurriedly marries the shy but solid Walter Kane who is about to be shipped off to Hong Kong. Once into Hong Kong Kitty's sensually hungry eye is met by the handsome but married with three children Colonial Secretary Charlie Townsend and they begin a torrid affair. When Walter discovers his wife's adultery he threatens to divorce her (thereby making public the scandal that would ruin Charlie's career) if she doesn't accompany him to Mei-tan-fu, China where a cholera epidemic is destroying the town. The situation finds Kitty struggling with her disdain for Walter whom she never has loved and eventual loathing for Charlie who proves to be the cad he is by putting his career and marriage over the 'silly thought' of running away with Kitty!Distraught, Kitty joins Walter on the trek to Mei-tan-fu where she gradually adjusts to the situation with the help of the consul Waddington who encourages her to fill her hours with helping the nuns care for the sick and the orphaned children. Kitty's life begins to change as she sees the manner in which Walter is focused on mankind, enhanced by the admiration he gains from the nuns. She discovers she is pregnant (whether by Walter or Charlie she does not know) but soon all attention shifts when Walter succumbs to cholera and Kitty, wanting to stay with the nuns who have helped her see that life does have meaning), returns to Hong Kong, has one last distasteful experience with Charlie whose wife has become the solid friend Kitty has always needed, and sets off for England. Once in Europe she receives a telegram that her mother has died and she returns to London to be with her sister and her distant father. Circumstances alter and Kitty finally finds in her lonely father the need to be loved and pledges to join him as he moves from London to a colonial position, awaiting the birth of a daughter who will be given all the love and training of equality Kitty has never known.Aside from Maugham's gift in creating characters so real we can visualize them, make them part of our reading lives, he also had the gift of descriptive writing about strange places that is as fine as any writer of his day. 'The morning drew on and the sun touched the mist so that it shone whitely like the ghost of snow on a dying star'. In describing the destination in China 'Mei-tan-fu with its crenellated walls was like the painted canvas placed on the stage in an old play to represent a city. The nuns, Waddington, and the Manchu woman who loved him, were fantastic characters in a masque; and the rest, the people sidling along the tortuous streets and those who died, were nameless supers.' The novel is full of these absorbing pictures.THE PAINTED VEIL is a little known Maugham, but for this reader it is one of his finest, most private works. Highly Recommended for all lovers of great literature. Grady Harp, November 06"},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"I bought this book 40 years ago.

I had never read a book by S.Maugham, only knew him by name. The writing is a bit like Oscar Wilde's - with an overuse of the word \\"ironic\\" that was a little tiring - and quite beautiful.Because I had seen the film beforehand, it provided a background and atmosphere and more \\"local color\\" to exotic early 20th century China when I was reading the book - and a sense of upcoming doom because I knew the end. I think I would have found the reading a bit slow going if I hadn't had these \\"mental pictures\\" from the film.What I really liked is how un-novel-like it is : there is no striking epiphany or wonderful reconciliation; we just see - no, \\"live inside\\" - Kitty's feelings, and witness her growing maturity and selflessness.

Nonetheless, compared to the movie (featuring Edward Norton as Walter, the epidemiologist), there is a more even-handed treatment of the marital issues between Kitty and Walter. The movie ended with Kitty's new-founded, mature love for her husband that lent this character dignity, which the book fails to do. Maugham's \\"Painted Veil\\" doesn't flesh out human foibles so much as it harshly indicts sheltered, young women of the wealthy class who were socialized to view their role in life through romanticized notions of marriage and childbearing. \\"The Painted Veil\\" is a \\"period book,\\" lucidly written and solidly plotted. Yet the movie brings to life the horrifying backdrop of cholera and the believable, dramatic transformation of its main characters."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"I discovered W. Somerset Maugham's novel after the release ofthe adaptationstarring Edward Norton and Naomi Watts. Though it is a beautifully performed and filmed movie, I found that it was quite different in essentials from the book. Whilst the film heightens the love story between an estranged husband and wife, the book is much more interested in the spiritual awakening of Kitty and her relationship with the world.Kitty Garstin is a beautiful but shallow woman, who marries bacteriologist Walter Fane in order to escape spinsterhood and her controlling mother. She travels with him to Hong Kong, only to find that she's bored and unsatisfied with the marriage despite her husband's adoration for her, and soon enough she's fallen into an affair with the charismatic and exciting Charles Townsend. But when Walter finds out, Kitty discovers that he has more pride than she gave him credit for. He delivers an ultimatum: if she cannot get Charles to divorce his wife, then Kitty has to accompany him to a new posting in the midst of a cholera epidemic.Sure enough, Charles is proven to be something of a cad, and a rather shell-shocked Kitty finds herself shipped into midland China. Yet it is there that she begins to discover that there's more to life than her cosseted and luxurious lifestyle. In the midst of death and disease, Kitty gradually learns more about herself and her place in the world, the people who surround her and the way in which she affects them.Unlike the film, the book is told entirely from Kitty's point of view and remains a character-study of a young woman's emotional growth throughout. Walter remains a distant figure who exists only in relation to Kitty, and the historical context of China remains unexplored. Unlike the film, Kitty never comes to love Walter, and there's no insight on Chinese culture whatsoever, only that Kitty doesn't understand it and is interested in it insofar that it is alien to her, opening up the possibility that she's incomplete.The title is taken from a Percy Shelley's sonnet, which begins with \\"lift not the painted veil which those who live call Life,\\" a quote that is open to wide interpretation as to how it relates to the text. Kitty herself remains close to both life and death throughout the story, both by living in the midst of an epidemic and her later pregnancy, and there always seems to be a \\"veil\\" between herself and the things that she desires. It's clear that she's searching for something, though not even she knows what it is, and the book doesn't necessarily end on a clear and decisive note. She's not the same woman she was at the beginning of the book, but it's clear that she's still young, and still has much growing to do.Maugham writes in delicate prose and though he doesn't offer much description in the way of the setting or time period, his portrayal of Kitty's though-process manages to be realistic and sympathetic even as she's being utterly selfish. Anyone looking for a historical novel or a romance will be disappointed, for \\"The Painted Veil\\" is a character study first and foremost. Though it is not the best of its genre, it is still a memorable and beautifully written novel."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"I, like many others, saw the movie first (I am a huge Edward Norton fan!). I have come to learn that when I see a movie first that when I pick up the book I have to look at the book as it is completely separate from the movie, and infact is not tied to the movie at all - this is the only way I am able to give a book a fighting chance. That being said, I loved this book (and the movie too). It was actually nice to envision the actors from the movie, in terms of physical looks, while reading the book.Kitty is spoiled rotten, having a life of great privileged. Kitty also prides herself as being very independent, especially from her mother's 'demands' and 'disappointments' that she is not married yet. To get away from her 'overbearing' mother (at least overbearing in Kitty's opinion) she marries Walter Fane, who she does not love and barely likes. Upon their marriage they move straight to China as Walter's work as a scientist is. Bored in China, Kitty meets Charles Townsend, a politician; soon they start a torid love affair! Despite Kitty's new found happiness, Walter finds out. In an attempt to tear Kitty away from Charles Townsend, he uproots them to the center of a Cholera epidemic. Bitter against Walter, Kitty finds her new life unbearable. However, in time she is able to see another side of Walter as he works to save the town's infested water supply and many lives.I would not say that this is a book about a love affair (as Kitty and Charles Townsend have), but more of self discover, as Kitty finds who she is and what she is capable of bearing. All the characters are very well written. I loved and hated Kitty all at the same time; I felt sorry for Walter; and I hated and like Charles Townsend. The plot unfolds expectantly, as W. Somerset Maugham makes you as in the end: \\"What and who is really important to us and in life?\\" You come away from this book with a better understanding of why humans do the things they do. I walked away from this book satisfied as it did not end in the typical way that most books do. There is a happy ending, but at the same time there is not a happy ending; something this book shows both sides of very well."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"Somerset Maugham's novel \\"The Painted Veil\\" explores themes of wrongdoing, forgiveness, repentance, and growth of understanding in a context that mixes religion and irony. Maugham writes in a Preface that the novel was unusual in that he \\"started from a story rather than from a character.\\" The themes of the book thus are more important than the characterizations. The story is told in the third person by a narrator who frequently gets deeply inside the minds and his hearts of his characters, particularly the protagonist, Kitty Fane, 27. The writing is simple and lucid, but the story has unexpected depth. In addition to the many religious references, Maugham sets the tone of the book through important allusions to Dante, Shelley, and Oliver Goldsmith.Maugham sets his story in China in the years following WW I and in Britain. As the book begins, Kitty is living in Hong Kong where she has been unhappily married for two years to an MD who specializes in bacteriology, Walter Fane. Walter is taciturn and reserved but adores Kitty who feels nothing for Walter. In the dramatic opening scenes of the book Walter discovers that Kitty is involved in an adulterous relationship with a highly-placed British official in Hong Kong, Charles Townsend, in his early 40's.Maugham goes back in time to describe the circumstances of the marriage. Kitty's mother had high ambitious to make wealthy if not good marriages for her two daughters. She had also pressured Kitty's father, an unprepossessing attorney, to make more of himself than he was inclined or able to do. For several years, Kitty resists the blandishments of many young well born suitors. When her mother is about to give up, Kitty marries the shy, awkward and to her uninsipring Walter who is stationed in Hong Kong.When he discovers the affair, Walter pressures Kitty to accompany him to a distant Chinese city where a cholera epidemic is raging. Walter has volunteered to be the doctor responsible for fighting the epidemic when the prior doctor had succumbed to the disease. With Kitty's and Walter's anger towards one another, loneliness, and ever-present death from the disease, Kitty begins the process of understanding and changing her life. She is befriended by an Englishman, Waddington, who imbibes freely and has a witty sense of irreverance but who also has a spiritual, philosophical inclinations. Kitty gets to know a convent of French nuns who devote themselves at great cost to fighting the cholera and learns a great deal from them about her own life and values. From Waddington, Kitty learns about Taoism and, to a lesser and somewhat unsympathetic extent, about Buddhism.Kitty tries to understand herself and her failings in light of the large mass of suffering she sees around her and in light of the patient, self-sacrificing, and noble character of the nuns, particularly the Mother Superior at the convent. There is also a degree of irony in the story as Walter, who took the position in part to punish and perhaps cause Kitty's death for her infidelity succumbs to the epidemic himself under questionable circumstances.Kitty changes in several ways, with some understandable backsliding. Broad religious themes of suffering and acceptance combine uneasily with Kitty's growing understanding of individuality and personal freedom. On the more general level, Kitty and Waddington develop a sense of the value of the religious outlook even in a secular world. Responding to Kitty's question whether the nuns have devoted their lives to an illusion, Waddington says:\\"Their lives are in themselves beautiful. I have an idea that the only thing which makes it possible to regard this world we live in without disgust is the beauty which now and then men create out of the chaos. The pictures they paint, the music they compose, the books they write, and the lives they lead. Of all these the richest in beauty is the beautiful life. That is the perfect work of art.\\"On a more individual level is Kitty's vow at the end of the book: \\"I want a girl because I want to bring her up so that she shan't make the mistakes I've made. .... I'm going to bring up my daughter so that she's free and can stand on her own feet. I'm not going to bring a child into the world, and love her, and bring her up, just so that some man may want to sleep with her so much that he's willing to provide her with board and lodging for the rest of her life.\\" There are issues here not only of personal independence but also of the view of human sexuality that restricts legitimate sexual relationships, for men as well as women, to marriage.One gets the impression that a tempered, nonsectarian spirituality has the final word in this thoughtful, meditative book. It is the path that Kitty sees in the life of the convent, the \\"path that led to peace.\\"Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"The more I think about this book, the more that I realize that I really admired it. I brought it with me to Singapore because it seemed like a good book to read in Asia. This was true, but at the time of reading I didn't give the book itself that much thought. It was only after I put it down that I found myself thinking more about Kitty Fane and her personal growth.There are certain kinds of characters that most novelists (and people) dismiss as irredeemable. Kitty Fane is one of those. Fiery women are worth salvaging in novels of every stripe. Shallow women generally only exist to provide a foil against which the real heroine can be placed. Kitty Fane is everything that we love to hate-- pretty in a young and showy kind of way, vulgar, shallow, not very clever. The book begins with her cheating on her scientist husband with a married equally vulgar cad. There's nothing at all to make the reader think that Kitty will be the hero of the book. All the sympathy lies automatically with Walter.One of the things that I've liked very much in the books that I have read by Maugham is that he seems to specializing in offering redemption to precisely this kind of character. He refuses to give up on them. And even if he does not forgive them their faults, he allows them to forgive themselves. I suspect many will be unhappy with the ending that he gave Kitty (it isn't, by any means, the conventional story) but I really admired him for it. It was one of my beloved negotiated happy endings-- no white horse, no happily ever after-- but a woman who has put herself on the right path and will not even let her own continuing maturation and mistakes shake her from following its trail. I like these kinds of happy endings because I can believe in them.In short: strong prose, humanism, and the ability to surprise. I liked it."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"The Painted Veil pits amiable but unscrupulous fools against tormented souls, has a duly sarcastic starting-point, and is set in far-away, warlord-era China; in short, it has the ingredients for vintage Maugham.The book begins in Hong Kong, with an adultery scene. Kitty Fane is beautiful, shallow, and calculating. She soon finds her match in Charles Townsend, a vain and cynical but popular colonial official - and in her own husband, the lover's very photo-negative, who drags her through plague-ridden country in revenge. The story is that of her spiritual transformation. It can even be read to show women's superior ability for moral elevation.The Painted Veil is full of Maugham's innumerable human insights, and it is filled with danger, physical and psychological. This is an easy to read, absorbing novel. Readers expecting lush visions of warlord-era China to jump from the page, though, will need to look in another place. The \\"native\\" country is distant, dream-like and morbid, seen through the eyes of the heroine, whose preoccupations are elsewhere. It is only peered at from the height of a curtained palanquin. Indeed, the novel paints the superficial and self-centred expatriate community of Hong-Kong much more than it does labouring China; as such, it probably remained true to life until very recent times."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"\\"The Painted Veil\\" is one of the most pro-feminism novel that William Somerset Maugham wrote. The narrative is about the spiritual growth the heroine, who after a lot of pain becomes a better human being. Even the secondary female characters have a deeply change throughout the novel, like Mrs Townsend and Mother Superior. It is essentially a novel about women, and their will to go after what they want - even if it is not the right thing.One of the things the main character, Kitty, wants is to divorce her doctor husband and marry her lover Townsend. Little does she know that her lover is not willing to abandon his family to join her. This is the main disappointment that she suffers in her life and leads her to a journey (a metaphorical and an actual one) of self-discovery. This kind of device is always used by writers and here it is has a great importance. When Kitty join her husband to go to a place dominated by a plague, the couple is offering themselves to death. Readers can imagine that not both of them will survive this destiny.If on the one hand Kitty is a very clear character from the beginning - one can figure her out from the first page - her husband is a enigma for both her and readers alike. Extremely inhibited, rigid and sad. Even if not being able to understand this man, Maugham makes clear that his is the kind of person that will never be happy.As a rule, Maugham's writing is charming and precise - he can find both beauty and sadness in the world at the same time, and translated them into words. He can pull out descriptions of Chinese landscape and the inner emotional landscape of his characters - mostly kitty. And he makes both of them very compelling. As he puts, one has to very strong in order to change his/her faith. It is possible, as long as the person wants to.\\"The Painted Veil\\" tackles above all with the painful process of growing up. As Maugham exploits it can be even more painful if already are a grown up. Kitty's journey is beautiful and touching. In the end she is not the only one who is different."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"An unusual read, I was engrossed after the first page! And as avid readers, we know what a delight it is to find a book that can enchant us in the first chapter and hold our interest until the end, and even beyond. The story follows a married British couple,Walter and Kitty Fane. Walter Fane is a bacteriologist that is working for the British government while stationed in Hong Kong. Kitty, a young and bored wife, soon succumbs to her passions with another man. Charles, another British government official. This affair comes to an end when they suspect Walter has found out about their liaisons. This is where the real excitement begins, and maybe the first form of &quot;biological punishment&quot; witnessed in a classic novel. What does this mean? Buy the book, and I promise that you will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"I agree with the many reviewers here who enjoy this as a gripping literary read. But it is also the first of three fine novels about Hong Kong - along with Timothy Mo's The Monkey King and Paul Theroux's Kowloon Tong, this book for me contained insights into certain Hong Kong personalities I encountered during my residence there in the 90's. In the case of the Painted Veil, a novel from the 1920's (!), certain actions and attitudes of western expatriates were still visible in my day (before and after the end of British rule). A little bit of playing at being &quot;gentlemen&quot; by people who could not afford the pose back home. This book, like Mo's and Theroux's, caused no end of upset in certain quarters of Hong Kong when released. Though it was not banned in China, like Kowloon Tong, in Hong Kong &quot;writs were served!&quot; (Parts of Hong Kong can react a little bit like a small town when its described by someone who's left it for better things - the other parts read these books with pleasure.) The detached reader need not worry about any of this - it's a great read. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"W. Somerset Maugham's love life was paradoxical, especially since he had many affairs with both men and women during his lifetime. He wrote: \\"I have most loved people who cared little or nothing for me and when people have loved me I have been embarrassed... In order not to hurt their feelings, I have often acted a passion I did not feel.\\" Therefore, it is not wondrous that Dante's character, Pia, should inspire one of my favorite stories, THE PAINTED VEIL.In 1925 England, Kitty Garstan is a spoiled young woman who revels in the attention of \\"her\\" young men. She is shallow and jejune, but the young Bacteriologist, Walter Fane, loves her to his own detriment. Though he knows she is embarrassed by his marriage proposal because she does not love him, she accepts to escape the shame of her homely younger sister's impending nuptials. Mrs. Garstan warns of spinsterhood and the loss of beauty. After all, Kitty IS 25 and with no recent \\"good marriage\\" proposals, besides a life in Hong Kong where Walter is stationed intrigues Kitty.Much to Kitty's delight, she finds the colonial outpost's society and the attention of the handsome Colonel Charles Townsend greatly to her liking. The Assistant Governor of Hong Kong is her living, male doppelganger. Bored with Walter, Kitty soon falls into an affair with the married Townsend. But Walter is no fool. He knows. \\"I have eyes, Kitty.\\"Then to Kitty Fane's astonishment, her husband agrees to allow her to divorce him under one condition: Charles must divorce his wife and they, Kitty and Townsend, must marry within a week of both decrees or Walter will ruin her lover by naming the Colonel as co-respondent. Otherwise, he expects his wife to accompany him to Mei-tan-fei, a city in the height of a Cholera epidemic.An ecstatic, Kitty rushes to Charles and discovers another truth that her husband knows. The man she loves is a cad, a supercilious one at best. Devastated, she returns home and tells Walter, that she is to go to Mei-tan-fu with him. During the days of their long journey, she mourns the loss of her lover and resigns herself to the fate her husband has planned for her. Dr. Walter Fane means for her die of the Cholera that is plaguing the Chinese city. Awaiting her certain death, Kitty Fane discovers beauty, strength, and serenity within herself. But the greatest realization for Maugham's Pia is the lesson of love: how she has affected those people who had tried to love her by withholding her own love. By forgiving the callous selfishness learned from her mother Kitty can truly love and be loved by others she desperately needs.THE PAINTED VEIL is strictly told by Kitty's point of view, since Maugham created her character first, rather than allowing the setting dictating Kitty's thoughts, words, and actions. Borrowing the story of the Sienna gentlewoman from Dante's INFERNO and infusing Percy's sonnet line -\\"Lift not the painted veil which those who live call life \\"- Maugham delivers a hauntingly beautiful story of character growth in his usual compact prose."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"A forbidden love affair. Analysis of gender roles. Philosophizing over the truth of a religious path in life. Criticism of class structure. Woohoo, I am THERE. This novel has it all. Before I get to the content and the societal critique this book presents, I need to say this book is beautiful. The words, the phrases, the descriptions and the character growth is amazing. Maugham is an artist and for nothing else, these are reasons to read this book.I now realize that my high school failed to assign me the really good classics and I somehow missed taking the right classes in college that would have given me the experience reading these books. How did I miss this book? Why did I never pick it up on my own? Years ago I read Maugham's Of Human Bondage and while it was well written with interesting characters, it was not a book that I enjoyed. So it was only because of encouraging goodreads friends that I read The Painted Veil. This is a book that is not to be missed, If you enjoy audio books then I recommend listening to the BBC Productions audio version (not the Kate Reading version - I like Kate Reading, just not reading this book - -thank you Catie for that recommendation!)The story is framed in an interesting way, while the set up seems to be focused on love and marriage it is focused on (albeit in a subtle way) examining the role women have in society, their options and their choices. Guess what the moral of the story is? While remaining in the confines of traditional upper class society there are very limited choices for women. There are examples of women in this story - both unhappy and happy and fulfilled. The happy and fulfilled women are nuns who have dedicated themselves to the ministry of the sick and the poor, meaning they have completely exited from the traditional roles of wives and mothers and live apart from those expectations. The unhappy women are those that center their lives around the social structure of the upper class and the attainment of the best marriages for their daughters.The story begins with the main character Kitty who is a young lady by our modern standards but nearing the end of her ability to get a spouse due to her age. Kitty is beautiful, charming and raised to believe that her entire value lies in her looks and talents in making men want her. Kitty seems to believe in this as a valuable skill. Enter her last marriage option - a boring, unattractive research doctor Walter. Walter is portrayed as honorable and later in the story as the victim, but I didn't buy in to that at all. Walter wants Kitty because of her charm and beauty and so he courts her and asks her to marry him. He does not know her and does not appreciate anything in her beyond her beauty. So we have a marriage now of two people enamored with Kitty's appearance: Kitty and Walter. Sorry Walter, I can't feel sorry for you or respect you. This book was published by Maugham in 1924-1925, it was serialized and published in a magazine. To me, this date time line is amazing. Maugham is making an amazing commentary that still stands as timely today: our value in life goes beyond appearance. Women's value reaches beyond marriage.So thus far we have a typical set up - beautiful girl, boring well established man, a marriage and then the couple moves to Shanghai. The bulk of the story is set in both Shanghai and then a province of China.Kitty becomes further bored with her marriage, her husband often doesn't notice her or pay attention to her. He is focused on his research and really, he married her to bed her - -right? His connection with her is tenuous and centered on what she can do for him carnally, nothing more. What is honorable about that? Eventually Kitty enters into an affair and her husband discovers her unfaithfulness. (not a spoiler) The rest of the story deals with Kitty attempting to atone for her crime, longing for her lost lover and learning that there is more to herself than her appearance. She gradually realizes there is more to life than just being a pretty girl on a man's arm; and that there is more to life than being desired. Maugham very artfully, but subtlety contrasts Kitty with the older nuns who work in a rural orphanage. These woman are honorable, they have surrendered all worldly desires and they are not in the race to be a wife nor a beautiful decorative piece. Through knowing them, Kitty grows, is spiritually awakened and becomes a character that readers will want to know, to be friends with. She respects who the nuns are and what they have accomplished in life but she questions their surrender to a higher being and she questions the necessity of evolving as they have done while being dedicated to a religion. At the same time Kitty is spiritually awakened, but she further questions whether the Christian path the nuns have taken is the One path to spirituality. This questioning of religion and gender shocked me. Were mainstream published authors questioning gender and religion during the 1920s? I guess they were, but how the heck did I not know this?The story ends in a very satisfying and inspiring way. I highly recommend this story for everyone."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed The Painted Veil.

It just doesn't get any better. MORE MORE MORE like this...that is my wish."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"This novel has one of the most intriguing opening scenes I've ever read. A tryst is taking place in Hong Kong between Kitty and Charlie when they discover that someone is outside turning the latches on the shutters--her husband, no doubt. The tone becomes much more somber, however, from this point forward. Kitty's husband Walter, a bacteriologist, issues an unpleasant ultimatum which results in her accompanying him to a cholera-infested town in China. Both Kitty and Walter find that they despise themselves and that perhaps this move is a suicide mission. The story is really about Kitty's maturity process as she confronts her own frivolousness and tries to live up to the standard of kindness, industry, courage and integrity that Walter exemplifies. A pivotal moment is when she finds herself pregnant and is faced with the task of telling her husband that she does not know who the father is. As Kitty is in the process of transforming herself, she is faced with one last temptation. Her handling of that situation proves that she's come a long way but is still human. This book packs a powerful punch in a short number of pages."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"This book makes us re-evaluate all the little details we fuss about in our daily lives. It is amusing to watch how Kitty, the simple uneducated wife of a prominent British wakes up to the reality of life and gains a whole new perspective after going through life changing events."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"advises one of the handful of colorful characters (the Mother Superior) in this story of a formerly foolish young lady's transformation into a woman of substance.The story starts with the author inserting the reader smack dab in the middle of the room where its adulterers, a 27-year-old married woman named Kitty Fane and her also married lover 41-year-old Charles Townsend, are secretly rendezvousing. Behind the locked door of her bedroom, they concernedly contemplate the identity of he or she who just tried to turn the doorknob. Was it her bacteriologist husband, Dr. Walter Fane, or simply a servant? Maugham's character descriptions are pointedly perfect. Kitty's mother is a, (p 19) \\"hard, cruel, managing, ambitious, parsimonious, and stupid woman.\\" Kitty thinks of Walter as (p 37) \\"a restrained, cold, and self-possessed man\\" who \\"loved her madly,\\" and Charles as (p 38) \\"tall and handsome.\\" During their first meeting, Charles flatters her by stating she's a \\"a raging beauty.\\"When Walter finds out, he confronts his wife, giving her two choices, one which the answer to will show her lovers' true colors, the other which will test her mettle. She takes the semi-suicidal route: agreeing to accompany him to Mei-tan-fu amidst a cholera epidemic. There they meet several interesting characters, including: Waddington, who, not knowing about the adulterous relationship, provides some eye-opening information about Charles and insightful comments about the Fane's marriage. The convent's Mother Superior, who, respectful and appreciative of Dr. Fane's efforts against the epidemic, helps his wife see his goodness. Of course, some sad stuff has to happen to help Kitty gain proper perspective on the men in her life.Worst of the book is the negative portrayal of the Chinese, best: super short chapters, great character development, and wonderful imagery. Here's one of my favorites (p 133): \\"The sky was unclouded and the early sun shed a heavenly mildness on the scene; it was difficult to imagine, on that blithe, fresh, and smiling morn, that the city lay gasping, like a man whose life is being throttled out of him by a maniac's hands, in the dark clutch of the pestilence. It was incredible that nature (the blue of the sky was clear like a child's heart) should be so indifferent when men were writhing in agony and going to their death in fear.\\" The Painted Veil is a short, stellar story about a woman's transformation in the face of tragedy. Also good: Silas Marner by George Eliot, The Wings of the Dove by Henry James, and Reservation Road by Richard Yates."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"The story line has been described several times, so it's not worthrepeating. The book seems very introspective, even for Maugham.However, there is enough happening, that one does not looseinterest. While I can't claim to understand Kitty, and neither does she seem tofully understand what happened to her by the end of the book, thestory drew me in. Kitty changes so dramatically over the courseof a couple hundred pages that her internal struggles are probablymore gripping than the description of the turmoil around her.While Maugham could write excellent short stories and short novels,I did enjoy his longer novels the best. While the \\"Painted Veil\\" is certainlyworth reading, it simply doesn't have the scale of those longer works.Therefore a comparison is probably not fair."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"I enjoyed the book very much, I saw the movie on tv first and then wanted to read the book.

Don't complain about the book being different from the movie. There are things like dead authors that scriptwriters cannot consult with. There are budgets. There are actors who are unable to portray the character the way that the writer intended. There are movie studios that hammer out a long listing of demands and restrictions, like length of the film and where it can be shot, etc. Don't ever expect a book to be like a movie, and vice versa. Unreal.***Spoilers below***Kitty Garstin is the elder daughter of a controlling woman and her put-upon, beleaguered husband. Mr. Garstin has never lived up to his wife's expectations, and neither has Kitty. She's unmarried and bordering spinsterhood (according to 1920s standards - NOT 2006 WHEN THE MOVIE WAS MADE). She meets Dr. Walter Fane, a bacteriologist and also an M.D. who is a public servant in Hong Kong. As Kitty's younger sister, Doris, is marrying a baron, and Kitty feels pressure to marry and leave her father's home.Kitty impulsively accepts Walter's unexpected proposal of marriage, knowing fully that she does not love him. Walter immediately takes Kitty to live with him in Hong Kong, where she enters colonial society. She very soon meets the Townsends and begins an affair with Charlie, a forty-something colonial secretary. Walter discovers the affair and demands that Kitty accompany him to a remote village, Mei-fan-tu, which has been overrun with a cholera epidemic ... certain death for them both.Kitty balks and refuses to go to Mei-fan-tu, and Walter agrees to divorce Kitty quietly only if Charlie will divorce his wife AND immediately marry Kitty. He does this knowing that Charlie will not leave his wife for Kitty, which Kitty soon discovers. Since Kitty cannot procure a divorce and remarriage with Charlie, she leaves Hong Kong with Walter, who shows her no kindness.The majority of the novel is Kitty's personal growth in Mei-fan-tu. She discovers that her husband is selfless and adored by the nuns who run the hospital he does his research and treats the cholera patients at. The other characters here, particularly British civil servant Waddington and the French Mother Superior, are well-written and assist Kitty in growing from a petulant, selfish young girl to a humbled, generous woman. She works with the Chinese orphans and from a distance understands the extent of the cholera epidemic swirling around her. Quite unexpectedly, she discovers that she is pregnant. She tells Walter, who has barely warmed to her, and he asks if the child is his. She knows that it is not, and in fact it is Charlie Townsend's, but doesn't lie to Walter to gain his love and trust back.Walter eventually catches cholera and his death is quick; Kitty barely has time to prepare for it. She is shocked at how little she grieves for him, and tries to continue the life she has built in Mei-fan-tu ... her friendly, platonic relationship with Waddington, her friendships with the nuns, and the work that she does with the orphans. She soon discovers that pregnant or not, she soon realises that her place is not in Mei-fan-tu. The nuns ask her not to return to work as it is too dangerous, and packs up what little she has in Mei-fan-tu and returns to her home in Hong Kong.Upon her return to Hong Kong, she is unexpectedly met by Charlie Townsend's wife, Dorothy. Dorothy admits that she thought that Kitty was quite vulgar when they lived in Hong Kong at the same time, and felt horrible about it. She begs Kitty to stay with her and Charlie as it was too overwhelming for Kitty to return to her home. Kitty reluctantly agrees and avoids Charlie, but eventually Charlie worms his way into Kitty's room and takes advantage of her weak emotional state. Until Charlie approaches her, Kitty has never really grieved for Walter, but breaks down into heaving sobs ... and Charlie pounces on her sexually. It is a consensual sexual act as Kitty is reminded of the passion between them, but hates herself afterward and leaves the Townsend's home immediately to return to her parents' home.En route to England, she finds that her mother has died, but not without some coarse words from her via post before she dies. She arrives home to find that her father has finally been awarded the Chief Justice position in the Bahamas, ironically after Mrs. Garstin had pushed him into such a role for their entire marriage - she never lived to see it. Mr. Garstin is finally free of the women in his life and looking forward to starting out again on his own. Kitty begs him to take her with him, and he reluctantly agrees. The book ends with an odd kiss to Kitty from her father (\\"on the lips, almost like a lover\\"), and her declaring that she would raise her unborn daughter (she is sure it was a girl) to be independent and not befall the same marital/extra-marital fate that Kitty had.Overall, it is beautifully written. The chapters are very short and quite descriptive, so it's easy to paint a picture in your mind. Maugham's writing style is very easy to follow; not too dense or too simplistic. The story is tragic yet very human, and Kitty is easy to identify with. Very well done, and I highly recommend it.Unless, that is, you've seen the movie first."},{"Title":"The Painted Veil","review":"This is a truly enjoyable book to read.

Mr. Boyd has done a great job explaining in detail the surroundings of the Chatooga watershed and the river - rapid by rapid, trail by trail. He gives details of the upper sections and how the river is used for trout fishermen all the way down to the infamous Five Falls and the excitement it brings to kayakers and rafters. The author goes through great efforts in outlining the potential dangers associated with whitewater and also provides the reader with very graphic visuals of the beautiful scenery unmatched by this area of South Carolina and Georgia. I am familiar with this river and have read this book along with a previous edition. The information provided about access points to the river are very accurate and will not take a newcomer to a uncertain location. The author has put in a great deal of effort in providing the reader with a useful and accurate resource to the Chatooga watershed and one can immediately notice that the author has a special place in his heart for the Chatooga River."},{"Title":"Experiences in Translation (Toronto Italian Studies)","review":"For anyone interested in how literary translation works, this is an appropriate place to begin. Eco writes in a clear, almost spare manner, mixing general observations with actual examples from his own works. The Name of the Rose. his most famous novel, is cited from the standpoint of the challenges it represented for his various translators, and William Weaver, who rendered it into English, comes in for special kudos. Experiences in Translation is divided into two parts. The first, \\"Translating and Being Translated,\\" is the more interesting and will appeal to both experienced and fledgling translators. The second, \\"Translation and Interpretation,\\" deals with semiotics and seems aimed more at specialists. The book is based on a series of lectures Eco gave in 1998, but the insights are timeless.

Apparently I would have been better to find a book written for a higher-level course or for graduate school.This book contained no new information from my perspective. For example, I was disappointed that the book only devoted 4 pages to vegetarian diets. Obviously, it is impossible to cover all aspects of the various types of vegetarian diets in 4 pages.If you are looking for a book that covers the basics of nutrition this is a decent resource.

If you are looking for in-depth information on one particular type of dietary plan or lifestyle choice (for example, vegetarianism), this is probably not the book for you -- after all, this is an introductory textbook, and thus provides a more general overview of the subject. However, the text does provide a lot of valuable information about human nutrition and also offers a thorough discussion of current diet controversies, as well as information that will aid those seeking to create a practical exercise/training plan.The textbook is a bit crowded with colorful charts and graphs; I personally was not annoyed by them, but if you are easily distracted by visual clutter, be forewarned.

This second volume in the series focuses on Elder Anthony (Putilov), the first abbot in the monastery and one of it's lesser known of the Optina Elders. A man afflicted by many excruciating illnesses throughout his life, and a man with an unbending faith in God, this biography proves that Orthodoxy is not a mystical way of life wrapped around incense but a faith of human proportions."},{"Title":"Elder Anthony of Optina","review":"If there is one word, which could sum up Elder Anthony's ministry and example it would be humility. He willfully submitted to so much during his earthly life.He submitted to his father's desire that he not become a monastic for a long time. Even against his own desires, he submitted to his earthly father.For a long time after he became a monk, his own brother was his Elder (Elder Moses of Optina)...and imagine submitting yourself to your brother, even if in a monastic setting (a most difficult task indeed.)Not only that, but he endured untold physical suffering. He had many and various ailments that he patiently endured as part of God's will.He also took the burden of becoming an abbot, something most monastics do not want to do, since it requires so much time handling earthly matters.All of these things he endured patiently without grumbling to others or about others. While many would call this weak willed, Elder Anthony showed strength and discernment in realizing that all these things helped him along the path of salvation.An inspiring story of a simple man that loved God with every ounce of his being.In addition to a biography of his life, the book also includes several letters he wrote and some of his teachings.A fantastic book of a true disciple of Christ."},{"Title":"Elder Anthony of Optina","review":"This book is a wonderful introduction into the very beginnings of the great Optina spiritual tradition. Especially fascinating is the realtionship between Elder Anthony and his brother and spiritual father, Elder Moses. Fr. Clement has provided the text of several letters between these two men from the period of Elder Anthony's abbacy at St. Nicholas-Maloyaroslavets monastery that give poignant insight into Elder Anthony's personal struggle with his heavy and often unwanted spiritual resposibilities. The additional texts from Elder Anthony's personal writings give the reader a glimpse into the mind and heart of the man himself and reveal his gentleness and humility of soul.As for this publication, the text itself pre-dates the 1917 Revolution and so it is thankfully devoid of any political undercurrent from the Russian Church's internal rift between the Synod and the Patriarchate of Moscow. The only thing that keeps this reader from giving this publication five stars is the Foreword, which has a tone of idealizing the past and maligning the present, a familiar foible of the publisher that one must simply put up with in light of the much greater service that St. Herman's Press has done in bringing us this present volume and all the others in the \\"Optina Elders\\" series.This is a worthwhile read for Orthodox faithful as well as those who take an interest in the history of Russian religious thought."},{"Title":"Hill Country: Stories About Hunting and Fishing and Dogs and Guns and Such","review":"Gene Hill truly understands the way a sportsman feels and thinks.

He had just returned home to Monroe, North Carolina from serving in the United States Military only to fight a war on the homefront.I was assigned to read this book for my 20th Century American History class in college and it's a crucial part of a non-fiction account in explaining how life was in the South during the Jim Crow laws and segregration in the 1950s until the Civil Rights movement was in full force.The author writes from his point of view in a convincing and persuasive style in order to help defend his right and others to bear arms in the South. In his home town of Monroe, North Carolina, African Americans were subjected to horrors of abuse and their perpetrators (almost always Caucasian) would get away from law enforcement.Williams writes that he doesn't support violence with violence. No, he argues that for African Americans in his community, the right to bear arms and defend themselves is necessary since law enforcement, government agencies, and even the Monroe Police Department failed to defend their citizens based on race.The stories here are true and horrifying about injustice to African Americans during this period. This book should be mandatory reading for everybody in the United States with regards to studying civil rights."},{"Title":"Negroes with guns","review":"Robert F. Williams is a man who is forgotten in most histories of The Civil Rights Movement. He talked and practiced self-defense before Malcolm X became a household name.

This book will enlighten you about the brave men and women who stood up to the KKK during the civil rights struggle 50 years ago.

It turns the standard political wisdom of &#34;Democrat vs Republican&#34; and &#34;Conservative vs Liberal&#34; on its head and takes a hard view of the life and death struggles of African Americans on the front lines of the struggle for racial equality. This book also shows how well meaning and arrogant political officials and community organizers from all sides of the political spectrum turned their backs on the African American community of Monroe, NC, what that felt like, and highlights the few populist organizations that stood with this community and with the author. The sides different organizations and politicians took in this life or death struggle is surprising and insightful."},{"Title":"Negroes with guns","review":"This is one of my favorite books, and It represents what a real struggle is, and how it should be handled"},{"Title":"Negroes with guns","review":"Mr. William's account of what he and BLACK folk in and around Monroe, NC were faced with is very instructional. Mr. Williams, a marine veteran of the Korean police action and a very religious man, was clear as to exerting his and other BLACK people's human rights; to live unincumbered from the racist and murderous white people's crazy rule. Mr. William's tried many times to work within the white people's version of democracy and law enforcement, and each time was lied to. It is interesting to note that the white people always wanted Mr. William's and the other BLACK men of Monroe to disarm, but the white people would not. And the NAACP's caving under pressure and suspending Mr. Williams is further instructional as to how the \\"willie lynch syndrome\\" can infect a people's movement to realizing their human rights.

Not quit as interesting as his Richard III but then look at the subject. Richard is controversial. Warwick is cut and dried. Still he's an interesting character. Kendell, who was an English professor at Ohio U. when I knew him, wrote better history than criticism and the former is hard to beat. Warwick stands as a nice companion to Richard III and certainly fills out the picture. Kendell's style is very readable but neither sensational nor condescending. He cites his sources. Argues closely and is willing to consider all points of view. He does take stands but they are not unequivocal. My question has always been how a man as savvy as Warwick could be such a fool at the end. Most important of all here is the fact that Kendell knows his subject and his times. Nothing is glossed over or romanticized but he doesn't like so many historians bog you down in details you don't need to know. This is a work by a true scholar and a man who knows how to write. Fun and interesting to read. I would give it five stars for those interested in the subject. Far better than his Louis XI which was a disappointment.

She has an easy familiarity with the criminal justice system after having spent many years working in that area. LEAVE ME BY DYING is a prequel to already published Ellis Portal novels. A series of movies may be in the works based on Auberts Ellis Portal series.Ellis Portal is 23 years old, and the year is 1965. He is in Toronto and is attending Law School. His rich and handsome friend and fellow student Gleason Adams requests that Ellis accompany him to an autopsy, which will become part of a school project they need to work on. Once there, all is not routine. The body is that of a young woman, at first glance, with a bag over her head and a rope around her neck. The autopsy is interrupted, and the body disappears, but not before Gleason fingers a packet from the body which contains two unusual rings. In the meantime, Portal rushes to pull together another project which might gain entry for him as an intern to Magistrate Sheldrake Tuppin. Kavin, his professor, tries to give Portal a feeling for what the law is really like:\\"'Magistrate Tuppin is of the 'Dirty Hands' school.' Kavin smiled, waiting for my inevitable comment. Everyone knew Tuppin to be an impeccable man-even, his enemies charged, a bit of a dandy.'I can't imagine the magistrate having any part of his anatomy less than perfectly sanitary at any time, but I do take your meaning, sir,' I answered. 'If you want to impress Tuppin,' Kavin said, 'come down from your ivory tower, Portal.'\\"Rosemary Aubert writes an excellent mystery that works on many levels: as a psychological puzzle; as a 'coming of age' tale for a somewhat stuffy law student who really hasn't had much experience; as an analysis of what havoc bigotry against gay people wreaks; as a family tragedy; and as a tale with as many twists and turns as the reader could possibly hope for. Aubert writes with a heavy hand towards characterization, and her characters don't disappoint. Family is ever-present in Aubert's presentation, as Portal confronts differing viewpoints in his family. Aubert also takes on the issues of Vietnam, the awakening to Selma and Martin Luther King, the plight of gays, and the transformation of Italian immigrants to positions of power.Shelley GlodowskiSenior Reviewer"},{"Title":"The First Olympic Games","review":"My 7 yr old and I are studying Ancient Greece, and I came upon this book in the library.

Pillow uses qualitative and quantitative data to examine America's ongoing teen pregnancy problem. The only western nation without comprehensive sex education, America also boasts a dubious distinction of having the western world's highest teen pregnancy rate.Teen pregnancy became noticed as an individual demographic-specific problem in the 1960's, but different races were and have always been treated differently in America when they find themselves pregnant.White women were historically regarded as having made a 'bad choice', but ultimately were redeemable (through the intervention of moralistic social service personnel) only if they sequestered themselves in maternity homes. Here they could become 'repaired' through a strict regimen of religion and vocational training, while they were supposed to ultimately find a man---their having a child allegedly limited marriage ability. Later on, some homes would even offer adoption services, allowing the woman to further \`erase' the teenage pregnancy and have a second chance at respectability.Contrasting, black teenage pregnancies became cited as \`evidence' of that community's problems and consequently were left to their own devices. Black teenagers traditionally were supposed to turn to their own for assistance.Although teens are no longer kicked out of school for becoming pregnant (Title IX), they are instead being handed many punitive options by our government. The same entities who do not give them access to information about preventing a pregnancy then appear to constantly remind them that their options are limited once they are pregnant. This compounds the sense of isolation which those young women have.What daycare and social service programs exist for teens is not enough to meet the demand. The American government historically and currently does not want to make the social policy investitures required for having actual social change. Connaught \`Connie' Marshner was a Reagan administration political appointment to head the office of family life, but she actually knew very little about the program which she was supposed to direct. Marshner was soon replaced by somebody with more related experience, but that 1980's incident is emblematic of how little priority the government gave to seriously addressing and then ending teen pregnancy. If bureaucracies ultimately function through expertise only, the first appointment never was actually going to address teen pregnancy. Rather it was going to reinforce ideological stereotypes about \`promiscuous youth' and 'values'; 'good people' allegedly did not have teen pregnancies.The 'promiscuous low-income youth' myth reared its head in the 1990's with welfare reform. Welfare reform itself was built on the assumption that young women of color were becoming rich from having litters of babies, selectively ignoring the actual payment levels pre-reform, which were not enough to live above poverty anywhere inside this country. The sexuality of black women ultimately provided sufficient ammunition for politicians to attack the welfare state, even Democratic president Bill Clinton had endorsed and signed the measure.She also includes information on Hispanic young women. By virtue of being people of color they are also being victimized through race-sexuality dichotomies and additionally face language barriers while trying to obtain social services. The thrust of the book's racial-ethnic focus is centered on the black-white politics of sex, teen pregnancy, and poverty. Since 19th century miscegenation laws were first enacted, black sexuality has terrified public policymakers as alternately being both inferior and effectively destructive to the country.Identifying many connotations within the term \`epidemic' Pillow concedes that American teen pregnancy rates will not substantially decline until we begin having honest talks. Our country needs to talk how current policies are/have been fundamentally race-gender-socioeconomic constructed and then we can adopt a more inclusive approach to sexuality education."},{"Title":"Unfit Subjects: Education Policy and the Teen Mother, 1972-2002","review":"Here's a subject that has been topical and controversial in the US for decades. How should the public education system accomodate pregnant teenagers? Many politicians lament the high rates of teen pregnancy. But what to do once she is pregnant and does not want an abortion?Pillow offers a thoughtful discourse on various aspects. Non American readers will note the constant reference to US Federal policies, like Title 9, which requires schools not to discriminate against these women. Pillow discusses the interplay of racial and ethnic factors. Especially the persistently high rate of unwed black pregnancy. What sort of counselling should be offered is also reviewed. Like, what to say regarding possible career paths, or the related topic about the availability of affordable childcare.She provides no simple answers. Possibly there are none."},{"Title":"Unfit Subjects: Education Policy and the Teen Mother, 1972-2002","review":"The book investigates the many facets of teen pregnancy, beginning with a social history of the problem. After introducing the teen mother of the 1930's as the \\"girl next door\\" who was wronged and needs to be supported throughout her pregnancy and motherhood, Pillow introduces the racial and class implications of teen motherhood and how that affects how society views the teen. After discussing who the teen mother is, she dives into the issue of how she should be educated, and explains Title IX in depth. Title IX was legislation that laid out what a teen mother is entitled to for her education. It states the following:1. Teen mothers may not be expelled from school.2. Attendance at separate schooling sites must be voluntary.3. Policies affecting teen mothers' access to school must be nondiscriminatory and teen mothers' education should be comparable to that of their peers.For much of the remainder of the book, Pillow investigates each clause of Title IX and how it is (and isn't) implemented in schools. She looks at many different programs which grew out of Title IX (including GRADS and LEAP) and how they support the teen mother. To conclude the book, the author points out the many questions surrounding teen pregnancy and education that have yet to be answered. She points out that most policies and programs tailored to teen mothers were not created by educationists, but rather by politicians who have separate agendas. She calls for educationists to rise to the challenge of trying to solve the difficult problem of how the teen mother should continue her schooling after she gives birth, and what expectations will be placed on her.Wanda Pillow's analysis of the social and education predicament that is teen pregnancy is very thorough. She identifies many themes in the application of Title IX that help the reader understand how different schools approach the legislation. When analyzing how pregnant teens are treated in school, she points out discourses of pregnancy as a cold and pregnancy as a disability or disease. By categorizing the student in one of these two ways, the student either stays in their current school with little or no additional support, or they are transferred to another location where special services are provided, but where the education is presumably not \\"comparable\\". By identifying these two treatments of teen mothers, Pillow is able to analyze the pros and cons of each, and conclude that the best treatment of the teen mother is somewhere in the middle.Pillow also identifies discourses that hinder schools from providing the teen mother with what she needs, and what she is legally entitled to. She explains clearly that discourses of contamination motivate schools to send pregnant/mothering teens to other locations because they do not want her to contaminate the other students with her bad morals. Discourses of education as a responsibility is another theme that Pillow identifies as being detrimental to the treatment of pregnant teens in school. In this theme, it is seen as the teen mother's responsibility to continue her education, not for the benefit of herself or her child, but for the benefit of society. Society benefits from her education because they will not be burdened with taxes to support this mother when she lives on welfare. While this discourse emphasizes that the teen should stay in school, it identifies her as having different education needs from the other students, and is more likely to push her into a school-to-work or GED program.By identifying themes in the different aspects of Title IX implementation, Pillow offers a unique view of teen pregnancy and how it is handled in schools. While the book is very adept at pointing out the flaws and successes in Title IX and the programs that followed, Pillow does not follow through on how to correct the flaws in the education of pregnant teens. In many ways these are questions that have no definite answers. Many of the problems that she points out with the way pregnant/mothering teen education is handled deal with deep-rooted attitudes and assumptions on the part of educators and administrators. Much of how a pregnant teen is seen by these people depends on the student's race and social class, and this dictates how the student's pregnancy affects her schooling. Issues of race and social class prejudice not only affect pregnant teens, but all students in general, and these are problems that may need to be dealt with outside the realm of educational policy for pregnant teens.However, other questions that are posed in the book are simply never answered by Pillow. She begins the book by introducing the questions of \\"what the problem of teen pregnancy is, who it is a problem for, and how government should intervene and on whose behalf.\\" While she discusses these issues throughout the book, she never comes to a concrete conclusion. She ends the book with still more questions:So what does education opportunity look like for a teen mother? Or rather what is equitable education for pregnant/mothering students? Are programs that are integrated with the school at large more equitable or do pregnant teens need a separate school experience geared to their needs in order to have access to equitable education?One reason for these questions is that, as Pillow states many times throughout the book, education on pregnant teens is hard to come by. One would like to look at school data on pregnant teens of different races and social classes, different regions, and see how they progressed, whether they graduated, etc, after becoming pregnant. However, while many schools have data on how many of their students were pregnant or mothering, they often do not connect that data with their demographics or graduation rates. This makes it difficult to conduct concrete research on how teen pregnancy was handled in specific schools. In the conclusion of the book, Pillow suggests many avenues where future research should be explored, but she does very little research herself.Unfit Subjects: Education Policy and the Teen Mother is a very informative book when it comes to the social history of teen pregnancy and legislative policies such as Title IX that are associated with it. The book is very thorough in both concrete information provided and in Pillow's personal opinions about the benefits and pitfalls of the different policies and programs for pregnant teens. Though her opinions are valuable and backed up by themes that she has observed in different schools and programs, most of her work is not backed up by concrete research. This flaw in the book is indicative of the flaw in the subject as a whole. There are many different policies and procedures surrounding pregnant/mothering teens and how they should be handled in school during and after their pregnancy, but these policies were not written by educators, nor were they backed up by research. Overall the biggest problem illuminated by Pillow is the lack of research on this topic. Thorough research in the future would not only make Pillow and her book better informed, but could be revolutionary for education policy for pregnant teens in the United States."},{"Title":"The door with seven locks,","review":"one of my all time favourate books. when I first read this (more than 15 years ago), it was easily one of the scariest books, esp before the finds them :)"},{"Title":"The door with seven locks,","review":"Edgar Wallace's stories are all good to read.

Broom and Dozier have created a magnificent book that focuses specifically on how scientific research can be applied to public relations practices. Using Research in Public Relations establishes the field as an applied behavioral science by providing for readers the latest scientific methods to survey public opinion, conduct formal and informal research, analyze relationships between variables, and many other public relations tasks. Furthermore, the appendices complement the chapters by providing for readers tips and applications of chapter concepts to real-life situations. And Broom and Dozier certainly did not forget to say a word or two about the all-important ethics in public relations research. One fact I must admit, however, is that much of the information contained within this book is a little difficult to comprehend at first glance, especially for those who claimed a communications or public relations major as a way to avoid math classes. Many of the terms in this book can also be found in a statistics book.

Mankell does a good job of placing the characters in a clearly drawn milieu that does recall the Sjowall/Wahloo Martin Beck mysteries of the 1960s and 1970s.To me, however, the book just seems too violent and vivid to be a really good police procedural. The serial killings at the center of the plot are barbaric and complicated; they remind me of the movie &quot;Seven&quot; in their stagy nature.Those incongruities aside, I found the book to be an intelligent and absorbing thriller.

However, after a few chapters I bogged down in the pacing of this novel. It seemed to take Wallander forever even to get the case, and let alone solve it. I was caught by the detail of life so different from mine and yet frustrated by the pacing of the book and lack of focus. Occasional beautiful writing kept me going in spite of these mixed emotions.I also found the writer indulged himself with \\"telling\\" rather than \\"showing\\" especially regarding Wallander's plodding and disorganized solving of the crime. His thoughts were baldly stated. Being a crime writer myself I kept saying aloud, \\"for God's sake, man\\" and \\"hurry it up\\" as Wallander's car broke down yet again and several pages were wasted in the barren and unpronounceable landscape of a Swedish winter.That said, I finished it. And that's huge for me with my own writing and two jobs. I am left hoping Wallander gets his dog and absentee girlfriend, and a vacation. Oh and some PTSD counseling would be nice."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"Just to get you an idea, halfway through the book Wallander and the rest of the police are still plodding along, having made no connections between any of their clues.The phrases below, and variations of it, comes up in intervals all throughout the first half. And even the latter half.\\"Something was bothering him, but he didn't quite know what\\"\\"He felt he should have noticed something, but it escaped him.\\"\\"They had absolutely nothing.\\"A first half a book filled with the above, plus tedious details of a directionless investigation, a red herring that leads nowhere, and I'm seriously wondering why this book has 4 stars. Why????A lot of the police work involves \\"hunches\\" and odd stereotypes, like the fact that men and women pack different. Really? Sexist much? I'm surprised this crime squad has ever been able to solve any crimes ever.There is no one gripping in this story, not even the lead. His characterization is poor. And there are really a lot of baffling details in this book. Wallander worries about the cost of repairs to his car, and frets about affording another car. But he is calm and enthusiastic about buying a home. Can someone from Sweden explain this to me? Is it much harder to buy a car than a new home in Sweden?This is the second Amazon Kindle deal I've purchased and that's it for me. I won't be buying anymore recommendations from Amazon without added research and recommendation from friends. Just a poor, disappointing, plodding book.(One good thing? The atmosphere. It is good.)"},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"I am not embarrassed at liking a story to move along at a reasonable pace. OK, now that that's out of the way, let me ask: Are you KIDDING? 5 STARS? There are wonderful story ideas here, but none of them are the plot of the book!Take the mystery of the main character (Detective Wallander) tailing his own father in the dead of night, to a church staircase in Rome where he stays for an hour. The reader is captivated. Wallander is intrigued but the father dies a week later, and all the pondering a lot of pondering) Wallander does will not answer \\"why?. (Why was it even in the book?)Then there is the wonderful story that could developed, of a group of four nuns being killed in Africa, but one Swedish woman, not a nun, is also killed. Only that death is covered up, and for some reason (not a very interesting one) her death unleashes murders in Sweden. Unfortunately there is no intriguing reason, and we never know the 5th woman as anything other than the mother of a serial killer.Oh, but wait, there is an even better story to tell: A man dies a violent and unexplained death at his isolated home. There, Wallander finds a hidden safe which contains a human head and the diary of a ruthless mercenary from the 1960's! Great idea! But NO: it has nothing to do with the main story! Mankell should have just said, \\"Never mind...\\" before taking the reader in a different direction.How about the disappearance of a Polish woman who mysteriously moved to a small town in Sweden, and then suddenly left all her belongings in her deserted house over 20 years earlier? Could she be part of the 5th womans killing? Could she have known the mercenary? Nope, not the story; hardly even part of the story. Never mind.If you read this, please do me a favor. Please count how many times Wallander stopped to wonder something, or couldn't quite put his finger on what he was thinking, or just had to stop and think. I was half way through the 654 pages when I realized that he was going to keep this up: full paragraph after wasted paragraph, stopping to think and having thoughts escape him. So please, someone, satisfy my curiosity and count them. Oh, and if you are up to it, how many times did he describe to the other detectives the same thing he had just explained to the reader by way of his experience? Does Wallander think his readers are so dumb that they won't understand the story if it is not repeated?Combine this with what the previous writer said about the weather, and you get the drift. It rained, there was mud, and then it got cold. Then it rained, and it got cold, and Wallander wondered about the rain or wondered about the cold and again \\"wondered how he could keep this up.\\" Then it rained...Those who gave this book 5 Stars, did you find a condensed version? Possibly some think that a long and tedious book must be good literature. It is not. I did like the unhurried style, but unhurried and repetitive dwelling on trivia are two different things. Take all the undeveloped good story lines and mix them with the all the repetition and you've got a terrible book by a fair author who is in great need of a good editor."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"Excellent exciting thriller, good development of characters and kept me wanting more. Would highly recommend. Excellent development of plot. Looking forward to reading next book."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"The Fifth Woman has both virtues and flaws, so I end up giving it an \\"average\\" rating. The major problem, for me, is the dreadful translation. More about that later. First I want to point out that the negative comments posted by a reviewer called \\"Revue Fan\\" tend to be misleading or simply inaccurate.1) Revue Fan says, \\"There are ...a number of conversations like this: First detective, 'This is critical. We must learn this as soon as possible.' Second Detective, 'I agree. Let's have a meeting to discuss it on Monday after the weekend.' Revue Fan's implication here is that the delay until Monday is inexplicable. In fact, there aren't \\"many\\" such conversations like this one; this is a paraphrase of one specific conversation in which the second detective actually disagree with the first detective and doesn't even want to discuss the topic, so his postponing their discussion until Monday is reasonable. Add to that the fact that the second detective is actually the first detective's boss, and you'll realize his \\"I agree\\" is actually political. In short, this is a slow novel and the dialogue must often be read carefully.2) Revue Fan says, \\"When the second serial killer's victim is discovered, the detective declares that it is obviously the work of the same killer, although the manner, location, and style of the murder are completely different\\" (note that Revue Fan meant to say the serial killer's second victim, not the second serial killer's victim). In this case, the author actually explains in considerable detail why his detective regards the first and second killings to be the work of a lone killer. The primary reasons are (a) both killings are exceptionally horrific and (b) both occur within the same small town, where such occurrences are presumably rare (even if this book does constitute an entry in a series). For a detective to reach a similar conclusion in, say, London or New York City might be an absurdity, but the population of Ystad is under 20,000, so the detective's first guess is not so unreasonable.3) Revue Fan complains that \\"the detective 'knows' when people are lying.\\" In other words, the detective's methods are too intuitive. Actually, there's only one such occurrence in this novel that I can recall, and my inclination is to blame the lackluster translation for failing to convey some subtle nuance in this scene that might have let the reader know, too, that the character being interviewed was acting evasively.4) Revue Fan complains because a detective is summoned to a discussion in person, rather than being more expediently given information via a cell phone. This is an extremely minor incident in the novel and is, at least in my estimation, excused by the complexity of the subsequent discussion.5) Revue Fan says, \\"Do the police take a sample of the blood on the floor? No.\\" Well, this complaint turns out to be valid. Granted, the detectives discuss this oversight as an error they made in this case, so it's not as if it represents their standard operating procedure. Even so, Revue Fan is right; the cops really blew it.And actually, the detectives in this novel seem routinely obtuse. Statements such as \\"he knew that it reminded him of something, but he couldn't think of what,\\" or \\"something about it disturbed him, but he wasn't sure why\\" occur in every chapter and seem (in almost every case) unnecessary to the reader's comprehension. Again, this may be a translation problem: perhaps in the original these build up a kind of tension. Also, we're frequently reminded there's a telephone message that our hero hasn't yet remembered to deliver. Again, this might add tension in the original Swedish, but in this translation I have to agree with Revue Fan: the detectives too often seem merely bumbling along.A few more words about this dour translation, since, again,it's what really drags this book down for me to only three stars. I don't know what the translator's goal was, but I'd never describe this English prose as \\"graceful\\" or \\"unadorned\\"--it has scant grace, no rhythm, no imagination, and no charm. I don't find it moody or evocative, just dull and tedious. In fact I wasn't sure if I'd finish the book, as the first half moves so slowly--but it does pick up considerably, once you pass the Kindle's 50% mark, so you might as well stick with it.Throughout the book, I found myself wanting to edit the translator's prose, pausing after every other sentence to consider alternate phrasing. This definitely prevented me from becoming more engaged with the novel, and it also guarantees I'll never reread it. Verb tenses seem frequently out of joint--little things like a \\"were\\" instead of a \\"had been\\" are like sand in my shoes. In one scene, the translator seemed not to remember that \\"shook his head\\" means no, and \\"nodded his head\\" means yes. The word \\"macabre\\" is used eight times by this translator, which, since it's a very common word (and it certainly isn't an \\"unadorned\\" word, by the way) it really sticks out when it's repeated and repeated. It's even used once in a casual dialogue--and when's the last time you heard somebody say \\"macabre\\" in a non-academic setting? Can't we have a synonym or two? What's wrong with \\"unsettling\\" or \\"chilling\\" now and then?Finally, I refuse to buy the psychology of the perpetrator, and therefore I don't buy the plot as a whole. And so it goes."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"This book had me from the first page. It is wonderful and I couldn't put it down.

I'll miss both now that Wallander is gone."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"It's my first Henning Mankell read and I thought it was great. Loved its unpredictability. I'm looking forward to reading his other books."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"I first read this 1997 novel (the sixth in Henning Mankell's Inspector Wallander series) in 2004, and saw the television adaptation starring Kenneth Branagh last year. So the general outline was familiar; I even knew who the murderer was going to be. All the same, I read the book this time with just as much enjoyment as on the first occasion, and with even more appreciation of detail of its texture. Unlike most detective novels, this one is less about the eventual solution than the process of getting there. The review from the Rocky Mountain News quoted on the back of my edition has it exactly right: \\"a police procedural in which the main procedure is thought.\\"The first full chapter ends with both a murder and (unusually) a glimpse of the murderer. An elderly man, coming out at night to listen to migrating birds, falls upon a group of sharpened bamboo stakes placed point-upwards in a pit; the person watching his agony from the shadows is a woman. Not that Inspector Wallander and his small team of detectives in Ystad, on the Southern coast of Sweden, realize this at first; the reader almost always knows a thing or two more than they do; the interest comes in seeing how they get there. More victims will follow; although different, the cases seem connected as different phrases in the same language that the murderer is using to communicate with the world. But this is no more than Wallander's feeling; translating that language, finding factual connections between the victims, deducing the murderer's motive, all this will be the work of many months.A few weeks ago, after reading PD James'THE PRIVATE PATIENT, I wrote a review entitled \\"TMI\\" (too much information). For almost 100 pages, James handled nothing but exposition, introducing almost the entire dramatis personae in separate chapters of great detail. Only then could the murder be committed and the work of detection begin. Mankell, by contrast, has almost no exposition at all. He plunges the reader immediately into the daily work of the Ystad police force, investigating an apparently minor crime, a break-in at a flower shop, that will turn out to have greater significance later. Mankell's great strength is his grip of texture; he reveals information in bits and pieces, as would happen in life. You meet the officers in the station as a group who are doing a job; any personal details you might discover about them come up almost accidentally, just as they might among colleagues in the workplace; the one exception is Wallander, whose family relationships do play a small part, but their effect is to emphasize the difficulty of balancing his personal and professional life. Although this is the sixth book in a series, there is none of those tedious side-bar summaries for those who missed the earlier novels, and the reader has no sense of being left out either. You never doubt that this is a real world, not something concocted for your entertainment.A less realistic crime novel might filter the information reaching the investigators so that everything is either a Clue or a Red Herring. Mankell does nothing of the sort; business at the Ystad station does not stop for the murders, and much information comes in that has little directly to do with them -- things such as the formation of a local vigilante group to make up for the perceived inefficiencies of the police. But vigilantism does turn out to be a running theme in this novel, and yet one more example of Mankell's underlying subject: the rapid decline of law and order in Sweden. He sees it as an age where it is easier to throw something away than take responsibility for it, an era \\"when people stopped darning their socks.\\"Mankell's novels have all tended to balance an inner focus on a small area of Sweden against an awareness of the outer world, especially Africa, where Mankell lives for part of each year. Even so hermetic a novel as the excellentITALIAN SHOES(not a Wallander story) has tentacles reaching into other continents. [InTHE MAN FROM BEIJING, one of his most recent, the balance in my opinion tipped too far towards the global scene, losing the meticulous sense of local life which is his anchor.] It would appear that this book also has an African connection; the prologue begins with a killing in the Sahara: four nuns and a fifth woman, a Swedish tourist, whose death has been suppressed by the local authorities. The back cover suggests that the fate of this Fifth Woman will be integral to the solution of the case, but the connection is merely catalytic. The true meaning of the title will appear as other women appear in the Swedish shadows, and the half-seen world has deadly impact on the real one."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"I find these so much more interesting that the few American mysteries I have read. I know I'm probably reading the wrong things. It's just that they all emphasize cocky, smart mouthed, brutal people who are the - investigators.

Well if you want to get back with the detectives that are out there wearing out shoe leather you might try this novel. Throughout the book people meet their deaths in some pretty strange ways, but the cops in the lower part of Sweden are right on it. They put in long hours taking time out to grab a pizza, hamburger or hot dog (yes, the author says Swedish police officers eat that stuff). So what happens? Does throwing half the department onto the case mean rapid progress toward capturing the killer? Well as the last line of Chapter 20 on page 214 says, \\"They had nothing to go on. Absolutely nothing.\\" I mean come on, the CSI guys solve these things in 1 hour using all the advanced technology. These cops do use cell phones, and have computers although we are never told what they use them for. Finally on page 277 they begin to have a slight glimmer of what they are looking for.This is a good, fun book. We watch the detectives scurry all over Sweden chasing down leads. The clues are few indeed. So busy are our investigators that none of them even have time for any of the romances found in most police novels, although when Inspector Wallander's father dies he does take the morning off to attend the funeral.This is an easy to read, well written novel for those of us who enjoy taking a break from the pseudo-scientific crime programs now inundating television."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"Kurt Wallander and his team have to solve a series of extremely cruel murders: an old man is found killed on a pole in the canal behind his house, another man first goes missing for several weeks before he is found famished and strangled in the woods and a third man is tied up and thrown into the water alive where he drowns. There does not seem to be any logical connection between the men. And they all have some shady sides to their lives. And meanwhile Wallander's old father dies and the weather is rainy and bleak. In short, a very grim background for a great book full of doubts. On page 250 the investigation is still no further than it was in the beginning, but that did not disturb me in the least.

Ostensibly the book purports to be a hard boiled police procedural, but it is so filled with logical errors and oddities that I couldn't help but wonder if the writer weren't being satiric. A few examples. No spoilers.There is a break in at a flower shop. Nothing is stolen, but there is a pool of blood on the floor. The shop's owner is missing, believed to be on safari in Africa. Do the police confirm that he joined the tour as planned? No. Do the police take a sample of the blood on the floor? No. When the second serial killer's victim is discovered, the detective declares that it is obviously the work of the same killer, although the manner, location, and style of the murder are completely different. Similarly, the detective \\"knows\\" when people are lying. Instead of a procedural, the technique of the detective seems to rely on wild speculation. There are also a number of conversations like this: First detective, \\"This is critical. We must learn this as soon as possible.\\" Second Detective, \\"I agree. Let's have a meeting to discuss it on Monday after the weekend.\\" The detective often calls policemen on their cell phones and demands that they come to the office immediately because he has something important to tell them. Why can't he tell them the essential information using the cell phone that he is holding in his hand? The main detective is always telling others to get him train tickets or make hotel reservations for him even though he is standing right next to his office phone. Swedish culture?In the end of I was half convinced that it was send up, a satire of police procedurals. If so, it was too subtle for me. The sentence level writing and descriptions of place are well done. But all in all a very strange book and logical flaws ruined the enjoyment of it as a mystery."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT:What makes Mankell's books so compelling is a combination of dense plotting, acute characterization, satisfying resolution. There are no rushed conclusions, no loose ends. In addition, these \\"Swedish noir\\" police procedurals address matters more weighty than immediately apparent. This one in particular raises the question of whether or not a woman is capable of carrying out atrocious acts, for what ever reason. The reader is made aware almost immediately that the killer is female. Mankell holds the question of the \\"why\\" until last, feeding information so adroitly that the suspense is as compelling as if it were being released at a more conventional pace.Apt comparisons have been made to Per Wahloo and Maj Sjowall. The decision by that husband/wife team to only write 10 books has baffled their fans ever since the appearance of the last in their series, more than 30 years ago. In this book in particular, there is internalizing on the part of not only Inspector Wallendar, but also the serial killer and to some degree the victims. It's frustrating to know that there are so many of his works that have not been translated into English."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"Fans of the Maj Sjowall/ Per Wahloo Martin Beck series will be right at home here in Henning Mankell's modern-day Sweden. We're on familiar turf as a tray of home-made rusks is offered to detective Kurt Wallander. (What are they, anyway?) &quot;The Fifth Woman&quot; is a taut, suspenseful, hard-to-put-down detective novel that combines all the best of the Sjowall/Wahloo series with an updated look at Sweden in the '90s. (Perhaps not so different from that Sweden of the '60s and '70s.) And if it's possible, readers of previous Mankells in the series will be glad to know that Mankell gets better with each novel."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"If you love mystery books, then you should grab this one.

Good summer reading."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"This was another great book in the Kurt Wallendar series by Henning Mankel. It kept me guessing. I look forward to the next in the series."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"Again and again Henning Mankell gives us a masterpiece. His terrific novels are not for the thrill-seekers and people with short attention span. His plots unrevel slowly and sometimes painstakingly, as I would imagine real investigations do.There are blind alleys and insecurities, and detectives are tired and occassionaly cranky. He is not only an exceptional mystery writer, but his astute assessment of our troubled times have accuracy of so-called serious novelists. Mr. Mankell manages the improbable, he excites and depresses us in the same time. Quite a feat for a mere scribbler of crime books."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"I generally very much enjoy the Wallander Mysteries, but must admit that this one left me cold. While a certain degree of Nordic stoicism is expected, the chilly atmosphere conjured up in this novel made reading a bit of a slog, despite a murder placed here and there throughout.Fans of the Wallander stories should read it because even a bad Wallander is OK and nobody wants to skip the chronological order of these novels. However, those who've never read any of this series are recommended not to start with this one."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"Master writer but even the title seemed a bit obscure. I gobbled up every word but at the end there was something missing. Was that something sex, violence, voice, the tone? I'm almost 63 and am sometimes forgetful but there was a certain forgettable quality to this book. I would call it well writen, creative, interesting yet there was a missing POWer. Once as a juror, I listened at the end of a trial as the prosecuter explained that he can't give every detail or evidence proved like in a drama. It was something like that with Fifth. The main character is smart enough, certainly &#34;real&#34; enough but I just didn't seem to care enough. It was sad when he loses someone close to him but I didn't get teary and neither did the m.c. in my opinion. Of course he was preoccupied with a serial killer but...I seem to be rambling so I'm going to stop but the biggest mystery to me was why the clever characters and plot just didn't really get to me."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"I'm a fan of Henning Mankell. I think The Dogs of Riga is a great crime novel. The Fifth Woman carries on the Wallender tradition but unlike The Dogs which is tight and fast paced, The Fifth Woman is long winded. It's a 100 pages too long. As much as Skane needs Wallender, Mankell needs a better editor to cut the fat."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"Swedish writer Mankell's graceful, unadorned prose provides an affecting voice for his melancholy protagonist, Ystad police detective Kurt Wallander, whose own mid-life difficulties give way to the pursuit of a cunning serial killer.As the book opens, a woman receives information that her mother has been murdered along with four nuns in an African convent, the crime hushed up. Then an old man who writes bird poetry is impaled on sharpened bamboo stakes embedded in a ditch on his property while the woman watches from his bird tower.Wallander, just home from a pleasant trip to Italy with his father, a rejuvenation of their taciturn relationship, investigates a break-in at a flower shop from which nothing was taken, receives reports of a growing vigilante militia movement and eventually discovers the body of the bird poet. Meanwhile the reader learns that the flower shop proprietor is a captive, slowly starving. He is missing more than a week - supposedly on an orchid-buying trip - before anyone realizes.The grisly narrative builds slowly, in plain, unhurried cadences. The fits, starts and frustrations of police procedure mingle with Wallander's concerns for his father and plans for a future with his lover, Baiba - all against a thrum of background tension - the bound, terrified man, the woman ticking off plans on a meticulous schedule, selecting her next victim.As the murder count rises, Wallander and his team delve into the background of the victims, uncovering dark secrets, making tenuous connections, inching toward a solution that horrifies them all. Mankell's (&quot;Fearless Killers,&quot; &quot;Sidetracked&quot;) plot organization and pacing is masterful and his perplexing, atmospheric story is all the more gripping delivered in measured, understated prose."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"I picked up &quot;The Fifth Woman&quot; by Henning Mankell because a reviewer favorably compared it to the classic &quot;The Laughing Policeman&quot; by Maj Sjowall &amp; Per Wahloo (Swedish wife/husband writing team). It doesn't disappoint. This is a book that is worth the price of a hardcover -- meaty, substantive, intricately/well plotted, with great characters.The three things I noticed that bind all three authors in their works are: 1) the Swedish people's dislike and distrust of the police, 2) the chill and loneliness that seems to pervade human relationships, and 3) police inspectors who are brilliant, meticulous, conscientious, introspective and given to depression. These Swedish police procedurals are not a barrel of laughs, but rather they are thoughtful, well written, and original.&quot;The Fifth Woman&quot; starts out with the murders in Africa of 4 nuns and a female visitor. The rest of the novel takes place with these murders' ramifications in Sweden where a serial killer is dispatching men, each very differently. The title refers not only to the 5th woman murdered in Africa, but also the 5th woman in Sweden who leads police inspector, Kurt Wallander, to the Swedish serial murderer.American police procedurals tend to reveal more murder motives from the get-go. In this novel the motive is a core plot element and isn't revealed until later in the book. The reader also knows a few things about the killer early in the book that the police don't know and it is fascinating to watch the police reach the &quot;same place in the book&quot; as the reader. I was reading a well regarded American mystery writer and stopped the book to read &quot;The Fifth Woman&quot;. When I returned to the American book after finishing Mankell's opus, it was sophmoric in comparison. This is a book for the serious mystery reader and well worth the effort."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"Ystad, Sweden is not a place where one would expect a homicide wave. Yet three brutal murders have shook up the citizens and stunned the police. Inspector Kurt Wallander sees no link between the vicious killings except that they were all well planned in advance and fierce and slow in terms of the victim.Wallander and his staff begin looking for an apparent serial killer. However, to the shock of the Inspector, evidence points towards a female culprit. While the law enforcement officials struggle to switch paradigms, the killer becomes angrier, more hateful, bolder and deadlier. Even Wallander wonders if the killer can truly be a genius and a lunatic at the same time?THE FIFTH WOMAN is the fourth Wallander tale to come to the States and like its predecessors is a fine police investigative novel. The story line slowly evolves as the audience spends much time inside the minds of Wallander and his foe. This turns the who-done-it into more of a psychological thriller than a typical serial killer investigation normally is. Not for anyone who wants fast-paced in your face action, Henning Mankell provides those readers who enjoy a more gradual speed with a wonderful police procedural.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"This is the sixth book in the Wallander series, and probably the last I'll read for quite a while. The series started out promisingly enough with Faceless Killers, an interesting police procedural plot introducing the reader to the ever-forlorn Wallander and his southern Swedish district. However, subsequent books have strayed into over-the-top thriller areas, including plotlines involving a 14-year-old serial killer (Sidetracked) and the attempted assassination of Nelson Mandela (The White Lioness)! This book returns to the procedural format, although at 450 pages perhaps overdoes it a bit.Rather oddly, the story begins with the death of a woman in North Africa (presumably Algeria), which apparently gives her daughter the psychic release needed to embark on a series of killings from a list of names. The first of these involves a retired car dealer who falls into a punji-stake trap. Wallander, who has just come back from vacationing with his father in Italy, is once again drawn into an elaborate serial killer's plot. This time, there's very little to go on and as the investigative team attempts to dig into the background of the retired man, it takes a very long time for Wallander to get any traction on the case. Eventually a connection is made with the disappearance of a local florist and his body's subsequent discovery. Still, the pace is excruciatingly slow, even more so than others in the series. When a third body shows up, the motive for the killings is finally deduced, but there's still plenty of work to do in order to piece together the common element that will identify the murderer. As Wallander winnows down the massive amount of forensic, historical, and psychological data, he must also contend with the appearance of citizen vigilante groups and the sudden death of his father, not to mention his own ambivalence about his relationship with long-distance lover Baiba.Eventually, Wallander's trademark methodical analysis and a little inspiration guide him to the right answer. But by then the reader is pretty exhausted by the whole thing. True, it's realistic to show the massive amount of footwork that it takes to follow up every lead until it dead ends, but since the reader is given access to the killer all the way through, it doesn't make for great tension. It also rings somewhat false that Wallander and the other police are constantly moaning about how brutal the killings are. These are the same police who were dealing with a serial killer scalper a year or two previously, and in Faceless Killers the inciting crime is the brutal bludgeoning murder of an elderly couple! Similarly, for most of the book Wallander completely rules out the notion that a woman could be the killer. This seems like a rather unlikely blind spot, considering that they've just dealt with a serial killer who is barely more than a child in \\"Sidetracked\\". As in the other books in the series, Wallander ruminates on the rise of crime in Sweden, and contemplates quitting the police force. All in all, the book is dreary and plodding, and the insights into Swedish society are similar to those given in previous books in the series. Time for something new."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"Kurt Wallander is both the main character and setting of Mankell's 'procedural' crime series. While based in southern Sweden, &quot;The Fifth Woman&quot; is in fact grounded in the rugged landscape of Wallander's interior life - his memories, hopes, shopping lists, prejudices and anxieties. Not since Lawrence Block's Matt Scudder have I read such an angst-ridden and ethically driven protagonist. This is the ultimate introverted hero - he solves crimes using weapons of solitude, intuition, memory-interrogation and a phenonomenal eye for detail. How could you not love a policeman who reminds himself in the midst of the chase to book the laundry room, alert his superiors to a colleague's excessive workload or take time to grieve for his father. Mankell also provides a vivid account of the broader issues that confronted Swedish society in the 1990s - refugees, law and order, social capital and shifting moral foundations. Wallander characterises the times as an age where people have forgotten how to darn their socks, preferring to discard a blemish rather than repair a resource. And the storyline of &quot;The Fifth Woman&quot;? Like Laurie King's &quot;Night Work&quot;, &quot;The Fifth Woman&quot; explores issues of violence, revenge and enforcing justice when the system cannot deliver. It is, like Mankell's other Wallander titles, a monumental chronicle of detail, connection and the unfolding of a tightly-bound investigation. The Swedish atmospherics will also help take one's mind off an endless summer."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"Chief Inspector Kurt Wallender is moody by nature, but as The Fifth Woman opens, he's feeling pretty positive. Kurt's elderly father has always wanted to see Rome, and Kurt agreed to accompany him. Father and son enjoyed the vacation, as well as each other's company, and Kurt comes home ready to return to work. Sadly, another serial killer case will soon rear its ugly head, destroying Kurt's newfound peace of mind. When his dad suddenly dies, Kurt's chronic depression returns with a vengeance. He throws himself into the new case, but clues and leads are hard to come by.The Fifth Woman is perhaps Mankell's best written work to date, and that's saying something. This is an engrossing case, especially because it soon becomes apparent that, uncharacteristically, a woman is involved in the horrific murders, each of which is unique in style. Picture a pit with stakes in it, and a large oven, and you get the idea. Wallender and his team work painstakingly, day and night, to \\"decode the language\\", to decipher the motive behind the staging of each death. The investigative process is thoroughly described, and seemingly unrelated details begin to merge, ever so slowly, into a coherent picture. Along the way, readers catch glimpses of Swedish life, which, to the chagrin of its citizens, has become increasingly violent. Among the complications facing the police is the rise of civilian vigilante groups, whose actions simply blur that picture. Wallender seriously ponders the question of how much longer he can endure the nature of his work.This is a police procedural, but, IMO, it's too literary, too fluent and deep, to be forced into a genre. Credit is due to Mankell, for sure, for his creation, but also to Steven Murray, for his masterful, seamless translation."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"yet there is method in 't.\\"Hamlet: Act II, Scene 2.Four nuns have been found brutally murdered in a convent in an unnamed North African country. A fifth woman has also been murdered. Although news of the murders is suppressed and the fifth woman is never publicly identified a policewoman with a conscience forwards letters found in her possession to her daughter in Sweden. Soon thereafter a series of seemingly unconnected and brutal murders grip the small, Southern-Swedish city of Ystad. The murders are well planned and executed. They seem designed to inflict as much pain as possible. Detective Inspect Kurt Wallander is tasked with identifying the killer or killers and the motive behind the killing. If Wallander cannot discover a motive he must at least learn enough about the killer's method to stop him or her before more people lay dead in strange surrounding. That is the plot of Henning Mankell's \\"The Fifth Woman\\".\\"The Fifth Woman\\" is the sixth book in Mankell's Kurt Wallander series. This series is often compared to the Martin Beck detective mysteries authored by the husband and wife team of Per Wahloo and Maj Sjowall. Wallander, like Beck, is a police detective in Sweden. Unlike Beck, whose beat was Stockholm, Wallander works in the small southern-Swedish city of Ystad. The Wallander series takes place in the 1990s while the Beck series took place in the 1960s and 1970s. Although I tend to prefer the Beck series, the Wallander books are entertaining page-turners. Mankell stays well within the \`police procedural' formula and has not tried to reinvent the genre. However, he has done a good job, through the first books in the series, of developing the character of Mankell and his supporting cast of characters. Wallander is no Sherlock Holmes and gets results more by perspiration than inspiration. He is also a fully drawn character. We see him dealing with the break-up of a marriage, an estranged daughter, and a father who is developing senile dementia. The supporting characters, particularly his fellow detectives, are also well drawn.As the plot in \\"The Fifth Woman\\" plays itself out Mankell does a good job of showing the grunt work that goes into a murder investigation. Mankell also does a good job portraying the relationship of Wallander with his fellow police officers and with his family, especially his aged and failing father. Wallander is shown as a flawed man, a man with a temper and someone who can be more than a bit stubborn. However, I found myself drawn to the character as much for his flaws as for his detective skills.The Fifth Woman is, in my opinion, one of the better books in the Wallander series and I have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone interested in a good police story, especially one set in a location outside the United States. Recommended. L. Fleisig"},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"With all the hoopla about the Stieg Larsson triology I became interested in other Swedish crime novelists. One of the best is Henning Mankell. His novels about the detective Kurt Wallender who lives and works for the small police department of Ystad in southern Sweden are excellent police procedurals and character studies of fascinating people set against the background of a cold and forbidding landscape. It is as if Phillip Marlowe left the sun splattered streets of Los Angeles to join Ingmar Bergman on a film shoot in Sweden! (Mankell is a son of law of the late Swedish film director).The Fifth Woman opens in Africa. Four nuns and a Swedish woman are brutally murdered by assailants who break into a convent. Who is she and how is she connected to brutal murders back in Sweden?The first murder victim is Holger Eriksson. He is impaled on bamboo poles located in a ditch near his isolated home. Eriksson is a bird watcher who is single and aloof. He is a retired car dealer who was quite wealthy.The second person murdered is Gosta Runfelt. He is found strangled to death with his body bound by ropes in a Swedish forest. Runfelt is the owner of a flower shop whose passion is orchids. He is killed while making plans for a trip to Kenya to see orchids.The third victim is a man named Blomberg. He is tied up in a bag and tossed to a grisly death under an ice packed lake.What is the link between the murder victims? Is a single killer responsible for the crimes? Is the murderer a man or a woman? It is answers to these queries that Wallender must answer to solve the horrible crimes.Wallender and his team at police headquarters have a difficult task in connecting this crimes which have been well planned and executed by a diabolical serial killer. Disturbing secrets are revealed in the course of the narrative about the three men who were so brutally murdered.Kurt Wallender is in late middle age. He is divorced from Mona and has a grown daughter named Linda who is a student is Stockholm. He has a lover named Baiba who lives in Latvia whom he met during the novel \\"The Dogs of Riga.\\"He often longs for Baiba to marry him so he can settle down with a labrador puppy and retire from police work.He is an introspective and often morose person who is well drawn by Mankell. His artist father dies shortly after accompanying Wallender on a sightseeing trip to Rome.This is an excellent novel for those who enjoy gripping crime stories which are well written."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"Though a literary omnivore, mystery novels are a territory that I've explored very little, and I happily defer to the many excellent Amazon reviews written by expert mystery-philes regarding how well The Fifth Woman measures up in its genre. For veteran mystery readers, be forewarned: my knowledge of your reading preference is so minimal that I had to look up the phrase \\"police procedural\\" (and yes, The Fifth Woman fits that definition).The plot has been well-described by previous reviews: three brutal murders, diverse and apparently unconnected \\"dots\\" of data, a determined team of police officers laboring to fit the pieces together. The novel resembles a video of an egg dropped from significant height, run in reverse slow motion: the yolk and the pieces of shell slowly and beautifully reform themselves until a perfectly formed egg stands before you.I like any book, regardless of genre, that stimulates my imagination and expands my horizons, and The Fifth Woman did both. Author Henning Mankell is a complex man, dividing his life between two continents (Eurasia and Africa), giving generously to charities, and deeply involved in political ideology from his youth forward. The complexity of the author is richly reflected in the characters in The Fifth Woman. No simple whodunit, the warp and weft of the fascinatingly woven plot of this book brings the social fabric of life in Sweden into vivid focus. Mankell doesn't simply illustrate that violent crime occurs in Sweden; his characters want to know WHY violent crime is rising. Why is law enforcement chronically underfunded, and what are the social and personal consequences of this? What leads to the formation of \\"citizen militias\\", and what are the accompanying dangers? Why do Swedes appear to have a universal disregard for the police? Who knew that Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity would probably have a significant following amongst a minority, but vocal, part of the Swedish population? How does a human balance the demands of one's job versus one's personal needs, and one's family and romantic relationships?Mankell draws characters in 3D, or even 4D, as his characters do change over time. His law enforcement veterans are still shocked and sickened by violence, rather than affecting the hard-boiled \\"I've seen it all\\" attitude often seen in crime-related fictional media in the U.S. Men and women working side by side develop deep friendships WITHOUT falling into bed with each other. Characters use the bizarre circumstances that befall them to grasp for a sort of wisdom, rather than use them as a cave opening that allows a descent into bitter cynicism. The Fifth Woman is peopled by humans that are neither saints nor demons, only humans that make choices, some more admirable than others. The perpetrator of the crimes in The Fifth Woman has complex motivations, and Mankell has truly written a why-dunit, rather than a whodunit.Mankell's writing is not characterized by breathtaking turns of phrase or startling imagery. His prose is blunt and to the point, and devoid of flowery language (despite the fact that one of the victims is fanatically interested in orchids). It gets the point across, and keeps the plot in motion. I'll be back for more, of both detective Kurt Wallander, and Mankell.If Swedish crime novels suit your fancy, consider recently publishedBox 21: A Novel. Grimmer, more brutal, and just as concerned with social issues as Mankell's The Fifth Woman, it is an eye-widening exposure to a Swedish culture that extends far beyond tall blonds and fine furniture."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"Henning Mankell really nails you to your reading chair from page one with his subtle and quiet horror stories where there is a minimum of the graphical violence you so often see in American thrillers these days. Mankell has an ingenius way of building up his stories which will keep you mystified till the end. He is also weaving into the fabric a honest description of Sweden on the social level and of how police work is developing in the Scandinavian countries. You get to like this Wallander and his Swedish colleagues so much that you are sad when the last page is turned."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"Art is an imitation of life, or something of the sort. But art needs to concentrate life, to direct and intensify our attention. That this Wallender novel surely does not do. The author is intelligent enough to know the risk he is taking: to make us endure the dead ends, the non-sequiturs, the repetitious emotional and professional mistakes in fictional police work that also dog our daily lives. So, as one reader accurately noted, we have gotten almost nowhere by page 250...what the reader does not note is that we have almost 100 pages to go...much of it the same plodding. No wonder the Inspector is depressed. Mr. Mankell and a young editor need to talk.That said, as readers have noted, larger issues of the direction of society, the mortality that perhaps faces policemen more often than the rest of us, etc. make the trip less tedeious. Still, the Dogs of Riga, weighing in at somewhat less than half the length of 5th Woman (and in bigger print) is perhaps as much of a reader's short life as she should give to this cloudy city."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"I stumbled across this after I was enthralled with the brilliant The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, so I thought I'd give another Swedish mystery/thriller a try. I wanted to like it, the set up is intriguing. But it is just too dull. After about halfway through I just couldn't pick it up anymore. the author writes everything so matter-of-factly that all drama or tension is filtered out completely. Also the book is far too long. I'll just read something else while biding my time until Girl Who Played With Fire comes out."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"I will not purchase any more books by this author.

The plot was interesting and could have been a great book if written better."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"The story had a slow start, it was hard to follow the author's train of thought; I kept reading for a while longer but it didn't improve. Needless to say, it went into the discard box!"},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"Was I reading the same book as those who described this mystery as a 'gripping thriller'? There was nothing gripping or thrilling about this book. I did not think the character of Kurt Wallander was developed at all and so I did not feel I understood him or liked him. But in fairness this is the first Kurt Wallander mystery I have read and so perhaps his character was developed earlier in the series. However, it was an effort to finish this 400+ page book. No surprises at all in the end, in fact I kept saying to myself 'why don't the detectives figure that out?'. I did not like the style of writing and found it very choppy. I was fed up hearing about the rain, it was raining, it was going to rain, would it rain. I am amazed at all the five star reviews."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"Having read many dozens of mystery/suspense novels, this has to be the worst of all of them. Obviously translated (from Swedish) is terribly choppy and excruciatingly long but more than that, Wallender is a dim, slow, sad police detective whose lack of cognitive skills allowed the serial killer time for more murders. His character is ill formed and unbelievable. Only the Epilogue cleared up multiple questions which any decent writer would have included in the prose. Why this series of books has been recommended is beyond my husband and I, who read it together."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"Detective Kurt Wallander is professionally cautious and thoughtful (dull), personally abrupt, a bit on the insensitive side. Wallander struggles to accept his father's death, and wonders if he can build a new life for himself, maybe remarry, maybe buy a house and a dog. He philosophizes a bit about the apparent rise of violent crime in Sweden. It crosses his mind more than once to give up police work.This is probably more realistic than many detective stories, because there's no Sherlockian detection going on-- just a roomful of cops going over a collection of facts they've gone over more than once already. They're tired. They haven't had any sleep. You really feel their fatigue. And it takes the cops forever to notice clues, long after Mankell has revealed them to the reader. I wanted to scream, &quot;Open the drawer!!! Would you look in the freakin' desk drawer!!!&quot; and the like."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"Disappointing read. Detective Wallander is the epitome of doom and gloom throughout, a rather pathetic main character, who doesn't seem able to get his life together. The plot is slow-moving, and the ending a foregone conclusion. No twists or surprises there."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"Absolutely satisfying. No rush in the telling.

As always, his protagonist is a flawed local detective who doggedly unravels a series of strange and seemingly disconnected crimes."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"Henning Mankell has again written a fine mystery that is engrossing and compelling. Kurt Wallander is again revealed as a real human character and a dogged investigator. This is one of those books that you won't want to put down."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"Wallender is on the trail of a serial killer again. This time the killer is a physically strong and a very intelligent protagonist. Three men are killed in horrofic ways and part of the mystery is not only how the victims are related, but why they are killed. Each victim has a dark history, which Wallender's team methodically unearths. Another subplot is Wallender's father dies. Wallender has to cope with the grief while he is working overtime.The mystery is good and the writing is well done. The atmosphere is gloomy because it is Sweden in a rainy fall. The plot drags slightly in the middle, but once again Mankell delivers an outstanding mystery."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"THE FIFTH WOMAN is a police procedural. What does a woman murdered with four nuns in Africa have to do with two missing men in Sweden and two inexplicable break-ins where nothing is stolen?As Wallander and his team of detectives strive to piece the puzzle together and discover diabolical murder, they constantly take two steps back for each step forward. But that's the nature of the beast. Every piece--whether it is of any help or not--must be examined, kept or discarded, to build the final picture. That's the way police work happens. Even with today's technology, someone has to do the legwork and slog through the muck and mire. The crimes are solved--and others prevented--because these workaday heroes put in the time and effort.Mankell exalts in providing the reader with the dark dreary frustrations workaday cops deal with every day set against the stark yet beautiful Swedish countryside.Which brings me to mind of another group of workaday heroes: the police procedurals of Dell Shannon and the LAPD Homicide team led by Lt. Luis Mendoza. I think that both of these series--Mankell's and Shannon's--will keep my TBR stack growing."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"I have read a number of these Kurt Wallander novels now. First introduced to me by a clerk at a book store in 700 Shops on Michigan Ave in Chicago. Since then I have read several. They are all terrific novels. Set in Sweden, translated to English, these detective stories offer a different feel than what we read from American authors of detective mysteries. Not necessarily better as a whole, but certainly different and refreshing. I believe these stories take a deeper look at the entire detective's life which adds tremendously to suspending the disbelief it takes to be engrossed in a story. The Fifth Woman is a great one.Det. Wallander is human, makes human mistakes, suffers from human malladies, and struggles with some of the things he experiences. But, he also has a knack for solving crimes and mysteries, and understands, sometimes reluctantly his responsibility in doing so. He does not do this magically, rather he accomplishes this through solid police work by the entire team of the detectives working for and around him.If you are looking for gratuitous steamy sex scenes, you will not find them in these novels. (Looking back, I don't think there are any sexual episodes in these stories.) What you will find is a great story that will keep you turning the pages and scratching your head.

I live in the Northeast, and in our bleak midwinter here, I sometimes enjoy reading a smart police procedural set in an even darker and colder locale. Mankell is a smart existential writer; I enjoyed this as much as the best P.D. James novels. It was necessary to read with full attention but the reward was significant. After finishing this novel, I ordered two of Mankell's other Wallander mysteries. For those of you who love quality procedurals with highly developed and sympathetic protagonists, this is a natural. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"With Kurt Wallander swedish author Henning Mankell has created one of these sympathetic if low-key protagonists that become very dear to the readers' heart as the single story and ultimately the different mysteries continue. He reminds me in many ways of his Israeli counterpart Miachael Ohayon, created by the great mystery writer Batya Gur. But of course Sweden is very different from Israel and the small town of Ystad is no Jerusalem. When two gruesome murders happen in the small community, Kurt Wallander is immediately torn out of reminiscences from his recent Italy vacation with his father and has to immerse himself in a strange and very dark reality. At the same time the reader follows the steps of the killer and sees a complex personality and story build as a race against time heats up for the Ystad police. The novel is well-written, atmospherically dense, intense and keeps a good pace all the way to the well-developed conclusion. Mankell has no loose ends remaining at the end of this story, yet the reader is sad to say farewell to Kurt once more."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"Inspector Kurt Wallender of the Ystad police spends a lot of time walking back and forth in parking lots, sitting alone in his car with the engine off, sitting on park benches and then changing to a different bench, sitting at his desk and staring at the wall. He's always thinking about whatever case is plaguing him at the moment, often several at once. This time, he's leading the investigative team trying to sort out a series of brutal, almost sadistic murders which don't seem to be related (although he knows they must be), while at the same time having to deal with a rise in citizen vigilantism which even affects the family of one of his detectives. But sometimes Wallender thinks too much for his own good as a cop. Investigating a murder at a lake, \\"he looked at the men working on the pier. At the ambulance, the police cars, the crime-scene tape. Everything about it suddenly gave him a feeling of enormous unreality. He encountered nature surrounded by plastic tape stretched out to protect crime sites. Everywhere he went there were dead people.\\" He's also trying to figure out the recent sudden death of his aged father, as well as his potential relationship with Baiba, the Latvian woman from an earlier book in the series. He knows he has trouble with the human relationships in his life. No wonder he tends to the melancholy. This continues to be a generally excellent series of procedurals populated by humane (but still human) cops trying to do their jobs and courting exhaustion in the process. It took a couple of volumes, but Mankell has certainly found his pace."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"There's no such thing as a bad, or even mediocre, Wallander book but this probably rates as one of the best. I'm pretty certain that all fans of this series are going to read them all regardless of what we reviewers have to say' which is the proper approach to take. This book also reinforces the need to read the books in order; while the crimes can stand alone the details of Wallander's personal life evolve from book to book and part of the charm of this series is that we come to care for him as a person. In this one his relationship with his father comes to the fore, and his love life seems to be evolving in a good way; he's thinking of buying a house and dog for heavens sake. In summation- newbies should start at the beginning. For everyone else this is merely another chapter in the life of Kurt Wallander."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"The characters almost come to life as it is written.

Mankell's deft character development, particularly of the lugubrious, ever-ailing, almost fatally-focused Wallander keep you rooting for the good guys.

At times I wondered if Ireally cared about the characters - it seemed as if there was not a lot happening in the so called mysteryand not a lot happening in Wallender's life - it would have helped if Mankell had keptWallender worried about his lady love and if we heard more from his daughter. Itseemed occasionally we would hear about them but they weren't important enoughto Wallender - and I know he was thinking about the investigation - but suspenseis crucial I think in mysteries and I didn't think the suspense was well sustained.Frankly, this was too long for what happens in the plot and the characters' lives; Mankellseems to have padded out his book to sell it for more $$."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"It seems to me that the stories move faster as newer ones are published.

Have read many of the Kurt Wallander Mysteries. What I like about this series of books is that the suspense is well built and you have no idea of who the protaganist is. Many mysteries that I read I know who and usually why the murder/crime is commited. While I still enjoy mysteries it is much more fun and interesting if I can't figure out the ending half way through the book, and I usually can't with books written by Henning Mankell. Excellent author. Excellent translations."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"Henning Mankell once again demonstrates his masterful creativity in his police procedural thriller \\"The Fifth Woman\\". What makes Mankell's work so special is his ability to humanize his protagonist Kurt Wallendar, police detective inspector of the Ystad police department. Wallendar, the senior inspector has personal issues that Mankell delves into, that have a profound effect on his actions. While conducting an investigation into a series of bizarre murders, Wallendar's father dies. He is also struggling emotionallly with a long distance relationship with his girlfriend Baiba who resides in Latvia.The novel commences with the murder of a wealthy, aged and retired auto salesman, Holger Eriksson, in very strange fashion. The gentleman, an avid ornithologist, while walking across a footbridge on his property was impaled on a series of sharpened bamboo poles as the sawed through planks of the bridge collapsed under his weight. The poles had been set in the fashion of a tiger trap in the ditch beneath the bridge. Wallendar soon becomes aware that Eriksson has a history of abusing women.We also get an insight into the motivation of the nameless killer of Eriksson. She apparently was incited by a letter she received against regulations from Africa. Her mother who was traveling got caught up in religious and social upheaval there and was murdered along with four nuns, effectively becoming the fifth woman. A sympathetic investigator aware of the cover up of the murders released the personal effects of the mother.Soon the killer commits another murder of a florist who it turns out was also abusive and possibly killed his wife. Wallendar with scant clues to go on leads the investigation in a methodical, analytical manner which slowly uncovers the answers to solving this series of crimes. Unfortunately more murders are committed and because of the violence citizens begin to form militias which hamper the investigation.Mankell has proven to be a very capable author and deserves a higher level of notoriety than he currently receives. His novels are gripping with a large dose of believability. He represents a noteworthy benchmark in his genre"},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"A book about Wallander great as always. Changing point of action many times, surprising events. For sure I\`m going to read the other books from series."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"Not your ordinary, formulaic police procedural. (There's been a murder! Who did it? Maybe this guy? NO, it's definitely this guy! OMG, NO! It was actually THIS guy! What a surprise!)The author really shows the laborious detail and grinding research that goes into a complex murder investigation. There are so many wrong turns, incorrect assumptions, and dead ends that sometimes I, along with the detectives, was utterly lost and confused, but gradually the truth is excavated, layer by layer. If it sounds boring, I assure you it was not.I will read more in this series, perhaps my favorite so far of the Scandinavian mysteries I have read."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"First Mankell book I read was \\"A Troubled Man\\" and enjoyed it enormously. The Fifth woman places Kurt Wallander in an earlier time in his life as a Detective. The narrative is reminescient of of a PBS mystery such as Prime Suspect. Wallander is a male version of Hellen Miren as the Inspector. Although graphic in detail of violence the real story is one of the compelling need to understand the unthinkable and solve the mystery. Like many other mystery readers, I devoured the trillogy from Stieg Larsson and needed more Swedish storytelling. Mankell is better than Larsson and needs to be discovered by American myster readers."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"I recently read the Steig Larrsen \\"Girl\\" series and was sad when they were over. Stumbled across this book on a special and find it to be almost as good. I love when books are set in other cultures, yet you can find things about the characters to relate to. I will likely check out the other \\"Kurt Wallender\\" books."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"\\"The Fifth Woman\\" is another in author Henning Mankill's superb series of police procedurals starring his melancholy Swedish detective Kurt Wallander. This novel, like the others in the series, is set in and around the Southern Swedish city of Ystad, and is as much about the characters and their social environment as about the crime itself.In a brief prologue, the reader learns of the murder of a woman's mother while traveling in Africa, and its coverup by local police. This awful event is somehow the trigger which will unleash a terrible violence, the nature of which the reader is only briefly left to guess at.The story properly begins with the brutal murder, by a pit full of pungi stakes, of an aging birdwatcher and poet. Detective Kurt Wallander, just returned from a once-in-a-lifetime trip to Rome with his aging father, is assigned the case. The perpetrator has left few clues. Wallander and his crew have little to work with until they painfully begin to make connections with other seemingly unrelated events: a break-in at a florist shop, a woman who went missing from a northern Swedish village years earlier, a mysterious visitor to a maternity ward in Ystad, and a railroad timetable. At the end of the investigative road is an alarming killer whom the police could not have foreseen.\\"The Fifth Woman\\" features Mankill's astonishingly meticulous plotting and superb characters, not least Wallander himself, a dedicated, intuitive cop who suffers through a family tragedy while on the case. \\"The Fifth Woman\\" is very highly recommended to fans of Henning Mankill's Wallander Mysteries."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"This is another in author Mankell's police procedurals featuring Swedish inspector Kurt Wallander. Here a man has died horribly by impalement on sharpened bamboo stakes placed under a sabotaged footbridge on his own property. He may have hung on the stakes for hours before dying. Wallander and his team confront clues seeming to point to mercenaries involved in the wars in Africa, but the clues lead nowhere. Soon they are confronted by a second and equally brutal and bizarre killing, probably by the same person. Then a third. Another serial killer? The team comes under intense pressure and works round the clock as public concern grows, even to the point of sparking vigilante groups. The story comes to an action finish, followed by a curious epilogue.Mankell is superb at capturing all aspects of the intense effort that a team expends trying to solve a major crime quickly. He captures not just the fatiguing pace of the effort but the team's fluctuations in energy and morale and the intense interpersonal dynamics among team members. Mankell describes the grueling pursuit of even the smallest details by the hard-pressed cops, although they know from experience that most of the leads will be useless. He also captures how the cops on the team have to juggle their private lives to meet the demands of the investigation, adding to the pressure and to the realistic depth of the characters. Mankell's grasp of police procedures and the way teams work is impeccable.On the other hand, the book is quite long and the narrative drags in spots, often because of Wallander's seemingly unending angst. I wanted to tell him just to snap out of it. Just one example: The repeated dithering about whether to buy a house and a dog and, if so, in what order added little to the story or the character. The plot is a bit unlikely, but it is well worked and is therefore not a drawback. The book is enjoyable and exciting despite its flaws."},{"Title":"The Fifth Woman","review":"As a diehard mystery fan for many decades, I've found myself getting more particular about the structure and plot of the mysteries I read. Lately, I've wondered if I've become TOO critical. But then \\"The Fifth Woman\\" comes along and makes me realize there are some near perfect books out there. The novel is riveting, from beginning to end. What makes it especially noteworthy are the shifts in perspective, which are used to maximum effectiveness. The author gives the reader just a touch of information from the killer's perspective, then switches back to the detectives, who are baffled by a seemingly random set of clues. As a reader, you're shouting out \\"No, don't you see what's going on? Do a blood test!\\" But of course the characters don't hear you and have to work things out through the duration of the book. So much fun (if you like being on the edge of your seat)."},{"Title":"Managing an Integrated Languages Arts Classroom (Grades K-3)","review":"Linda Picciotto has done a wonderful job explaining her program and ideas for managing a classroom in a holistic fashion.

I would strongly recommend this book to beginning teachers and veteran teachers. This book answered some of those questions that I had about how to organize a classroom as a beginning teacher. She gives countless tips to first year teachers in the afterword section. Her words of wisdom have tryly inspired me to implement some of her strategies into my own future classroom. The samples of students' work and responses makes her strategies workable and believable so that is why I would highly recommend this book to all teachers. Good Luck with teaching!"},{"Title":"Finder","review":"(3.5 stars) Picking up three months after the events in KEEPER, Rucka combines another fast-paced plot with some welcome fleshing out of his main protagonist, Atticus Kodiak. Kodiak has issues and I still think he's implausibly young for what he does but this time that actually plays into the story somewhat as his relative inexperience - not to mention his immaturity in dealing with relationships - is highlighted when he comes up against the SAS, in what is basically an extremely over-the-top custody battle.Like Lawrence Block's Matthew Scudder series, Rucka earns a suspension of disbelief because he's so good at developing his characters. If there's one flaw, it's the same problem KEEPER had, with New York City feeling a little too sterile. The names and places are all correct but there's a certain something missing, that something that Block does so well in making the City a living, breathing character as opposed to simply a backdrop.All in all, another strong, if flawed, outing and I look forward to reading the next installment in the series."},{"Title":"Finder","review":"Well crafted mystery that keeps you guessing to the end. Greg Rucka is off to a good start"},{"Title":"Finder","review":"I must agree with the reader from Carpinteria, CA. I would not want these people protecting me. Why would a professional team take a job when the principal's father won't give them any info about the nature of the danger? Since one set of killers already know where he lives, why move Erika there? The list of implausibilities goes on and on."},{"Title":"Finder","review":"I have just started this book, but read Keeper just before this. I agree with several of the reviewers. It's unbeliveable anyone just 28 has had the experiences and adventures of Kodiak. The thing that bothers me most is his indiscriminate love life. He seems to sleep with whomever is handy. And how much older was Erika's mom during their \\"romance\\" since he was 24 and Erika was 11. Sounds like Diana was robbing the cradle, but Atticus was more than willing. I too couldn't understand Atticus enlisting the help of all his friends in a protection scheme when no one knew what was going on other than they would be pitted against some of the world's best trained killers. And what was a British team doing there in the first place? Was the retired colonel that important? It doesn't sound from the other reviewers that I will get many answers. I hope there aren't too many 15 yr olds like Erika in this world. If I am naive I'll stay that way thank you."},{"Title":"Finder","review":"The book itself is alright, if you dont mind the author's bland, verbose, and tedious writing. But be prepared for a big letdown because the ending of the book is one of the worst I've ever read. I wish someone had warned me, so I'm warning others. I like the characters, but the book doesnt flow fast at all and it really fizzles in the end with no climax, and it was a big dissappointment."},{"Title":"Finder","review":"Reading these two novels was like watching two lousy chess games by a low IQ player cursing all the time with dirty words and tough talks. Very bad scenarios with stupid and unprofessional characters in pretentious and inplaucible plots. Rucka should change his main character's occupation since he was not capable in the protection business at all, and talking tough with lot of &quot;fucks&quot; or &quot;fuckings&quot; won't help these characters a bit. The stupidity of these pathetic roles sometimes even caused anger and frustration during reading. Making two SAS teams hiring by a divorced US couple was even ridiculous, and the development of the sequel and its ending were neither believable nor logical. Almost all of the characters in these two books were either stupid or unprofessional. Rucka should improve himself first to write his specified profession stories. Very disappointed and hated to be fooled by the blind praises"},{"Title":"Finder","review":"Rucka does certain things masterfully. His dialogue crackles with realism and intensity; his characters breathe down your back, they're so alive; and the emotions he conveys are rich without being melodramatic. Atticus Kodiak, his protaganist, moves in a circle of foul-mouthed, partying friends, yet maintains a style all his own in the midst of the muck about him.Here, again, Atticus Kodiak is at work as a bodyguard, this time watching over the daughter of his former lover. Erika's all grown up now--or thinks she is--and isn't always hip to the idea of his guardianship. What's truly eating young Erika, though, is the power struggle between her despicable parents. She takes out her frustrations on those sent to protect her, but finds a friend in Kodiak's off-and-on romantic interest, Bridgett. With trained assassins opposing Kodiak's team, the odds seem stacked against him, but he manages to come through...not without some physical and emotional scars along the way.If you're a fan of G-rated mysteries (in the Mrs. Pollifax vein), steer clear of Kodiak. If you like your mysteries tough and gritty, with a bit of heart (think Dashiell Hammett after the sexual revolution), then give this series a shot."},{"Title":"Finder","review":"I thought this second adventure of Atticus was even better then the first. Although there are some implausible events, I felt it was an entertaining read with an air of tension. Atticus seems cut from the down on the luck hero rather then the invicible superman cloth that arises too often these days. If you can't see the movies one night and are in the mood for an action detective type flick definitely pick this up."},{"Title":"Finder","review":"So I'm about 1/2 way through Keeper (the previous novel) and I decided to order Finder since I'm enjoying the Kodiak character. Unfortunately the Amazon review of the book gives away the (an?) ending to Keeper in the first sentence. I guess it's expected but annoying nonetheless."},{"Title":"Finder","review":"Love his books. I read Keeper and Finder, and am ordering Smoker too.. Atticus Kodiak isn't the typical invincible hero, and doesn't always win. Once I start reading, I have a hard time stopping...

The end of the last book left Kodiak physically and emotionally battered, and this book opens with him working below his potential as a bouncer at a club catering to the New York S&amp;M scene. He is pulled out of his slump when he encounters the daughter of a colonel for whom he had provided security while at the Pentagon, Erica Wyatt. After this chance encounter, he is thrust into the role of her protector. Once he is forced into this role, his personal life, past and present, violently collides with his duty to protect his client and his need to find the truth behind the lies that everyone is telling. Rucka shows again that he has mastered two very important skills in the page-turning genre: he writes interesting, well-drawn, and complex characters, and he knows how to write a chapter, that when it ends, compels you to read the next one. Once &quot;Finder&quot; gets going, just as with &quot;Keeper,&quot; you won't want to get off until you get through the entire wild ride. I dropped everything to mentally sprint through the last 60 pages alongside the hero.

Atticus becomes caught up in amaelstrom of slush funds, rogue agents, and multiple deceptions as he seeks to protect his youngcharge from becoming killed, or perhaps even worse.......Greg Rucka's breezy style of writing makes for a fast-paced, exciting story line filled with fullydeveloped three dimensional characters that readers will easily care about, especially Atticus.The audience's involvement with the characters turns FINDER into a wonderful readingexperience that is easy to start, but impossible to put down until it is finished. The mainprotagonist is a complex anti-hero, who is still learning about himself and his environment.

Harriet Klausner 5/18/97"},{"Title":"Finder","review":"Greg Rucka, who is best known as a contributor to several comic book series, once again flexes his literary muscles in the second installment of the Atticus Kodiak series. Although the plotting and events border on the improbable, this in part is what helps the book succeed. Like the old saying about life being what happens when you are making other plans, the consequences of the characters actions in this book do NOT always happen the way the reader anticipates them. This adds a touch of reality to this book, that combined with Rucka's tight verbal prose make this an interesting and exciting read, and leave me looking forward to reading more. If you want your formulistic action thriller then you will probably not like this book. However if you want your characters to be fallible and human and struggle to their victories and enjoy lean and well crafted prose- then don't miss FINDER."},{"Title":"Finder","review":"While I feel that his action pacing needs some work,the very human dimension to Kodiak's character is refreshing. The story was not written as a handbook for VIP protection and this shows, however, as a story with a security specialist as the protagonist it works well. Mr. Rucka's writing style took some time to get used to but I found myself caring about Atticus Kodiak. The stress on quasi &quot;realistic&quot; action is okay but some cinematic stuff would be entertaining as well.This is especially so in a novel that does take dramatic license with the close protection field. Mr. Rucka has definitely created a cast of characters that I want to read about again as it is their personal journey that is the true heart of the stories."},{"Title":"Finder","review":"In Finder, as in Keeper before it, Greg Rucka has given us something incredibly rare these days; a story that is rife with the consequences of human actions. Finally a story that is nota &quot;comedy&quot; in the strict sense of the word; order is not restored at the end of Finder...a resolution indeed occurs, yet it is an outcome basedon the actions of the characters. Many authors and screen-playwrights today seem to beafraid to let their heroes suffer for choices made, not Rucka. This not only makes for a refreshing and welcome change, but also a realistic story with deep three dimensional characters that get into your head and take up residence. This is one of the gutsiest books out today and you would all do yourself a favor by snatching it up."},{"Title":"Finder","review":"(MAY CONTAIN A SPOILER.)I purchased this book and Mr. Rucka's previous Atticus Kodiak novel \\"Keeper\\" largely due to the reviews here on Amazon. Unfortunately, the reliability of Amazon as a source was less, in this case, than has previously been my experience.It's not that this is a terrible book, but it certainly isn't great, or even very good. The dialogue is frequently perfunctory, and often unbelievable. Most of the characters are shallowly drawn, and many of the minor players are actually more developed than the central cast. Too often the only reason for a character's very existence seems to be as a device to move the plot forward, instead of having the plot grow from the actions and motivations of the characters.Also, there were significant technical errors, especially with regard to police procedures and firearms. While I realize that most authors do not have extensive real-world experience in law enforcement, military service, or high-risk private military contract work, I do feel that they have a responsibility to their readers to either exclude technical detail, or else get it right. In one scene a character, supposedly a highly-trained Israeli special operator, fires a high-velocity assault rifle on a downtown New York street, but tells Kodiak that there is no risk to bystanders, since he loads his own ammunition and uses such low powder charges that the bullets will not injure anyone past a hundred yards. I won't bore you with all the technical detail, but take my word as a veteran of both the military and law enforcement, that simply isn't possible.There were also certain inaccuracies relating to the SAS that seem to indicate the author merely skimmed some general source about the Regiment, and has no real knowledge of their structure, training, or methods. One minor example of this is his repeated and pointed use of the phrase \\"brick\\" to refer to a four-man team. Having done some liaison and exchange program time with member of the 22nd SAS, I can say categorically that I have never heard them refer to a four-man component as anything other than a \\"patrol\\", within the higher structures of Troops and Squadrons. (The term \\"brick\\" is used by the British Army to refer to a four man tactical element, but this was a development of the Army's Northern Ireland Training Team (NITAT) and the brick concept was used for improved flexibility by every regiment which operated in Ulster. While the 22nd SAS did participate in NITAT, they retained their own terminology.)I cannot categorically state that members of the 21st SAS or 23rd SAS may not use the word \\"brick\\", as I have no operational or personal experience with either unit, but my understanding is that these units function more as training and development commands, and occasionally in support of various British intelligence and security agencies, and would not therefore be involved in such activities as Mr. Rucka imagines. I also have to say that in one scene, and this is a key plot point, an SAS entry team is outwitted, and outmaneuvered , by a much older man who is dying from AIDS and is barely able to draw enough breath to speak, yet can outrun SAS troopers.So while I understand that many readers might feel, as some reviewers point out, that Mr. Rucka explores a world of close-protection specialists that few authors have examined, I'm afraid that his books are simply too slapdash to be on any lasting interest."},{"Title":"Cannibals and Christians","review":"This is a collection of Mailer's work from 1960-66 and includes political articles, book reviews, a couple of stories, a few interviews, and some of the worst poetry ever written. Most readers either liked or hated Mailer, but whatever side of the fence you came down on it was impossible not to realize, even appreciate, the seriousness of his intent. Probably a quarter of the book is in some way concerned with Lyndon Johnson, and although he is highly critical, especially concerning events in Vietnam, he is also respectful and deeply reflective. Mailer also writes about the Kennedys, NYC politics, architecture, and a number of writers, including James Baldwin, Mary McCarthy, and Philip Roth among others. Of the interviews (one of which appears to be made up by Mailer), the best is the Paris Review one, where he is at his most speculative and ruminative. The stories, one a SF experiment, are forgettable, and the poetry, which is sprinkled throughout the book, is embarrassingly bad. The non-fiction Mailer represented here shows the author in full stride."},{"Title":"Cannibals and Christians","review":"...and the kind of writer that one either loves or hates.

Over the past dozen years, her elegant, understated novels have won enthusiastic reviews and a small but appreciative audience, which has sufficed to keep them tenaciously in print. When &quot;The Blue Flower&quot; won the National Book Critics Circle Award last year, however, Fitzgerald suddenly became a popular success. Heartened by this, Houghton Mifflin has been reissuing several of her earlier novels (in paperback only, unfortunately), and &quot;Human Voices,&quot; originally published in 1980, now appears in this country for the first time.Set in the summer of 1940, when England was undergoing daily bombardment and German invasion seemed imminent, the novel focuses on the BBC's Broadcasting House, which produced the Home News six times a day even as bombs fell over London. While civilians cope with adversity through self-denial and recycling (&quot;The nation defended itself by counting large numbers of small things into separate containers&quot;), the workers at BH deal with anxiety, depression, and worry over loved ones as they fulfill their schedule of news and features.This sounds like a recipe for a conventional novel about British determination and pluck, but Fitzgerald is in fact doing something more interesting. She notes that Broadcasting House followed a policy of offering truth rather than propaganda -- &quot;Without prompting, the BBC had decided that truth was more important than consolation, and, in the long run, would be more effective&quot; -- but then adds: &quot;Truth ensures trust, but not victory, or even happiness.&quot; The major theme of Fitzgerald's fiction, the inadvisability of trying to avoid hurtful truths, can be glimpsed in these two sentences.This sounds pretty earnest, but &quot;Human Voices&quot; is in fact a deft and very funny novel, astute and sharply observed -- even rather consoling. The beleaguered BBC, operating like &quot;a cross between a civil service, a powerful moral force, and an amateur theatrical company that wasn't too sure where next week's money was coming from,&quot; converts its concert-hall into a dormitory for the day when London is invaded and employees seal themselves into the building. As things turn out, the most action the space sees happens the evening when a young assistant crawls into a dark cubicle and goes into labor.The cast revolves around two middle-aged and unhappy men: Sam Brooks, the Director of Recorded Programmes, and Jeff Haggard, the Director of Programme Planning. (As though to convey the institution's sometimes irritating fussiness, the author usually refers to them simply as RPD and DPP.) With the assistance of a staff of surprisingly understanding teenaged assistants (one of them, finding a letter from her boyfriend largely blacked-out by the censor, thinks: &quot;What a job having to go through other people's personal letters . . . they must feel uncomfortable, you had to pity them&quot;), they stoically confront the various crises that beset the Corporation, such as a French general who has just escaped his collapsing country, and whose request to broadcast an urgent message for the British people the BBC unwisely grants.Although much of the novel deals with the technical problems involved in recording &quot;human voices,&quot; the title is an obvious allusion to Eliot's Prufrock, whom both RPD and DPP resemble. One of them is finally wakened by Eliot's &quot;human voices,&quot; but does not (like Prufrock) drown; the other's case is more equivocal.At times Fitzgerald shows a slightly unsure hand, and readers of her later novels (especially &quot;The Gate of Angels,&quot; which shares some features with her present novel) will see where she has elsewhere handled matters a bit more adroitly. This is the only real criticism one can make of the novel, and it is hard to fault a writer for having improved with time. Compact and concise, &quot;Human Voices&quot; is a small gem, and should please new readers almost as much those already familiar with her work."},{"Title":"Human Voices","review":"GIST: Staffers at British Broadcasting try to cope with each other in wartime conditions. HAMMOCK-TIME: Again, a delightfully slim book by Ms. Fitzgerald, concise and absorbing. Requires perhaps one lazy weekend in your hammock or beach chair to finish. SKIMMING QUOTIENT: Her characterizations and subtle humor are so delightful, there's no need or desire for most readers to skim through any part. STYLE: Some parts are sluggish, but generally the story is fast-paced, and humorous. SUBSTANCE: I really appreciate this author. Ms. Fitzgerald focuses on adult themes with sophistication, without tedious explicit sexual passages; and profanity is practically non-existent. It's difficult to find comparable American authors who display similar tendencies and skills. QUIBBLES: The occasional interjection of British jargon and references to British locales or history was jarring to me, a foreign reader, but in general, the storyline is easy to understand. COMPLEMENTARY BOOKS: I enjoy all her books, and you might, too. This book above has turned out to be my favorite, although another Fitzgerald work, The Bookshop, is a close second. # # #"},{"Title":"Human Voices","review":"I found _Human Voices_ harder to &quot;get into&quot; than the other four Fitzgerald novels I've read. And it seemed to have more stock characters. However, it ends more convincingly (less abruptly) than some of her other novels. Having survived wading through the acronyms, I came away feeling that there is more substance in this novel than there seemed to be while I was reading it. Almost by the way, it provides a compelling portrait of life in London early in the war and insight into how the English held on as they expected a Nazi invasion during 1940. Fitzgerald has a great gift for making human foibles simultaneously funny and touching."},{"Title":"Human Voices","review":"Of course, the same can be said for several other novels by the sublime one, but I've been waiting a long time for a U.S. edition of Fitzgerald's take on the British Broadcasting Corporation during the Blitz. Each time I go to England, I buy a few copies, since I know friends will interpret any loan as a gift. And Human Voices is exactly that--packed with an ensemble of singular BBC employees, from the Director of Recorded Programs, whose department is known as &quot;the Seraglio&quot; (owing to his penchant for young female assistants) to the French General Pinard, who--instead of boosting national morale on air--urges all England to surrender: &quot;When the Germans arrive, and at best it will be in a few weeks, don't think of resistance, don't think of history. Nothing is so ungrateful as history. Think of yourselves, your homes and gardens...&quot; Luckily RPD had a feeling that Pinard would fink out and failed to record the &quot;appeal&quot;! Like all Fitzgerald's novels, Human Voices will make you want to rush back to the first page the minute you finish it. Bracing, mirth-making, and ever-provocative."},{"Title":"Human Voices","review":"Ms. Fitzgerald actually did work for the BBC during WWII, and while there was at least one annoying trait, I found the book to be her wittiest I have read. My complaint has to do with the use of acronyms; if you worked at the BBC this will not be an issue. But when used liberally, in a compact novel that defines how she writes, there is little time to learn them. \\"CJ get me AJ the SECDEF, RJ the SECTRES, ASAP, for a get together at MOJ, PDQ...OK? The PPA, and 2 JPA'S, should attend as well.\\" Usually this sort of banter is reserved for a Tom Clancy Novel.The book ended with a great bang like many of her works, but this time we are not left wondering if the book we are holding is a few pages short. There still is more to unfold for some central characters, but this time the reader decides whether or not to pursue a continuance.The TRUTH is the mission the BBC is on. To broadcast this and nothing else, not even speeches by The King that have been mended to delete his stutter. However in one of the funniest passages of the book, a French General feels compelled to share the \\"truth\\" with England and the English he so loves. Fortunately for both country and citizens alike, and to the amusement of the PM, he had the plugs pulled upon him.Since Ms. Fitzgerald did work at the BBC, it offers an additional avenue for thought. Simply stated, how much is true, how many of these people actually lived, and how much was pure fiction. It is a tribute to her writing that the reader is unsure. By writing as she has, whether in a complimentary manner, or unflattering, I doubt some of the subjects would recognize themselves.Another novel, without repetition, that demonstrates the vast skill this woman commanded."},{"Title":"Human Voices","review":"If you love language, quirky and vividly drawn characters, delicious irony, and above all, if you want to spend some time with the creative work of someone possessing an exquisite gift for writing, read this book.But if to you, any good novel must have &quot;character development&quot; or a gripping plot, perhaps you should go elsewhere. (Hey, come to think of it, the character development in this novel is wonderful, especially given how short it is. Oh and the plot, though full of low human foibles and often trivial struggle does take place against the backdrop of the last century's supreme struggle between good and evil. And the funny folks depicted apparently bear some resemblance to those who were actually in charge of getting this story out to the world.While reading, I started to laugh whenever an official of any sort was introduced, because they were almost instantly reduced to an absurd abbreviated title (RPD, DPP, and the truly absurd ADDG). Friends, I believe this is a joke. At some point, these people's identities have been subsumed by their occupational roles. They are more RPD and DPP than they are &quot;Sam&quot; and &quot;Jeffrey&quot;.One measure of a book for me is how preoccupied by it was I (or not) in the days after I finished it. This one ran on and on in my head. for days and days. I can't wait to read more Fitzgerald."},{"Title":"Human Voices","review":"If you love language, quirky and vividly drawn characters, delicious irony, and above all, if you want to spend some time with the creative work of someone possessing an exquisite gift for writing, read this book.But if to you, any good novel must have &quot;character development&quot; or a gripping plot, perhaps you should go elsewhere.

Members were confused, disengaged, and bored. Most did not understand the understated, deadpan humor. However, I read the book twice; once I understood its point, I developed real affection for the quirky characters and chuckled a lot.Still I couldn't escape the feeling that the work is a mere sketch, rather slight, very underdeveloped dramatically. Because the characters were so sketchy, it was difficult at first to care about them. Fitzgerald is obviously very intelligent; she suggests a great deal, so the reader must infer and interpret and read between the lines. The reward for doing so is an understanding of the quirks of organizations--how they become obsessed with trivialities, gossip, power relations, etc-- and a feeling for the poignancy of the &quot;stiff upper lip&quot; stoicism of people who had everything to lose, and a pleasure of watching slightly eccentric individuals interact. The work is short but flavorful."},{"Title":"Human Voices","review":"This book was just pathetic. I did not care about the characters. They were one dimensional and revealed nothing. This book seemed like a rough draft, and ended abruptly killing off a character for no reason. Completely pointless. I would give it zero stars if I could."},{"Title":"Human Voices","review":"With all the rave reviews from reviewers I usually trust and having an affinity for most British novels, I went into this book with high expectations and was bored silly. With The Blue Flower, Fitzgerald fleshed out her characters, but the characters in this novel, some of whom are referred to only by their initials, remained virtually anonymous to me. The charm and satire that other reviewers have found in this were utterly lost on me. The novel doesn't have much of a focus and skitters from one character that you hope will become a focus to another, never really staying with any one of them long enough for you to care about what happens to them. I think the only reason I finished this one is that it is very short. Much longer and I would have thrown it aside and forgotten all about it."},{"Title":"Human Voices","review":"The only reason I forced myself to plow through this book to the end (after having started it for the second time), was because of the glowing reviews, and because I had bought it and didn't want to waste my money. With the exception of a few clever phrases, it lacks all of the qualities which make for a good novel: character development, continuity, tension, plot. The overuse of acronyms is disruptive, and the typeface is difficult to read. The best thing about this book is that it's blessedly short."},{"Title":"The Golden Hand","review":"I wonder if Michael Crichton used this as reference for his book Timeline?!

In this short little book, Henri Nouwen gives us a few clues that could lead us to joyous suffering.We are not meant to go at it alone. We are made for community. Our joys and sufferings ought to be experienced with others, not in isolation. We will never find a perfectly safe place on this side of heaven, but with others our love can grow. \\"When our love grows from God's love we no longer divide people into those who deserve it and those who don't.\\"Of the works of Nouwen I have read, this one was not a favorite.

I highly recommend this book to everyone - whether you're going through a time of mourning or helping a friend through a difficult time. This is a book that helps one recognize a deeper relationship with God - making Him known even in the most difficult times when you think He is nowhere near. Nouwen is on point when he says not to bury yourself in busy-ness. You don't learn anything from this time of mourning if you don't experience it. Don't dwell in it - but learn from it. I'm a Stephen Leader at my church and will be recommending it to all of our Stephen Ministers to help them in their caring relationships."},{"Title":"Turn My Mourning Into Dancing","review":"This is an amazing book. I found it to be very validating to my life experience. The best part is that it gives a beautiful and enlightening look at suffering and puts it in perspective in the larger picture. Living in a culture that doesn't like to acknowledge suffering (or that considers it to be 'I didn't get the color of BMW that I wanted') this helps one process his/her deeply felt grief. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Turn My Mourning Into Dancing","review":"This is a powerful book for anyone, but it is especially powerful for those of us who are suffering loss or see ourselves in difficult circumstances wondering if God really cares about us. I had been given this book several years ago by a family member, but had never read it. Recently, while my wife and I were doing some home library reshuffling, I came across it and read a few pages and was gripped by it's authenticity and clarity. The idea of inviting Jesus into my wounds and suffering so that He could heal me was especially liberating. And it became abundantly clear that God did, indeed, care about those of us who suffer loss when I gave away my copy of Nouwen's book to a friend who had suffered a recent loss through a miscarriage.Shortly thereafter, I ordered four copies from Amazon. One copy to finish reading the book for myself and three others to share. In just over a month, all of my copies are gone! And the response from friends and family who have received copies ofTurn My Mourning into Dancinghas been equally amazing. Through this book, you will see a framework for a biblical doctrine of suffering, you will see that suffering is not about judgement, but is about the Father's great love for us. Nouwen shares the secrets that were life-changing to him has he sojourned here on earth. Every page reveals another layer of God's methodical work of grace and mercy in our lives as He conforms us into the image of His Son Jesus.I have given to friends at funerals, at their homes, and sent it through the mail. So, my suggestion stands, read this book and give it away.

But I know that some people find English spelling really frightening. Unfortunately this is not a book for them.It is for people who master well enough the language and can make distinctions between various forms and spellings of English. Even those who think they are excellent at spelling, can still take a look at some of the exercises. You might find out that there are still words you don't know how to write them correctly.And for those of you who still have a long way to go to master the English language, get a good grammar book and don't worry too much: Virginia Woolf, Hemingway, Emily Dickinson had similar problems, just to name a few personalities."},{"Title":"Accomodating Brocolli in the Cemetary: Or Why Can't Anybody Spell","review":"This is a strange book and I'm not sure how well it travels outside the specific region for which it appears to have been written (southern England). There are some fascinating history lessons on English spelling but many of the more modern examples don't make sense outside of specific dialects. For example: our and awe aren't homophones where I live. They aren't even close! There are also some examples of \\"American\\" example which may been regionally correct but aren't nationally correct. Here are some examples: dialog, glamour, catalog. In my neck of the woods, they are spelled: glamor, catalogue, catalogue. Then there is the weird spelling of hiccup (hiccough in the book). I've NEVER seen it spelled hiccough and even found a couple examples from the BBC website of the hiccup spelling. In conclusion, I think this book would have been stronger if it had just stayed with one dialect and its history of spelling rules."},{"Title":"\\"I AM\\" Adorations and Affirmations; \\"I AM\\" Decrees (Saint Germain Series - Vol 5) (The Saint Germain series)","review":"Man, these decrees have really changed my whole existence, let me tell you.

I had to go on to say it &quot;isn't like that.&quot; This is a book that uses people's words about their experience as a clue into the complexity of human history. When historians relate &quot;what happened&quot;, they are furthering an establishment version of events. As this book shows, some of the events that people who lived through it recount as most important aren't recorded *anywhere*. Likewise, the accounts that are recorded as history are sometimes considered insignificant by the participants.Another aspect of this book that is interesting is its cross cultural perspective. The author is able to interpret oral texts in both English and Italian, and has done research in Kentucky and in Italy. His background also allows for literary interpretation, demonstrating that when transcribing oral history, care must be taken to accurately recount verb tenses and pronouns as a way of demonstrating whether a person is stating what happened, or how they interpret what happened, or how they have rationalized what happened to fit their current viewpoint."},{"Title":"The Puritans in America: A Narrative Anthology","review":"This is a great collection of primary sources such as speeches, sermons, etc. produced by the Puritan leadership during crucial moments in their society's development.

The reader gets to sample the works of writers like Alice Walker, Joyce Carol Oates, and Ursula LeGuin writing about subjects as varied as abortion and dance parties. The common thread in this anthology is that each piece speaks so directly and deeply to our lives as American women.In her introduction, Wendy Martin stresses that she has attempted to give voice to the \\"female experience in all its complexity\\" by including women of African, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, and Jewish descent, as well as those of European ancestry. She hopes the stories speak \\"to what has been silenced, repressed, and excluded in women's lives,\\" and will remind us of the importance of remembering our personal and collective pasts.From \\"Royal Beatings\\" by Alice Munro: \\"Looking out from her kitchen window at the cold lake, Rose was longing to tell somebody. It was Flo who would enjoy hearing. She thought of her saying 'Imagine!' in a way that meant she was having her worst suspicions gorgeously confirmed. But Flo was in the same place Hat Nettleton had died in, and there wasn't any way Rose could reach her.\\"Even though our experiences are so disparate, each story rings true. Some stories are disturbing, some are delightful; some bring us to tears, some make us laugh out loud--much like life itself.These are stories that long to be told, and Martin has skillfully brought them together and given them an audience. In \\"No Place for You, My Love,\\" Eudora Welty says, \\"A thing is incredible, if ever, only after it is told--returned to the world it came out of.\\" Here are our stories, returned to us to delight in and ponder.Wendy Martin is chair of the Department of English at the Claremont Graduate School and teaches American literature and American studies at Queens College, CUNY.

He writes with a passion that is at times overwrought - especially when teeing off against Plato and Hegel. Whether his criticism of their views is on the mark is incidental to the attack on Marx, and I leave it to the scholars of each to debate the merits of his critique. What Popper brings to the table is a clear exposition of his ideas. He makes a solid case for \\"social engineering\\" (an accurate but unfortunate term) as both a description of the past century and a prescription for addressing the problems with economic and social systems. This is a valuable and challenging book which will reward the reader willing to think through Popper's analysis."},{"Title":"The open society and its enemies, (Princeton paperbacks)","review":"Popper attempts - and largely succeeds - in puncturing the myth that authoritarian societies are in any way superior to Open Societies. This is an important message, particularly in this morally relativistic age where intellectual support (and justification) of authoritarian regimes is at an all-time high. The terrible truth is that totalitarian regimes do horrible things to their own people without qualms.Popper demolishes the idea that a planned society is somehow preferable to a free one. A planned society is necessarily a static society, i.e. Eastern Europe and the USSR since 1945; the exact opposite is true of dynamic, continually evolving open societies. A casual look will convice all except the loonies still &quot;waiting for the Revolution&quot; that a liberal, market-driven culture produces goods and services that an authoritarian one cannot.But his other arguement is deeper, more subtle. An open society is intrinsically more powerful for its intellectual machinery. It is not the material wealth of the West that should be admired (or disparaged if you are of that type). It is our intellectual dominance - particularly the US - that is so overwhelming. And it is true in all areas - scientific research, inventions, art, music, science...open societies excel, planned societies falter.This is Popper's strongest arguement for an open society - the relationship between economic and political freedom. It is not possible to have one without the other over the long haul. Yet, Popper touches on what might be considered the greatest weakness of our own success - the idea that material wealth leads does not require political freedom or participation. In this era of slogans, sound bites and everyone from actresses to radio hosts to rap stars dispensing political advice, it is important to remember that an open society exists only so long as citizens choose freedom through informed choices. Intellectual laziness or (worse) depravity is the first step to cultural decline. An important, readable work."},{"Title":"The open society and its enemies, (Princeton paperbacks)","review":"In this volume, Popper argues against what he calls the prophesies of historicism, and in particular the historicist prophesies of Marx. Of course, Marx didn't view his model of the progression of society as a prophesy but rather as a science grounded in observation. But Popper argues extensively that Marx's historicism cannot be a science. However, one argument that Popper does *not* resort to is that history has proved that Marx's socialism was inferior - simply because that would be resorting to an historicist argument!One key argument Popper puts forth against Marx is that his model of the progression of society failed to predict that there were more options open to society than just unrestrained capitalism and socialism - that is, Marx's model failed to predict the interventionism (or social engineering) that derailed the drive toward socialism in the western world. Or perhaps it was not so much that Marx failed to predict interventionism, but rather that he simply denied its possibility. That is, Marx was certain that no amount of rational action could ever untrack the revolution from unrestrained capitalism to socialism - socialism was, quite simply, the fate of human society.And therein lies Popper's distaste for historicism. He sees historicism not as harmless but as dangerous. It is dangerous precisely because it leads people to discard rational thought and action in favor of submission to fate and destiny.Throughout, Popper advocates democracy. In his view, democracy is the most desirable of the political systems invented by humankind primarily because it lends itself to reform - to peaceful revolution. Another criticism he has of Marx is that Marx always left open the possibility that the socialist revolution would be violent if necessary, even if it required a violent overthrow of a democracy. In Popper's estimation, this would be begging for totalitarianism (if you were to violently oust the democratically elected representatives, who would you replace them with?!). In Popper's opinion, violent revolution should only ever be considered in cases where peaceful reform is not an option (i.e., in anything but a democracy).In wrapping up, Popper waxes philosophic with respect to reason. In doing so, he proposes an interesting definition of rationality: for Popper, rationality is a social process in which individuals participate to achieve consensus. In science, this consensus is on theory; in politics, this consensus is on action. This is in stark contrast to other notions of rationality, such as the Platonic notion that rationality is a personal achievement. Popper argues that the Platonic notion of rationality leads to elitism and aristocratic/caste thinking - it leads one to ask totalitarian questions such as \\"who should have the power?\\"; whereas he argues that his notion of rationality leads to egalitarianism, to hearing one another's views and arguments, to respect for one another as individuals - it leads us all to ask democratic questions such as \\"how should power be controlled?\\"Add to this the readability and understandability of Popper's prose, and it's a philosophical page-turner if there ever was one."},{"Title":"The open society and its enemies, (Princeton paperbacks)","review":"This is a well known classic written more than 60 years ago that even our commonplace and leftist noise dominated cultural environment could not silence, therefore it needs no recommendation.

Then he treats Marx with kid gloves. What gives? The saying that the road to hell is paved with good intentions is all too true and Popper upholds this view when he talks about unintended consequences. If you look at Marx's political action you also discover that he was opposed to the Anarchists, the libertarian branch of socialism. I just can't make heads or tails of the different approach that Popper takes to these various purveyors of totalitarianism. Maybe Popper is only dealing with Marx the thinker, not Marx the politican. I'm much more concerned with the evil after effects of Marxist doctrine. Still today dictators use Marx as an excuse for their bestiality.On a different issue, Popper argues that a theory can never be proven, only falsified and that we use the theory until we find a better one to replace it. In Chapter 24, The Revolt Against Reason, Popper argues against the idea of society being superior to individual humans. For Popper society is just the sum of its parts (with no surplus value). When Popper argues with members of society, it is only a one-on-one dialog. Modern science has a very different view. For the Science of Complexity, the sum of the competing actions of the members of society creates a moving \\"fitness landscape\\" that in turn influences the outcome of these actions. In this view, society is more than the sum of its parts and it does influence members as a collective more than as a one-on-one dialog as Popper has it."},{"Title":"The open society and its enemies, (Princeton paperbacks)","review":"What else could I think of this book when I find Popper, today an almost forgotten philosopher, making fun of one of the greatest minds in history, like Aristotle? King Popper even remarks that he is ready to forgive Aristotle's shallowness, for he is the inventor of the respectable discipline of logic (this he does not dispute). He also suggests that Aristotle did not understand the problems he was dealing with in his Metaphysics. As for his analysis of Plato, he gets some conclusions right, but for the wrong reasons; and most of his theses are simply wrong, as so many critics have shown in the past decades.The chapters on Hegel are funny, and as far as personal accusations go, they are quite fair. But the analysis of Hegel's philosophy is not rewarding, unless you just want to make fun of Hegel and refuse to make the least effort to understand his admittedly difficult philosophy.The analysis of Marx is just what I expected: Marx as read by a clever but impatient and not quite informed critic.The discussion of Mannheim et al.'s sociology of knowledge is question begging or at most irrelevant. Mannheim never denied that critical thinking exists, or that intersubjectivity is possible. But he set limits to it. Perhaps Popper thought there were no limits to critical thinking in the social sciences and that &quot;prejudices&quot; were always criticizable. But this he does not prove.If you read the book carefully, you will also find out how much of a &quot;naive&quot; falsificationist Popper was, despite his own claims to the contrary.Popper's witticisms are the most enjoyable thing of the book, except when he gets disrespectful to the point of being ridiculous."},{"Title":"The open society and its enemies, (Princeton paperbacks)","review":"To begin with,the word \\"totalitarianism\\" only came into existence in the 20th century or rather the late 19th century.Anyone who is interested can confirm this by looking it up in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary.Popper is applying a term to describe Plato's philosophy which never existed when Plato was alive.In other words he's accusing Plato of being a totalitarian when totalitarianism didn't exist.There were dictatorships and tyrannies of course but these have always existed since men began living in cities (around 4000 BC).People in ancient Egypt, or ancient Mesopotamia,or ancient China were ruled by kings,pharaohs,or emperors and lived in un-democratic societies long before Plato was even born.How can you blame Plato for the fact that someone was ruled by a king or pharoah when Plato hadn't been born yet?The way that Popper uses the word totalitarianism it means the same as dictatorship or tyranny but in fact the word totalitarian had a specific meaning because it was used to describe the governments of Soviet Russia (especially under Stalin) and Nazi Germany.People who analyzed these governments at the time wanted to make the point that they were different from dictatorships or tyrannies in the past.Different, not just because they killed millions of people in concentration camps but because of the control they exercised over individuals who lived in those societies.This kind of control over the individual was only possible in the modern nation-state which didn't exist in Plato's time.In the modern nation-state you have governments with bureaucracies,modern communications,secret police forces,and political parties none of which existed when Plato was developing his philopsophy. Last point.If anyone takes the trouble to read biographies of Hitler or Stalin you very quickly realize that these were not the kind of men who would sit down and read Plato's Republic for inspiration.Raymon Aron in his book Democracy and Totalitarianism (which I recommend to anyone who wants to understand totalitarianism) made the point that the kind of men who seize power and become dictators don't need a philosophical justification to take power.Seizing power is its own justification.A case in point is Sadaam Hussein.Does anyone out there seriously believe that he read all of Plato's works as preparation to become dictator of Iraq? Of course not and neither did Hitler or Stalin.Popper appeals to the conspiracy buffs who want to believe that there is a secret liberal plot to undermine Western civilization and need someone to pin it on.Since Plato had a number of uncomplimentary things to say about democracy he becomes an obvious target."},{"Title":"The open society and its enemies, (Princeton paperbacks)","review":"Popper rules the Amazon roost.

I've come back to many of its quotes and arguments since, so I recently reread it and let me tell you - it's better the second time.Popper's goal is to go through (in brief) some of the worlds most mistaken large-name philosophers who he feels were responsible for creating closed social systems. This second volume focuses on Hegel (from an Aristotlean tradition) and Marx. Hegel alone is enough to earn Popper 5 stars as anyone who can (at least attempt to) explain the dialectic in anything approaching language is an amazing feat. In fact, a few reviewers below take issue with Popper's 'mischaracterization' of Hegel but due to Hegels chimeric and unintelligible explanations, I would suspect that no correct representation would be possible. In fact, this is one of Popper's arguments and that, in itself, is about as close to the truth of Hegel as one could get.Marx simply transforms Hegelian dialectic into a (to his credit) more intelligible, material one. Here, we get into crucial discussion of historicism and any deterministic system trying to plan history in advance. This, Popper notes, ALWAYS leads to totalitarian thinking as when one accepts the a priori 'direction' of history, one will become slave to she who dictates it (i.e., Marx or Lenin).Honestly, even if these parts of the book were never written, the list price is more then returned to the reader by the ending essays, where Popper discusses 'the sociology of knowledge' and why most ideas therein are antithetical to open societies.

Popper's ideas were used for ideological purposes during the Cold War, and continue to be used today by libertarians and \\"conservatives\\" to advance ideas that Popper rejected. What Popper means by \\"The Open Society\\" is a society based on reflection and deliberation, not one based on \\"laws of supply and demand.\\"THE OPEN SOCIETY AND ITS ENEMIES is one of those books much more often cited than actually read, and upon examination there is much here that is quite surprising. For instance, though Popper is mainly critical of Marx, who he calls a \\"false prophet,\\" he also says \\"[o]ne cannot do justice to Marx without recognizing his sincerity. His open-mindedness, his sense of facts, his distrust of verbiage, and especially of moralizing verbiage, made him one of the world's most influential fighters against hypocrisy and pharisaism.\\" (82) He also notes \\"...how justified [Marx] was in his glowing protest against the hell of an unrestrained capitalism...\\" (185) And Popper devotes an entire chapter to *agreeing* with Marx's anti-psychologism, his sociological insight that \\"social existence determines consciousness.\\" (Chapter 14, \\"The Autonomy of Sociology\\")It is precisely in reference to the way in which Marx's prophesy of capitalism's demise failed to come true that Popper distinguishes himself as a flexible liberal and not a dogmatic libertarian. Because, he says, \\"[u]nrestrained capitalism is gone. Since the day of Marx, democratic interventionism has made immense advances...\\" (187) The living standards of the working majority were raised through democratic social reforms which included the 8-hour day, recognition of trade unions, women's suffrage, and much more.

Popper says there IS an alternative, though we have to think, and fight, to bring it about. There is no need to submit to an abstraction such as The Free Market -- the very success of the postindustrial democracies is testimony to their success in democratic social engineering.Popper's main critique of Marx is that he, like Plato, was a historicist who believed in a universal history of humanity. \\"Historicist\\" is not exactly an everyday epithet -- why did Popper see historicism as dangerous? According to Popper, there are but multiple histories of various aspects of human life, such as religion, art, and so forth. He objects to anyone believing they have the key to the future, whether that results in socialist dogmatism, or libertarian dogmatism, or any other form of teleology. Popper makes this incredibly timely observation about the tendency to treat the history of power politics as universal history -- \\"...[t]his is hardly better than to treat the history of embezzlement or of robbery or of poisoning as the history of mankind. For the history of power politics is nothing but the history of international crime and mass murder... This history is taught in schools, and some of the greatest criminals are extolled as its heroes.\\" (270) Popper closes the book with rousing praise, not for blind patriotism, but for critical debate, rationalism, and pluralism as opposed to \\"monolithic social ends\\" (396)."},{"Title":"The open society and its enemies, (Princeton paperbacks)","review":"&quot;deconstructing heidegger&quot;Popper's attempt at saving the Western World, part II.

So here's my comments on the review of September 16 (while at the same time touching some - of the many - subjects that the book treats).The review criticises Popper for calling Plato's philosophy totalitarian. The reviewer argues that:1. the word totalitarian didn't exist in Plato's age, ergo Plato's philosophy couldn't be totalitarian.2. that totalitarianism is a word especially constructed for the mind control practised by modern dictatorships, and that the ancient dictatorships couldn't practice this kind of dictatorship because they lacked the technical abilities.3. that totalitarian leaders aren't bothered by what Plato writes, and thus that Plato's philosophy can't be responsible for totalitarianism.ad 1. Clearly dogs existed before the word \`dog' existed, atoms existed before the word \`atom' existed and totalitarianism could have existed, before the word \`totalitarianism' existed.ad 2. While the word \`totalitarianism' might have been created for the mind police exercised by the Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany, the word can also be used to make a distinction between ancient dictatorships. It would indeed be wrong to call the dictatorship practised by the ancient Egyptian pharaoh's - that condoned the existence of the Jewish religion - as totalitarian. However the point Popper is making, is that Plato's philosophy didn't condone different views. Plato basically said that the wisest should lead and that none shall question him. This philosophy is supported with \`mind control' techniques as: banning foreign influences and thoughts (banning free travel), disallowing the writing of certain scriptures/books, and disallowing the right of free speech to the working class, woman and the under 45. While in modern times there is surely a greater range of mind control techniques (although in contrast: inventions have also made it easier to exchange ideas), it would be strange not to call Plato's philosophy totalitarian, simply because the ancient times lacked camera's, etc. The important aspect of Plato's philosophy is whether it leaves room for different views, if not: it is essentially totalitarian.ad 3. Firstly a philosophy can be totalitarian without ever being responsible for a totalitarian government, just as a racist book need never create a racist person (or be the cause of a racist action). Secondly, I believe Popper is right in asserting that Plato has made a considerable contribution to the believe in the wise, unquestionable leader. Even if Plato hasn't directly inspired dictators, his philosophy hasn't helped to create checks on these leaders. Instead Popper is arguing for criticism, and although a dictator will probably not spend much time studying Popper, hopefully it will stimulate resistance to its policies.Lastly, the reviewer remarks that Plato can't be blamed for a undemocratic/dictatorial philosophy because in those times people simply didn't know better. This puts questionmarks at how well the reviewer read the book, since Popper took great time in this book to show otherwise. To show that democratic views were known to Plato, but that he rejected them for the totalitarian rule of the wise leader."},{"Title":"The open society and its enemies, (Princeton paperbacks)","review":"Popper's attempt at saving the Western World, part II.

In the course of this book, (and in the preceding volume), Popper discusses Greek philosophy, the rise and fall of Athens, the logical shortcomings of philosophical idealism, the scientific method, the art of government, and excesses of Hegelian and Marxist philosophy. And he does it all in a style that is both straightforward and elegant, precise and easy to follow. Indeed, Popper's facility at rendering complex issues and ideas lucid and assessible is so extraordinary that the reader is apt to forget the profundity of Popper's analysis and the range and depth of his thought.Popper's mastery as a philosophic critic is no where in better evidence than in his discussion of Aristotle in chapter 11. Popper brilliantly shows why Aristotle cannot be regarded either as a scientific thinker or even as a defender of reason. Aristotle's doctrine of definintions and his essentialistic epistemology, Popper contends, only serve to bring about a great deal of hairsplitting, verbalism, and despair with reason and argument. &quot;Scholasticism and mysticism and despair in reason, these are the unavoidable results of the essentialism of Plato and Aristotle,&quot; concludes. &quot;And Plato's open revolt against freedom becomes, with Aristotle, a secret revolt against reason.&quot; Since Aristotle's speculative methods of determining matters of fact still dominates the cerebral processes of most modern social thinkers (think of Marcuse or Ayn Rand, for instance), Popper's critique serves as a rallying cry for those of us who want to bring social thought and philosophy back within the confines of empirical reality and the scientific method."},{"Title":"The open society and its enemies, (Princeton paperbacks)","review":"What I particularly liked about Popper's book was its accessibility. He does not entirely avoid jargon (historicism), but he explains whatever philosophical jargon he does use in a straightforward and understandable way. Because he writes so clearly, the reader can really feel he is participating, by reading, in a meaningful way, in an important debate.Some philosophers seem to revel in the obscurity of their expressed thoughts. Popper on the other hand seems to express his ideas in a clear and direct fashion. Refreshingly, he skewers pomposity, pretence and philosophical obfuscation (on this last, he is highly critical of Hegel).The accessibility of the ideas in the book makes one think that this is the way philosophy should be written, sets a standard of clarity, and is a good invitation to further reading and reflection. His systematic logical development of ideas, by making historical or literary observations, and working out the logical consequences, demonstrates the possibilities of analytical reasoning applied to philosophical issues.This is a book about political philosophy. What was particularly striking was the contrast in point of view he paints between Plato's desire, as Popper describes it, to avoid change, and the measures that Plato was prepared to advocate in order to avoid change on the one hand, and on the other hand the perspectives of an open society. How valid all of his criticisms are I am unsure; I subsequently read that some Platonists have taken issue with Popper's analysis and conclusions. Even if Popper is wrong in some respects about Plato's intentions, none the less, Popper's points on the division between those who seek to avoid change for society, and those who wish to create an institutional structure that permits constructive change have great currency. What is interesting is that elements of resistance to change also occur in open societiesWhat is intriguing about this book is that it was written in 1943 or so. It was Popper's war effort. His real strength is supposed to be in the philosophy of scientific investigation.

Popper hated Soviet communism. However, he remains quite sympathetic to West European social democracy and speaks of great respect for Marx. In fact, he finds the totalitarian consequences of Marx's thought in the eastern bloc to be the effect of a harmful Hegelian residue, which he attempts to expunge - anticipating Louis Althusser's, the French communist philosopher, entire philosophical project.His treatment of Hegel is drastically unfair and totally out of date, but his attempt to formulate a Hegel-less Marx is fascinating and not at all the right-wing attack that some commentators, who have probably never read the book, seem to think it is."},{"Title":"The open society and its enemies, (Princeton paperbacks)","review":"To Popper, science is a process of \\"conjectures and refutations\\"-- advancing bold conjectures about the state of the world and then trying to refute them. \\"Even in the study of history, objectivity should be sought in the institutions and traditions of a discipline. It is only through the give and take of open criticism and the ongoing interplay of many different kinds of biases that anything approaching objectivity will emerge.\\" Thus, \\"truth\\" is seen as a hypothesis--you can't prove truth, you can only prove untruth. This is because one cannot know everything, therefore, nothing can be proved to be true.Open societies, in Popper's definition, with their ideals of freedom and reason, of men who may create their own future, are opposed to the regimes of authoritarianism and totalitarianism. Hegel and Marx are the main focus of the book. Aristotle built his theory on Plato; Hegel on Aristotle; Marx on Hegel. Popper is concerned with their philosophies of history. A philosophy of history is an attempt to interpret systematically the historical process by a principle that unifies the results of research and points to an \\"ultimate meaning\\" behind the process. It involves systematic reflection on scientifically derived data about the past. All the parts are unified to form a whole with \\"ultimate meaning.\\"It was thus not Marx's historicist method which led him to success, but instead the \\"methods of institutional analysis.\\" In many democratic, capitalist countries production has been so great that the workers have a higher standard of living than Marx ever envisaged. He also had an unrealistic view of human nature--that because man is born good, changing his environment will bring happiness. But this view ignores the universality of human imperfection, and the sacredness of personality that is lost in the communist state.Yet, Popper claims that Marx has done Christianity a great service by pointing out the humanitarian demands of Christ. Popper made many generalizations about Christianity without describing the basic tenets that have made Christianity \\"the strongest opponent of Communism.\\" Popper does not view Christianity as being a \\"substitute from dreams and wish--fulfillment; it should resemble neither the holding of a ticket in a lottery, nor the holding of a policy in an insurance company.\\" Popper opposes a \\"leap in the dark\\" of faith, whether by Marxists probing the beginning of evolution, or by those experiencing a personal relationship with God.

Kitty hires former prosecutor turned defense lawyer Sandra Salinsky to defend her. Sandra quickly realizes that his client had numerous motives including a vast inheritance and had the means and opportunity to push her father following a party the night before.The case is personal for Sandra as her mother and partner was the victim's best friend and her boyfriend his legal partner. Making the case more complicated for Sandra is that her former friend police Lieutenant Dennis Truman heads the investigation and he still considers her a turncoat for changing sides so he is uncooperative. Sandra quickly learns that those who attended the party at Phillip's home tell diverse stories of what happened that evening. Though the case that no nonsense prosecutor Edgar Saul lays out seems open and shut, Sandra believes Kitty is innocent, but to prove this seems impossible.This entertaining legal thriller grips the audience more for the almost incestuous ties between the defendant, her defense team, and the prosecution-police side. The story line is action-packed, but is character driven and the heroine realizes that as she digs deeper into life of the deceased the more personal it feels. Fans of a fine mystery will appreciate Susan Baker's delightful DEATH OF A PRINCE.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Five Star First Edition Mystery - Death Of A Prince","review":"I liked the mystery and I stayed interested.

Overall, I enjoyed the mystery."},{"Title":"Everybody Scream!","review":"Fans of Jeffrey Thomas's 'Punktown' are going to love this full novel of Punktown's carnival adventure, but even those who have never journeyed to Punktown should enjoy this alien infested midway within Thomas's dreamy landscape of the planet Paxton, and the city of Punktown.Overflowing with a wide variety of characters, 'Everybody Scream' still narrows most of its focus on Sophi and Del Kahn, owners and operators of Paxton's annual Carnival, a free-for-all of rides, amusement, and murders. Central to its theme are Mitch Garnet, the Carnival's security chief, Pearl Mason, a singer with a mutant body, and Hector Tomas, a Theta Researcher who has found out the truth behind the multiple dimensions.I am a fan of strange worlds, mutated bodies, oddly imaginative aliens, and a good carnival. 'Everybody Scream' delivers on each of these twisted needs of mine, along with a lot of action on the last day of the carnival's season, plus a sizzling finale that keeps you reading right up to the last page.Worlds collide across dimensions, drugs are bought and sold, corruption seethes underfoot, and people's daily lives float by as you immerse yourself in Thomas's Punktown world. Thomas does use his strange platform to put out some messages on political issues such as Animal Testing and Animal Rights, but the lessons are not long or tyrannical, more thought-provoking, so if you hold a different view just skip the paragraph and enjoy the book.Thomas is a talented writer that is definitely worth the attention, so don't forget to pick up the anthologies Punktown and Punktown Third Eye, along with the upcoming Punktown Shades Of Gray. Strange worlds and strange beings, it doesn't get any better than this.Take an extra minute to note the fantastic artwork on the cover by David A. Magitis, a very talented artist in my opinion. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Everybody Scream!","review":"Everybody Scream is about Punktown's otherworldly carnival, a word rooted in the Latin cognate \\"carn-\\" or \\"flesh.\\" And if there is an overarching theme throughout Everybody Scream, it's that the carnival itself is one giant organism with its various constituents all appendages of its body.Sophi Kahn is the head. The owner of the carnival and the thinker of the group, she always tries to maintain a cool detachment from the inevitable murders that happen at the carnival. Yet when one of her indiscretions come back to haunt her, her emotions take over...Del Kahn, former famous singer and de facto leader of the carnival, is its heart. He thrives on emotion in the moment, preying on young girls who idolize his memory as a star. But if his unfaithfulness is driven by the gaping void in his soul, his redemption is galvanized by Sophi's jeopardy. And when roused to anger, the fist is raised...That fist is Mitch Garnet. A forcer with a checkered past, he itches to retaliate with violence against those he deems worthy of scorn. When the gloves are off, little can hold Mitch back, not even Del. The only person who can tame Garnet is Pearl Mason...If Garnet is the masculine portion of this carnival's corpus, Pearl Mason is its feminine voice. A former prostitute-turned-singer, she has a conjoined twin that she conceals beneath maternity clothes. She is both mother and maiden, torn between two roles. Pearl is also a canary in the coalmine, the first to react to a wrongness about the carnival that's the surest sign something is rotten in Punktown......as evidenced by the parasites. There are two kinds, equally loathsome: the ghoul-like snipes (yes, snipes) and the roach-like coleopteroids known as bedbugs. Both feed off the carnival's denizens in different ways, but only one group has an agenda. And the only person who perceives that agenda is......is Hector Tomas, the eyes of the carnival. Hector is a Theta researcher who has seen awful things in other dimensions that are enough to drive him to use drugs - so he can sleep, so he can forget, so he can function. A broken man, Hector turns to the only people who can satisfy his needs.And that is the odious Johnny Leng, enforcer for Roland LaKarnafeaux's drug-dealing gang of bikers. Leng is the carnival's embodiment of lust, and he rapes and murders his way through the carnival with abandon. It will take a strong heart and a clenched fist to bring him down.Everyone else in the novel is a victim or an accessory to this twisty tale of a carnival's last night. As always, Thomas' superb writing is in full effect here, detailing a myriad of alien races and cultures effortlessly. Everybody Scream is a fascinating series of character studies and a chaotic whirl of sex, drugs, and rock and roll. Just like a carnival."},{"Title":"Everybody Scream!","review":"Suffers from not being Deadstock, Monstrocity, or Letters from Hades.Kind of like reading anything by China Mieville after Perdido Street Station, nothing ever quite measures up.Anyway, this is a Punktown novel. And Punktown novels are excellent for a anyone bored with conventional, sci-fi, horror, fantasy, and a few other things. It's a day at the carnival. There is no plot line that is terribly important to all of the characters; they meet and bounce off each other, everyone trying to make the most out of what they have. Or, in some cases, just trying to get laid.Some thought-provoking stuff in here, along with interesting, likeable characters. And a few douche bags. A novel with a bizarre but believable setting, consisting of plot created by bizarre but very real characters.If you're a fan, read it.

While very accurate, Chedzoy avoids the common tendency of biographers to dwell on dates and times but focuses instead on Caroline's actual life, which was remarkable. She was born into a family situation which forced her to marry a man which she did not love, and he soon became physically abusive to her. She was close friends with William Melbourne, who became Prime Minister of England, and her husband accused her of &quot;criminal conversation&quot; (a euphemism for adultery) even though he knew very well that this was completely untrue. Caroline's husband eventually took her three children from her and would not allow them to be returned to her until one of them died due to poor medical treatment. In retaliation, Caroline went to Parliament and over the course of a few years reformed the British laws for women. Overall, this was a very good book, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone interested in women's rights, poetry and literature (Caroline wrote many poems and novels-- during her life, she was compared to Byron and thought of as more talented that E.B. Browning), or English history in general."},{"Title":"Conquer Stress... Auto-matically (While-U Drive)","review":"Robert Griswold and all the Love tapes from Effective Learning Systems (I have over 10) are great. I have used a few different tapes by others and none of them even come close to comparing!"},{"Title":"Grimm's Grimmest","review":"I must confess to ambivalent feelings about this book. The stories are sordid accounts of hideous people committing unspeakable acts with the basest of motives. Hannibal Lecter could step into the pages of one of these stories without even a change in costume. The idea that anyone, anywhere, any time, could have considered these tales appropriate for children boggles the mind.Then why would anyone want to read them? Well, the archetypal human concerns woven into these macabre tales still pong home with disconcerting clarity, just as they did in feudal Germany hundreds of years ago. Loveless existence, infertility, betrayal, greed, jealously, incest, poverty, disaster; the stories read like a laundry list of the most tragic bits of the human experience and, sadly, the subject matter hasn't changed much, only the manner of expression.The book opens with a comprehensive introduction by Maria Tatar, which provides an excellent frame of reference for what could otherwise be merely a jumble of surreal images. In the early 1800's two brothers, Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, collected and retold old German folktales. Discovering a lucrative market for children's morality stories, they created successive revisions targeted especially for children. Sexual content was suppressed, but violence was not. Whether by popular demand of due to quirks of their own, the Grimms in some cases even escalated the violent images.Viewing the original folktales as allegorical teaching tools, designed to help adults cope with life problems, it all begins to make sense. Each story contains at least one rather heavy-handed lesson -- morality written large: &quot;Greed will get you in the end.&quot; &quot;Disobedient children are likely to die a hideous death.&quot; &quot;Don't bemoan your childlessness or you may give birth to a hedgehog.&quot;I was intrigued by the little secondary assumptions that are included in the stories and give clues to the cultural orientation. Oddly enough, there are a number of strong, independent female characters. Where did they come from? Children are expendable, not entitled to love, and the challenge seems to have been how to get as much work and as little aggravation from them as possible. For women, marriage was a huge, inescapable gamble. One must marry, but the bridegroom was as likely to turn out to be a cannibal as a prince.Read these stories like a book of puzzles, looking for the main morality lesson and digging out the secondary assumptions, and they act as a mirror held up to our own society. What has changed? What is the same? What is better, what is worse? Horrific they may be, but vastly enlightening as well."},{"Title":"Grimm's Grimmest","review":"Liked the illustrations to this volume of the darker tales, especially Juniper Tree, which was an amazing story that makes you realize just how awful the stepmothers of fairy tales are. Some of the stories are familiar but quite a few were new to me, so this was something of an adventure."},{"Title":"Grimm's Grimmest","review":"I received this book as a Christmas present last year, and it has quickly become one of my all-time favorites. Okay, yes, the stories are pretty darn gory, with decapitations and/or mutilations playing a prominent role in quite a few of them, not to mention the incest and cannibalism and so forth, so you need to keep this book away from the kiddies. That aside, it's a wonderful and fascinating collection of tales. The illustrations are very nice, and there's a lot of them. Plus there's a great introduction at the beginning that gives the reader more of a background story on the Grimms and their work. Overall, a fantastic book."},{"Title":"Grimm's Grimmest","review":"I found the narratives to be engaging. The color illustrations were fine, but the black-and-white drawings were, uh, AWFUL. The book would benefit from the deletion of the black-and-white drawings, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Grimm's Grimmest","review":"Maria Tatar introduces the stories and some of the variations in different editions. She also delves into the politics that have helped some stories become well known and helped keep others obscure. There is a table of contents, but the stories are in no discernable order.This collection takes readers closer to the original tales and include incest, sex, and graphic violence. The stories are rough and sometimes hard to understand. For example, I could not understand why the daughter who had fled the castle and the incestuous advances of her father, the king, later purposefully let her identity be known to him.These stories are excellent reading that should help tellers understand these folk tales better. They may be tellable as written to an adult audience. However, I feel that an audience that is not well-versed in the oral tradition my need some help in understanding them or putting them into context.The illustrations have a lurid quality that intensifies the feeling of uneasiness.Source Notes: Selected stories from the 3rd ed. (1822) of Kinder- und Hausm&auml;rchen by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm.Reviewed by Karen Woodworth-Roman, MS Library Science"},{"Title":"Grimm's Grimmest","review":"This volume collects a number of fairy tales recorded by the brothers Grimm, translated and illustrated to preserve all of the macabre aspects. Murder and mutilation to incest and cannibalism, there is a little bit of everything grotesque in these stories, which range from well-known tales such as Cinderella to lesser known stories such as Hans My Hedgehog. Tatar's short introduction makes up the sole elaboration and explanation of the texts--there is little commentary, little history, and little to put the grotesque elements in perspective. As such, this is a fine introductory text to the Grimm's stories as they originally appeared--the collection isn't huge, but it's large enough for the casual reader, and the illustrations pick out some of the best moments. However, this is not a complete collection and contains no history or commentary, so it may disappoint the reader that is already familiar with the grotesque aspects and/or is looking for a more detailed or more useful text.Stepping far away from the singing mice and innocent maidens that fill modern conceptions of traditional fairy tales, Grimm's Grimmest presents original Grimm stories, translated into English, presented with illustrated plates (color and black and white), which preserve and even flaunt their more gruesome aspects. A stepmother feeds a murdered child to his father; Cinderella's step sisters cut off their toes to try and fit their feet in the glass slipper; a father cuts off his daughters hands so that she cannot sin. The storytelling is simple and repetitive, the plots and premises are at the same time macabre and magical, and the stories resolve to conclusions that are logical, often vengeful, and not quite happy every after. The story selection is fairly wide, including both famous and lesser known tales, the illustrations are simple and grotesque much in the same way as the stories, and the book certainly delivers the gruesome aspects that it promises.For the price and the claim, however, this book is little more than a brief introduction to the original Grimm stories. To be fair, there are a decent number of stories in this collection (19, to be precise), but this is a small fraction of the 200-some Grimm fairy tales that the brothers published during their lifetimes. And, although the eight-page introduction is interesting enough, it is limited in scope and depth; without footnotes, individual introductions, or commentary, there is no detailed information on the stories themselves or the Grimm brothers, their collecting and writing process, or the impact of the books or their grotesque elements. It should also go without saying that the stories are translations, not retellings, and so they are short, have repetitive narratives, and forgo characterization and description in favor of the plot. In short, while this is an adequate and brief introduction to the Grimm stories in their original form, but it is not complete, complex, or particularly informational, and readers who are already familiar with the original Grimm stories or who are looking for more detailed information will probably find this collection to be disappointing.Personally, I appreciate this book for what it is: a short, simple, but entertaining collection of dark and twisted stories. It is a fast, approachable read, the illustrations encourage a bit of lingering on the \\"best\\" parts, and both the magical and gruesome aspects make for a good read. But on the whole, what the reader gets from this book will depend on what he wants from it--those looking for a short and simple set of original grim Grimm's stories will enjoy it; those looking for a broader collection, more detail, or an updated storytelling style will probably be disappointed."},{"Title":"Grimm's Grimmest","review":"This book contains the collection of the Grimm's brothers original fairy tales, and mostly gruesome in nature, involving cannibal and gruesome acts.

And by that I don't mean these weren't readable because of their content, but rather the way they were written, that is not very enticingly or intriguingly at all. Basically this read as an allegory for something I already knew: that people can be cruel, violent and otherwise awful. And where's all the grim stuff the book was crowing about. Sure, there was lots of blood shed, but most of it was either relatively mild or came out rather alright in the end. I was expecting horror stories galore but what I got was the sense of heavily toned-down reading. A kid could read this stuff hardly batting an eye (as the intro itself seems to suggest). Even the sexual references are oblique enough that children would pretty much gloss them over (such as Rapunzel asking why her clothes don't fit anymore).

It's possible to recognize some of our own versions of these tales, but they are certainly changed from the originals!

Very few end with \\"they lived happily ever after\\" and even less beginning with \\"once upon a time\\".Containing cannabilism, incest, murder, sex, and a host of many things not consider \\"good\\" for children. Many of these stories evoke visions of Vincent Price rather than the canned, sanitized Disney movies. These are stories of goodness and purity most often - not always! - winning the day. The wicked are punished brutally for their misdeeds.Printed on yellowed paper with both black and white and color illustrations it feels as if you are reading a book far older than it is. The story structure is rough, crude because these are oral stories written down perhaps for the first time when the Brothers gathered them. The language and pacing stay true to this oral tradition making the reading rough to a reader used to modern well edited stories.

Even when described, the artistry is such that the reader has difficulty connecting with the text as the descriptions are not picturesque but instead, one dimensional.Based upon the editorial review, I expected that I would be chilled and thrilled from here to doomsday. Hardly. This was a horror free read, after which I slept like a lamb. This book was the equivalent of a kiddie ride at Six Flags.However, while it did not deliver the promised goods, I did find it appropriate for a very young adult with whom you are interested in rekindling a love of stories and reading.

This book is a great source as a Dictionary (and I stress Dictionary, this is NO PHRASEBOOK) for looking up individual words *BUT* 1 thing I don't like is that alot of times there is more than 1 Albanian word for the English word and it doesn't tell you what form is correct It only lists the different words for the 1 word and it's up to you to figure out which one is the correct form of the word you want to use. It does have the Alphabets, Pronunciations, and Words in both Albanian and English. This is why I think it is important to have a phrasebook to go along with this Dictionary, because for general speaking and the correct usage of the words, you need another book or phrasebook to accompany this Dictionary. I brought this Dictionary with me the last time I went to visit my fiance and it was very useful in pointing out different words.In saying this, I DO recommend having this book for any person learning or wanting to learn Albanian.

The author is a poor writer, with confusingly structured sentences and paragraphs whose content seems to repeat itself many times. He had very few points throughout the entire book, limited mostly to just saying that the Penitentes find sacredness in the things around them and in charity. If you know that, you know the essence of this book. It's a short read at only 79 pages (certainly not worth $18) but I could barely make it through, noting in the margins things like \\"This book is awful\\" and \\"Charity, prayers, charity, prayers, charity, prayers,\\" because he rarely mentions anything else.I was intrigued by the prospect of this book but found it entirely disappointing.

While his text is rather detailed and scientific, his illustrations are natural and use many every day examples (like a spool to illustrate the phalanges) to model moving parts of the body.

They are the least instructional part of this book. The magic of this book is in all of those little off the cuff-looking diagrams that compare the ribcage to a truncated egg, or the joint of a finger to a sideways spool. Study them well until you can reproduce them from any angle from memory. Those simple, blocky diagrams and the accompanying handwritten teacher's notes are like gold.

(two reviews pointed to these issues as detractors to the book)What it is, is a superb tool to aid the artist in understanding the complexity of human anatomy in a visual, easy to grasp manner.It portrays the human form in ways that allow the artist to understand the underlying mass, weight and structure of the human body and gives answers to many questions most artists don't even realize they had until studying this book.True, it hasn't been updated since its original debut, but it hasn't needed to be.

Fortunately, he supplements them with his own soft pencil drawings on other pages, and he includes detailed (and surprisingly readable and relevant) descriptions of how different bones and muscles connect. He does give the proper names for muscles and bones, but he doesn't bore us with overly scientific discussion.The few photographs don't illustrate much, but they serve as fair examples for differing body types and positions. Peck puts uncommon effort into facial features and expressions: he doesn't just draw the muscles on the face, but he indicates the directions they pull and how they work to express temperament.A previous reviewer expressed dislike for the racial comparisons - but I liked them. I don't think Peck means to say &quot;all white people look like this, all black people look like this, etc.&quot; but he gives the artist characteristics to watch for when drawing from life (to base your own drawings off of his descriptions, well, yes, that would be silly).He also describes proportions and motion in good detail.

He goes into expressions, cultural and age distinctions, and locomotion. Is this the only book you'll need in studying anatomy, probably not. But each book you get on the subject, and study (NOT JUST COLLECT) will hone your visual memory until drawing the figure becomes second nature. Note: Study means putting time and effort on that drawing pad!!! Also, nothing beats drawing from life or imagination! These books are to supplement these areas."},{"Title":"Atlas Of Human Anatomy For The Artist","review":"I feel that this book is very practical for any person who is interested in anatomy for human body. It is a rather complete and well illustrated guide. I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Atlas Of Human Anatomy For The Artist","review":"As a teenager, I bought this book to help me draw people better. Learning body and head proportions is key to drawing more realistic-looking people, and this book can help you along. Peck's illustrations show you different ways to look at the human body, sometimes using blocks, spheres, and other objects to represent how a certain muscle group works or looks to help you better understand how it should be drawn. He covers everything from musculoskeletal structure to facial expressions, emotions, and photos of faces from around the world. And for those who like to warm up their skills by sketching people but have no model to use, there are several human model pictures towards the back of the book to help you out. Before I took college courses and had real models to work with, I used these photos to do my many quick pencil or charcoal sketches as a warm-up for drawing. Having this book before those courses definitely helped me draw better and faster than some of the others who were learning to draw people for the first time. I have referenced it several times since then when drawing or painting people to make sure I'm getting the right idea of the muscle structure. I have used other books for learning to draw people that was more step-by-step, but this book has a lot of different detail other books don't have.And I was surprised to find out it was from the 50's when I looked it up here on Amazon, since it doesn't really appear that way at all."},{"Title":"Atlas Of Human Anatomy For The Artist","review":"I am an art student who wanted a guide to the human body.

The combinations of photos, hand sketches and detailed black and white illustrations give an immense look at each part of the body. From the first section of the book on bones, to the next on muscles, and finally to other details some books over-look like body structure by ethnics, emaciation and obesity, as well as superficial elements like veins and wrinkles, this book covers so much all at once. Also I admit I haven't 'read' much of the content in this book but really the pictures speak for them selves and are clearly labeled. It isn't one of those books that bombards you with needless text but it does have a more precise description in what text is there that serves to enhance rather then overwhelm. Out of the countless art books I have bought seeking answers to my proportion problems or to find out in best detail the actual structure beneath the skin (as well as a better understanding of how the skin layers over it) this book has been the best and most comprehensive thus far."},{"Title":"Atlas Of Human Anatomy For The Artist","review":"Atlas of Human Anatomy For the Artist is an excellent book.

I read alot of anatomy books and have not come across too many willing to go beyond the ideal body type. I found it especially helpful that this book provides detailed drawings and photographs of the figure; some books only have rough sketches which are not very helpful. This book is not just for those who want to draw the figure; those who model the figure in 3D applications will also find it useful.

Wow, what a stimulating discovery, and what fun! Besides the skeletal and musculature illustrations, \\"Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist\\" is full of Peck's own drawings of basic anatomical features. These are not just the \\"final\\" drawings, like the master prints in Hale, but the beginning \\"rough sketches\\". I find this delightful because every beginner needs some inspirational guidance in drawing's first steps. A simple rough sketch of a nose, with shading; or bones drawn as a simple hinge joint, an arm or leg.... Peck's general reduction of the human figure to basic shapes is of inestimable help. The reader may just find himself saying, \\"Hey, I can do THAT!!!\\" And that is the wonderful thing about PECK's book.Peck has impeccable credentials and must be compared to Robert Beverly Hale. Peck's is not merely an alternate duplication of the same material Hale covers. There is a 'personal' touch in Peck; but the problem with any/all anatomy books, for beginners, is that they are simply intimidating, in their detail, their precision, their absolute realism. PECK overcomes this anatomical intimidation. I would venture that PECK ought to be included in at least the first several \\"drawing\\" books that one acquires. Sometimes it seems that several pages offer more practical instruction to a new student than entire chapters in the books coming out in recent years with gimmicky titles.\\"Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist,\\" in combination with any beginning book on figure drawing is a must. With Famous Artist's School, Willy Pogany, Walt Reed, Jack Hamm, Viktor Perard and similar instruction, any ...................book-buyer / beginning artist will find themselves advancing steadily. I rate this in the top 4 of figure drawing books for the beginner.The chapter on \\"Distinctions of Age, Sex, And Race\\" is highly useful. PECK may be in danger of getting shoved aside with time and the publication of new pablum texts containing nothing new or vital; but PECK has written a timeless text that commands respect.

I have not seen (ever) a better description of human anatomy, bodily motion and the methodology for capturing both in artistic media. This book describes every detail of the human anatomy from multiple angles.In the section describing the bones, it shows you how the bones look for all ages and each sex. It shows you how the bones move, and work together. It shows you what the bones look like from the underside.In the sections covering muscles, it shows you how fat is stored in the muscle, how the the muscles move, how blood vessles show through the muscle and how the muscles layer.There are detailed portrayals of proportion, motion, emotion and prospective, all in photos and drawn graphics - not just in words.As I said, I've never seen a better book for describing the human body to an artist, and I've been on the look-out for more than 20 years."},{"Title":"Atlas Of Human Anatomy For The Artist","review":"Mostly focusing on bone, and muscle structure this guide is excellent for finding what you need quickly.

A part of me regrets buying this book because I expected a figure drawing book. It isn't. It's a reference to human anatomy and I guess half if not most of the book is useful. I just can't give it 4 or 5 stars because Mr. Peck uses more words than visual diagrams to explain how the body moves and where fat develops. The section about fat is purely textual. It would have been better if there's a diagram of an average person overlaid with outlines where fat develops.I still use it to supplement Joseph Sheppard's Drawing the Living Figure though.I ordered Anatomy of Movement by Blandine Calais-Germain and I hope the high reviews of that book reflect its actual quality.I guess it's true that there is no one-stop shop book on anatomy and figure drawing. An artist must have access to a library - personal or otherwise - to learn from.Again, Mr. Peck's book in my opinion doesn't deserve 4 or 5 stars but if you do buy it, you won't regret it as much as let's say buying an anatomy book authored by Christopher Hart (blech)."},{"Title":"Atlas Of Human Anatomy For The Artist","review":"By far the best book on human anatomy for artists.

The book is pretty inexpensive, and it's pretty clear, and I haven't found something better that doesn't cost a whole lot more. It was published in the 50s, and it hasn't been changed one bit, so the usual number of cornball drawings are included (they look VERY 50s). And the racial and gender characterizations are incredibly goofy and/or offensive. I'm a woman, and believe me, I've seen worse characterizations, but still.... The racial characterizations are truly amazing: really booga booga (oddly, no women are included in the photographs of the races). Lest white men think they're off the hook, they're not. Many of them get the Ken-doll treatment (blurred-out genitalia: at least I hope they've just been blurred out).Still, the price of the book is right and has lots of good basic information (I like the descriptions of joints and how they work: very 50s and very easy to understand.It SURE would be nice if somebody would publish lots of pictures of skeletons next to muscle overlays next to photos of real people in natural poses (all kinds of normal people, and skeleton, muscle, and humans side by side). So far, everything I find is so stupid. Barcsay is still probably the best book, but lacking in some cohesiveness.Just reviewed what I wrote: I switched to a much more expensive textbook, which was worth it (Nathan Goldstein's \\"Figure Drawing\\").

I will be sure to do business with again thanks."},{"Title":"Atlas Of Human Anatomy For The Artist","review":"Originaly published in 1951, the Complete Atlas, while probably the best and most comprehensive anatomy book available for artists, betrays its age with what is now clearly objectionable racist and sexist content. Illustrations and photographs of male models and body structure outnumber those of women by at least ten to one. Incidentally, sexist prioritization places the female form in a small section toward the back of the book.This sexist bias extends to the text, which describes the female body in less than glowing terms while lauding the ideal nature of the male form. An example from page 175 on the navel: &quot;In the female a large deposit of fat, especially below the navel, causes the pit to be deep and obscure in detail. The navel of a lean, muscular male is distinct and firmly rimmed.&quot;The short section on racial features contains perhaps even more offensive language, describing dark-skinned people as having a &quot;muzzle&quot;! I assumed that this must be a technical anatomical term applicable to all human beings but the only other reference to it in the book occurs in a note on genetic defects. As might be expected, illustration of racial types also starts with the Nordic male and whiter peoples first, in tacit hierarchy.While the racism and sexism of Peck's book may be mild for its time, it seems that our enlightened sensibilites demand an updating of the text. I am not an individual who supports political correctness but I believe these issues need to be addressed in their own right and before giving the book a perfect five stars."},{"Title":"Atheist Universe Chapter 2 Interview with an Atheist","review":"I originally read the paperback version of Atheist Universe about six months ago, but I didn't post a review at that time since innumerable others had already sung the praises of this exceptional volume. I believe, however, that I am the first to review the new CD audio book version, which I purchased when it became available on Amazon last week.The CD is read by David Mills, the author, but his manner of speaking is so natural and animated that, had I not possessed the printed book before me, I would have assumed he was speaking extemporaneously. I now understand why Mills refused to farm this job out to some hired studio actor. He does a fabulous job and is extremely persuasive in his argumentation!The CD covers Chapter 2, \\"Interview with an Atheist.\\" Mills addresses all the questions commonly posed to atheists. His \\"adversary\\" in the interview is a pleasant but intensely focused female attempting to trip Mills up. There is only one CD in the package, but it contains more meat than some 8-CD packages I've purchased for ten times the price. Interestingly, this audio CD is housed in a DVD case, so that a larger, detailed insert may accompany the CD, providing precise Track locations (minutes and seconds) of each question that is asked. This handy list of questions and answers on the CD enhanced the pleasure of listening and made it extremely easy to replay noteworthy sections -- and there were many!I thoroughly enjoyed and learned MUCH from this CD, even though I had already read the printed version. I would highly recommend this CD for atheists, agnostics, skeptics of all flavors, and even to believers who simply want to hear an articulate spokesman defend a controversial and misunderstood position. My only complaint is that this is a highly abridged version. If you want a meticulously detailed rebuttal of Christian belief, then you'll probably want to buy the printed version. If you love audio books as I do, then this one is unique and one that you'll play over and over -- then share with friends."},{"Title":"Atheist Universe Chapter 2 Interview with an Atheist","review":"David Mills's direct, down to earth style of writing makes this book a must read for Freethinkers and Religionists alike. I rate this book in the same class as Dan Barker's Loosing Faith in Faith and George H. Smith's Atheism: The Case Against God.David Miller gives us more than just the reasons why Intelligent Design belongs on a dunghill. Mr. Miller reminds us that even if one entertains the possibility of the biblical account of the origin of life then one is also obliged to accept as truth all the supernatural occurrences in the bible. Are their any sensible person today that holds as truth that:2 Kings 13:21A dead body is brought to life when it accidentally touches the bones of Elisha.2 Kings 2:8When Elijah needs to cross a river, he just smacks the water with his magic mantle and crosses on dry landNumbers 21:6God sends \\"fiery serpents\\" to bite his chosen people, and many of them dieLuke 11:14People who cannot speak are possessed with devils.Luke 13 11-16Illnesses are caused by SatanIn light of all the other absurdities in the bible how the heck do people give any credibility to an invisible spook that spends a week creating our universe????.......Thank you David miller and keep up the good work."},{"Title":"Atheist Universe Chapter 2 Interview with an Atheist","review":"A wonderful interview.

Isaac was aquainted with Abe Lincoln for over a quarter century, and that helped him in completing this wonderful biography. It does, however, lack several important facts that have now been discovered. Since Mr. Arnold wrote his book twenty years after Lincoln's death, the United States didnt have time to realize what an amazing and influential person Lincoln was. New data also shows that some of his facts in the book are proven to be wrong. Even with those minor details that are false, it doesnt take away from the intensity of the book. Being able to read his speeches and visualize Lincoln speaking is amazing and Mr. Arnold does a very good job of painting that picture."},{"Title":"The life of Abraham Lincoln","review":"As stated elsewhere, this biography has the asset of being written by a personal friend and colleague of Lincoln. The personal reminscences and portrayal of Lincoln and his characteristics are very good. By knowing and working wth Lincoln during his Presidency as well as in Illinois, the book is much stronger on the Civil War years than HERNDON'S LIFE OF LINCOLN (and thus more knowledgeable of Lincoln's evolution). The book discusses Lincoln's work with Congress to pass the 13th Amendment (outlawing slavery) far more than other bios and though such detail may disinterest the general reader, this accomplishment by Lincoln surpassed the Emancipation Proclamation in results. Surprisingly, though heavier on the politics, the book covers the Civil War's fighting pretty well. Of course, almost all 1 volume Lincoln biographies are noticeably flawed, and in this one, there is a big flop by the book virtually ignoring discussion of Lincoln's family during the White House years (Mary is discussed sympathetically as a widow). But if it is Lincoln the Politician, President, or friend, that interests you, this is pretty good."},{"Title":"The life of Abraham Lincoln","review":"If you like history and biographies and like to have them be real - such as, the person who wrote this actually knew the person he/she was writing about in real life and wasn't just presenting a biography that happened to fit with and promote their own worldview- then this is a great book for you. It's style, of course, is somewhat old-fashioned - but that, in itself, is entertaining. The content is great - full of amazing facts and anecdotes about President Lincoln's life, beliefs and worldview, etc. My husband and I both really enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"System Identification: Theory for the User (2nd Edition)","review":"An excellent textbook for engineers, and a necessary reference for Matlab toolbox (System Identification)."},{"Title":"System Identification: Theory for the User (2nd Edition)","review":"Let me be the first to slam this book as having little practical use. The author uses a very unconventional, inconsistent notation that renders this book virtually unreadable. This is coming from somebody who has taken various courses in probability/stochastic processes, system dynamics, controls, and Kalman filtering.The \\"theory\\" part in the title is dead on, but what about the \\"for the user\\" part? What user is this referring to, an ivory tower professor? Most of the problems at the end of each chapter begin with \\"prove\\", which in my opinion makes this a math book and not an engineering text. A practical example never surfaces in the text."},{"Title":"System Identification: Theory for the User (2nd Edition)","review":"This book is very through in presenting methods of system identification...mathematically. However as with most good mathematical oriented books there are not a lot of practical design type problems. One other mark aginst the book is that similar notation is used for different topics, which can sometimes be a bit confusing. One thing I might recommend, to a potential buyer is that you take a course in random process, and possess a through understanding of signals and transforms. All in all though if a little more meat in terms of practicality were added I'd rate this book a five."},{"Title":"System Identification: Theory for the User (2nd Edition)","review":"I have two system identification books on my table right now: One is by Prof Ljung and the other is 'Time Series: Theory and Methods' by Profs. Brockwell and Davis, and I must say that I refer to the latter much more often than the former. The primary reason for this is that Prof. Ljung's book uses notation very inconsistently. This makes for very difficult reading. On the other hand 'Time Series: T&M;' is consistent and an excellent resource. Both books are of an advanced nature, suitable for graduate students. Again, 'Time Series T&M;' is more rigorous.Nonetheless, if you plan on using Matlab's Sys Id toolbox, I would recommend Prof. Ljung's book. He wrote the toolbox, and he refers heavily in the Matlab documentation to the book."},{"Title":"System Identification: Theory for the User (2nd Edition)","review":"I have taught system identification at graduate level for over 15 years. Ljung's System Identification is my first choice as a thorough reference book. However, I have still to find a person who finds the book helpful to the beginner. If you are looking for a text-book to teach system identification to beginners or if you are such a beginner, even at a graduate level, you better look for something more readable. On the other hand, keep Ljung's book handy, it will be hard to find a topic in LINEAR system identification which is not covered by this book. As for readability, I would give it one or two (max) stars (and the second edition improved on the first!). As for thoroughness, it is a five-star book."},{"Title":"System Identification: Theory for the User (2nd Edition)","review":"Contrary to other reviewers, I have used this book for very PRACTICAL USER applications. Yes, the book is \\"heavy\\" in mathematical proofs and the notation will keep you focused. However, you do not need the proofs to apply the material. They are there for those (I am NOT one of them) who would like to read/understand them. PRACTICAL System Identification is by its nature an application of stable recursive computations and thus is indeed \\"heavy\\" in mathematics. I applied very successfully the recursive methods, which I studied in the first edition of this book, in my early System Identification Control projects. Was it easy? No, not by any means. It took some very careful studying and very careful programming of the recursive least square algorithms. Then, with the advent of the Matlab System Identification Toolbox, the topic of system identification (using Ljung's 2nd edition of \\"System Identification: Theory for the User\\") became indeed very accessible for the USER. Yes, you will need to have a relative good understanding of Stochastic Processes. However, since the topic of system ID is graduate material, I would anticipate that most readers will have studied stochastic processes as part of their undergrad studies.Many years ago I was so fortunate to be able to attend a Matlab organized conference in Boston near MIT. As part of this conference a System ID Toolbox workshop was given by Prof. Ljung. It was this workshop, this Toolbox and this text, that took systems ID from my \\"basement\\" levels to the very applied levels. Even though I am now retired, I still spend most my days trying to keep up with the advances in Control Systems. I gave my old copy of this book to an ex-colleague.

Go get it, and you won't regret it!.."},{"Title":"Crossfire Trail","review":"When it comes to reading Louis L'Amour the modern western fan is faced with having to take things in context. Remember that L'Amour's works were primarily written in the fifties and sixties and, as a result, have a certain &quot;dignity&quot; about them that no longer applies with the westerns of today, especially those on the big screen.Take CROSSFIRE TRAIL for example. There is plenty of action here but it is painted much more subtly on L'Amour's canvass than, let's say, on those of Larry McMurtry or on Clint Eastwood's or Kevin Costner's movie screens. Frankly L'Amour or his readers would not have tolerated the raw, often harsh violence of today's western s offerings.L'Amour wrote with a clear sense of nostalgia and romance about the west. He was much for the kindred spirit of John Wayne and John Ford than of McMurtry, Eastwood or Costner.I thoroughly enjoyed CROSSFIRE TRAIL, a tale of revenge, deceit and, as is the case with all L'Amour tales, of ultimate white-hatted triumph and justice. The fan of the movie of the same title, starring Tom Selleck, should note that there are some differences between the screenplay and the book. But all in all the story is the same and is just as enjoyable in print as the story told on the big screen. Read it in the correct mindset and you have a masterpiece.Douglas McAllister"},{"Title":"Crossfire Trail","review":"Louis L'Amour often wrote novels of men whose strength of character was their best redeeming quality although they were handy with guns and were rough and tough when it mattered. Rafe Caradec's promise to a dying man kicks off this tale that begins on a ship and plays out in Wyoming amid lawless men and unfriendly Indians. The story has touches of romance and plenty of shootouts and fistfights, and as usual, the bad guys get what's coming to them. Caradec does seem to good to be true but the tale is a good read and ranks as one of his best western yarns."},{"Title":"Crossfire Trail","review":"Louis L'Amour may not have had the prettiest writing style but his westerns had such an easy and relatable accessability to them that readers readily snapped them up. And, actually, L'Amour's love of the wild west and the old frontier was so palpable that many passages of his novels did end up reading like poetry. I've read most of his stuff and, bar none, this guy is my favorite writer of westerns (well, okay, Zane Grey, as well). CROSSFIRE TRAIL is just one sample of L'Amour's ability to transport the reader back to the old west, when your word meant a whole lot more, when men were hardy (and probably very dusty) and a trusty horse and a well-oiled pistol determined life or death. I'm sure things weren't so black and white back then or that simple, but L'Amour drew a clear line between the dastardly and the heroic. And, always, always, he told an exciting story.L'Amour's protagonists are basically all cut from the same mold. Much like how one takes it for granted that mystery author Dick Francis's heroes are inevitably urbane, unassuming, and grittily resolute in the face of adversity, Louis L'Amour almost without exception writes his leading men as lean, tall, strong, upright and very capable. They're all heller with a gun, peerless in a brawl and savvy in the ways of the west. Rafe Caradec, the central character of CROSSFIRE TRAIL, fits all this to a T. In the parlance of his time, Caradec is a man to ride the river with.CROSSFIRE TRAIL was published in 1954, and it's a testament to L'Amour's skills and timeless appeal that this story doesn't at all read as dated. It's a fast-paced story of survival in the wilderness and a reckoning in Wyoming. Rafe Caradec, on the surface, is a rough sort, skilled with a gun and with his fists. A man of commanding presence, he escapes from forced shipboard labor, vowing to keep a promise he made to Charles Rodney, a dead friend left behind. Rafe makes his way to Wyoming, set on looking up and protecting Rodney's family and wresting back Rodney's ranch, of which ownership is currently in question. In the tiny cowtown of Painted Rock, Rafe Caradec runs into a world of trouble.He learns quickly that Painted Rock is controlled by a gang of scoundrels and stone cold killers. Worse, the gang's conniving head honcho, Bruce Barkow, is engaged to Rodney's beautiful daughter, Ann. Worse than that? Ann doesn't at all believe Rafe's story and instead suspects that Rafe is out to get the ranch for himself. But Rafe is not without unexpected facets. He's able to buffalo the thugs with mere talk (even if it's talk bolstered by the threat of imminent violence). In a courtroom scene, he smoothly acquits himself from a charge of murder. Gradually, Rafe begins to turn the tide. And, naturally, Bruce Barkow, slated initially as the book's prohibitive Big Bad, persists in resorting to underhanded means. But someone lurks in the wings and, as it turns out, this hombre is a lot worse and far more frightening than Barkow.To add more texture to the thing, the Sioux hover somewhere in the backdrop and there's the mystery of why Barkow so covets Rodney's land. CROSSFIRE TRAIL, like most of L'Amour's novels, reads like a bullet and offers plenty of Rafe Caradec bracing his enemies, resulting in blazing gunplay and a hellacious brawl or two or three. And while L'Amour never was one to get muddied too much in epic love story, he does throw in the occasional romantic spark. Let's just say, it's not too long before Ann Rodney begins to have serious misgivings about her shifty fiance.No surprises in this book, as CROSSFIRE TRAIL isn't really Louis L'Amour at his tiptop best. But nonetheless this is a pretty riveting no-frills read, and it's a lot of fun watching the dangerous Rafe Caradec outtalking, outthinking, and outfighting those what done him and his friends wrong. Reading Louis L'Amour's vivid descriptions of the lay of the land and the people inhabiting it, you can't help but soak in the old west atmosphere and the rugged culture. As usual, L'Amour tacks descriptive sobriquets onto several of his characters (Texas Brisco, Bully Borger, Gee Bonaro, Trigger Boyne), catchy nicknames being an element prevalent in the western mythos. And, as well, the occasional homespun vernacular lends one more touch of authenticity. I've said this elsewhere, there's Zane Grey and there's Louis L'Amour. In my eyes, every other western writer takes a back seat."},{"Title":"Crossfire Trail","review":"&quot;Law was still largely a local matter&quot;.

(it makes me cry every time) Although it may seem like just a book about some dog and he gets ina fight with a coyote. Big whoop. But it's Not! It's the great story about a boy and his great loving dog! It includes how important pets are, even though they may just seem like pointless little animals. And you grow to love Old Yeller, and if something should ever happen to him, you would cry bitter tears!

The power of friendship is also shown in this book. It show that your best friend doesn't have to be human to be your best friend. To me Old Yeller was an average childrens story.

To my amazement they had never even heard of OLD YELLER. Now, middle school students can be the toughest audience in the world but THEY LOVED THIS BOOK.Author Fred Gipson perfectly captures the time period of Texas in the late 1800's and the challenges of daily life. Into the mix of chores and adventures on the farm is the universal bond of a boy and his dog. Travis and Old Yeller are two characters that any child will immediately connect with and grow to love. And naturally as many novels geared towards younger readers, the conclusion will remain with them long after the novel has been read.On a side note I must also recommend the classic Walt Disney version of OLD YELLER (VHS or DVD). Young readers will enjoy the similarities and differences between novel and movie. It's an excellent example to build discussion or writing lessons involving comparisons or contrasts.And while I have continually mentioned young readers I should also comment that OLD YELLER is a must-read for people of any age group.

It tells about a fourteen year old boy named Travis who was left in charge of his family and the farm while his papa was away on a cattle drive. One day an old yeller dog shows up and steals some meat and wrecks the fence. At first Travis is ready to shoot the dog, but his little brother didn't let him. Travis really wanted a horse not a big ugly slick-haired yeller dog with a chewed off ear and a stub tail. Travis comes to love and depend on Old Yeller.

He looks after his mother and his little brother, Arliss. While his dad is gone a dog shows up. He's an ugly Yeller dog, and yet the decided to keep him.

I'm going to stop right there, and hope you pick this book up and read it."},{"Title":"Old Yeller (A Literature unit)","review":"What made me choose this book is the movie. I saw the movie and I really liked it so I thought the book would be good too.What I thought the book would be about is a boy and his dog doing things together like hunting. I felt sad for Old Yeller, Travis, Arliss, and Ma because of what happend. The book was what I expected it to be. I still feel the same about the book.The main characters in the story are Old Yeller, Travis, Arliss, and Ma. It takes place in the late 1860's, in Birdsong Creek in the hills of Texas. When Pa goes away to Abline,Kansas to give cattle to the market for money, while Travis, Arliss and Ma are left to take care of things. One night this old yeller dog ate some meat of theirs and Travis got real mad at him. Little Arliss wanted to keep him and he got to because Travis had a dog when he was younger. One day when Arliss gets into a dangerous situtation with a bear Old Yeller saves him. After that Travis likes old Yeller better. Later they start doing things together and become best friends until one day changes it all. The type of book that this is is a historical fiction. These things could happen in real life but they didn't. The author of this book is Fred Gipson. I found the book exicting because of all the things that happen ,like the bear attack, and I found it sweet too because Old Yeller would do anything to help and protect the family. I would recomend the book to other readers because it's a good book. The age group that I think is approite for this book it ages eight and up. If you like exicting books this is the one for you!"},{"Title":"Old Yeller (A Literature unit)","review":"I liked Old Yeller because it is about a young boy whosedad goes away leaves him in charge.

At first they dont get along but then the dog saves his brothers life.The worst part of the book is when the wild boars catch the dog and slashed his side open. The slash in his side revealed his enternal organs. This leaves him two choices either patch him up or kill him.The setting is the most illustrated part of this book. It makes you feel as if you are out west killng and growing what you eat.The description of the wild life is so realistic it seems to walk out of the book."},{"Title":"Old Yeller (A Literature unit)","review":"Alexandra Y 10/25/02Reading Response #5Old Yeller By Fred GipsonI think that Old Yeller is a good book. There are many carefully described details and thoughtful characters. This book is about a 14-year old boy named Travis who becomes the \\"man\\" of his family. While his father is gone, Travis becomes friends with an old, yellow dog who shows up at their cabin. He doesn't like this dog at all until something bad happens to his brother, Arliss and Old Yeller comes to the rescue. This book is filled with friendship, happiness, excitement, and sadness, which reminds me of the movie Shiloh.Old Yeller takes place in the Texas hills during the 1860's. The setting is very important because it shows how hard it was to manage living. For example, they didn't have soap back then. They would have to mix lye water with hog fat and boil it. The setting also explains that they lived in the country area and had to prepare very hard each year for the comings of winter. This is one reason why they needed a dog to help. Luckily, Old Yeller joined the family and helped along!If I could meet the author, Fred Gipson, I would ask him many questions. Was he the first author to write about a boy and a dog's friendship? Did many people copy his idea because they liked his book? Or did he get his plot idea from another author? Also, I would ask him if this story is true. While reading Old Yeller, I felt as if it really happened because of the wonderful details. I think it would be quite amazing if this plot weren't a true story because I felt that Old Yeller is very realistic and I felt very close to the characters. They have unique personalities.Old Yeller reminds me of life in the world. Like the world, this book has sadness, joy, happiness, problems, and pain. In the world there are a lot pain, like when Old Yeller repeatedly gets hit by a rock. I think this is one of the reasons why this book is so interesting to read.Old Yeller is a great book. I think that it was a good idea for this book to get a Newbury Honor. I recommend Old Yeller to everyone who likes A Day No Pigs Would Die by R. Peck. Both books are about an animal that becomes an important part of the main character's lives."},{"Title":"Old Yeller (A Literature unit)","review":"This story about a family surviving after the Civil War.

As he sat on the fence the bulls pushed through the fence and got caught in an iron tire the bulls ran away.Travis laughed and laughed to see such tough bulls get scared and run.I would recommend this story to anyone that likes dogs.

When Travis's father leaves unavoidably, Travis becomes the man of the house, with burdens that modern readers will marvel over. Old Yeller helps Travis to get through a number of tough spots, including a battle between two mad bulls, a skirmish with wild hogs, and a bear attack. But when Travis hears about an onset of \\"hydrophobia\\" among the local wildlife, he can't be prepared for the toll that it will take on him and his family.Modern readers of all ages can thrill in the stories of children living on the wild frontier. With the wildest frontier times a full century behind us, there's still something that resonates within everyone who cares to read about that exciting time in history. Gipson has captured that magic perfectly.The Disney movie version, produced decades after this book, has not aged nearly as well as the original book has. Scenes that seem cheesy on screen are still powerful and immediate in the book (which was always better anyhow).I highly recommend this captivating tale, along with the Little House on the Prairie Books and \\"The Day No Pigs Would Die,\\" by Peck."},{"Title":"Old Yeller (A Literature unit)","review":"This classic is a real tear jerker.

Money was running a bit shaort and the only way to make money would be to sell some of their cattle for what they call \\"Cash Money\\", and so Pa gathered up some of his cattle for a long trip to Kansas. Since he wasn't going to be around to do all the men's work around the farm, he made Travis the man of the house, which is a BIG responsibility back then, and Pa suggested that to make things easier around the farm was to get a good dog. But Travis didn't think about wanting a dog, he wanted a horse. So a few days pass, since Pa left and that's when Old yeller came, he was caught eating some met that was left outside to dry. Arliss immediately fell in love with the dog, but Travis couldn't stand the dog. But more in the book Travis and Old yeller work together as a great team, keeping up on the farm, watching out for raccoons in the corn patch, and helping with many other projects that must be done on the farm.What I liked about this book was how the writer made Travis describe Old Yeller when he first came, \\"He was a big ugly slick-haired yeller dog. One short ear had been chewed off and his tail had been bobbed so close to his rump that there was hardly stub enough to wag.\\" What I also liked was how Arliss kept going in the drinking water, and Travis would always get mad at him and scare him to where Arliss would run screaming to the house. There is also a bunch of action-packed scenes that make you actually want to be there when it was happening, a bull fight for example. The author describes the scene so well that you could actually see the fight going on!"},{"Title":"Old Yeller (A Literature unit)","review":"I gave it 4 stars because it was a good book.

But his dad his dad said that he needs to find a good trustwerthey dog first. well his dad leaves and he is the man of the house. After a few days along came a dog and Travis desided to keep it and he called it Old Yeller because it was a yellow dog.

I really enjoyed reading Old Yeller and I hope you enjoy it too."},{"Title":"Old Yeller (A Literature unit)","review":"The book is about a wonderful dog named Old Yeller. The book is a little too violent with things such as: bull fights, hog attacks, etc., but the good deeds of the dog Old Yeller make this story seem special. In the beginning the dog did not seem so good. He did things like bark, yell, and steal meat, but then the good part comes out when he saves lives. I feel some of the really violent things could have been eliminated because they make this story scary. At the chapter before the last, a mad loafer wolf wants to attack Travis's family, so Old Yeller goes and fights the wolf. The sad thing is that poor Old Yeller catches rabies from this wolf. It turns out that Old Yeller sacrifices his life for his owners.This part really does make you feel sad, but if you like stories about kind animal acts, and you do not get scared easily, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Old Yeller (A Literature unit)","review":"Old yeller is a book in the 1800's.In the book there is a 14 year old boy named Travis.His dad is leaving to go fight in the Civil War and hes leaving Travis in charge.Taking care of his little brother Arliss was like another chore that Travis had to do.When Travis was younger he had a dog named Bell.

Old Yeller is an exciting novel that people of all ages will enjoy.One thing that was very good about this book was that it was very descriptive. For instance one time Travis catches Little Arliss in the water hole again and yells at him the book describes Little Arliss's reaction as \\"Arliss saw then that I meant business. He came lunging up out of the pool, knocking water all over his clothes lying on the bank. He lit out for the house, running naked and screaming bloody murder. To listen to him, you'd have thought the Comanche's were lifting his scalp. And when he was describing one of the bulls, before the bulls started to fight, he said \\"He was a leggy, mustard-colored bull with black freckles speckling his jaws and the underside of his belly. He had one great horn set for hooking, while the other hung down past his jaw like a tallow candle that had drooped in the heat. He was what the Mexicans called a chongo or droop horn.\\" The book also uses great description when Travis is hunting, for the deer.Another thing that I really liked about this book was how the author used sayings and similes that made you feel like you were in Texas in the 1860's. For instance when Travis is talking about how he wanted to see the bulls fight for a long time, he said \\"I'd wanted to see this since I was knee high to a grass hopper.\\" And when he was describing the chongo's horn before the fight, he said \\"it hung down past his jaw, like a tallow candle that had drooped in the heat.\\" Or when he was describing how his brother squealed, he said \\"you'd have thought the Comanche's were lifting his scalp\\".The other thing that I thought was really interesting about the book was the development of the relationship between Old Yeller and Travis. In the beginning Travis finds Old Yeller lying over the half eaten bones of the Deer he had just stolen from the family. The Little Arliss falls in love with him and insists that they should keep him. Then Old Yeller scars away the bulls, and gets in the watering hole, and hates Old Yeller even more. But then Old Yeller saves Little Arliss from the bear, and he starts to like Old Yeller, for he did owe his little brothers life to that dog. Then they just get closer and closer until Old Yeller got into the fight with the rabid wolf and got rabies, so Travis had to do the hardest thing he had ever done, and shot his loyal friend.Old Yeller is a very exciting book that I would recommend to anybody. The book is thrilling and will touch anybody's heart. So if you are looking for a good book to read, go to your library and get Old Yeller.N. LENIX"},{"Title":"Old Yeller (A Literature unit)","review":"Old Yeller is about how a young boy named Travis changes through the love of a dog. The boy finds this ugly, stray mutt that steals food and is very self centered, according to Travis. Travis has to take over the role of being the man of the house. He thinks it is difficult at first, but when Old Yeller comes into their lives, Travis' job becomes easier. They have a few amazing adventures and one almost cost their lives. Old Yeller saves Travis' family many times, but can Travis save his heroic dog?At first, Travis doesn't know how to be a man. When Old Yeller enters his life he changes into a man. In the beginning when Travis first finds Old Yeller he tried to make excuses to his mother to kill the dog. By the end of the book, Travis loves Old Yeller and they were unbreakable. Old Yeller taught Travis patience.The setting of the book is what is knows as \\"the wild west\\". This was when there was so much free land that people thought having a neighbor living five miles away was close. A person would raise their own food and do a lot of physical labor. You have to go to the wilderness to hunt for food and there are no supermarkets. There's a saying that goes with the setting for this book: \\"it's a dog eat dog world\\" meaning that if you don't fight to survive, you won't survive.I would recommend this book to everyone who likes a heroic dog story. It also is very good at showing how a boy can change throughout his childhood. I give this book a high recommendation because I would like to pass on its glory. I wouldn't recommned this people who don't like sad stories because this is a major sad story.I really hope you will read Old Yeller by Fred Gipson. Remember that! This book is a heartbreaking dog story. All dog lovers must read this book. That is a request and a requirement.W.J."},{"Title":"Old Yeller (A Literature unit)","review":"Title:OLD YELLER by Fred GipsonMain Characters:Travis:A fourteen year old boy.When Travis saw Old Yeller,right away he despised him,but as Travis hung around him more,he realized he was way better than he thought.Sooner or later Travis and Old Yeller become best friends.Old Yeller:Old Yeller is a dog with dingy,short,yellow hair.He's also a clever,smart,strong,and courageous dog.He proves that he can protect Travis and his family from anything.Plot:When Travis found out they were keeping the dog,he was disgusted.They found him on Birdsong Creek where Travis and his family lives.At first he thought Old Yeller was ugly and a thieving rascal,but then Old Yeller was a big help around the frontier and Travis started to ultimately trust him.Old Yeller then gets very ill and Travis doesn't want the sickness to run through the family.He decides that it is best to put Old Yeller down.Theme:I think the book is telling you to not judge anyone before you don't even get to know them.Sooner or later you could become the best of friends.Iloved this book because it's adventurous and very sad.Right away when I started to cry,I knew it was a good book.No wonder it got an award."},{"Title":"Old Yeller (A Literature unit)","review":"Old Yeller written by Fred Gipson is a fun book for kids. I liked this book because it was full of action and was really good. One reason I like this book is because I thought the author Fred Gipson shows the characters and plot in good ways. He doesn't give things away it's like you don't want to stop reading. When it's time to stop the characters start something exciting again. When I first got the book it started out slowly but then it gained action and I couldn't stop reading it. The book was becoming full of action. It made me visualize parts of the plot. One of younger characters is just like my brother. They even had the same personalities... they both like the same thing. Lastly, I liked the book for the quality ... Fred Gipson did a great job on writing Old Yeller. Gipson especially did a good job on characters and plot. As the story ends, it turns dark and gloomy for one of the characters ...nothing cheered him up. There was only one thing that cheered him up. It was a present ...and it reminded him of the thing he lost.Tyler"},{"Title":"Old Yeller (A Literature unit)","review":"I think that Old Yeller is a good book. This book is about a 14-year old boy named Travis who becomes the \\"man\\" of his family. While his father is gone, Travis becomes friends with an old, yellow dog who shows up at their cabin. He doesn't like this dog at all until something bad happens to his brother, Arliss and Old Yeller comes to the rescue. This book is filled with friendship, happiness, excitement, and sadness, which reminds me of the movie the Dead Poets' Society.Old Yeller takes place in the Texas hills during the 1860's. The setting is very important because it shows how hard it was to manage living there. For example, they didn't have soap back then. They would have to mix lye water with hog fat and boil it. The setting also explains that they lived in the country area and had to prepare very hard each year for the coming of winter. This is one reason why they needed a dog to help. Luckily, Old Yeller joined the family and helped along!If I could meet the author, Fred Gipson, I would ask him many questions. Was he the first author to write about a boy and a dog's friendship? Did many people copy his idea because they liked his book? Or did he get his plot idea from another author? Also, I would ask him if this story is true. While reading Old Yeller, I felt as if it really happened because of the wonderful details. I think it would be quite amazing if this plot weren't a true story because I felt that Old Yeller is very realistic and I felt very close to the characters. They have unique personalities.Old Yeller reminds me of life in the world. Like the world, this book has sadness, happiness, and pain. In the world there is a lot pain, like when Old Yeller gets hit by a rock. I think this is one of the reasons why this book is so interesting to read. Old Yeller is a great book. I think that this book would be loved by people who are interested in relationships between the animals and humans."},{"Title":"Old Yeller (A Literature unit)","review":"Old Yeller is a delightful story about a boy and his dog.

This book was mostly unexciting, but Old Yeller's fate was a bit sad.

It really says something about a book if it can be thoroughly enjoyed by a 4-year-old boy, who probably identifies more with Arliss than Travis, as well his middle-aged Papa.The language and detail of the book marks it as authentic; one gets the sense that the book was written as an autobiography, though it wasn't. Like the Little House books--although, arguably, better in this regard--it immerses the young reader in a time and place, impressing upon one just how important the details of place were when people lived \\"close to the land.\\"The lovely thing about this book is that it wonderfully develops the relationship between the boys and their dog, who turns out to be a canine hero. While this might sound banal or silly, the book is really anything but; it is great literature and seems perfectly realistic. It captures some of the best aspects of boyhood (and the realities of frontier life).This is the sort of book that a zillion would-be \\"literary\\" entries lamely attempt to imitate. It is an enjoyable, fulfilling experience instead of a dry intellectual exercise."},{"Title":"Old Yeller (A Literature unit)","review":"Old Yeller is a great book for dog lovers.

And then we walk with Travis through the heart-wrenching realization that he alone is the one to give old yeller that final moment.Your heart will race with excitement and break with tears as you follow the tale of this young man learning about love and responsibility in the brutal world of the old West. This book is among ones that should be required reading in every elementary school in our country.Walt Disney made a fine adaptation of this tale but the book itself lends far more to the reader and will last longer in his or her heart.

It was such a good book!!!!"},{"Title":"Old Yeller (A Literature unit)","review":"Travis Coates is a 14-year-old boy, left alone to protect his mother and younger brother on his family's 19th-century Texas homestead. When his father goes on a trip leaving him to \\"act a man's part,\\" he throws himself into his new responsibilities. But the challenges of feeding and protecting his family prove to be greater than his boy's abilities, and he comes to depend on and love the stray dog which adopts their family.The story follows chapter after chapter of gritty, riveting and often funny adventures as the family wrestles out a living from the land, dealing with angry bulls, thieving coons, an enraged bear, vicious javelinas, and an outbreak of \\"hydrophobia\\" (rabies). Through these challenges, Travis grows to fill his father's shoes while Yeller makes himself indispensible, saving the family member's lives time upon time. In the culmination of the story, Yeller is bitten while fighting off a rabies-infected wolf that had attacked Travis's mother. Realizing the bite of the wolf is fatal, and that Yeller will become a danger to the family before he dies, Travis kills him.It is important to note that Travis is not forced to kill his beloved dog. He is quick to see that Yeller has been infected with rabies, and (unlike Jody in The Yearling) he does not deny that his dog is a danger to the family. Although he loves Yeller, he knows his responsibility is first toward his mother and brother. Although his mother offers to do it for him, he quickly and resolutely pays the price to protect his family. This self-sacrifice is exactly the kind of character quality our children ought to see as normal, and Travis's decision grows out of the his emerging character. It is an extraordinary act of moral courage, but it comes at the end of a story filled with ordinary acts of responsibility. In this outstanding coming-of-age story, Travis's manhood is achieved at great cost, and in this cost he proves his worth as a man."},{"Title":"Old Yeller (A Literature unit)","review":"I give Old Yeller five stars. The author of this book is Fred Gipson. Fred Gipson didn't write any other books but if he did Old Yeller would be my favorite book. This book is non fiction. The book theme is never get too attached with your dog you never know what's going to happen.The author's writing style is sad but still interesting it also makes you want to turn the page as soon as possible. The main characters are little Arlis, Travis, mama, and my favorite character is Travis.In the book the main characters live in Texas and they live in a little cabin type house like back in the olden days. The most exciting part to me was when Travis was about to be killed by hogs then old yeller came in and saved him. But can Travis save Old Yeller?I recommend this book to people who like to read sad but still scary at the same time. This book will put you on the edge of your seat.

I should think of Old Yeller as being in touch with nature, and when Fred Gipson writes about Hill Country of Texas, he makes the area more fun to live in although living in it can be physically demanding. He also delivers the characterization very well for each of the characters except for the father which is understandable. One thing I immediately notice in Old Yeller is the rugged attitude conveyed by the main character Travis which gives the book a very different feel. This helped to elevate Old Yeller into a different territory because Fred Gipson allows no prisoners to be taken throughout the story. And when I write that, I mean there is a lot of animal killing going on. It's not that it is ethically wrong, but we are talking about the story taking place during the nineteen century post Civil-War. That being noticed, the time period puts Old Yeller into a different perspective. Of course, the relationship between Little Arliss and Old Yeller and then the dog with Travis go a long way and serve as the cornerstone of the book as well.

This Story is a classic that completely captures the time period and setting of which it is based (1800's). Travis is a very strong young man who becomes the \\"Man of the house\\" while his father is away. Travis and his brother grow fond of a dog, \\"Old Yeller\\" after at first, not wanting it to be around. This book is very touching and will help any child who needs to better understand the concepts of love and death. Great story.-rac3301"},{"Title":"Old Yeller (A Literature unit)","review":"Old Yeller is a beautiful story about a boy and a dog. When they first meet they do not think they will be friends. However, over time they come to genuinely care for one another. Travis is a boy who has to grow up really quickly and Old Yeller needs a home. Although Travis does not realize it on their first encounter, he needs Old Yeller as much as Old Yeller needs him. They have many adventures together that really show that dog really is man's best friend.This is a wonderful book that can be enjoyed by both male and female of all ages. It gives a great lesson about how life is not always fair, but one must live life to the fullest and not dwell in the past. This book will make you smile, laugh and cry. It is captivating and makes you not want to put it down. crm3301"},{"Title":"Old Yeller (A Literature unit)","review":"Do they get any sadder than this story? It's the story of a family, trying to survive in the wilds of 1870 Texas while the head-of-the-household is off herding cattle, who takes up with an old ugly mutt. The older son, Travis, is trying to protect his mother and little brother from wild bulls and boar coons and bears and sickness and hunger. In the process the family comes to love an old good-for-nothing dog. (And you know what happens....I'm not giving anything away, right?) The death of Old Yeller has to be one of the most painful scenes in childhood literature."},{"Title":"Old Yeller (A Literature unit)","review":"I am a grandmother of four who loves educational books that combine history with a great story. Old Yeller provides children with the insight of what it was like to live in the days of horse pulled wagons, early farming, and living in the wilderness. In addition, Old Yeller tells the story of a young boy meeting the challenge of taking on his fathers responsibilities while his father is away and about the dog who helps him. You may be searching for books that capture your children's attention because they do not like to read and you may also tend to seek books filled with sarcastic phrases, double meanings, slang, etc. to entice your non-reader into reading. Keep the faith! There are classic stories out there that also target these children and Old Yeller is one of them. This book is best enjoyed in a cozy surrounding, just you and the kids. Read the story to your children and have them return the favor. No gadget, computerized instrument, or cartooned book will ever replace a classic Like Old Yeller."},{"Title":"Old Yeller (A Literature unit)","review":"Travis Coates, fourteen years old, lives with his Papa, Mama, and five-year-old brother Little Arliss, near Salt Licks, TX, in the late 1860s during the days following the Civil War. Papa has to go away with other local ranchers to take their cattle to Abilene, KS, and leaves Travis in charge. Travis hopes that Papa will bring him back a horse, but before he leaves Papa tells Travis that what he really needs is a good dog. However, Travis had recently lost his dog Bell after it was bit by a rattlesnake and really doesn't want another dog. Then this big, ugly, yellow dog shows up and steals some of their meat. They call him \\"Old Yeller.\\"At first, Travis can't stand the sight of Old Yeller. But he sure is a clever dog that can be a big help on the wild Texas frontier. He saves Little Arliss from a she bear. He helps Travis catch a wild turkey. He gentles their milk heifer Spot. And he's good at catching the hogs that run loose to get them marked. Travis grows to love the dog. Old Yeller proves that he can protect Travis's family from any sort of danger. But with the threat of hydrophobia (rabies) in the area, can Travis do the same for Old Yeller? One of my favorite childhood memories is the 1957 Walt Disney film based on this Newbery Honor winning book. There are minor differences between novel and film, but it really was one of Disney's better efforts at turning a book into a movie.We did Old Yeller as a family read aloud, and everyone enjoyed it. Yes, it's a little sad at the end, but it has been called one of the best \\"boy-and-his-dog\\" books ever written. The Saturday Review of Literature said, \\"A bestseller for generations, the combination of excellent writing and the sensitivity to human emotions places it on a shelf with the classics in juvenile literature.\\" The only language issue is that once the phrase \\"O my Lord\\" appears as an interjection. Yeller's puppy becomes the title character of the 1962 sequel, Savage Sam, which also became a Walt Disney film in 1962. Two other related books by Gibson are Curly and the Wild Boar and Little Arliss."},{"Title":"Old Yeller (A Literature unit)","review":"I read this book the first time when I was a kid, I read it to my children, and I bought this copy to put in my library for my grandchildren to find and enjoy. It's a fine story - the best of its genre that I know of. Mr. Gipson was a true outdoorsman, and his love for the Central Texas wilderness and for good dogs, and his understanding of boys and their view of the world is expressed on every page."},{"Title":"Old Yeller (A Literature unit)","review":"I know that this was made into a movie but I am not sure that I have seen it. I have some vague recollection that it's a Disney movie (so it must therefore be heartwarming, and also be the topic of a ride somewhere), and the actor who plays the protagonist Travis looks goofy. Most folks know the story already or will know it well enough after reading one or two of these reviews. Yes, it's about a boy and an unattractive yellow dog, and yes it has a sad turn of events. I can't say that this story or the storytelling is masterful, but there is a style of delivery in this book that is quite intriguing and no one comments on it. The circumstances of the story are quite rough. A young boy is left in charge of his mother and little brother in the wild Texas hill country while his father, relunctantly, must pursue a little gain on a cattle drive to Kansas. This is no small task, and long before the book is over, we see that at least two or maybe all three of the mother and kids would have died but for the happenstance appearance of said yellow dog (also noteworthy is the generosity and insight of the cowpoke who actually owned the dog but let Travis keep him). The life is hard and matter-of-fact, and the writing reflects it. The animals live in a practically different world, where life depends on instincts, species hate and kill other species and sometimes their own, and even bloodborne diseases have a scent that only dogs can detect. It's brutal. Old Yeller, our hero, bridges this world, and willingly devotes all of his animal kingdom powers for the protection of the humans that he inexplicably adopts and serves. The relationship between boy and dog is always a bit beyond the reader's reach. We never see these two playing fetch or lounging around under a tree. Their bond is one that is forged in combat and hard labor, and this hard practicality might ultimately explain Travis' ability to rationally and quickly make the hard decision to kill his pet. I don't think that it's a spoiler to state here that Travis must, in the end, destroy this animal - Gipson reveals that ending in the very first page of the book (and it is at the point of that destruction where the four great characters of this book - boy, dog, gun, and disease - collide). So, this is a world where the animals are the most cunning, strong, and fearsome, but it's a world that is dominated by Man, and in the end the loyal Old Yeller doesn't even know what hits him. That scene is revealed without sentiment or unnecessary drama.One other thing. I wonder if it is this book, printed in the late 1950's, that \\"taught\\" popular culture everything that it knows about the dreaded hydrophobia. Growing up in the 1970's, I thought that rabies was everywhere, and that the only thing between you and going mad with foaming thirst was the time it would take for any old squirrel to drop on your head and dig in. Of course I also thought that finding a dead Bigfoot was only a matter of time, and that eating Pop-Rocks and drinking a Coke would make your abdomen explode. There must have been some other sources of this rabies phobia though, as this book did not go into any detail about some three week regimine of shots to the belly button in order to cure the disease once afflicted.Anyway, good book. Read it to my three pre-teens and they loved it."},{"Title":"Old Yeller (A Literature unit)","review":"This book was very good!!! It was about a dog helping a family.

Fred Gipson's book is about a boy named Travis and his hardships and joy on becoming a man. The book starts out by Travis's dad leaving for Kansas to get money from the sell of the cattle, and throws Travis a big challenge. He is to take care of the family and the farm while he is gone. They live on a farm around 1870 near a place called Salt Licks. Travis likes to be outside, and likes to go hunting. Travis is really good at throwing rocks. He is so good he can cut a person when he throws one. Then there is Little Arliss. He just like all little brothers annoying, he's loud, always wants someone to play with him. Next there's Mama. She's hardworking, takes care of the family, and takes care of the animals around the farm. Then there's Old Yeller of course, he is and old yellow dog. He has a stub tail; one of his ears is partly chewed off. He thinks he is bigger then what he really is. (Physically) Travis taught Little Arliss how to throw rocks as well as Travis can throw them. Old Yeller comes up to the farm and Travis starts throwing rocks at him until Little Arliss covers Old Yeller and starts screaming at Travis and throwing rocks at Travis. Travis doesn't like Old Yeller at first, but then becomes attached to him more and more. They go through life's little troubles together. Like hydrophobia is going around Salt Licks, which is a form of rabies hat makes you go crazy, and being attacked by wild pigs. I think this historical fiction book is great.

The book takes place while Travis was serving as the man of the house while his father was trailing steers to a Kansas cattle market. The stray dog was not liked when he first arrived at the family's cabin. Travis had found him sleeping and a side of hanging pork was missing. He would have killed or drove Old Yeller off if Little Arliss hadn't put up a fight to save the dog. Travis grew fond of Old Yeller after he kept Little Arliss from being killed by a bear, and saved Travis from meat-eating hogs. Travis killed a stray bull and the family's milking cow after it was obvious the animals had come down with hydrophobia, or rabies. They had to burn the dead animals to prevent the disease from spreading, but the scent of roasting meat attracted wolves. While protecting his family, Old Yeller ended up in a fight with a rabid wolf. Travis shot and killed the wolf. He thought he had saved Old Yeller's life. His mom said Old Yeller had to be killed because the mad wolf had bitten him. When Travis shot Old Yeller, he said, \\"It was like having to shoot some of my own folks. That's how much I'd come to think of the big yeller dog.\\"The book Old Yeller was a reading adventure for me. It was an exciting book to read because it contained animals, action and even a lot of blood! Fred Gipson, the author of Old Yeller, did a good job in describing the feelings of the characters. It gave me an eyeview into the lives of homesteaders in the 1860's. In order to survive, children matured at a much younger age than they do today.

I didn't dislike anything about this book, but it would be nice if there were more illustrations.On a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this book a 5 rating.

At first Travis hated this dog but his younger brother would not let him go no matter what. The brother would get really mad if Travis did anything to the dog. One day Travis went out hunting by himself when he heard something down near birdsong creek. He started hearing screaming and yelling from arrliss, his brother, but he thought that he was just kidding. Then he heard a bear growl and he knew that Arrliss was in trouble. He ran down there but he knew that there was no way that he would make it in time but old yeller sure did. Old yeller ran down there and scared the bear away and saved Arrliss. After that Travis loved old yeller like a family member and would never let anything happen to him. A man stopped by there house and told them that rabefs was going around the town. Then old yeller and Travis went out to the hogs to clip there ears, but they attacked them. The hogs chased them all the way down and .... fell down. He knew that it was the end but then old yeller came and saved him. Travis started running away and got away but never got old yeller. He walked home and told him mom and his mom rode there mule to old yeller and brought him back. Old yeller was really hurt and It only got worse. The next day, Travis looked out the window and he saw a mad bull running around in the light. Arrliss started screaming and old yeller got up. Travis ran over and got his gun and brought it out and shot the bull In the head. They realized that the bull had the rabefs and they had to burn it up. They did that but the next day they found a cow that also had rabefs and that cow was the only cow that was good at milking. They also had to kill that cow and burned it as well. The next night Travis got awaken bye some racket that was going on outside. He looked out the window and old yeller was fighting with a mad wolf in the dark. Right now the fire was still burning from when they burned the bull so there was a little light to see the two dogs. Right away Travis got out his gun and aimed it at the wolf. He didnft want to fire the gun because he wasnft sure if he would hit Old Yeller by mistake. He had no choice so he pulled back the trigger and he fired the gun. The sound stopped and he was almost positive that he hit Old Yeller. He ran over and the wolf was right there on the ground with a gun shot in his body. He looked at Old Yeller and gave him a hug, after that he realized that the wolf had scratched Old Yeller and he was getting rabefs. There mom came running out to Old Yeller and Travis. She said that he had to shoot Old Yeller or he might bite one of there other family members. It was very hard to do it but .... looked down at Old Yeller and he was looked at him wagging his stub tail. Travis backed up and pulled the trigger and that was the end of Old Yeller. They his father came back from a long trip that he was on and brought Travis back a horse of his own.

Travis and his family moved to Texas, but soon his father had to leave and go to Kansas. With his father away, Travis was left in charge as the \\"man\\" of the house. One day as Travis was completing his work for the day he noticed some of the meat missing from the front porch. He soon discovered an \\"old yeller\\" dog had been stealing the meat off of the front porch. He tried to keep the dog away, but the dog kept coming back to the house. Travis eventually developed a bond with the dog and named him Old Yeller. Travis and the dog became best friends, and Old Yeller helped Travis and his family through tough situations. Old Yeller later becomes infected with the disease rabies while protecting the family from danger. The story ends with Travis having to kill Old Yeller, his best friend, because the dog has become a threat to the rest of the family. This is a heartfelt story of a boy who must face the challenges of manhood. He must learn to provide for his family, work in the fields, and make crucial decisions at the young age of fourteen, even if it meant shooting his dog, his best friend and helper. This book would be best used at the middle school level.

The hardships, dangers, and rewards of a life hard-wrought from the wilderness are depicted unsparingly. It's an often brutal existence, and Gipson's characters are equal to it - tough and unsentimental but unashamed to care about each other. The prose is descriptive and easy to read, and the story itself moves quickly. It's full of adventure, but has the somber tone of a serious coming-of-age novel.Ultimately, though, \\"Old Yeller\\" simply didn't move me. Perhaps it would have when I was younger. Maybe I've heard so many times what a tearjerker this book is that I was already desensitized - but I don't think that's it, as I still mist up when I reread \\"Red Fern,\\" and if having read a book several times doesn't diminish the impact of a sad ending, nothing will. More likely, there just wasn't enough in this book to explain the special bond Travis shared with Old Yeller. Mostly Travis talks about what Old Yeller does for him - the numerous occasions in which he saved someone's life, and how helpful he is around the farm - but there's little exploration of their emotional connection. In the context of the story and the characters it makes sense: frontier settlers in the 1860s didn't have much time to sit around loving on their dogs. Travis's affection for Old Yeller is clear enough in his actions and words, but somehow I simply didn't \\"feel\\" it.\\"Old Yeller\\" is an excellent novel with plenty to offer casual and thoughtful readers alike. It just didn't connect with me, but then, I know not every book will, even every book considered a classic. Fans of adventure stories, historical fiction, and animal tales will find \\"Old Yeller\\" well worth their while. Personally, though, I'll stick to \\"Where the Red Fern Grows.\\""},{"Title":"Old Yeller (A Literature unit)","review":"when old yeller first came to the farm travis wanted to kill him but when he had to it was like shooting at a famiy member.

However, for an eighth grader, the book sucks. The best part is the bull fighting part. The worst part is when the dog dies."},{"Title":"Old Yeller (A Literature unit)","review":"I am appalled that this book is considered by some to be a \`classic in juvenile literature'. It is an ugly, brutal book in which it is considered a good thing that all the \`Indians' have been forced on to reservations. Perhaps it should be possible to accept that attitude, only politically incorrect now by our modern standards. The book was written, after all, by a Texan in the heyday of the Cowboy movie and is set in the 1860s.And of course it is possible to understand, even sympathise with, the violence involved in killing your own meat.But what is absolutely unacceptable, in any historical period, is the brutal violence used against mule and dog and child. The mule, for instance, is made to behave in this manner: 'I drew back my green cedar club and whacked him so hard across the jawbone that I nearly dropped him in his tracks.' Similarly: Old Yeller is subdued by being hit in the head with a violently thrown rock. The younger brother is frequently 'thrashed'.The book is crudely written and is brutal from beginning to end.This is not like the brutality in, say, \`Call of the Wild'. Jack London didn't approve of that violence. This writer does. It is his boy hero and the boy's mother who do the clubbing and thrashing and rock throwing.There are some saving graces: The boy is distressed when he thinks he has shot a doe without killing it outright. And in the end the boy and his mother go to great lengths to save Old Yeller. But nevertheless, this is not a book for anyone who considers themselves a \`dog lover' (or an animal or people lover for that matter) It should only be read as part of an understanding of the history of the American West - and then with horror."},{"Title":"Old Yeller (A Literature unit)","review":"The novel Old Yeller is one of the most enjoyable books you can ever read. This book I loved because some people have to let go of things they really loved. They experienced something they wouldn't want to do.The Characters were interesting and believable because they had to do something someone who was in real life would have to do. My favorite character was Old Yeller. This character was special to me because he saved the whole family and he was an excellent guard dog. The author did a job that was very well written, he also did an indescribable job describing the characters. He made me think that the characters were right there next to me reading the book.The author was able to hold my interest throughout the entire novel because Gipson (author) made the characters and I go right together and it was in some parts of the book when I was there with everyone in the story just watching them. The author did a great job writing this story.This book I would absolutely recommend to my friends, family and anyone I know. I would recommend it because I think that they would enjoy it just the same way I did.From reading this book I learned that when you become friends with someone and you have to face the fact that you might end up feeling sad, lonely and miserable. Travis knew he had to do the right thing so he obeyed but he couldn't sleep and he thought about what he had done all the time.The experience that I gained from reading this book is lost stray dogs may become loved ones and something bad ends up happening, but Old Yeller's spirit still goes with them no matter what happens and even though they have moved on."},{"Title":"Old Yeller (A Literature unit)","review":"Old Yeller Jacob J.Do you like classic American stories about a boy and his dog?

The dog known as \\"Old Yeller\\" because of his bark and the color of his coat, and the family that comes to love him, provides an interesting look at life on the prairie. There are many adventures, with Old Yeller saving each one of the family from such dangers as a bear, killer hogs, and a mad wolf. Travis, Little Arliss, and Mama Coates are all interesting characters that help the story along. The central part of the story is Travis' relationship with the big yeller dog and what ultimately happens to the both of them. It is a tale filled with sadness and joy.

Well, if you haven't, I highly encourage you to read, the Newbery Award Winner Book, Old Yeller by Fred Gipson. In the story the protagonist, Travis, is left home with his father's responsibilities around the house while his father is away over the summer, but then he meets a one eared, stubbed tailed yellow dog who he calls Old Yeller. Travis doesn't like him at first because he ate all their meat and he wants to kill him, but then his little brother, Little Arliss, wants to keep him and their Mom says, \\"Yes\\". Even though Travis doesn't like him at first they become best friends anyway. Over the summer Old Yeller helps Travis with his responsibilities, but these two also face many problems like the terrible disease hydrophobia {it's like rabies} that breaks their friendship forever. If you want to find out why read this book.Anyway, as I told you before hydrophobia was a terrible disease that affected some of their animals. I know this might seem silly, but one of their animals that got it was their best milking longhorn cow named Spot. Spot was a huge longhorn with brown blotches all over its body. It used to be as gentle and kind as a cute fuzzy rabbit, but then it turned as evil as a raging bull going after a matador. They had to get rid of her some how, but how?\\" Help! ! !\\" screamed Mama and Lisbeth a wolf with hydrophobia attacked them, but Old Yeller weak and frail from a past fight with hogs conquered the wolf, but something terrible had happened that might break their friendship forever, what is it and will it?The book, Old Yeller, by Fred Gipson can be a sad, heart-warming classic. This book was one of the best books I ever read and I hope these cliffhangers will make you want to read this book. When you do read it I hope it becomes one of the best books you have ever read, too.

Examples of this include Lassie, Benji, Where the Red Fern Grows, Call of the Wild, and this classic from the mid 20th century: Old Yeller. Set in farm country, the story revolves around a 14 year old boy who is left alone with his mom and younger brother for a year while the father is of getting money driving cattle. Our protagonist encounters a big yellow dog that is adopted by the family. Old Yeller, as the dog is called, soon proves his worth and becomes an integral part of the family. Tragically, the book ends with our protagonist having to kill Old Yeller after the dog gets into a deadly fight with a rabid wolf. But like other children stories, this one has a happy ending as the family adopts Old Yeller's progeny. Overall, the book takes under 2 hours to read, and is quite enjoyable."},{"Title":"Old Yeller (A Literature unit)","review":"The book Old Yeller is about a boy named Travis and he was left in charge of the farm and duties while Pa went on a cattle drive to Kansas.

More than chores fall upon his young shoulders as he sacrifices play time for the good of the family. He begs Papa to buy him a horse of his own, but his wise father assures him that he needs dog even more. Travis learns the bitter truth of that statement several times over when the family adopts a yellow mongrel with his own means of survival.Resentful of the thieving brute at first, Travis grudgingly admits that Old Yeller, as they call him, sure has is paws full saving their lives?when he?s notup to some mischief himself. But soon the settlement will face its most serious threat with the plague of dreaded hydrophobia. How will Travis handle the peril of Rabies on his own? Gipson?s narrative is full of dialogue and fast-paced plotting, which includes occasional foreshadowing. A real page-turner whichexplores the bond between a young man who discovers man?s best friend. This is a story of both physical and emotional survival--for kids of all ages."},{"Title":"Old Yeller (A Literature unit)","review":"If you like reading about a dog who has been found by a family that lives in a cabin, then you should read Old Yeller.

Yes, Rowan is part of a team going on a difficult quest, and the book does have some of the typical quest challenges (like the threatening spiders we also saw in Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter). However, I don't see that as a drawback. This book is intended for really young readers (I would say 2nd-4th grades), and for them, this can be an excellent introduction to some of the conventions of the \\"hero\\" myth and the genre of the fantasy-adventure story. Along the way, they also have a character in Rowan that they can identify with (what young kid hasn't felt that adults don't take him/her seriously???). I like the way Rodda doesn't let Rowan fall into the \\"adults are stupid\\" attitude that I see as so prevalent in cartoons and movies aimed at children. Though the adults all fail in the quest, Rowan comes to see that it is because we all have weaknesses and fears to face.

As one who felt like an outsider when I started to attend a new school, I was able to sypathize with Rowan's plight, I admired his tenacity in pursuing his mission (even in the face of almost certain death) and his selflessness in trying to help those who despised him for his differences.

Her hero Rowan will win over the earnest bullied kids, or the people who once were.Rowan is the most timid child in the village of Rin, and so he is often teased and bullied by other children. Adults pity him or dislike him for his apparent weakness. He is also is a herder of the bukshah (buffalo-like creatures who provide milk and wool), who are fed by a certain stream coming down from a nearby mountain. And, it is said, a dragon lives at the top of the mountain. One day it's discovered that the mountain stream is drying up. Without it, the bukshah and the village will both die. They consult old Sheba, a clearsighted wise woman who utters a cryptic rhyme: Seven hearts the journey make/Seven ways the hearts will break/Bravest heart will carry on/When sleep is death and hope is gone...The village sends six of their strongest, bravest men and woman - and Rowan, who is the only one who can use their map. Coming along is Strong Jonn, half-Traveller Allun, inseparable companions Val and Ellis, Marlie, and Bromden. More prophetic verses crop up in the map, leading the way through dens of enormous spiders, bogs where they hear their loved ones' voices, right to the cold summit of the mountain. But Rowan and his companions will learn some lessons about fear and courage...Reading this book, one sees so many ways that it could have gone wrong. The adults could have remained one-dimensional and snobbish - but they don't, they grow and change as Rowan does. Rowan could have been a little twit - but he wasn't, instead being a thoroughly believable young boy who WANTS to be brave. I liked how he was not bitter about being pitied or teased by the others, but merely needed a chance to prove himself.This is probably too \\"young\\" a book for most 9-12 readers, as the inside flap describes it as 7-up. But despite being a very straightforward story of about 150 pages, it's also tightly plotted and well-interspersed with fantasy elements, though not too many.

A mad old lady named Sheba gives them little clues of how to get up the mountain safely, and six of the strongest heroes are chosen, but the weakest child[or teenager,the book never realy told his age]had to come beacause only he could revele the map.

The whole village of Rin migrates to a different hill with water, but they notice that the water is beginning to stop there too.

For an adult, I read it in 90 minutes. . .literally- Its a story with a good message. Also the main character develops and comes out better for it in the end. . .and so do the supporting characters- The author uses nice poetic riddles to build the adventure and suspense, which gave it a good Indian Jones / National Treasure feel- The story is predictable as it is a very common story thread.PLOT = Unlikely hero outdoes everyone by overcoming all the obstacles that stopped stronger and \\"better\\" people from succeeding. As a boy he is the hero in the end where adults failed.This can be somewhat forgiven since it is obvious the first in a series and has to introduce the main character somehow. But this is not why I dropped it a star. . .- The final challenge to me is left unresolved. Even though the main quest was finished, there were things that happen at the end that make you wonder, \\"And? What happened to the xxxxx?\\" (I don't want to give away anything by saying exactly what my question was) This is why I ding the book a star less. If it was something small, then no biggie, but this was a big \\"thing\\" in the end that shouldn't have just \\"disappeared\\".

By the beginning of the fourth book, I knew exactly what was going to happen in that book, and probably in the fifth book as well.

After all, Tolkien borrowed heavily from old and middle English writing, and Hogwarts is situated next to a forest full of spiders. However, when a story consists of nothing except rehashed elements, and the characters are only marginally engaging, it has problems. Add to that the fact that you can correctly predict most of the plot after reading the first few chapters, and you have something less than a worthwhile book.

One by one, the travelers can go no more, and Rowan alone must face the final danger awaiting him at the top of the mountain.I believe that this book is influential bacause I learned an important lesson at the end of the book. Before reading the book, I always thought that a brave person was a person with little or no fear. But the Sheba, the Wise Woman, said that, \\"Only fools do not fear.\\" When I was done reading, the book had completely changed my opinion. I learned that a truly brave person is someone that can look his or her fear in the eye and face it head on.This book tells me that all people don't have to be big and strong to be brave. One thing that i learned about other people is that when the people you love are in danger, they will do whatever it takes to save or protect them. The style of this book is adventure-fiction."},{"Title":"Rowan of Rin (Rowan of Rin #1)","review":"I read this book first when I was 10 years old.I have read it about 20 times since.This is my favorite book in the series,and the best one I've read ever.I am always eagerly waiting for book 6 to come out,because I have read all of the books more then once.In a nutshell,this was the best book I've ever read."},{"Title":"Rowan of Rin (Rowan of Rin #1)","review":"This book is very fascinating. It tells a lot about friendship, and how to survive stressful situations. This book is also very interesting.

We started reading them because Emily Rodda is the same author of the Deltora Quest books, which we both love.If you like fantasy books, dragons, adventure, peril, and heroes, you should read these. In this case, the weakest (Ronan) is the one that always saves the day. If the message is that children, no matter how small, or how insignifcant they believe they are, are important and can do amazing things, well than I'm all for it. It's an uplifting message."},{"Title":"Rowan of Rin (Rowan of Rin #1)","review":"I couldn't put it down when i started reading it!!!"},{"Title":"Rowan of Rin (Rowan of Rin #1)","review":"My eight-year old son is a voracious reader but we have trouble finding things that hold his attention without being too intense. The Rowan series is a well-loved exception.Emily Rodda's language and plot are sophisticated enough to hold his interest and the adventures are gripping without being too scary.I think these books are a great choice for younger readers who're looking for a \\"serious\\" book. I'm glad we found this series."},{"Title":"Rowan of Rin (Rowan of Rin #1)","review":"I think that Rowan of Rin is a great book. I really like the poem 7 hearts the journey makes,7 ways the heart will break... I really like how the book just grabs me. After I read the first chapter you could not get me away from it. I kept on thinking \\"when is he going to do this\\" \\"why did he do that\\" They get a map and use that to get up the mountain and clues are on it. I felt so bad when some people from the group went back to the village. I love this book, I own it and I think that anybody who likes adventure, happy, suspensfull & joyful book then this book is for you. I don't know what els to say without spoiling the book for you so I will say one more thing IF YOU DON'T GET THIS YOU ARE MISSING OUT!!!"},{"Title":"Rowan of Rin (Rowan of Rin #1)","review":"We like to read aloud with our elementary school aged kids and heartily recommend this book for 5 to 10 year olds. The plot is complex enough and characters likeable. From a parent's viewpoint, the book gets high marks for morality without preaching, suspense without terror or tragedy, not to mention pronounceable character and place names. The kids just like the story and have a great time trying to figure out the riddles before the characters do.

He suceeds in getting the river flowing and he is applauded"},{"Title":"Rowan of Rin (Rowan of Rin #1)","review":"Gentle spirited Rowan is thought of as weak by the strong and hardy folk in his village, Rin. He doesn't measure up to the other villagers; in him they see no value and he has learned to see no value in himself. Only the peaceful creatures he tends named the bukshah love and appreciate him. When an expedition to the top of the mountain is formed to save the bukshah Rowan is forced to go. Haunted by fear and scorned and pitied by the other members of the expedition Rowan is driven by the faith the bukshah have in him to meet the dragon who lives at the top of mountain.Throughout this book Rowan struggles to exhaustion to combat his fears and do things others find so easy. Who among us hasn't felt that way? We spend a lifetime trying to be good enough only to be bashed down. Most people can identify with Rowan and even at times his companions in this book.One of the lessons Rowan learns is to see more clearly. He learns to see himself and his companions in a truer light; they are not as invincible as he thought and he is braver than he knew. As the only one to complete the quest he also learns what true bravery is; it is overcoming your fear and doing something even though it frightens you. It is a lesson many people in the real world have yet to master.This is a book I have come back to many times and each time I read it I am immediately transported to the valley of Rin. It is written for a younger age group than I tend to read, but the rich texture and characters appeals to many ages. The writing is graceful and Rodda is able to keep the momentum up throughout the story. With universal themes of learning to value yourself and bravery in the face of fear I give this book four stars.Definitely give this book a chance!"},{"Title":"The Moon Men","review":"This is actually two books in one. The first, describing the exploits of Julian 9 was the better of the two, in my opinion, due to the great struggle to lead a downtrodden people up from the dregs of existence and begin the revolution. The second book, taking place more than 300 years after the first book, is more of the typical ERB; i.e. hero gets captured, makes escape, gets the girl, and wins the war. There was some character development here and I found it interesting that the hero's brother was the &quot;enlightened&quot; one. The hero makes some progress towards changing his world view but in the end, remains the action-oriented adventurer. That doesn't mean its bad, just typical ERB. When I read ERB I am always amazed that he wrote his stories so long ago and yet had amazing insight on problems of today and tomorrow. An amazing feat. Enjoy reading the Moon Men."},{"Title":"The Moon Men","review":"This was my First ERB book and I think that it is one of his finest and accompanied by the &quot;Moon Maid&quot;, which I believe is the first book of this duet, makes this a very good ERB story."},{"Title":"The Moon Men","review":"As a child I wallowed in ERB, as an adult I pretty much dismissed him as the Slave To Formula he was (one might argue that he invented or refined the the formula but that does not make it a particularly good formula, and even a quick comparison with Dumas or Stevenson will suffice to blow this particular Mr. Burroughs out of the water) - however, something about the darkness and savagery of The Moon Men has always remained with me. His vision was here was uncharacteristically, studiously pessimistic and deeply cthonic - the narrator describing his own throat being slit, the dregs of humanity in the wake of the lunar invasion being raised like beef-cattle, and the wonderful evil of the &quot;electric guns&quot; which can be set at the frequency of bone, say, and thus dissolve all the bones of anyone coming within range of the rays (which is actually quite conceivable today, but rather innovative for Burroughs' era) - all in all, this book (and to a lesser degree its predecessor, The Moon Maid) seems ERB's darkest yet most advanced."},{"Title":"The Moon Men","review":"With Mars now closer to the Earth than it has been for hundreds of thousands of years, some of us are given pause to think about how all the stories of spaceships going to Mars have never really been concerned with the actual logistics involved. Such practical considerations are a minor part of &quot;The Moon Men&quot; trilogy of pulp fiction yarns from the master of adventure, Edgar Rice Burroughs, in which a spaceship headed for Mars is sabotaged and ends up on the Moon instead. Unlike John Carter, who made his way to Mars simply by raising his open arms to the red planet, the adventures in this story, the first in ERB's Moon trilogy, actually take a spaceship.It is interesting that Burroughs played a bit more attention to the science in his pulp novel this time around, even in terms of the fanciful Eighth Ray, given that the Moon books are his most political. Burroughs began working on a story, &quot;Under the Red Flag,&quot; at end the First World War, which voiced his concerns over the Communist takeover of Russia, albeit in slightly dramatic form. However, with the war over pulp magazine editors were not interested in ERB continuing to fight the war, even in his Tarzan novels. Over the course of the next several years, while he worked on other projects, the prolific Burroughs turned his grim prediction of a world under the yoke of a communistic government into a space adventures that would allow him to make the points he felt needed making. After all, the man who created Tarzan was obviously a big believer in personal freedom.However, the first volume in the trilogy turns out to be a rather standard ERB romantic adventure. &quot;The Moon Maid&quot; is the first book in the Moon trilogy and takes place after the end of the Great War (1914-1967). Captain Julian commands &quot;The Barsoom,&quot; the Earth vessel that ends up on the Moon. Once there he and his companions discover flora and fauna, including small horse-like creatures with human features. The title creature is Nah-ee-lah, human type known as U-ga, who comes from the city of Laythe where she is the daughter of it's Jemadar (come on, this is an ERB yarn: you knew she would be royalty). The godless Kalkars prove to be the biggest threat to both Julian's survival and his chance of a romantic relationship with the Moon Maid. The first time around saving the girl becomes the prime objective. Saving the rest of the Moon people from a fate worse than death happens in the next set of stories,In the second book, &quot;The Moon Men,&quot; which was actually written before &quot;The Moon Maid&quot; but was not published first, we learn that since the United States and Great Britain have essentially disarmed now that they rule the world together the Earth is easily conquered by Orthis when he returns in 2050 with an army of Kalkars. The story picks up in 2120 with Julian 9th in a totalitarian world where intellectuals get executed, education is prohibited, and the infrastructure of the world has collapsed. Julian 9th has a love interest, Juana, and a desire to resist the occupation. There is a flag that is a key symbol of rebellion, the flag of Argon, and the climax of the book is the beginning of the revolution.The final volume, &quot;The Red Hawk,&quot; jumps ahead to the year 2430, at which point the main character is now Julian 20th, who is known as the Red Hawk. The revolution that began in &quot;The Moon Men&quot; has driven the Kalkars all the war to the western part of the continent, where they now hold a pass that leads to their last stronghold. The Kalkars are now led by the sixteenth Or-tis and of course there is a love interest for Red Hawk, a woman named Bethelda. However, there is a twist in that she turns out to be an Or-tis and the novel heads for the end of the Great Feud. One sign of the times in this story are the Nipons, a race of Japanese pygmies, that is a bit disconcerting.Taken all together, &quot;The Moon Men&quot; trilogy is an odd mix. The writing suffers in comparison to his best work, such as the Barsoom series, but that is balanced by the political arguments inherent in the stories. In the wake of the First World War and the Communist revolution in Russian it is clear that Burroughs was worried about the fate of the world. &quot;The Moon Men&quot; attacks communism, authoritarian rule, and disarmament, warns against dictators and politicians, while arguing for the sanctity of marriage, friends and family, and love of country. For the most part these are serious subjects dressed up in the standard ERB mixture of romance and adventure.

However in my initial reading of the letter/speech* (reference to letter throughout) I saw many red flags that indicated to me that the letter was fake. Investigating further confirmed my suspicions and I intend to base my review mainly on the historical authenticity (or lack thereof) of the Willie Lynch Letter of 1712.To begin, in my own readings of many primary and secondary texts of the 18th and 19th century I've never come across any reference to a Willie Lynch or reference to the letter. Dr. Ampim has an interesting essay called Death of The Willie Lynch Speech (Google it) that confirms that no reference was ever made by any known antislavery or proslavery activist during that time period which makes the alleged letter and influence on slavery suspicious. Also, stated in the essay is the fact nobody named Willie Lynch existed during the time of the letter and the only known person named William Lynch was born 30 years after the fact and never owned a plantation in the West Indies.Another major factor in The Willie Lynch Letter leading to my conclusion that its fake is the problem of language found throughout the letter. There were many issues I found in my initial reading and several that I missed thanks to AndreM.'s review and latter Dr. Ampim's essay. As Dr. Ampim pointed out there are many anachronisms in the letter; words like fool proof, re-fueling, program, Black (20th century origin) etc., that point to the letter being a fake written in the 20th century. Another language issue I initially found was the use of the word South and the context surrounding it in the letter. In the context used either the mysterious Lynch had incredible foreknowledge of the growing trend between the north and south (as we come to understand today) that became evident in early U.S. history. The problem is that in 1712 slavery was prevalent throughout the colonies and such distinction between north/south did not exist during the period of the alleged letter. So why would Mr. Lynch assume just the South?Another language problem I overlooked was the use of the word \\"color\\" in the letter. Here is the problem; Willie Lynch is supposed to be a British slave owner of the West Indies, but the spelling of the word \\"color\\" as used in the letter is of the American spelling and not of the British spelling \\"colour.\\" Just further evidence the letter is fake.This is just a small sampling of the many mistakes found in this letter of only a few paragraphs long. Just from the evidence presented, it should be sufficient enough to confirm that the letter has no historical validity originating from the 18th century."},{"Title":"The Willie Lynch Letter and The Destruction of Black Unity","review":"Very good read but I thought there was a lot more to the letter.

The story then takes a turn to add drama by mixing the country orphans with wealthy landowners and their own difficulties.This is one of Rawling's more rare novels, and her ability to evoke the natural world is as sharp as it is in \\"The Yearling.\\" The story is a good novel, but I especially love it because when I drive through the citrus growing areas of Florida, the scenery comes alive through Rawling's description."},{"Title":"Golden apples","review":"I was very happy with this copy that I bought for my father.

It gives alternate ways for finding vocabulary words as well. The recommendations in this book are very specific, with several examples. It does not do the work for you - you still have to come up with your own words and worksheets. However, the examples are detailed and clear, and I found the process of creating vocabulary worksheets to be simple. The first couple of times that I created worksheets, I had the book open as I created questions, to make sure that I was not missing any important points. After that, it was a breeze.

In my work with teachers, this book has had the best reception with practicing teachers of any book I have used. I has been a very popular selection for professional book clubs.The authors use common-sense language to explain how to make vocabulary instruction meaningful--and why many commonly used techniques are ineffective. Of the essential elements of reading instruction, vocabulary has easily been the most neglected, despite its clear connection with reading comprehensioin. This book provides teachers with real, usable methods that have been proven effective.Every teacher should read this book. I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"Bringing Words to Life: Robust Vocabulary Instruction","review":"I still remember when my high school teachers would assign the dreaded weekly vocabulary homework. We would painstakingly look up each word in the dictionary, write down what was usually the shortest definition, and then take a wild stab at writing the word in a sentence. I'm not sure how many of those words I actually learned, but I do remember being bored, frustrated and confused. Dictionaries are not necessarily the only tool for deriving meaning of new words.Thankfully, this book helps educators to realize the importance of meaningful vocabulary instruction.

The bulk of the book consists of country-by-country entries. Each entry includes a full color illustration of the national flag along with text detailing the history and symbolic significance of each flag. The individual entries also contain various other visuals, such as national coats-of-arms, presidential flags, etc.Other features of the book are sections explaining the parts of a flag and various flag terminology. Particularly fascinating is the large number of subnational flags that are depicted and explained in the book. Among these are the flags of Canadian provinces, U.S. states, French overseas territories, Spanish regions, Russian republics, and Malaysian states. I found many of these subnational flags really visually striking--from the fairy-tale like elements of the Swiss canton flags to the bold colors and geometric designs of the Brazilian state flags, and beyond. There is also section on the flags of international organizations such as the Arab League and the United Nations.My only complaint about this fine book is that the descriptive text around the pictures of many of the national flags has lines pointing from the text onto the drawing, unnecessarily marring the illustrations. This descriptive text would have been just as effective without these distracting lines. That complaint aside, this book is a richly informative and visually exciting reference work--it's a book you can turn to again and again."},{"Title":"Smithsonian Handbooks: Flags (Smithsonian Handbooks)","review":"My son is 7 and he loves this book.

Perhaps a smart child. but a great book none the less."},{"Title":"Smithsonian Handbooks: Flags (Smithsonian Handbooks)","review":"This book was produced by DK Publishing, which I have found to produce excellently-illustrated books on many subjects, always doing a better job with illustrations than most other publishers. This book is no exception to this. The researching was done by William Crampton's Flag Institute and its U.S. release was sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution, two organizations that between them guarantee the quality and accuracy of the research. So these facts alone set a high standard, and the book meets all expectations in that regard.One thing that you will find in this book, not present in most, is a large selection of subnational flags (States in the USA, provinces in Canada, etc.) While the US and Canada are covered in most flag books I've seen in this regard, I have seen few illustrations of subnational flags from other countries, and this book covers many of them. (It does not cover Japanese prefectural flags, however, which I have seen elsewhere. But it covers more nations than I've seen in any other book.)All in all, a book worth the 5 stars I give it."},{"Title":"Smithsonian Handbooks: Flags (Smithsonian Handbooks)","review":"i havent read a whole book since graduate school but have never stopped learning about things. we have the entire collection and i now devour them cover to cover. i purchased almost all of them on Amazon for $5-$13 each (verses the $20 cover price). my kids and i LOVE to read these books and learn about the rocks, fossils and nature we find camping and fishing. smithsonian/DK even make flags interesting!"},{"Title":"Smithsonian Handbooks: Flags (Smithsonian Handbooks)","review":"This book is perhaps the most up-to-date authority of the flags nation's fly today. It is richly colored and provides good analysis of what the flags consist of. It has the flags of the world, and many individual states or provinces within the several countries.

Mumford's premise is that modern civilization based on democratic-capitalism creates only a &quot;mass man&quot;: incapable of choice, incapable of spontaneous, self-directed activities; at best impatient, docile, disciplined to monotonous work to an almost pathetic degree, but increasingly irresponsible as his choices become fewer and fewer; finally modern man is a creature governed mainly by... modern business, the propaganda office and the planing bureaus of totalitarian and quasi-totalitarian governments (which, by definition, include both Marxist-Leninist governments and democratic-capitalist governments). Written years ago, &quot;The Conduct of Life&quot; remains a rational, conclusive and veracious analysis of humanity's place in a capitalist society."},{"Title":"Conduct of Life","review":"Opening the book and forcing myself to read its content didn't bring me very far.

I have enjoyed all of her books except for the endings. Her books fall in this pattern-the main characters fall in love, one of them needs to be forgiven for some indiscretion he/she neglected to tell the other, the other character cannot forgive the person, and an angel dramatically changes the mind of the character in the last 5 pages. Bang -end of story.Her latest book, &quot;Small Wonders&quot; began with everyone knowing most of Cole's problems. The book dealt with self discovery, the ability to change, and being able to forgive yourself.The secondary story of Melissa and Alex was also wonderful. As a Special Ed teacher I felt especially appreciative of how this story was handled. I wish more people were so easily accepting.I thorougly enjoyed the whole book. Oh, and the angels were still there, but the characters were given litlle nudges throughout the book, not a mind altering nudge at the end."},{"Title":"Small Wonders","review":"Leanne Wilson is not known for making the best choices when it comes to romantic relationships. Her four year-old son's father skipped town as soon as she told him she was pregnant. Then, Leanne thought she had finally met the love of her life in Cole Jackson -- until he conned almost the whole town of Bethlehem into a nonexistent investment, and took off with all of their money. It doesn't matter to Leanne that he eventually repaid everyone. A thief is a thief, in her book. She'll also never forgive him for leaving his twelve year-old son behind, even though she loves the boy like her own. Now Cole is back in town, sentenced to five thousand hours of community service as punishment. But, just who's being punished here -- Leanne or Cole?Cole Jackson knows what he is, and figures it's too late to change. He never dreamed he'd end up back in the small town where the majority of the residents hate him. All Cole wants is to serve his jail time and get the heck out of there. Instead, he gets the shock of his life when the judge sentences him to almost two and a half years of community service. Now he'll have to live across the street from Leanne Wilson, the woman he loved as much as a man like him could, and the son he left behind. Cole would much rather be behind bars!I found the first few chapters of SMALL WONDERS a tad annoying with Cole's constant inner self-loathing, and Leanne's constant inner pity parties. Whenever they met on the street the two harped at each unmercifully. But, as the story continued, and the two really started to communicate, I was glad I persevered. Cole is one of the most unlikely of heroes, Leanne almost too good to be true, but as the story unfolds, they work well together.This is the first of Marilyn Pappano's books I've read, and I'm thinking of tracking down the rest of the books in this series. Several surprise twists and turns held my attention, and a bit of a paranormal twist added some sparks to the story.Overall, I recommend SMALL WONDERS as an enjoyable, mostly light read with intriguing characters. If you're looking for an entertaining, hometown type of romance, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Small Wonders","review":"Con artist Jack Coleman works his trade in Savannah until the local police arrive to arrest him claiming he is Cole Jackson. However the local cops hand him over to Bethlehem, New York police sergeant Nathan Bishop to escort Cole back north to face charges of embezzlement and child abandonment.Cole hates returning there because he left behind his son Ryan and the woman he loves Leanne Wilson, owner of SMALL WONDERS. Unable to do anything but plead guilty though he knows his parents and siblings would call him a barbarian for the con is in the gene pool, Cole is shocked by the sentence. The Judge sentences him to 500 hours of community sentencing under some weird young man Eli. Though he plans to book at the first moment he can flee, the magic of the town begins to cleanse his soul as much as his love for his son, Leanne, and her son.The latest miracle romance is a delightful charmer though in many ways it is similar to previous stories in the series. The key is the cast. The reprobate Cole knows he has the con gene while Leanne oozes goodness yet is no turn the other cheek miss. The two children act like youngsters while Eli provides mysticism to the usual wonderful Marilyn Pappano novel.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Village Life in America, 1852-1872","review":"Caroline Cowles Richards, born in 1842, penned her diary before, during, and after one of the most tragic times in US history, the Civil War. Her writing has captured the realities of daily life and her personal views while living in the small village of Canandaigua, NY. The time frame was 1852-1872. It is a richly layered interpretation of her young life during a very turbulent period of growth, complicated by 4 years of war. She reveals much abour her acquaintenances and touches upon a diverse array of subjects including social customs, food, dress, education, community events and religion. Her descriptions capture views of a vibrant community experiencing an economic renaissance, abolition, women's rights movements and religious revitalism. This new edition is illustrated with 25 photos, including two new images, one of which is a full length view of Caroline ca. 1859 in period clothing, typical of her age, social status and area where she lived. There is also a new introduction which reveals significant information about Caroline's life not revealed in her diary. The cover of the book is a picture of the community taken in 1859, a perfect match to her newly discovered image which appears in the book. Great, easily read book which is a classic."},{"Title":"Making and Using Graphs and Nomographs","review":"This is an elementary school workbook designed to teach 9 year olds to plot whole numbers, up to 10, on a number line.

Active in politics as a devoted socialist and antifascist he founded the resistance movement &quot;Giustizia e Liberta.&quot; &quot;The Watch&quot; (L'orologio) is best classified as a political documentary novel, pertaining to the Neorealism of postwar Italian literature. Set in the desillusioned period after the war, it portrays a gallery of individuals (family, friends, partisans, and the commom people) all trying to cope and adjust to a new reality and the postwar Cabinet crisis in Rome. Levi foresaw a perpetuation under new slogans and new flags of the worst features of the tendency towards fascism, a culture of the &quot;nostalgia.&quot; The heroism and sacrifice of partisan war faces a conservative reaction. Socialism has been a deception of history, the old structure is revived afer the war: the parasites (Luigini) feeding upon their hosts (Contadine), and the overall purpose is to restore the authority of the state. The partisans are blamed for pretending to reform a structure by preserving and restoring the very same structure they initially attempted to reform. The &quot;watch&quot; merely plays the role of a symbol, an attempt to fix an old time mechanism, which eventually is substituted by a similar one.Besides its political tone, &quot;The Watch&quot; is characterized by an elegant prose and clearly denounces Carlo Levi as a painter, with characters and setting descriptions viewed from the perspective of an artist who is stroking his brush on a canvas."},{"Title":"ASIMOV'S SCIENCE FICTION - Volume 22, number 19 - September Sept 1998: Sea Change with Monsters; Market Report; With Arms to Hold the Wind; Xiaoying's Journey; How Meersh the Bedeviler Lost His Toes; Radiant Doors; The Gold Digging Ants of the Lost","review":"An excellent issue, with one 4.5 story, and one dodgy one, ending with McAuley's rather cool underwater adventure.There's a rather epic Spinrad book review cum column, that espouses upon some small press and French books including a Di Filippo novel called Ciphers which is apparently replete with rock 'n roll jokes.

While I didn't agree that all were actually \\"lies\\", Borsellino certainly gave me food for thought.Learning to recognize and teach your kids the truth will be a valuable experience for the entire family. I highly recommend this book to anyone that deals with kids in anyway. It is a wonderful guide."},{"Title":"Pinocchio Parenting: 21 Outrageous Lies We Tell Our Kids","review":"In the introduction to Pinocchio Parenting, Dr. Borsellino says that \\"Smart people believe half of what they hear. Really smart people know which half to believe.\\" Remember Gepetto's Pinocchio, the puppet which became a little boy? The more lies he told, the longer his nose grew. Well, the author is suggesting that each time we verbalize certain \\"outrageous lies,\\" we take on the aspects of this storybook character.Perhaps we as parents have not looked at Dr. Borsellino's listings as lies, but he presents a strong discourse on each one. He and his wife Jenni wrote How To Raise Totally Awesome Kids, and he has a nationally syndicated television program called At Home Live! with Chuck and Jenni, so his credentials seem to underlie his talking points.The author lists the 21 different lies in chapter form, relating examples and giving his truths at the end. I have chosen a few of the most familiar chapter headings and revealing truths as enticements for reading this book.The number 1 lie is: \\"You can be anything you want to be,\\" with his truth being: \\"You may not be able to be anything you want to be in life, but you can do the most you can with what you have and do it in a way nobody has ever seen before.\\" Number 5 in the listing is: \\"It Doesn't Matter Whether You Win or Lose--It's How You Play the Game,\\" with his truth listed as: \\"Winning isn't everything--but it does matter. People keep score for a reason.\\" Number 11: \\"It's Not What You Know but Who You Know That Counts,\\" with the truth being: \\"It's not about what you know--or who you know. It's what you do with what you know that matters most.\\" Number 14: \\"It Doesn't Matter What You Do in Life, as Long as You're Happy,\\" with the truth listed as: \\"Happiness isn't a right. It's a by-product of chasing your dreams and living your purpose.\\"And, in listing a number 22, Dr. Borsellino lists \\"The Most Damaging Lie of all--The Lie We Tell Ourselves,\\" and that being that we don't matter. His truth statement is: \\"Your life matters. You're not insignificant, irrelevant, or inadequate. God believes in you. God values you and has a dream for you.\\"The author has demonstrated his knowledge of psychological factors that play in the perpetuation of clich&eacute;s that we have heard over the years, but he also shows the spiritual side. I had never thought of these statements as \\"outrageous lies,\\" when I had repeated some to my own children, so I believe this is a strong assessment.

Seraphim Rose warned &quot;It's later than you think&quot;."},{"Title":"Not of This World: The Life and Teaching of Fr. Seraphim Rose","review":"After reading the reviews of others who have read this book, I must echo some of their sentiments as well as make a few observations of my own.First of all, this book is enormous (over a thousand pages.) It definately takes a commitment to make it through it. If one proceeds with caution it can be an extremely valuable read.First the praise: Fr. Seraphim's story is truly amazing. A disillusioned intellectual in San Francisco in the 1960s shuns the eastern religions he has clung to and converts to the Russian Orthodox Church. His conversion story is so touching because one could tell that he wanted the truth above all else in life, and thankfully he finally found it (as well as helping many others to find it throughout his life.) The part of the book that concentrates on his conversion is especially valuable to Americans or others brought up in a place with western European values (England, Austaralia, New Zealand, etc.) because he understood our modern times so well. Many people will recognize Fr. Seraphim's journey to Orthodoxy as their own: disillusioned with his protestant upbringing &amp; eastern religious experiments as well as being distraught with the notion that their is no meaning to life in the modern world, Fr. Seraphim found Christ in the Orthodox Tradition.Not only is his conversion inspiring, but his work as a monastic is mind boggling. He taught himself Russian so he could understand church services (in the 1960s it was difficult to find Orthodox churches that conducted services in English. In present day America, English services are the overwhelming majority.) Not only could he speak Russian, but he was highly literate too. He translated many, many valuable works of Russian spirituality into English. He also wrote original material in English and in Russian (he is loved in Russia where his works helped sustain Orthodox believers through communist opression.)My complaints are similar to those of others too. There is a LOT of politics in this book, especially towards the end of it. Fr. Seraphim was a meek &amp; gentle man who tried his best to avoid politics. Come to think of it, Fr. Seraphim is hardly mentioned in the last several chapters. Much of it is devoted to the activities of the Brotherhood after Fr. Seraphim's repose (+1982). The book has been a source of some controversy, but not in that it portrays Fr. Seraphim as saintly man...this is obviously the case. The problem is that the book tries to justify some questionable decisions made after Fr. Seraphim's repose.There is another life (thankfully much shorter) of Fr. Seraphim coming out soon from Regina Orthodox Press, hopefully it will be more about him and less about politics. Hopefully it will be the tribute Fr. Seraphim deserved.Once again, overall, it is a fabulous book...it just occasionally gets bogged down by excessive biographical details and the politics. If you keep these things in mind, and cut through all the crud...it still reveals a beautiful portrait of Fr. Seraphim."},{"Title":"Not of This World: The Life and Teaching of Fr. Seraphim Rose","review":"From an introduction to the book:&quot;The story of Fr. Seraphim Rose is not just the story of an individual; it is the story of what can occur in the conscience of the American soil, when God stirs the strings of the American sense of righteousness. Living as a monk in the mountains of northern California, he broke the shackles of his times and penetrated into the heart of ancient, otherworldly Christian experience, reconnecting fragmented Western man with his lost roots and showing him the way of return to God. Today his name is know and loved by millions throughout the world.At an early age, Eugene Rose - the young Fr. Seraphim - rebelled against the superficiality of modern American society and partook of the restlessness, despair, nihilism and lawlessness of the &quot;angry young men&quot; of his generation. He even tried to escape into the exotic realm of Buddhist enlightenment but his soul was still left empty and yearning. His forthright, self-sacrificing &quot;American cowboy&quot; character, however, pulled his back from these self-indulgent escapes and it was then that God revealed himself to Eugene's sorrowing soul. The conversion from modern American rebellion to ancient, apostolic Orthodoxy was begun. When he did come to Orthodoxy, he cut straight through all the externals - the worldliness and boring organizational mentality - to go right to the essence and heart of otherworldly Christianity. He has blazed the path for other honest, forthright American souls heeding their own American sense of righteousness.&quot;It's almost a stereotype to speak of a book which changes one's life, but in this case, for me it would be an understatement. There aren't many topics of inquiry for the modern spiritual searcher that aren't covered in this book, but it isn't just theory. This is the real ongoing history of ancient, esoteric, apostolic, transforming Christianity in it's American form. It's often said that &quot;Orthodoxy is one of the world's best kept secrets&quot;; This book reveals the inner heart of Orthodox Christianity as it can be lived in modern practice."},{"Title":"Not of This World: The Life and Teaching of Fr. Seraphim Rose","review":"This well written & extremely long book, over 1000 pages, was my churches spiritual manual for many years. How a 1950ish southern Californian Eastern Philosopher Beatnik named Eugene Rose, rejecting the so-called \\"Norm\\", turned into one of the most influential Eastern Orthodox monks of our time period. Later tonsured with the name of Fr. Seraphim Rose with a follow brother in Christ Gleb Podmoshensky tonsured Fr. Herman, they entered the Northern California forests to create a monastery & print shop called \\"St. Herman of Alaska Brotherhood\\", writing books that have effected & enlighten Eastern Europe & Russia during the Soviet oppression.As with other reviews, the book is fantastic as long as it focuses on Fr. Seraphim Rose's mission in life, with great photographs during his short but productive life. But once Fr, Seraphim Rose dies, the book turns into a private agenda about the monastery's fall out with ROCOR (Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia). The Great News is that the monastery is now under the Serbian Orthodox Church & the book has been extremely edited, deleting this major fault. Please check out \\"Father Seraphim Rose: His Life and Works\\" for a well waited focus on this hopefully Saint-To-Be."},{"Title":"Not of This World: The Life and Teaching of Fr. Seraphim Rose","review":"Despite its 1000-plus pages, this extremely well-written biography of Fr. Seraphim Rose (Eugene Rose) is not a difficult or tedious read; it is, as the saying goes, \\"a page turner.\\" The heart of the book describes Rose's intellectual and spiritual pilgrimage from agnosticism to Eastern Orthodoxy, culminating in his ordination to the priesthood and founding - with his spiritual brother Gleb (Fr. Herman) Podmoshensky - of St. Herman's Monastery in the mountains of northern California. Dozens of black-and-white photos make the people, places, and events come to life in a way that mere text would not be able to do.Handsome and intellectually gifted, Eugene Rose could have had anything the secular world had to offer. But, like Thomas Merton a generation before him, his dissatisfaction with modern life caused him to follow a different drummer. He began to explore the philosophical underpinnings of both Western and Eastern civilization. Originally drawn to Buddhism, he eventually gravitated towards Christianity, and - in particular - the mystical traditions of Eastern Orthodox monasticism.Much of the first part of the book is an intellectual tour-de-force, as we hear Rose's wide-ranging exploration and critique of the philosophies of East and West, of the great minds of world civilization, both ancient and modern, in fields ranging from science to literature, philosophy, music, religion, and popular culture. In particular, Rose focuses on what he regards as the spiritual decline of the West, its causes and - he hopes - its remedy. And the remedy is Eastern Orthodoxy, lived from the heart and not as mere habit or social convention, or as a religious sanction for a corrupt and decadent secular society.Rose's Orthodoxy is countercultural, conservative, and apocalyptic, yet it has an amazing quality of freshness and aliveness, of vitality and newness. That very sense of vitality and adventure seems to have alarmed many in the Orthodox church hierarchy, and Rose's numerous conflicts with church authority occupy much of the latter half of the book. (I vividly recall overhearing a Russian Orthodox priest make disparaging remarks about Fr. Seraphim Rose when I attended a Russian church festival in Seattle in the late 1990s.)Rose's piety is not for everyone, however. It represents an idealization of monasticism, poverty, celibacy, liturgy, sobriety, and prayer that few in the modern world appear willing or able to follow all the way. Thus Rose and his spiritual heirs see themselves as forming a modern \\"catacomb\\" church, a church living precariously on the margins of society, possibly facing persecution in a not-too-distant future. In this, they are somewhat in agreement with evangelical Protestantism and Catholic traditionalism, both of which view the modern world as living in a state of apostasy and thus increasingly subject to demonic influences.There is thus a danger that the St. Herman Brotherhood will end up as a cult, living in paranoid isolation from a sinful world. This is not a prediction, just a danger, and it would be most unfortunate, as Fr. Seraphim Rose represented in his own life a much needed renewal of the ideals of Christian monasticism, an element of sanity in a world gone mad.One final note: an updated (and slightly longer) version of this book exists under the title: \\"Fr. Seraphim Rose: His Life and Teachings.\\" Because of the considerable overlap, many readers will perhaps want to read one or the other of these books, but not both. (The earlier version of the book - the one I am reviewing - follows events up until the late 1980s, several years after Fr. Rose's untimely death, so it is a complete biography. The extra material in the new book is supplementary and interesting, but not essential.)"},{"Title":"Not of This World: The Life and Teaching of Fr. Seraphim Rose","review":"_Not of This World: The Life and Teaching of Fr. Seraphim Rose, Pathfinder to the Heart of Ancient Christianity_ by Monk Damascene is an excellent biography of an American who converted to the Russian Orthodox Church (ROCOR) and founded the St. Herman of Alaska monastery and printing house in the mountains and forests of northern California. Probably his most well known book is _Orthodoxy and the Religion of the Future_ in which Fr. Seraphim examined today's bizarre spiritual phenomena, such as charismatic Christianity, UFO encounters and eastern religious cults in the light of ancient Orthodox Church teaching. Fr. Seraphim is also the author of _The Soul After Death_, which describes the Orthodox doctrine on the spirit realm and life after death. His magnum opus, _The Kingdom of Man and the Kingdom of God_, a metahistorical study of Man's attempt to supplement God's Kingdom with an earthly Utopia in this life, remained incomplete.There seems to be a lot of controversy surrounding _Not of This World_, it being &quot;written with an agenda.&quot; This is ridiculous, seeing as how every single book ever published has been written with an agenda, consciously or unconsciously, for good or for ill. This is a great book on a man who rejected the materialist &quot;American Dream&quot; and traveled the cross-bearing, ascetic path of Christ.Born Eugene Rose, Fr. Seraphim's early years were wrought with much spiritual seeking. He at first embraced Nietzsche's nihilistic philosophy, but also became interested in Zen Buddhism and the writings of Rene Guenon. Through Guenon, Rose realized the need for an authentic religious tradition. However great Guenon's metaphysical thought was however, the true Faith was only to be realized in Truth Incarnate Jesus Christ.A large proportion of the material in this book is from Fr. Herman (Gleb Podmoshensky), a Russian &eacute;migr&eacute; who aided Fr. Seraphim in establishing the St. Herman Skete. A host of different bishops, priests, missionaries, and groups is examined in detail, including Archbishop John, Archbishop Averky, and Bishop Nektary.A predominant theme in the book is the brotherhood's struggle with the Church hierarchy. This book appears to be radically &quot;right-wing&quot; and anti-establishment, but in fact Fr. Seraphim criticized both the far right &quot;the ultra-correct group&quot; and the left wing/liberal groups and trendy theological innovators in the Church. He emphasized the \\"Orthodoxy of the Heart,\\" without pretenses, squabbling and rule-mongering.The end of _Not of This World_ deals with Fr. Seraphim's emphasis on the Apocalypse, and the crumbling structures of the word's churches, and the eminent reign of the Antichrist. What motivated him to work so hard for his faith was &quot;it is later than you think.&quot; Fr. Seraphim's books have been more widespread in Russia than in America, and it is hoped that &quot;Russia will arise&quot; in a Christian Orthodox revival before the end comes. He died at the age of forty-eight after a stomach ailment, and appears to be the candidate to be the first Orthodox American convert Saint.The book does get tedious and bogged down in minutiae in some areas, in addition to highlight the fighting going on in the Russian Church. But in all, a great book on Orthodoxy, a modern day American &quot;beatnik&quot; intellectual's journey into it, and the spiritual crisis of our age."},{"Title":"Not of This World: The Life and Teaching of Fr. Seraphim Rose","review":"Sadly, this book which should be the life of Fr. Seraphim Rose, reads more like &quot;The Life and Times of Gleb Podmoshensky (a.k.a. Abbot Herman).&quot; We are, however, treated to information about Fr. Seraphim's youth and conversion to Orthodoxy as well as his work with the St. Herman's Brotherhood.Strewn throughout these pages is constant reference to church bickering, which Fr. Seraphim would have been very disappointed over to see in print. All of the politicking is simply a build up to justify Abbot Herman's defrocking and subsequent seeking of uncanonical recognition. Often throughout the book, it seemed as if the topic of the book was Abbot Herman and not Fr. Seraphim.Fr. Seraphim lived and reposed loyal to the Russian Church Abroad. Unreported in this volume are some of his very strong words at the time of his repose (death) to Abbot Herman regarding their association. Other characters were also misrepresented in this book. This book should be edited down to size with all of the politics removed. Only then would it be a fitting tribute to a Hieromonk who was and still continues to be a source of inspiration to many."},{"Title":"Not of This World: The Life and Teaching of Fr. Seraphim Rose","review":"In this book, it mentions that, \\"A truth-seeker, when he finds the truth in Orthodoxy, must then stop his searching. His path to Orthodoxy, which is on a horizontal plane, has ended, and now he must go 'vertically,' deeper into Orthodoxy.\\" This book has help me to do just that! I've been Orthodox for 14 years, and I can't begin to describe how much deeper my relationship with God is now. I'm compelled to pray more, to read the scriptures more, and to help others seeking Truth. My copy is flagged with dozens of Post-It Notes and is highlighted throughout. I want to buy another copy, so I can keep mine, and share the other.By the way, why is the fact that it's a 1000 page book a detriment? I prefer books of that size - otherwise they are finished too quickly!"},{"Title":"Mathematics in Western Culture.","review":"I agree with the above review and would simply like to add my own thoughts. The book illustrates the fascinating way in which mathematics, society, religion, politics and of course physics have affected each other (it goes both ways!) through out the ages. Furthermore, the author nicely illustrates the processes by which people think and how those processes have also changed through the ages (i.e., The Age of Reason versus The Renisance). This book left me with real insights as to the nature and limitations of the current state of mathematics and physics. Things are not as they seem, my friend! Lastly, the author displays an appreciation for the humor and irony of the history which makes this book hard to put down at times. I never thought a math/history book could be a &quot;page turner&quot;... Read it."},{"Title":"Mathematics in Western Culture.","review":"In most mathematics classes, students are presented with a completed edifice, and given a floor plan to help them navigate the halls. While this approach works for many people, others need a little more basic information. In this book, Morris Kline builds the building, starting with the mud and straw of the bricks.&quot;Mathematics in Western Culture&quot; shows that the history of mathematics is one of hundreds of years of people sitting in the sand, drawing shapes and lines, scratching their heads, and trying to figure things out. This is not necessarily Dr. Kline's intention for the book, but this is certainly one of the many messages to be derived from it.A fascinating, exciting book which makes mathematics more understandable and accessible."},{"Title":"Mathematics in Western Culture.","review":"Kline's work is a breath of fresh air and an electric shock all in one. His handling of both the history of math and the math itself intertwine so well that you finish the work actually &quot;knowing&quot; for sure what you thought you knew in high school or college math classes. Having read this book one could argue that Kepler was the greatest scienctific mind ever, and actually be able to defend the thesis. A must read."},{"Title":"Mathematics in Western Culture.","review":"I graduated in physics several years ago. It happens in life that you first do things and later you understand what you have done. With this book it happened to me to understand most of what I have studied after I have read it. It was a turning point in my life and in my career too. This doesn't mean it will be the same for everybody but surely that was my experience. Since I have read it, I have never forgot the following paragraph.When earth was put apartGranted that it was the superior mathematics of the new theory which inspired Copernicus and Kepler, and later Galileo, to repudiate religious convictions, scientific arguments, common sense, and well-entrenched habits of thought, how did the theory help to shape modern times?First, Copernican theory has done more to determine the content of modern science than is generally recognized. The most powerful and most useful single law of science is Newton's law of gravitation. Without anticipating here the discussion reserved for a more appropriate place in this book we can say that the best experimental evidence for this law, the evidence which established it, depends entirely on the heliocentric theory.Second, this theory is responsible for a new trend in science and human thought, barely perceptible, at the time but all-important today. Since our eyes do not see, nor our bodies feel, the rotation and revolution of the Earth, the new theory rejected the evidence of the senses- Things were not what they seemed to be. Sense data could be misleading and reason was the reliable guide. Copernicus and Kepler thereby set the precedent that guides modern science, namely, that reason and mathematics are more important in understanding and interpreting the universe than the evidence of the senses. Vast portions of electrical and atomic theory and the whole theory of relativity would never have been conceived if scientists had not come to accept the reliance upon reason first exemplified by Copernican theory. In this very significant sense Copernicus and Kepler began the Age of Reason, in addition to fulfilling the cardinal function of scientists and mathematicians, that is, to provide a rational comprehension of the universe.By deflating the stock of Homo sapiens, Copernican theory reopened questions that the guardians of Western civilization had been answering dogmatically upon the basis of Christian theology. Once there had been only one answer; now there are ten or twenty to such basic questions as: Why does man desire to live and for what purpose? Why should he be moral and principled? Why seek to preserve the race? It is one thing for man to answer such questions in the belief that he is the child and ward of a generous, powerful and provident God. It is another to answer them knowing that he is a speck of dust in a cyclone.Mathematics in Western culture, Morris Kline, 1953"},{"Title":"Mathematics in Western Culture.","review":"Really an excellent book, although it is philosophy of math, it is easy to understand. We could know then, how important the math in promoting the society!"},{"Title":"Mathematics in Western Culture.","review":"This is a book about the philosophy of mathematics. The author considers the effect of development of mathematics on many aspects of our culture including music, art, and various sciences.I purchased the book because it was selected by Prof. Judith V. Grabiner as \\"essential reading\\" for Lecture One in her course, \\"Mathematics, Philosophy, and the \`Real World'\\", produced by The Great Courses (formerly The Teaching Company). She says of this book in the course bibliography: \\"A magisterial work, addressing many of the topics in this Teaching Company course in its 472 pages. Though it does not reflect scholarship since the 1960s [copyright 1953] and reserves a good deal of its sympathies for those who share the modern Western worldview, it orients the reader well and contains many insights.\\"The reader does not have to know mathematics beyond high school to understand this book. It is more about the role mathematics has played in the development of the rest of western culture than it is about how mathematics works.Kline, in several places in the book, forced his basic premise by concluding that modern thought in many disciplines would not be important without the influence of mathematics. For example, in Chapter XVIII, in a discussion of Literature, he argues: \\"...Just as the successful businessman in the twentieth-century America has become the authority in our time, so mathematicians, successful in revealing and phrasing the order in nature, became the arbiters of the language, style, spirit, and content of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century literature. The biggest literary figures of the age decided that their writings were inferior in all respects to the mathematical and scientific works and that prose and poetry could be improved by following these examples...\\"If the reader can get past these over-zealous conclusions, there are many thought-provoking sections which make this a good read. Kline closes the book with the statement: \\"...Mathematics is variously described as a body of knowledge, as a practical tool, as a cornerstone of philosophy, as the perfection of logical method, as the key to nature, as the reality in nature, as an intellectual game, as an adventure in reason, and as an aesthetic experience.\\" He made a good argument for all of those conclusions. I was glad I read the entire book.I purchased the Kindle version for the ease of reading in bed [472 pages!], and the convenience of having the Kindle dictionary handy. I am satisfied with my purchase, and believe it met Professor Grabiner's and my expectations as a foundation test for her excellent course."},{"Title":"Mathematics in Western Culture.","review":"This book gives you an excellent introduction to the role of mathematics in real life without making heavy demands on your comprehension of mathematics.

Aids and Research Tools in Ancient Near Eastern Studies No.3. By Daniel C. Snell. 140 pp. Malibu : Undena Publications, 1979. ISBN 0-890003-058-8 (pbk.)The author tells us that the idea for this workbook came from the 'Japanese Kana Workbook' by P. G. O'Neill (Palo Alto and Tokyo : Kodansha International 1967), a highly successful workbook for teaching the Japanese syllabary.Snell's cuneiform workbook gives a similar course of programmed instruction that teaches the 110 most frequently used cuneiform signs. It teaches the standard Neo-Assyrian sign forms, and a method encouraging active use of the signs is presented on the grounds that an active knowledge of the signs will stay with the student longer.The signs are divided into eight sections. Each section contains step-by-step exercises and ends with a quiz reviewing all the signs presented. Two appendices provide an alphabetic list of values taught and a list of the signs.The 'Workbook' is designed for home study by students in beginning Akkadian classes and provides a practical and systematic introduction to the cuneiform writing system. It should be used in conjunction with R. Labat's 'Manuel d'Epigraphie akkadienne' (5th ed., Paris : Geuthner, 1976).The book measures 8.5 by 11.0 inches, is well-printed on strong paper, and is bound in a sturdy wrapper. In both design and procedure it follows O'Neill's popular and highly effective 'Kana Workbook' very closely.Snell's 'Workbook' is an excellent book which achieves what it sets out to do. Since it covers only 110 signs, it won't of course turn the user into a full-fledged scribe. But it will be of value to beginners in cuneiform, and it should help dispel some of the mystery which surrounds the beautiful but complicated cuneiform signs."},{"Title":"Workbook of Cuneiform Signs (Aids and research tools in ancient Near Eastern studies)","review":"I newly purchased this book.

Faggot to You!\\" Perhaps looking to distance himself further from his humor essays, his second novel, \\"Looking for It\\" comes off as rather dark in spots, though overall realistic and with a positive message.The novel tells us about a group of gay men in a small upstate NY town. The main character is Mike, bartender at The Engine Room, the only gay bar in about a two hour radius; Mike is kind of a free spirit who has no long term plans or any conscious desire to settle down. On the other end of the spectrum is Stephen, a closeted accountant whose sex life is solely imaginary with online partners, and Thomas, a closeted Episcopal priest dealing with feelings he had thought were successfully repressed. Add in a mature gay couple whose relationship is trying to survive the \\"seven year itch,\\" and a wise old queen named Simon who has resogned himself to be alone since the death of his longtime partner, and you have most of the characters for the novel's coverage of developments in their lives between Halloween and New Years of a recent year. There are some steps forward, some steps backward, and some tough decisions that could affect their makers for many years to come. The \\"dark\\" part of the story comes mostly from the involvement of an additional character, a self-hating \\"straight\\" men using violence to deal with his homosexual urges, preying upon the insecurity of gay men he encountered at a porn cinema and via the internet.I thought the story was somewhat predictable, though the characters were original, portrayed well and put in realistic situations for small town living. The overall message is a positive one, of \\"community\\" and entended families, although it also seems to suggest that gay men, at least in small towns such as this, really don't know what they want out of life, even if it is in front of their eyes.

It wasn't completely unenjoyable, but I would have expected better from such an experienced and prolific writer as Mr. Ford.He does create a good sense of the story's setting and location, and I rather liked Simon, the eldest member of the cast. The erotic passages are well-written but their explicitness seems very out of place. Overall, Ford has a tendency to use 10 words when half that number would suffice."},{"Title":"Looking For It","review":"By no means a great book, but not mediocre, either. Any book that stimulates this highly unsentimental reader to tear up not just once, but thrice, leaves an indelibly positive imprint. Yes, the saccharine ending is a little incredulous, but still it is invigorating to have \\"positive\\" models and outcomes, even if they seem only to occur in fiction. The difference, here, though, is that I saw myself and many others through Ford's perspicuous, variegated prism. Maybe the story is little bit overdrawn, but in another universe, all these facets do indeed occur.Ford weaves a number of tales about several gay men residing in a rural, upstate New York community. That the characters all \\"represent\\" different facets of the gay community, rather than some monolithic homogeneity, is exceptionally refreshing, if at the same time, a little too literarily convenient. Ages, interests, backgrounds, types, are all multifaceted, like the real world, not the world of youthful Los Angeles (which, for some unknown reason, seems to be the epicenter of most gay fiction).The monolithic, stereotypical, homogeneous \\"gay\\" community is a myth, but there are certain patterns of behavior and action that a great many gay men share -- and usually at different stages of life. Without reducing the \\"gay community\\" to a stereotypical farce, Ford enchants the reader with beguiling, yet normative, characters. Several are extremely endearing; others are a nightmare, literally. Some are simply caricatures. But the one thing all but one of these characters desire, more than lust, is affection, fellowship, and intimacy. Finally a gay novel that extols something more than lust.Ford's storytelling talents are excellent. Just enough information to give the reader a \\"feel\\" of things, but no over-lording the narrative with supercilious metaphor to distract. I've grown up in a small town, but have no adult experience of one. This book seems to capture that small-town feel authentically. In many ways, I think the experience is not that much different from a metropolis, but I would expect a certain, \\"closed-in\\" feeling to be different, and Ford seizes it.A final word about lust. It is frequent, raw, and intense. It may even startle some shy gay readers, but, hey, that's part of the picture too. It's often prurient, occasionally vile, but most of the time genuinely and sensitively expressed. Indeed, Ford draws the viable distinction between a f**k and making love, and that's part of the scene, too. Maybe I am more of a sentimentalist than I thought; I know I am a romantic. Those readers on the \\"edge\\" probably will not enjoy this book. Those who look forward to inclusive marriage definitely will."},{"Title":"Looking For It","review":"Told from the point of view of several different men who all are connected by their visits to a gay bar in a small town, this is a story with humor, tragedy and love. Don't expect tremendous depth, but it is a good \\"beach read.\\" Or, if you are the soap opera type, you'd like this, because it has varying storylines and reaches dramatic highs and lows.Mike, the bartender, finds his path crosses with a priest, Thomas, who is just discovering his true nature. Both are looking for love. Stephen, a shy accountant who is too close to his parents (emotionally and geographically), is nearing a point in his life where everyone must know the truth. John and Russell are a committed couple finding their relationship is stale, and maybe not permanent. Simon is the wise \\"old queen\\" that younger gays run to for advice. In his 60s, he misses his longtime companion and believes that love is in his past because of his age. Pete Thayer is one of most interesting characters, bringing a dark and dangerous element to the story. He seems to be bi, but has a hatred for gays, especially after he rapes them.If you like the humor, hunt, and cattiness of bars, this will appeal to you, because a healthy chunk of the book takes place in the bar where Mike works, and has many scenes of the characters sitting, drinking and talking. The storyline with Simon was brave and rare, covering what seems like a very realistic life of a gay senior. I think the John and Russell portion could have been completely left out of the book, but the good thing is you can fast-read through the slower portions and get to the parts you like. And I don't just mean the love scenes. While those scenes seem inserted rather than a natural outflow of the story, they will surely please the readers who like red-hot juiciness in their storyline. Just be aware that some of those scenes are graphically straight/bi (Pete's situation) and horrifyingly violent (again, Pete)."},{"Title":"Looking For It","review":"I very much enjoyed Michael Thomas Ford's first attempt at gay fiction, but I really thought this book was superb - much better than the first. The way he develops the characters is excellent - especially Simon and Walter the two older men, and their forty-year relationship. All the characters are very interesting, including the rather pathetic portrayal of the gay-basher. I highly recommend this work for all gay readers."},{"Title":"Looking For It","review":"Last year Michael Thomas Ford shook up the gay literary scene with his charming novel Last Summer. I liked it so much that I even placed it in my top ten best books of 2003. There was a freshness and honesty to Ford's work that was impossible not to like. In his latest novel, Looking For It, Ford again centers on a group of gay men and presents an eclectic tapestry of their often disparate, incongruent lives. Whereas Last Summer had a light, breezy, almost sit-com feel to it, Looking For It, is much darker. This is a powerful, hard-hitting novel that doesn't shy away from savage, violent sexuality. Themes of gay bashing, bar life, gay spirituality, and middle-aged loneliness are all presented in a tight, taught narrative. And while the sex is almost pornographic, it is never gratuitous, as Ford manages to juxtapose these blunt scenes with sections of profound tenderness and humour.The story centers on a group of gay men living in Cold Falls, a small town in upstate New York. Christmas is on the way, and as the first snow falls, life for these men is about to bring about profound changes as they all look for sex, romance, companionship and spirituality. Mike, a hunky, sensitive barman works at the Engine Room, a small local gay bar, but when he meets and falls in love with Thomas, the local Episcopal priest, he begins to profoundly question his life and job. John and Russell have been together for seven years, but John's steadfast inflexibility has begun to annoy Russell. Acting on impulse, Russell decides to have a break from the relationship and move in temporarily with Simon, an older man who is mourning the loss of his partner of many years.The shy, reclusive and somewhat closeted Stephen still lives next door to his parents, and haunts late night adult bookstores and online chat rooms looking for anonymous sex. He gets more than he bargained for when Pete, a blue-collar mechanic, who is full of self-hatred about his own homosexuality, savagely beats him. There's an absolutely riveting subplot involving the violent, alcohol fuelled sex obsessed Pete when he almost murders another of the main characters after meeting them though the same local Internet chat room.At times the narrative tends to become cluttered and some readers may find it hard to keep track of all the characters as Ford seems intent on having each character run the total gamut of gay life from coming out to one's parents to questions of faith and worship. But the central message of the novel remains current as the characters meet to celebrate the holiday season and talk about the importance of family, the relevance of religion, their respective sexual practices, and gay marriage. Although parts of the story are dark and sexuality shadowy, there is always a feeling that true love will conquer all.It is obvious that Ford's target audience is gay men, but the themes in Looking for It are quite universal and are told from a youthful and romantic viewpoint. This is essentially an idealistic and somewhat quixotic story, with its characters facing dramatic events and, at times, great danger, but Ford's simple, direct, and restrained style help reveal great depths of character and keep the plot moving along briskly. And Like Last Summer, the cover art for Looking For It is absolutely beautiful. Mike Leonard October 04."},{"Title":"Looking For It","review":"This is my first novel by Michael Thomas Ford; previously I had read and enjoyed his humorous essay collection THAT'S MISTER FAGGOT TO YOU, and I was interested to see how he measured up to the challenge of a full-length work of fiction.Ford does not disappoint. He presents us with a fairly large cast for a novel: seven principal characters, to all of whom he gives pretty much equal time. The book takes place in upstate New York, territory that Ford obviously knows well, since the novel has an excellent sense of place.There's Mike the bartender, who is sort of the central character by default, since his friends are also patrons at the gay bar where he works.There's Stephen the accountant, a man still half in the closet, who hides behind his job as a way of avoiding having his family find out about him.There are Russell and John, a couple of seven years' standing who are at a crisis in their relationship.There is Father Thomas Dunn, the priest at the local Episcopal Church, a man who has avoided dealing with his sexuality by hiding behind his vestments, but who is soon to face the necessity of dealing with his feelings.There is Simon Bird, a somewhat older man whose longtime companion died a year ago and who is torn between the grief he still feels and the need to move on and keep living.There is Greg Mihalski, a co-worker of Russell's whom Russell tries to fix up with Stephen, with results that are complex, to say the least.And finally, there is Pete Thayer, an auto mechanic so deep in the closet that he refers to gay men as \\"faggots\\" constantly and whose forays into the seedier side of gay sex often end in violence.With the exception of Thayer, most of the characters know each other at the beginning of the story, and by the middle of the book, Father Dunn, previously the only outsider, has been taken into the family when he quite unexpectedly falls in love with Mike.Ford has a little trouble keeping track of his narrative; early in the novel he has Thomas fantasizing about Mike stepping out of the shower, but later on it is Mike who has the memory. Also one subsidiary character, the church's music director, is a fixture of thirty years' standing at the beginning of the novel, but later tells Simon that he came to town only three years ago. I really can't lay all the blame on Ford; for one thing, I have seen this sort of thing happen to writers as \\"big\\" as Stephen King, and for another, I used to work in publishing and these sorts of errors are what editors are for.This is not a very long book, at only a little more than three hundred pages, but there is a lot in it, everything from romance to sex to camp to gay-bashing to coming out. And for the most part Ford juggles these many plot elements like an old pro.Altogether a first-class job."},{"Title":"Looking For It","review":"I was wandering a lot around Michael Thomas Ford, never deciding to buy one since, first there were so many to choose from that I didn't know where to start and second I was worried to become addicted and knowing me if I liked one than I for sure I would have bought all of them. So I waited and waited and then in a gay bookstore they were all there, looking at me from the shelves and they are so pretty with those covers that I picked one. The saleswoman told me pick one random, they are all good and my choice was Looking for it.It's strange, usually I don't like stories with two much characters, I never know for whom to care for and always feel like no one of them has enough space. And above all, at least one of them has not an happy ending. And instead Looking for it made me rethink on my assumptions. It's true, it's the choral story of a groups of friends, all of them gay and all of them represents a way to face gay life. There is Mike, the bartender of the Engine Room, the pub where all of them gather. He seems the more steady of them, always ready to listen to other problems. But also Mike has his bad experience in the past and maybe he is alone since he fears to be burnt again. But Mike is a too good guy to stay alone forever and so enter Father Thomas Dunn, the new episcopal pastor of the S. Peter's Church, the same church where some of the above friends go. So, in a way, Mike and Thomas do the same work, they listen to people problem trying to forget that also them have their own relationship issue. Thomas was in love with a fellow seminarist, a boy he didn't have the courage to love and who died. Since then, Thomas's guilty grew so much that now he is convinced that his punishment is to be alone forever. What I liked of Mike and Thomas' story is that it was without angst; both of them new that it was not an easy relationship but they faced it with an easiness that made it sweet and tender.The other known couple in the novel is John and Russell, who are facing the classic 7 years love relationship crisis. They love each other, but they arrived in a moment in life and in their relationship, where the other is granted, and you believe that you haven't to prove your love. John and Russell were since the beginning a strange couple, Russell full of joy and life, and John so quiet and shy. Probably this is the reason why they love each other, but living together is a play of balancing, and probably they forgot that. It will be not easy for them to find a way to stay together, but what I liked of their story is that they never stopped to love each other.Then there is Simon, one of the best character of all. He is 65 years old and recently \\"widower\\". His more than 40 life partner died of cancer the year before, and Simon is wondering why he didn't die with him. He has friends, a place to stay but he is alone, and at his age he doesn't believe possible to have a second chance in love. And even if it was, how will he recognize it? He was out of the dating game for so much that the rules are all changed, and he doesn't know if he likes how they are playing now.The last two men, but not the least important, are Stephen and Greg. In a way they are similar, they both are in the closet but in the opposite way: Greg came out simply living his family and all he knew to live in another city, among strangers who accept him for who he is and not for who they want him to be. Stephen instead is out with his friends but completely in the closet with his family, and living one door next the other it's quite impossible to have a normal relationship. So both of them are limiting their relationship to one night standings, believing in this way to quench the thirst of love they have, and instead gathering so much need inside that sooner or later they will explode.On a side note there is also the story of Pete, probably the sadder of all. A man who was raised believing that being gay is the worst evil of all, and that has no way to understand his needs and feelings. The only way to claim them is with violence. Even if he is not a \\"good\\" guy, I think the author considered him another of his boys, another way to live being gay, I wish this one being the less chosen, but I know that in reality, for many people is the only one. I can't hate Pete, neither after knowing what he did, I can only feel a great pain for him.On a closing note, Looking for It is a wonderful romance, and it's also pretty sexy, something I seldom have the chance to find in a more mainstream novel. The sex scenes are all good, even the one that serves to the author to prove something, they are enough but not too much, and above all, they are more romantic than free.And now my only problem is how to choose the next one among the Michael Thomas Ford's novels..."},{"Title":"Looking For It","review":"Although I read the entire book, I found it more depressing than enjoyable. I enjoy gay and lesbian fiction, but there was so much unnecessary sex in this book that it took away from the actual story line.The scenes with Pete Thayer, a blatant homophobe who harbors homosexual tendencies, were especially explicit and, in some cases, disgusting, and I felt they did nothing to explain his beliefs and his character.There are lots of good fiction books out there dealing with gay men, but LOOKING FOR IT isn't one of them."},{"Title":"Looking For It","review":"When I read gay-themed novels, I usually have low expectations, which is a shame. I have read Michael Thomas Ford's humorous essay books and thoroughly enjoyed them, but was hesitant to pick up one of his novels. I was very pleasantly surprised! In this book he creates a string of characters and manages to connect them all as they come together for a summer in Provincetown, MA, which serves as an excellent back-drop for the story. The characterization is excellent and the humor sprinkled throughout made it that much more fun to read. But what kept my interest the most is how accurately gay relationships were depicted, from the friends, the commited couples, to the not-so-commited couples, to the \\"newbies\\", to the parents, to the relationships on the rocks. Much of the book felt like non-fiction to me, because of how accurately the relationships were portrayed. Some readers may find the connections in the storylines to be too convenient or forced, but I was so enjoying the book that I just went with it. I think the flaws are easily overlooked. Prudes beware, there are some graphic descriptions of gay sex!"},{"Title":"Looking For It","review":"In My Big Fat Queer Life, Ford admits to the use of prescriptions-I wonder if this has changed his writing ability. This extremely dark story weaves flat, surface characters together with interlocking storylines and the solution of sex at the end of most chapters. I love Ford's style but I what I do not like is his need to cram all of these characters into one book. A book about a priest and a bartender would have been a lovely read, or a book about a deranged man trying to figure out why he's gay, or even a book about why two lovers should stay together, yet all of these characters thrown together in a dump cake is too much. Naming two of the main characters after oneself (Mike and Thomas) is self-inflating. The role of the self-hating gay man made the story dark (although I believe Ford was trying to convey being gay in a small town) and seemed out of place. This character seemed problematic as if it was going to turn out to be an SM erotic tale, not a book about families and how we form them. Ford writes horror very well, but next time he needs to keep it out of a summer book."},{"Title":"Looking For It","review":"I LOVED THE CHARACTERS...THESE CHARACTERS ARE DESCRIBED WITH SUCH PERFECTION - I FEEL LIKE I KNOW THEM SO WELL BY THE END OF EACH CHAPTER - The detail ford writes is just breath-taking!"},{"Title":"Looking For It","review":"I really do like Michael Ford, his stories are easy to read and there is a familiar trend in each story. I wish this story had more detail in certain events and eventually it became predictable with the characters. I was thrown a curve ball in one chapter, but the rest was more or less foreseen. It was still a nice read, but wish he would have taken it to the next level. Last Summer was excellent, but it was my first novel of his and it got me hooked. I do plan on continuing on reading his novels."},{"Title":"1 And 2 Samuel: An Introduction and Commentary (Tyndale Old Testament Commentaries)","review":"Baldwin's book is a concise christian oriented commentary on the Book of Samuel. Baldwin's book is for the reader who wants a quick reference to better understand the Book of Samuel 1 &amp; 2. However, the academic may become a little perturb when reading the book because Baldwin on occasion proselytizes. Baldwin undoubtedly has a firm understanding of not only the Book of Samuel, but also the bible in general. I would recommend the book to anyone who is attempting to quickly understand some of subtleties contained in the Book of Samuel, however, I am sure there are more thorough commentaries published for the more serious of mind."},{"Title":"1 And 2 Samuel: An Introduction and Commentary (Tyndale Old Testament Commentaries)","review":"Good analysis, but due to its publication date doesn't include upto date historical and archaeological information"},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"Little House on the Prairie by Laura Ingalls Wilder is a classic about Wilder's life as a child settling in Indian Country. It tells what life was like back then, and it is from the point of view of someone who actually experienced it, which is cool. It begins by telling what it was like, being in he covered wagon for so long. Once they reach their destination, Wilder describes in great detail how their house was built, little by little. These parts sometimes got boring, but sometimes they were interesting, like most of this book was. This book did get a bit racist, sharing the settlers' view that Indians were all wild and crazy, and the land was rightfully the Whites' (not). It got a bit annoying when Wilder included parts like when Pa started to Say something but Ma hushed him. I, like Laura, wanted to know what he was going to say, but only they knew. This was a pretty good, interesting, historical book which I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"The book is gorgeous and arrived early.

My views of different subjects have changed drastically since then. I am now well aware about what was happening in America during this time. When I was eight, I think what attracted me to this book was that Laura was my age. I wanted to see what her life was like during this time.Since I haven't read this book in roughly ten years, I'm going to re-read it and review it again. One review is from what I remember as a child, and next week I'll go back and read the book, this time from a different view.My review as an 8-yr-old (I want to say 1992):I remember being excited that Charles wanted to move his family to the prairie. I don't remember why. I think it had something to do with Wisconsin being too crowded. I vaguely remember a section about Laura and Mary playing outside and being surprised when a new neighbor settled down miles from them.I loved the part about their journey and Jack the bulldog walking faithfully beside the wagon. Then there was the frozen creek and the part where they made it across just before the ice broke. That scared me as a child because I kept thinking, \\"They could have died!\\"As the story unfolds, we learn that Pa settles down and builds a cabin in Indian Territory, the family becomes sick and are nursed back to health by an African American doctor, Pa takes Mary and Laura to Indian creek where the girls bring back clay beads for Carrie. Then, the ending made me said. The family is forced off their land. Charles and Caroline have a garden that they will have to leave behind for the rabbits. Mary and Laura are cranky because they don't want to leave.There was one part that stuck out in my mind. As the family is leaving they comes across an abandoned wagon with two people living inside. I don't remember why the couple is stranded. The book might have said something about the Indians stealing their horses? I don't remember. What I could think about was, \\"I hope they make it somewhere safe?\\" It worried me a lot as a child.That is all I can remember. I seem to recall being upset when I asked the librarian why the Laura Ingalls books were considered fiction when she wrote about her childhood, and she replied with, \\"Because Laura made up a lot of stuff. She was old when she wrote the books and couldn't remember much.\\" ArgThat's my 8-yr-old review. I'm going to start re-reading this now. I'll update my review in a few days."},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"I had to have this book for my collection of Little House books.

I completely neglected them growing up, (while my sister devoured them,) preferring instead to read them out loud to my children in my 40's. I thought they would be decent stories, but I had no idea how powerful and extremely well crafted they are. Absolutely some of the finest historical fiction ever written. Justly famous.The thing that impresses me most about this book is the shear guts and determination of Pa Ingles to root up his family from a particularly nice setup in Wisconsin, and travel about 600 miles to the south to Kansas territory, to setup a homestead on the prairie approximately 40 miles from the nearest city.His resources? His back, a sharp ax, and an incredible will to provide for his families. Truly, an epic example of the pioneer spirit if ever their was one. Pa Ingles is as real as they come, the the book actually hinges on his decision to move, (and ultimately his decision to leave.)The book is utterly fascinating, and is as close to perfect literature of its kind as exists. You simply cannot keep from reading it until its finished.These books are VASTLY superior to the Michael Landon TV versions, believe me. In fact, except for the names and relative ages, the two are almost entirely dissimilar. The tone and feel are so different. Do NOT judge this book by the TV show, (which I never cared for. I watched it, but I never really liked it.)Get the whole series. Get everything she ever wrote. (Even the last one that was unpublished during her lifetime.) Her daughter Rose had a major hand in editing and revising these books, and though her voice does not show through, her efforts are indispensable in making these books what they are.

Also, I think fifth or sixth graders would like this book because this is a cute book and it is cool to learn how people lived back then, then compare it to the life we live now. The author put in really descriptive words that could paint a picture in my head and feel like I was in the story. If you read this book, you would want to read the next book because you want to see what happens next. If you don't like one book, you'll probably like the next one because the story is an adventure for you every time and, the book matures as you read more of the series.

I also learned that there was a sickness called fever 'n' ague that was really malaria that some mosquitoes give it to people.I would recommend this book for three reasons.

Laura tells of the trek across the central US, over the frozen Mississippi River, past mile after mile of empty spaces and tall grasses, till they reached the site where Pa decided they would stay. The family builds a log cabin by hand and digs a well, plants gardens and Pa hunts jackrabbits under the huge blue sky. There are neighbors, the Scotts, who come from Indiana, and the \\"Tennessee Wildcat' Mr. Edwards, who is an especially good friend to the Ingalls family and the girls. The best parts of this novel were the ones that had to do with Jack, the family's bulldog, who was fierce and fearless in his defense of his loved ones. A close second to the stories of Jack is the tale of the Christmas spent in the cabin, when floods made a visit from Mr. Edwards--and Santa--unlikely...and yet an improbable miracle comes to pass. The stories here are at once heartwarming and informative, and the segments that tell of Indian relations (especially if one looks outside the novel at the events going on in that time and place) make for an invalubale first-hand view of an era in US history typically described only by those who were never there."},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"Little House on the Prairie was a very good book, I thought. This book was written in the 1930s, while Mrs. Wilder was in her 60s. Laura Ingalls Wilder's describes her beloved story of a pioneer girl and her family in her Little House books series. They have been cherished by generations of readers as both a unique glimpse into America's frontier past and a heartwarming, unforgettable story. I really enjoyed hearing about the way she grew up in the Midwest going through hardships, but always pulling through because of the close bond she had with her family. In this book Little House on the Prairie the Ingalls family decide to move from Wisconsin to Kansas and build a new home on the prairie. Which this was only one of the moves of many more to come. They face many hardships while traveling, build a new little cabin, encounter the very few settlers in the area (which was Indian Territory at the time), sickness, prairie fire, good and bad Indians, and finally realize the heartbreak of losing their new farm. Here they meet Mr. Edwards, who becomes a very special family friend, and Dr. Tann, a black doctor to the Indians. This book hasa been banned in many libraries for racial content, it actually shows how settlers fo the time felt. Some were prejudiced, some weren't. Even within the same family there were often differences of opinion. Overall, I thought the book was very interesting and enjoyable to read. I enjoyed it because it showed that life is not always easy and you have to work really hard sometimes to pull through those difficult times. I think that this is a good way of showing younger children reading these books that sometimes in life, you just have to push yourself really hard towards something that you want."},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"Rereading this touched my heart as if I were ten again! Yes, re-reading Little House on The Prairie, really did touch my heart. In fact the book touched my ten-year old heart that I guess still exists somewhere inside of me. That heart is purer and more senstive than the heart I walk around with most of the time. That part of me still loves to play with dogs and run with the little rabbits and scan the sky for the big hawks and run barefoot in the long prairie grass. That part of me wants to string beads and look at the stars and listen to my dad fiddle in the moonlight. And that part of me knows that my Mother and Father will protect me and teach me all the wisdom I'll need to know. Of course, that part of me didn't live on the prairie and never really saw a covered wagon, or a prairie dog, or ran with rabbits or even ran through the prairie grasses. But I was able to do all of those things almost for real, all because of Laura and her books. And the most amazing part of all is that when I reread this book as an adult I found I was just as moved and taken with her writing as I had been at ten.This book has a purity and a depth that few books today can equal. I'm so glad that Little House on the Prairie is around for the girls of today. If you are a mother of a girl, make sure she reads this book and the whole series. If you haven't read this book-read it now, no matter what your age. And if you have read it, re-read it as I did. Let that pure part of your heart from childhood come alive again. You'll be thankful as I was that there is still a way back to parts of ourselves that see and feel with an innocent wisdom so many things!"},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"I was first exposed to this work over 50 years ago, having had it read to me by one of my early teachers. I was enchanted then, and upon rereading the book over the years, including recently, am still enchanted. This is children's literature at its best. The style is not dated, the story line is simple and the author has the ability of catch the reader from the first and not let go until the last page is turned. Not only do we get a great story though, but we get a great first hand account of our history seen through a child's eyes. This book and this series of books, continue to attract children of all ages even after all these years. It certainly appeals to the little boy that still lurks within me. I cannot recommend this work highly enough."},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"I am a sixth grader. The author of the book is Laura Ingalls Wilder. The story the Little House on the Prairie isabout a girl who is about nine years old. The girls name is Laura. Laura and her familymove out of their little cozy log cabin home, to head west, and settle in another area. Thereason why the family moved west is because were they used to live, there would beanimals that would roam around and there would be the deer and fawns who would comeright up to the house. Now there were more and more people wanting to live right nearthem, the girls dad did not like that. He liked it where the animals could roam free and notbe scared to come up around the house. The family then packed up all of their possessionsand they left the house, the father had already sold the cow and her calf to another man, sowhen they were all ready to leave, they left. Laura has two sisters. Her older sisters namewas Mary, and her baby sisters name was Carrie. Along the trip to the west they meet thisman and the man trades his western mustangs for the fathers tired horses. The father washeading west to go to Indian territory. When the family finally got to the Indian territory,they found the perfect place to live so they started unpacking, and a few days after theywere there, their father and mother started building their house. The house took at least aweek and a half to build. Some of my favorite parts of the book is when the Indians cometo the families house. I also liked when the girls were trying to catch the gophers. Ithought that the book Little House on the Prairie was a pretty good book. I wouldrecommend this book to someone who likes old books, that are back in the day, and abooks that have adventure. The author Laura Ingalls Wilder has written nine books alltogether. The titles are Little house in the big woods, Little house on the prairie, Farmerboy, On the banks of plum creek, By the shores of silver lake, The long winter, Little townon the prairie, These happy golden years, and The first four years. In conclusion, I wouldrecommend this book to many people."},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"I am a sixth grader. I chose to read this book because when you look at the cover you can see what the book was about I loved the way the author \\"Laura Ingalls Wilder\\" explained what was going on in her own words. The main characters in the book are Laura, Pa, Ma, Mary and Baby Carrie .On the second or third page of the book there was a timeline that determined the people in the Ingalls family. On their voyage through the old country times they run along many troublesome times, they get through them. In the book there are Indians and they moving through different territories every year. The reason I would give this book 4 stars is because I like adventures and old books like this. There is a whole series of this book. I've read the first, second, and third. These were many reasons why I chose this book to read. I think you should read it too !!!!!"},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"This book is a sweet little slice of Americana, set in the heart of the pioneer days. If you have never read the series I highly recommend it for anyone. It is wonderfully written and highly descriptive of the days when the country was wild and free.Laura Ingalls tells the story of her life, wild and free on the beautiful wind swept prairie. She gives us vivid pictures of just what it was like to be a homesteader living off the land. When Charles Ingalls decides the big woods of Wisconsin are getting too crowded, he gets an itchy feeling to head out and homestead in the \\"Indian Territory\\" of the midwest. Laura tells the story of this adventurous move with the wide eyed innocence of a little girl. This is especially remarkable since Laura wrote these stories while she was beyond the age of 60!This account of her life, lived under the billowing top of a covered wagon, reads just as freshly, as if it happened yesterday! You can't help but get swept up in the lush reality of it all. Laura Ingalls Wilder lived these experiences and brings them into sharp focus for us today. Some of her most vivid and gripping recollections come in reference to the wolves and Native Americans surrounding her little cabin. Laura is full of spunk and always ready to face whatever challenge comes along. She is a wonderful role model for young children, even if she is a little impulsive at times.If you've seen the television show and haven't read the books, please take the time to enjoy them! The TV show was good but dramatized quite a bit. These books read as a historical record told in stark honesty. They dispense with the hollywood melodrama and the present a story in a straight forward way.But as I said before they are vivid and rich in their portrayal of life on the prairie. This particular book is well worth your time!"},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"This is one of the best series I have ever read. I started reading these books when I was 8 (am now 19) and I read the whole series every year.

I can't wait to pass them on"},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"Laura Ingalls Wilder and her family pull up stakes to travel to the Indian country of Oklahoma, where they believe they can put down roots as homesteaders.Pa and Ma display great wisdom in the rearing of their children, and great ingenuity in dealing with the harsh conditions of pioneering life. We get detailed accounts of building a house, installing a latched door to help defend against wolves and Indians, and the problems of procuring, storing, and preparing food.The details and accurate portrayal of frontier life is half of what makes this book tick. The other half is the warm and loving relationship between the Ingalls family, who cherish their little community far more than their meager possessions.We also get to see a snapshot of an evolving political landscape from the Ingalls' point of view. The wobbly US government is negotiating with the various Indian tribes in the area, and the Ingalls must live and die by the word of the law. They also have to deal with increasingly resentful and intrusive Indians, who bring a real note of menace into their lives. So many modern portayals of frontier Indians show them as saints; this is a more realistic portrayal of how Indian culture might seem menacing from the perspective of a lone family on the prairie.This is a beloved series that has withstood the test of time. While the interactions between the children and their parents can occasionally seem a bit cloying, their natural good-naturedness never comes off as preachy.Parents and children have only so much time to read books together. This book should be a priority for them all."},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"I am a 3rd grade student.Little House on the Prairie is an awesome book. Laura is anxious to see a papoose. Her sister Mary is scared to move when the large prairie fire struck. It is hard to believe what they go through every day. Ma and Laura get bitten by mosquitoes while picking blackberries. Then the whole family gets sick with malaria. Still the whole family works hard to do the everyday chores. The Indian war-cry is terrible with screams and yells which doesn't let little Laura, little Mary, Baby Carrie Pa and Ma sleep. Then the Indians go away and the government makes all the American settlers go away, or else soldiers from Fort Dodge would come and drive them away. So the family moves to Plum Creek, Minnesota where again Laura and Mary play in Plum Creek's water and later go to school."},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"Charming, engaging, and wonderfully told, the story about Laura and her family's life on the frontier is a great read for preteen readers and adults alike.

They are in Indian country and Indians come into there house and take a lot of there food. They soon found out that it was too dangerous to live there so they moved again.I thought this book was awesome I liked all the excitement in it. I didn't like that there was too much description because it got just a little boring. My favorite character in the book was Jack the dog because he protected the family and made sure that who ever came to there house was not an Indian or someone bad. The scene that meant something to me was when the Indians came because I thought that they were going to hurt the family. This book isn't like most of the other ones that I have read because it took place so long ago and they do everything without using things that we have now. I think you should read this book because it is very good and everyone should read it. The question that I had after reading the book was how come the family moved so soon I would think that they would of stayed there longer. My strongest reason for recommending this book is a lot of things will surprise you and it makes it very exciting."},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"I thought this series of books was interesting and informative to read.

The stories told in these series were actually events that happened in her life. Laura is able to draw the reader into her stories as if you are actually there with her.Little House on the Prairie begins with the Ingalls family leaving the Little house in the Woods that has been there home. The family has decided that the big woods is becoming too crowded and they head for Indian territory in Kansas. They must cross the Mississippi River before the ice melts so they leave while it is still winter. Laura and her sisters Mary and Baby Carrie have not known any other home except the house in the big woods. They are a little apprehensive about leaving but are exited also. The Ingalls family will face the unknown together.The Ingalls encounter many problems along their journey. Some of these are: crossing the high creek, wolf packs, prairie fires and Indians. In all the bad encounters there are good ones as well. They meet other folks who are traveling west, make friends with Mr. Edwards and together they learn how much it means to stay as a family.The little house on the prairie is a wonderful home the Charles Ingalls builds himself. \\"Pa\\" is an expect carpenter/builder who can design and build most anything. The family gets to live in the little house about 1 year when they find that they are residing 3 miles into the Indian Territory. The soldiers from the command at Washington are to come and drive out all the settlers in Indian Terrirory. So the Ingalls will begin moving out leaving behind their house and garden to find another place to settle. Their adventures continue in the next book of the series \\"Farmer Boy\\".I could not wait to read the rest of the series.

While a child will be interested in these stories because they're entertaining, funny, and even a bit scary sometimes, these books provide valuable history lessons and even some survival techniques.Every book in this series is amazing. An adult will probably complete each book in a couple of hours, while it each one will entertain a child for a few days or a week. Some reviewers here said the books were girlish, but I wouldn't say this is the case. There's also a book \\"Farmer Boy,\\" about the boyhood of Laura's eventual husband, Almanzo Wilder. The contrast between a New York State farm family and the Ingalls' pioneer lifestyle is interesting.Highly recommended reading for any age, but specifically good for kids in grades 3 through 7.-- JJ Timmins"},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"Little House on the Prairie By: Laura Ingalls WilderWould you like to live in a covered wagon for a year?If you like adventures, Little House on the Prairie is for you.

These are the books that I have renewed time and time again when I was a young girl. Reading them again 30+ years later ~~ I still love them. I definitely appreciate them more now as I am a mother and an adult ~~ and a history lover. But the magic is still there.This book is when Charles, Laura's pa, decided that The Big Woods was getting crowded with settlers traveling in from the East, so he upped and moved the entire family out west. They lived for a year on the prairie where the wild life was plentiful and everywhere. There were also Indians there too and while they didn't attack the Ingalls, they were restless. But for a year, they lived under a wide blue sky with ever-changing wind. Laura detailed as many details as she could ~~ their bout with malaria (or what they called, fever and agues), their special little gifts from the store in Independence, a town forty miles away, their daily routine and Pa's hard work in building a lovely home for all of them. They battled a wild fire that threatened to burn down their home. They also battled a chimney fire, the threat of an Indian uprising. There are also descriptions of nature so vividly painted that you can feel the wind blowing in their house, or look out the lovely glass windows, or see the moonlight beaming on their beds or hear the wolves howling all night long.This is such a wonderful book ~~ historical and all.

The family dog,Jack,was lost while crossing a lake.That part was really sad and almost made me stop reading.But I saw his name further into the book,so I didn't stop.Laura,being the tomboy of the family,helps Pa make the door.I love it how they show the steps to making the door.Its cool how a door with hinges could be made back then.They even made a lock.The family have many adventures in the house.Some of then are with indians.They find beads at an indian camp and that starts a rival between Laura and her sister,Mary.Mary decides to use her beads to make a necklace for their baby sister,Carrie.Not wanting to look spoiled,Laura decides to,also.One time indians came to the house,there were fires and other extraordinary adventures.During their life on the prairie,the Ingalls make two friends.One is Mr.Edwards,who is a very jolly guy.The other is Mr. Scott,who isn't as cool,but still okay.These men help the Ingalls a lot.Being the only neighbors,everyone becomes fast friends.The praire was large and neighbors were far away.When the family came down with malaria,it was a long time until help came.Laura was the strongest and helped until she was too sick.Luckily help came and everyone got better.I admire Laura.She is very strong and she is a tomboy,just like me.That's why I enjoyed this book a lot.It was like I was in their family doing all the things they did back then."},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"I've always loved the books, including this one. But in this edition there is an error on the back cover. It states incorrectly that Laura travelled from Wisconsin to Oklahoma. She actually travelled to Kansas, near Independance. As far I've researched, Laura Ingalls Wilder never lived in Oklahoma. I don't know if this error is on all the books or just mine."},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"Unhappy with the growing population in the land around Pepin, Pa Ingalls packs his family and heads out on a danger-fraught journey to the southwestern Indian prairie lands, where he attempts to settle down with his three little girls and patient wife. Vast and breathtaking, this new home offers up a wealth of adventure to the Ingalls family, and is as big as Pa's dreams for the future. Laura recounts the hardships of their travels, their encounters with Indians and other settlers and the many ingenious ways they had to employ to carve out a life for themselves - like building their own cabin and carving their own furniture. Her descriptions, though written in a language simple enough for children to appreciate, are wonderfully evocative of the time and inspire an awe in the reader for the people who struggled to make a life in the harsh world of nineteenth century America. She reminds us of the more severe moral code of the time (\\"Children should be seen and not heard\\") and the rife prejudice that existed in the hearts of the settlers but offsets these aspects by her beautiful portrayal of the love shared between Ma and Pa and their little \\"half-pint.\\" Coming to these books as an adult certainly has its disadvantages - it's hard to swallow the descriptions of native Americans and the reactions to them that the settlers had - but putting those things into the context of the time helps. More importantly, I think I have a greater appreciation for the perseverance and indomitable spirit of the pioneers and for their close family bonds and amazing resourcefulness."},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"I grew up in the 1970's watching the syrupy Little House on the Prairie television series. So it was with some skeptecism that I approached the original version of the story. Oh, was I so wrong! \\"Little House on the Prairie\\" is a real classic of American literature. Because it is written in the voice of a young girl, this book is often times condescendingly relegated to the realm of children's literature. Although the writing may be spare and somewhat naive, it is nevertheless beautiful and profound. I found myself moved by this story of a pioneer family adrift upon the American frontier. I entered into this beautifully recreated world thinking I was doing my six year old daughter a favor but discovered to my great pleasure that I was the lucky one.

I am glad I made the purchase. It was definitely worth having this for my collection."},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"I love this series. It doesn't matter how old I get, they just keep getting better and better. When we last left the Ingalls family, they were enjoying life in the Big Woods of Wisconsin where Ma and Pa had built there home and lived among family with their three little girls, Laura, Mary, and Carrie. Now, spurred on by his love of travel, Pa has decided to take the girls and Ma and head West for new adventure.They load up the wagon and with goodbyes from their family, head west to the great prairies to Indian territory, where they hope to make a new home. Pa finds a great spot not too far from a river and starts building the house by himself, with a little bit of help from Ma. They meet some of their neighbors and as they get settled in life happens. Whether it be sickness, celebrations, Indians, or fires, life isn't that dull for the Ingalls. They do their best at surviving well using only the resources they are able to obtain easily for themselves and yet remain happy. They live in this house for a year and get along just fine until forced to move on.I hesitate to call them characters, as they are based off of real people and are more of Laura's telling or diary of her own life, but they are great characters. She does a good job of expressing the family dynamic and even going so far as to show herself truthfully with all of her faults. To me, that is wonderful, as she isn't trumping herself up to be the best of all. At times, her depiction of Ma doesn't seem quite fair, but as a child I can see how she'd view her mother as a sterner authority figure while her dad was more jovial of a person.Not only does Wilder do a great job of writing this book, she makes it informative as well. When I was a kid and reading this I didn't pick up on nearly the amount of instructions on homesteading that I do now. In fact, with just a little extra help from a diagram, I'm pretty sure you could make a door without nails just by her description of when she helped her dad build one. She also offers a very simplistic outline of building a log cabin as well. These and other little tidbits are a treasure trove of knowledge if you read right. Another great thing Wilder does with her writing is express how much job the simple things can bring. When Pa builds Ma a new rocking chair, they celebrate! This is wonderful because it really makes you appreciate the little things and see how even that was really doing good for the times.There is a small warning for these books however. Due to the time they were written in, there are several view points and words that could be considered racist. Most specifically in this book, this would apply to Native Americans. Ma herself isn't a big fan of them, but Pa likes them so they seem to balance each other out a bit. Still, it does have the potential to offend.Such a beautiful series and I always voraciously read them as quick as I can as I hate to put them down. These especially seem to be great books for the holidays as well and are perfect for reading with a nice hot cup of cocoa. Little House on the Prairie is a wonderful book for both adults and children.Little House on the PrairieCopyright 1935335 pages plus illustrations from Garth WilliamsReview by M.

I think her books are interesting and well written. Her descriptions of events, places, people, and time periods cannot be beat and it draws you right in."},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"Laura Ingalls Wilder's writing style is on the simple side, perfect for younger readers. Even as an adult, I don't mind it. For some inexplicable reason, I never read this series when I was young, in spite of watching the series regularly. Now I wish that I had. As a child I think it'd be a bit easier to be oblivious to the obvious racism against \\"Indians\\" that detracts from an otherwise excellent book. Don't get me wrong. I'm glad that settlers homesteaded the land (all but one of my great-grandparents were homesteaders in McIntosh County, ND). And although I'm saddened about the mistreatment of Indians at the hands of the American government, I'm glad that things have turned out as they have for descendants of those who came after the Native Americans. I just wish it had gone down differently. The problem is, in Little House on the Prairie, pretty much everyone except for Mr. Ingalls, as this example from Chapter 22 illustrates, \\"Pa said he didn't know about that. He figured that Indians would be as peaceable as anybody else if they were let alone,\\" disliked or downright despised the Indians.The story is this (straight from the first page of the book), \\"...there were too many people in the Big Woods...\\" so \\"...Pa and Ma and Mary and Laura and Baby Carrie [and their dog Jack] left their little house in the Big Woods of Wisconsin.\\" The family went \\"across Minnesota and Iowa and Missouri\\" in a horse-drawn wagon filled with all of their belongings except \\"the beds and tables and chairs\\" because \\"Pa could make always make new ones\\" and began their new life on an empty plot of Kansan land. The tale is of an arduous, adventurous journey and an exciting but simple life on the plains. Encounters with future friends (fellow settlers) and foe (wild animals, Indians) are the primary highlights in the mostly happy lives of the Ingalls family members, most of which are spent obtaining the basic necessities (gathering, preparing and eating food, constructing a home and filling it with necessities). Encounters with Indians are inevitable due to the location of their chosen plot. These samples illustrate my primary criticism with the book - that it is racist against Native Americans:Chapter 10\`\\"Dear me, Laura, must you yell like an Indian? I declare,\\" Ma said, \\"if you girls aren't getting to look like Indians! Can I never teach you to keep your sunbonnets on?\\"'Chapter 11\\"...she saw two naked, wild men coming...\\"\\"Their eyes were black and still and glittering, like snake's eyes.\\"\\"...she smelled a horribly bad smell and she looked up at the Indians.\\"\\"We don't want to wake up some night with a band of the screeching dev-\\"Chapter 17\`\\"Land knows, they'd never do anything with this country themselves. All they do is roam around over it like wild animals.\\"'\\"She did not know why the government made treaties with Indians. The only good Indian was a dead Indian.\\"Chapter 22\\"Mr. Scott said he didn't know why so many of those savages were coming together, if they didn't mean devilment.\\"\`\\"The only good Indian is a dead Indian, \\" Mr. Scott said.'Chapter 23\\"...at night they heard the savage voices shouting.\\"Although a great story about one family's experiences traveling to and growing up on the prairie, portions of the book are racist. Similar (though probably better for boys): Farmer Boy by Laura Ingalls Wilder. Better: Pippi Longstocking by Astrid Lindgren, and Anne of Green Gables by L. M. Montgomery."},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"Being a &#34;boxed set&#34; I expected it to be in some sort of box to keep the books in one place as a set.

In Kansas they found some lovely land, dug a well and built a log house. Then they left it all and rode their covered wagon back to Wisconsin.What a sad, discouraging story.Wait a minute - Little House on the Prairie is not a sad book! It could be, but it isn't. And having a happy story come from a sad experience is the gift of this writer, Laura Ingalls Wilder. The lure of Laura's books is not in the events but in the emotions, not in the facts so much as the feelings. The tiniest details let you live her real life stories, and Pa's fiddle helps you feel it.So Little House on the Prairie is another happy, five star book by Laura Ingalls Wilder. Whether they were riding the covered wagon to Kansas or back to Wisconsin, Ma and Pa and Mary and Laura were all cozy in the round circle of the prairie and the sky, and all was well, all there together."},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"I liked this book because it made me feel the heat and cold of the seasons.

I will never try a LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE CD AGAIN."},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"I used to watch the TV series on and off during the late 1970s before I was introduced to Laura Ingalls Wilder's true-to-life adventures out on the frontier. Unfortunately, the Pa character on the TV just doesn't bear any resemblance at all to the real-life father of the famous little girl under her sunbonnet. In fact, the real Pa had a BEARD while the one played by the late Michael Larson just looked too macho and youthful.In Mrs. Ingalls Wilder's second story, the family had to move out of The Big Woods in Wisconsin to go traveling across the great open prairie lands in a covered wagon. The two little girls, Laura and her sister, the blonde Mary both experienced very daunting incidents ranging from their own father falling into a raging river to Ma's leg getting pinned under a heavy log from the new home they were building to the sudden loss of their faithful dog, Jack. But it is also a very eye-opening experience for the modern kids as told in the aged heroine's very own words.Laura's tales very vividly paints her childhood days out in the wilds during the late 19th century like pies made out of underripe apples, the very construction of a real log house with its cavernous fireplace which was big enough to stand in, the sudden visit from the Native Americans and all! Garth Williams, the reowned illustrator of children's books also provides realistic pictures of what it was like to be a little girl in the pioneering times."},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"I was disappointed in the color edition of Little House on the Prairie.

Laura and her family were, at times, kind of racist against the native Americans. When I first read this book, I was very dissapointed at that but now I realized that Laura was just a very ignorant girl who has been taught to fear them. So if you read this book, you should understand that these people lived in a very different world from us, not just in terms of electricity and modern inventions, but also socially. Anyway, apart from being slihjtly racist, I just don't like this book as much as Little House in the Big Woods but it's still pretty good for young kids."},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"I loved this book, it was a great one too.

I liked the pictures and the big words they used. My favorite part was when they arrived on the prairie. My favorite character was Carrie because she was sweet,caring and loving. She was cute and a little baby. The book was about how Laura,Carrie,Pa,Ma and Jack were moving out of the woods and when they had to cross the river Pa almost drowned. To tell the truth, I didn't like the book that much and I would give the book probably a half of a star.

However, when Pa and Ma decide to pack up the wagon and head west, Laura, along with her older sister, Mary, finds herself excused from the daily regimen of quilting, and slaving over a hot stove all day, and instead finds herself smack dab in the middle of an adventure under the blue skies as the Ingalls family set off for Kansas territory. Kansas territory is full of wide-open land lush with wild animals, and perfect acreage made especially for settling on - and that's just what Pa intends to do. While the trip is bumpy, and often dangerous, as there are rapids to cross, and horse thieves to avoid, the Ingalls family find the perfect spot to establish their homestead, and Pa gets to work building a house fit for a king, and his four queens, while Ma spends her days cooking meals, and Laura and Mary divide their time between watching Baby Carrie, helping with chores, and playing with their beloved Jack. However, once the cabin is built, and the Ingalls family finally begin to feel settled, trouble comes lurking in the shape of the government and Indians. Laura finds herself frightened at how close the Indians travel to her new home, and is even more terrified when they demand things of Ma - such as food and tobacco. What was once a dream come true, is now turning into a nightmare - not just for the children, but for Ma and Pa, as well. Now, Pa, with the help of their new neighbors, and friends, Mr. Edwards and Mr. Scott, feels that it is up to them to learn more about what the government plans on doing to protect them from the Indians, while, at the same time, staying on the Indians good side to prevent a war from starting.While the first two LITTLE HOUSE books - LITTLE HOUSE IN THE BIG WOODS and FARMER BOY - kept the prose peaceful and light, and stayed away from turmoil, LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE begins to introduce the dangers of frontier-life to readers, illustrating not only problems with the government and the Indians surrounding them, but also bringing talk of sickness, such as malaria, to light, giving readers a more accurate - if not slightly harsher view - of the world of Laura Ingalls. As in previous books, Laura Ingalls Wilder illustrates each and every aspect of prairie life in an easy-to-understand language that can be enjoyed by readers of all ages, male or female. Her descriptions of the hardships she encountered as her family crossed the Kansas territory are nerve-wracking; while her ability to recount everything from how, exactly, Pa built their home from scratch, and the excitement of having real glass windows in their home (something we often take for granted) brings a sense of joy to the reader. Those who read the two previous installments will love the addition of new characters to the tale - such as the kind-hearted Mr. Edwards. I also adored the character of Mr. Edwards on the LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE TV show, and was ecstatic to see him introduced to readers on paper here. His jovial personality, and bright outlook on life, along with his tenderness towards Laura, Mary, Baby Carrie, and even Ma and Pa are splendid, and really bring his kind spirit to life. The perfect way to relive the innocence of simpler times.Erika SoroccoFreelance Reviewer"},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"We love these books and have read them many times.

This one follows the Ingalls family to Kansas. Pa sells the house in the big woods in search of something bigger and better. His idea of bigger and better? Indian Country! This makes Ma very uneasy, as she feels Indians are savage people. Pa assures her that they are only savage when provoked and that they are very peaceful people. Laura, on the other hand, understands why they're upset. They have been forced to move away to allow settlers to live on their land. She is desperate to see an Indian baby. Pa promises her she will see one. Ma is outraged, saying that she already has a baby sister but Laura wants an Indian baby in addition. Laura does see one and is so excited. The family is plagued by illness and prairie fires and there is even an unpleasant encounter with two Indians. Prairie life doesn't quite turn out as Pa hoped, but his motto is simple: no matter how bad things are, you must never give up or give in if you want to survive.

I would highly recommend this book on CD for both children and adults."},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"Little House on the Prairie was given to me by my Great-Grandma Kile on my eighth birthday and was one of the most beloved books of my childhood. I read it so many times that it is a very tattered worn copy that is falling apart when I now read it to my children.My sons are five and three and the loved listening to Little House on the Prairie. The three-year old did have some attention problems when the pictures were few and far between on some chapters, but the action always soon roped him back in.The beginning of the book is the Ingalls family journey from Wisconsin to the prairies of Kansas. The journey is arduous, but also a great adventure. Jack the dog has a nail-biting adventure of his own, which left my kids in tears one night, but very happy another. Once they arrived in Kansas, Pa found the perfect spot to build their little log cabin on the prairie. The detail on how exactly the home was built including the stable, roof, chimney, and digging of the well intrigued my boys. I think Kile is ready to build his own cabin on the prairie.The adventures continue while they are building the cabin and after they make it a home. They meet a bachelor neighbor named Mr. Edwards. Ma does not approve of his rough ways, but Laura takes an instant shine to him. Mr. Edwards helps Pa with putting the roof on the cabin and Pa helps him with his place. My favorite chapter of the book (and one of the boys' as well) is \\"Mr. Edwards Meets Santa Claus.\\" After much rain, the Ingalls girls are told that Santa Claus will not be able to make it to their place for Christmas. Mr. Edwards meets Santa Claus in Independence and brings the Ingalls gifts over the flooded river to surprise them for Christmas. Even Ma's heart is melted towards Mr. Edwards as he relates his journey and he makes Laura and Mary's day complete. It is wonderful how the spirit of Christmas can be found in having a tin cup of your own. This chapter alone is one of my favorite Christmas stories.Little House on the Prairie gives a view of the Native Americans as white settlers viewed them at the time. Although Pa seems more open minded then Ma, he is technically squatting on Indian reservation land that he has no right to be on. I never really thought about this when I was a child. After such comments in the book as \\"The only good Indian is a dead Indian,\\" I tried to give the boys a more enlightened views of Native American/Settler relations. I told them how the Native Americans were here first and the settlers took the land away and there was much fighting involved. That didn't stop the boys from playing, \\"The Indians are going to attack!!\\" later that day. I tried!It was an amazing life the settlers lived on the prairie. When the Ingalls family comes down with an illness and all pass out in their home, they are lucky that a passing Indian doctor (Dr. Tann) is able to help them to survive. I think it is interesting that Dr. Tann is actually an African American doctor. It is interesting to read about fascinating African Americans of the 19th century. A deadly prairie fire, chimney fire, and near fatality in the digging of the well, made one wonder how people survived. As my husband Ben said, many did not.Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote about the details of her life and I always consider this book to be \\"non-fiction.\\" It is in reality historical fiction as Laura changed some facts to make the timeline smoother. The Little House on the Prairie adventures actually took place before Little House in the Big woods in real life and Laura was too little to remember.Overall, Little House on the Prairie is a wonderful, enthralling, educational adventure story that is enjoyable for young boys, girls, and their parents.This review was first posted on my blog, Laura's Reviews."},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"The author of this book deceives the reader in a manner which few can admit.

The moon shone over the dark prairie, the winds were still, and softly Pa played his fiddle. He let a fast note quiver far far away, until it dissolved in the moonlight.\\"The writing style is perfect for reading out loud to the children while they lay tucked beneath the sheets. I wonder how many times it has been read to children by adults. More than the author could have ever wondered.In many way this is a lighter version of the hardships encountered by the pioneers - unlike Willa Cather'sO Pioneers!which describes the harsh winter freezes, the shortages of living in the tundra, and how men inhabiting the wild can misbehave when around young women. Cather describes for the adult, Wilder describes for the child. And, each describes well.Often she describes how mother nature affects her surroundings - in a manner which reminded me of the great sequences in Zora Neale Hurston's great depiction of hurricane forces inTheir Eyes Were Watching God.As an adult, I was unsure whether I would enjoy this novel.

So he decides to sell the house and move west with his family. Just before the ice breaks, the family loads up their wagon and heads out. They cross the Mississippi River and then head south, settling two days away from Independence, Missouri. Now they have to build a new house and survive the wilderness. Meanwhile, Laura is anxious to see a papoose. And with all the Indians in the area, she may get her chance.This is a charming book. It's almost a collection of short stories with many chapters being a self-contained event. Still, through these pages, we get a good picture of life on the American frontier 130 years ago. The book gives plenty of detail about their everyday life without getting bogged down. And it is interesting. Frankly, some of the chapters are so harrowing I felt my pulse quicken. Often I found myself shaking my head in awe at what the Ingalls dealt with on a daily basis. This is a good way to make anyone appreciate just what we have today.These books are still popular 70 years after they were first written for good reason. They are an entertaining and enlightening look at a bygone era."},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"In my opinion: This may be a children's book, but it's just as good if not better for adults. The writing is simple but not insulting. The story itself is captivating. The occurences between the settlers and the American Indians were really amazing. All through the eyes of a little girl.Laura Wilder had an amazing gift to tell stories and to make an accurate picture of the time she grew up in and of what she thought and felt as a girl. This is not like the show in many respects though. If you only want to read about the exact characters and stories from the show, this may surprise you. Mr. Edwards is not in here much and you won't see characters like Albert or Mr. Oleson in this book. As they live on the prairie, there is no school or store, only a few neighbors a few miles away. Also Indians which only actually show up now and then.Again it is a story about hard work and family sticking together. Superior to the first book in that you already know alot of the mundane [though very interesting]details of their daily life, and the characters. Now it is full of story. The interactions with wild life alone are astounding as taken for fact. They are not just the amusing tid bits from the first book, but quite dangerous and spellbinding ones.Fantastic book for anybody. The whole series is great."},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"This cd made a 6+ hour ride home from vacation fly by. My 6 year old daughter asked if the trip home was about an hour and when I told her it was more than 6 hours she could not believe it. My 9 year old son, husband and I also enjoyed listening to every word. This is a great cd which will be used over and over in our home. The reader did a great job and it was a delight to listen to."},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"I've recently started reading the Little House books to my seven-year-old daughter and I'm thrilled to discover that I love them just as much now as I did when I was her age. There are a lot of reasons for that. Laura Ingalls Wilder was a wonderful writer. She's simple and always crystal clear, but at the same time, she uses so much detail and has such a great sense of the rhythm of language that her writing is beautifully poetic and always a joy to read aloud. And the characters, of course, are among the most beautifully drawn characters in literature: the feisty Laura who has such a hard time doing what she's supposed to do, her frustratingly perfect sister Mary, her strict but kind parents. Even the animals in the book come across as interesting characters. No matter how tired I am in the evening, I always look forward to getting out Little House and reading a chapter or two.Those were the things I loved about it as a child, and still love now. But as an adult I've also come to appreciate how quintessentially American this book is. It's the kind of book that makes you think about our heritage, and makes you proud to be American. In these books, Laura and her family keep facing hardships and meeting them head on. When necessary, they pick themselves up and move on to a new place, starting from scratch. They don't expect anything from anybody, and yet they care about their community and their neighbors. You often hear the words \\"pioneer spirit\\" used to describe America's best values, but after you read Little House that's not an empty phrase. You, and the child you read it to, understand it in your heart."},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"I've just finished reading Little House on the Prairie to my six year old son and he enjoyed every page. The classic illustration were his favorites and now we've returned to purchase Little House in the Big Woods to start the series from the beginning. He's learning to read now that he's started first grade and the Little House books are a much anticipated bed time activity"},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"In 1935, a book was published that would become an American classic. Laura Ingalls Wilder's LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE followed her pioneering family as they left the big woods of Wisconsin (the setting of the first installment in the beloved series) to claim land in Kansas. Though LITTLE HOUSE was the second book to share the adventures of the Ingalls family, it came to stand for the whole collection of books and later lent its name to the 1970s television series.Now, on the 75th anniversary of the book's publication, its publisher has released a special edition featuring full-color illustrations by Garth Williams, whose characteristic black-and-white versions have given form to Laura and her family since the 1950s. While the text remains the same, the vibrant pictures and new hardback cover give the book a new dynamic look sure to capture the imagination of a new generation of young readers or inspire adults to re-read this favorite.LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE, along with the other books in the series, is based roughly on Laura's childhood in what was then the American West. From Wisconsin to Kansas to Minnesota, Laura's father Charles moves the family in search of open spaces and the American Dream. Along the way they move far from family, meet new neighbors, come into contact with Native Americans, raise cattle, grow crops, explore the landscape, sing songs and exemplify the pioneering spirit of the late 1800s. In LITTLE HOUSE, Pa Ingalls builds a log cabin, digs a well, and more after having driven a covered wagon across the prairies. Laura is a wide-eyed and clever girl with a sense of adventure and a penchant for mischief. Her companions are her two sisters and faithful dog Jack.From dangerous wolves to tender lullabies, the Ingalls family endures much to follow their dream of a patch of land and a solid house to call their own. Boys and girls will be thrilled by their trials and tribulations along the way.Included in this edition are a short biography of Laura Ingalls Wilder, photocopies of a couple of her letters and a telegram to Garth Williams, and more. But even without these features, the book is special because the story is special. Laura is a wonderful guide through a fascinating moment in American history characterized by optimism, symbolized by wide-open spaces, and challenged by the diversity of culture and ethnicity of America's changing landscape.LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE remains a fun and interesting book for readers of all ages, and the 75th Anniversary Edition is a wonderful way to celebrate this classic tale by one of America's best-loved writers.--- Reviewed by Sarah Rachel Egelman"},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"I can still remember this book after all these years. It was and still is a sweet story, one that must be read by every American. It continues to amaze me how well a simple children's story can capture the lifestyle and the spirit of the late 1800s. It is a tale of nothing less than the human experience: hardship and prosperity alike seen through the innocent eyes of a young girl.Try as you may, you'll never be able to resist the charms of this story. Laura Ingalls Wilder will forever live on in your heart as a bright flame, symbolic of everything good in our country, our world, and our entire existence.It is a must read for all children everywhere. A thousand times more valuable than Star Wars or Pokemon, it is something a kid can love and hold on to for the rest of his or her life."},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"Cherry Jones' reading of Little House on the Prairie is lively, spirited, clear and articulate all at the same time. The best is when she sings along to Woodiel's fiddle. I was initially worried that the songs would sound ridiculous, but I was pleasantly surprised by how natural Jones' singing was, and how smoothly the fiddle entered the narration. I highly recommend this recording for any fan, or new reader who wants to hear a warm-hearted, relaxing bedtime story. For example, I listen to audiobooks when I'm experiencing particularly bad insomnia, which is NOT to say the books bore me to sleep; instead, I'm soothed to sleep.Little House on the Prairie was my least favorite of the series, but listening to Jones breathed new life into this story for me. Even the long descriptions I used to find somewhat tedious, of how the house is built, well dug, etc., were suddenly fascinating. Hearing this work makes it somehow realer; you can't just pass over it the way you can in a book. It reminds me that Wilder grew up in a more oral tradition, and this recording proves how effective and how different orality is. Jones puts so much into her delivery that Wilder's crisp imagery really helps you visualize that labor and love Pa and Ma Ingalls put into their survival. Laura's spritely personality is also perfectly captured. Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"This book is a very good book because it is a true story written in a fiction way. It is about a girl that moves from the big woods into the indian teratory and has a lot of adventures. For instance, a lot of indians come into her house. If you read this book you will find it very interesting just like I did."},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"This title is such a familiar part of our culture that it might be easy to assume that you know this story, when you really don't. Forget the TV show and even the mega-abridged picture book spinoffs. This is a great book, both as a piece of literature and as a historical document. First, it is well written (my understanding is that Laura Ingalls Wilder's daughter is the real writer here, although the stories and surely much of the writing are Laura's). There is a balance between readability that is suitable for young readers, and mature detail and narrative to hold an adult's attention. The story itself is amazing - really. Nothing against Michael Landon, but Landon couldn't hold Ingalls' jock. If 'Pa' Ingalls did half of what is attributed to him (both in this book and in the other Little House books), the guy was a big league stud. Frankly, it was men like this (and not gunslingers and sub minimum wage cowboys) that made the West and grew the country. Imagine any man leading his wife and three little daughters into unsettled Kansas and squatting in, literally, the middle of nowhere and calling it home. The perils come early and often. Flooded creeks, Indians, fire, disease, wolves, weather, more wolves. And the dude (and Ma and the girls) pulls it all off. Read this, either for yourself or aloud to your kids."},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"I gave my book five stars because I like the way it tells you what the characters are doing and how they're feeling about their lives.Little House on the Prairie is about a little girl named Laura Ingalls and her family.It tells about their move to an Indian country where they have all these cool adventures and meet new neighbors.

I am seeing the whole experience from a new perspective now that I am 35 (relating more with Ma I think) and I am enjoying the stories completely. It's also nice because the books can be read in a single afternoon or just a few hours. A wonderful look at the pioneer life with details on cabin building and settling a piece of land.

The need to pull up roots and travel to an unsafe destination, to build a house and barn, to trade furs for seeds, and then pull up roots again based on a rumor seems a very sinister backdrop to the pleasant life of two young girls. This book helps me understand better the american roots of religion, independence and the right to keep and bare arms. It also is a snapshot on how the white people pushed the indians to acts of desperation and how the indian &quot;problem&quot; was understood by the white settlers. All this, plus a very pleasant read for young children who are strangers to hardship and sacrifice. Great stuff.

A family lived there that consisted of a a dog Jack, a baby Carrie, the oldest daugter Mary and the yourner daughter Laura. The parents are known in this story as Ma and Pa. Ma and Pa are somewhat strict whils Mary is somewhat conservitive and Laura is very adventorous. They left the big woods and went to a new place out west. They traveled along the Mississippi and stopped in amny differnt places to rest. When they finally got there they met their new neighbor, Mr. Edwards. When Pa and Mr. Edwards met Pa asked if they wanted to help each other build their houses. For the next several weeks they helped each other build their houses. When they were finished with the houses Pa asked Mr. Edwards if he would help him build his stable in turn for food. He accepted and they built a sturdy nice looking stable. One night Pa and Laura were sitting in the doorstep and they heard something that sounded very close. It was cowboys! The cowboys were coming to ask Pa if he would help them keep the cattle out of the ravine in turn for fresh meat. He accepted and was back in no time. The next day they decided to go search for an indian camp. They found one eventually but there was no one there. They found some beads and took them home and then they made a necklace for baby Carrie. She loved it. The next few weeks the girls were'nt feeling well. They were very sicka dn needed someone to take care of them luckily htye had a good neighbor who came to just check up on them. It was Mrs. Scott. She took care of them until they became well. Now it was Christmas time. Pa went down to town and bought the girls Christmas presents. They didnt know it but Mr. Scott was on his way over there and he was also bringing him presents for Christmas. They loved all the presents they got and they were very thankful for them.A week later Pa heard a loud screech from the Scott's house. Pa thought it was something awful like someone was hurt but it was just a panther and Pa ended up killing it anyways. About three weeks later there was a prairie fire.

Believe it or not, listening to stories does a lot of improve reading skills in kids of all ages."},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"This story shows a lot about the American Frontier and the settlers who moved out there. It is also not cloaked in American sentimentalism and is more realistic than most books are about frontier life. I think it is because the author actually lived the life she wrote about and the book was written in 1935 when others had also lived a similar life on the plains.

The problem that occurs in the story is when the Indians go to war. The problem is solved at the end of the story.

While the first book seemed to be a guide book on survival in the wild this book is more of a tale with Indians, bush fires and other dangers.

They were happy in their \\"Little House in the Big Woods\\". Ma, Pa, Mary, Laura, baby Carrie and dog Jack decide to move west so Pa would have more room to hunt. Pa is a hunter extraordinaire and earns an excellent living for the family. But the woods where they live get more crowded every year so there are less animals to go around. They pack up and move away from their dear home to a new, unknown land.Their covered wagon makes a great camping vehicle and they enjoy a nice camping trip on their way. They would stop driving for the day, Pa would go out hunting, Ma and the girls would set up camp, and Pa would come back with the evening's supper. They cooked it over a fire, ate the leftovers for breakfast, packed up, and were back on the road for the day.When they arrived at what Pa said was \\"home\\", it was nothing but a big space of grass. Where would they live? No problem.Pa knows how to build a house with logs, make furniture, dig a well, and build a stable for the horses. That Pa can do anything! The land is free, the hunting is free, building the house and digging the well is free. By the time they plant the garden, I guess they would have no need of money.But they do get money. Why? Because Pa is a hunter, remember? And a good one. He sells the furs, and the hunting is so plentiful in this area that he has no trouble at all.The neat thing about this book is that it describes how to do many things: How to build the house, How to make a rocking chair, How to cook over the fire, and describes a clever way to protect your home from a prairie fire that really works! Many popular songs are also included as Pa plays the fiddle in the evening. Some we remember and some we wish we knew.Because of these things and because of the indians, this was a book that my boys enjoyed right along with my daughter. My husband, the couch potato, even became interested and rented some \\"Little House\\" videos.This is the best kind of history. It's like talking to your grandma and hearing the real story of what things were really like for real people. If you like history, you will love this book."},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"in 4th grade I unfourtunetly had to read this book and let me tell you, I have sleeping problems and this has been the only book that LITERALLY caused me to fall asleep."},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"Let's be honest: the history of White settlement in America is, among other things, a history of heinous crime. The wrongs of colonization were particularly acute on the frontier. A good novel can overcome the problematic position of its characters, but this work does not. Instead it mostly repeats the racist perspective of White settlers, who feel frightened and endangered by the people who live in the land already.In short, the characters epitomize the great White inversion of history: Whites--the ones who killed a million Indians--describe Indians as posing the threat. Whites, who stole Indian lands, describe Indians as trespassing and menacing. Whites, who destroyed the ecosystems that sustained Indian life, then say the Indians aren't making use of the land. Relatedly, the novel's Whites say that their \\"productive\\" use of the land entitles them to take it. The Whites long for the Indians to \\"disappear\\" or go further West. In this novel the Indians are dark, violent, mysterious, and unknowable: they are literally \\"savages.\\"Pa helps to soften some of the racism. He sees \\"good Indians\\" mixed in with the bad and tries to make nice with the Other. He points out that they could be expected to be angry, having been evicted from their ancestral lands to the east. He is unapologetic about the colonization of Indian land, and the associated genocide, but he does reinforce a more humane view of the savages. Ma and Pa are contrasted with the more genocide-minded Mr. and Mrs. Scott. No one in the novel kills an Indian.I tried to gently help my six-year old daughter through this moral terrain, but she identified with the White settlers' point of view: the Indians were scary and the Whites weren't stealing. Of course, the novel tells nothing of the violence that delivered the lands to Whites and kept it in their possession. The novel offers only nice White folks making an earnest living. They are utterly blameless, since no big picture is given. And yet they are, in effect, good Germans during the Nazi era: their wholesome business is entwined with the ruination and murder of Indians.But most American Whites can't stand hearing this sort of thing, and have no problem with the myth of peaceful Whites and bad Indians on the Western frontier. On a far more basic note, then, there are some major flaws in the writing. A few: (1) Baby Carrie goes missing from the story for chapters on end (where was she? wasn't she crying? who was watching her? etc.). (2) It can take Wilder pages and pages to describe something as inane as building a door. That's fine if you're interested in historical carpentry, but it seriously drags down the pace of the novel. (3) Whole chapters limp by with scarcely an event. Actually, that's true to life, but not it does not make good novel reading--particularly in a children's tale, and particularly when (4) there is zero character development.This book is a fascinating historical document, in part because it helped to reinforce the mythologies at the core of White supremacy. But it has no business being read to or read by children, unless one wants to perpetuate its lies."},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"Though from the descripition it seems amazingly boring, but it is kind of charming in an offbeat way. It describes the Ingalls family going out west (to Kansas, to be specific) and settle there because the Big Woods was getting too crowded. I thought it as OK, but there was no thrilling or excciting bits, or parts when the plot suddenly turned dark.I recommend this book only to kids under the age of eight and kids who have not read the Harry Potter or Artemis Fowl series.

Reading the unendingly dull chapters about Pa building the house, the door, the fireplace and the well made me want to burn the log cabin down. And I still can't believe that Ma ironed on the wagon in the middle of the prairie. (wtf?)

This book is about the Ingalls family travelling on the prairie. Almost every night Pa played his fiddle around the campfire while everybody ate supper. When the Ingalls family settled on the indian territory they had a good life for one year. While they lived on the prairie, Mr. Edwards, their neighbour would visit often. Mr. Edwards was single. Mr. and Mrs. Scott was another one of their neighbours. Mr. Scott helped Pa build a well next to the house. Once Pa went to Independence and brought back news that the soldiers at a fort were planning to push the settlers out of the indian territory. Mr. Edwards said that he would escape by going down the river, Mr. and Mrs. Scott did not know what to do, and Pa and the family were going to travel in a wagon, but they did not know where they were going. I think that they are going to have a much better life wherever they go.I recommend you to read all the books in the series. All of them are just as good or even better.The End!"},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"This second book tells how the Ingalls family moves from the Big Woods to Indian Territory.I got a real sense of adventure reading about crossing the rivers, almost losing Jack, building literally everything by hand without too much help, getting the fever and finally leading up to the part where the Indians rally to get rid of them and every other settler in the region.The ending is a little sad because Pa decided that, instead of being forced out, they would just pack what they could and leave everything for a new life somewhere else.The courage and determination is seen in this book and it's a 5-star!"},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"I loved this series of books as a child and read them countless times. I am amazed at how many things I still remember from them, particularly the portions describing how things were done or made. This particular book was one of my least favorite since it is a bit slow. In addition, I was uncomfortable with the depiction of Native Americans even as a child. I am currently reading this book to my 4 1/2 year old, since we recently drove out to Colorado and have been able to compare some of what we saw to the descriptions of the landscape in the book. I have been skipping at least some portions of chapters such as the one on building a door. I have also edited (ok censored) some of the negative comments about Native Americans. Its hard not to convey some of the negativity though, so I'll be looking for a book or 2 to show us a different perspective."},{"Title":"Little House on the Prairie (Little House-the Laura Years)","review":"My wife bought this audio book for her mother, who is a longtime fan of Laura Ingalls Wilder.

The Ingalls family left their homestead in wooded Wisconsin to travel to the grassy prairies of the new lands out west. Their grandparents, aunt, uncles, and cousins all came to say goodbye; they might never see them again.This book will give you an idea of what it was like to live and travel in the 1870s. Before airplanes, automobiles, even trains; before television, radio, electricity, and indoor plumbing. No maps or roadsigns either. What was it like to cross a creek in those days? What was it like to build your own house? How did people eat without a butcher, baker, or grocery store? Where did they get furniture? They settled on the prairie, far away from the woods. For Christmas, Mary and Laura got their very own tin cups; how happy they were!

Heading into the unknown wondering if you'll ever see your family again. The dangers they encountered by the wolves, the unhappiness of the Indians, dangers in crossing the creeks and the only shelter, until the house was built, was the cover wagon to protect them from nature. I always wondered why Jack always had to follow the wagon and was forced to swim in the rising creek. I felt so sorry for him! Pa had such a sense of humor! Ma was so brave because she was often left alone with the girls while Pa was in town, hunting or getting logs to build with.

The story is about a little girl named Laura Ingalls and her ma, pa, and her two sisters Mary and baby Carrie. In the 1880's they move from Wisconsin to Indian country which is Kansas. They build a house of logs and they face many hardships: a rushing river they have to cross, illness, fires, and an Indian scare. When these events are happening the story goes very fast. The first book, Little House in the Big Wood,s is better than this book because it is more interesting. It is interesting because it doesn't have lots of boring details like when pa and Laura put on a door. There are more exciting parts in Little House in the Big Woods like when Laura and her family go to their grandparents' house for a dance. \\"Suddenly Uncle George did a pigeon wing, and bowing low before Grandma he began to jig. Grandma tossed her spoon to somebody. She put her hands on her hips and faced Uncle George, and everybody shouted. Grandma is jigging.\\" I think that women and girls would like this book.

Once you begin reading this book, you get caught up into the life of this little prairie girl, Laura Ingalls Wilder. The story is so brilliantly written, you will be able to feel how Laura feels through times of happiness and times of great sorrow.Reading through this book will make anybody think that he or she has it easy in life compared to the Ingalls. But through thick and thin, the Ingalls' family was able to survive. This book shows a person that you should never give up no matter how hard things seem in life.The words in the book come from the heart of the author.

Yes, the comments in there about Native Americans are horrible and racist when you look at them in today's context, but Laura was just a innocent little girl who was warned against the big, bad Indians by her parents. She couldn't change what her parents said or did. I definitely would NOT recommend reading this book to little ones. It's a better book for those who have a clearer understand of its context and aren't going to be offended. Remember, it was the 1870's when this was happening, political correctness was unheard of. Even when this book was written, decades after the events within this book, there still was no PC-ness.The parts about making things was fun to read, since it gives us a valuable insight in how different life was back then (though some people might consider that kind of stuff boring). How many of us could survive out on the prairie, no Internet, no electric, no phone, no hardware stores, etc...If you hate this book and want to bash it, please remember the context this book was written in and what things were like back then, where this happened, and the mindsets of many frontier folk. Such books like this give us a valuable understanding of what happened back then, so this book needs to be approached with an open mind."},{"Title":"Cuba 15","review":"This kind of book seems to be circulating a lot lately.

This book Cuba 15 is filled with great descriptions, humor, and everyday situations for teenage girls just trying to get through one day, with out having to worry about how crazy school, boys, and family can be.

As Violet is about to become a women she uses at home situations in her comedy speeches to help her laugh off some of the hilarious get-togethers and cookouts. This book is hilarious and will keep you laughing, from the burning of the roast at the cookout to the endless games of dominos. The book Cuba 15 is a good choice for anyone of any background not only of the Cuban culture.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys learning about something different and would enjoy taking an adventure on a magical ride through a mystical journey, and through the history of different cultures and values by which one culture lives by. The book also makes you feel connected to the characters with the many ways the author describes the mood and feelings of the character, and with the growth of the character, Violet Paz, through the book into womanhood; you also feel like you grow with the character in accepting different forms of doing things and different traditions.

Wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Cuba 15","review":"Violet's quinceanero, something she thought of as a humiliation, changed all her views and prompted an area of her life that changed everything that was anything, and with the party, anything was everything. A quinceanero is what fifteen year-olds of the Hispanic persuasion use as the show of changing from a girl to a woman, and Violet was far from happy about hers. Over a year, Violet competed on the speech team, from which she got a boyfriend, organized her quinceanero, and tried futilely to learn from her secretive family about Cuba, where her Dad was from. Violet got pumped for the party, lied to her parents, and nearly didn't get to have the traditional dance with her Dad. Luckily, every part of the quinceanera's party thudded into place with funny family and friends and an easy to read, quirky book that I would recommend to middle to early high school girls.Violet, or Violeta, was not a perfect teenager, but she learned from her mistakes. For her school speech team, she was in Original Comedy, and she was not very skillful at first, but she figured out how to make something that would win awards. She also figured out that she liked being out on stage. She listened to part of a poem that her best friend Janell was dedicating to her, and got offended before she had the right to do so. Janell told her the rest, and she was flattered. Violeta's biggest mistake was most likely when she lied to her parents about where she was going with her second best friend Leda. They went to a rally for PEACE WITH CUBA, and her father believed that it was evil, especially since she didn't tell him that she was going. Violet did have some sort of reason to go -her father would never talk about Cuba- but she learned not to lie, but to talk.Nancy Osa gave the characters all very different personalities, which kept things interesting. Violet's grandfather (Abuelo) was stubborn; he wouldn't talk about Cuba either, funny with his music and constantly unchanged clothes, and excellent at dominoes. Violet's boyfriend, Clarence, was easy-going, seeing as how he was wide open to playing dominoes with Violet's father and brother instead of being alone with her, caring with his phone calls and willingness to go to a Cuba rally with her and Leda, and sort of scandalous because of the fact that he called Violet's house to ask if she would be at the party and then flirted with Leda. Violet at first didn't think that she was too cool of a person, but learned that she was very unique as a Cuban Polish girl with the crazy family, which she used in her Original Comedy.Cuba 15 brought you through ups and downs that made it really easy to read. As I said, Violet's first speech team performance brought her down for good reason, but after that she got better and started to figure out that a quinceanero is not that bad. She went to the Halloween party after hearing Janell's poem and taking offense to it only to feel bad about her costume and her \\"headless date.\\" Of course, her friends explained and everything was better. The lowest point of the book was when Violeta's dad wouldn't even go to her quinceanero because of her lies, that is, before he came to his senses and gave in to talking about Cuba.There were a lot of things in Cuba 15 that I could relate to, like unfair parents, stress about life in general like Violet had in her fifteenth year of life, or fights with friends as Violet did once, both friends at the same time. It left you with things to think about, but it didn't make it seem like a sequel would come because it would probably mess up the aura of the story, which I will add was fantastic.-K. Carson"},{"Title":"Cuba 15","review":"Violet Paz gives little thought to her ethnicity. She's half-Cuban and half-Polish, but all American. She takes for father's roots for granted, even if her crazy relatives are always visiting for mega-Domino tournaments and zany cookouts. But when her grandmother and parents insist that she participate in her \\"quince,\\" she is forced into a reluctant and embarrassed embrace with an \\"old world\\" tradition.This debut novel masterfully and subtly details the modernization of the quinceanero, a coming-of-age party for a Latina's fifteenth birthday, through the eyes of a clever and humorous teen living near Chicago. The author, Nancy Osa, accurately captures the resentment of parental influence some teens experience in their quest for their own identity. As Violet struggles with being forced to participate in her own quince, she seeks advice from other adult figures who help her balance parental expectations with her own need for independence. Osa pulls off this high-wire act masterfully, not going \\"over the top\\" in teen rebellion fashion, nor making Violet an unbelievably acquiescent parent-pleaser.Osa weaves the subplot into the novel quite well, also. It makes Violet's self-discovery a double success story: not only does she make her quince relevant to her modern, American life, but she uses her zany family's exploits as fodder for her speech team event.CUBA 15 has received considerable attention and been nominated for numerous awards. This is a likeable story from a \\"new\\" author I hope we hear from again! Five stars.Reviewed by: Mark Frye, author and reviewer"},{"Title":"Cuba 15","review":"Violet Paz is a 15 year old, half Cuban half polish teenager growing up is the suburbs of Chicago.

The author, Nancy Osa, wrote this book from Violet Paz's first person point of view. Even though Violet (in her mind) is a full American chica, her Abuela unexpectedly announces that Violet will have to have a \\"quince\\". Feminist Violet is completely against this \\"quince\\", which seems to be her, standing on a stage, and telling a crowded room how feminine and grown up she is since she turned 15. At first, Violet would do anything to get out of it, but after awhile, she's do anything to keep it going perfectly.Although this book had an interesting plot that I have never seen before, there were many characters shoved into it with undeveloped and common personalities. Like the activist child, Leda. Even though she had many interesting qualities, she was just a big ball of nothing but originalities. If all of the characters had had half of the personality expressed through Violet, maybe this book would've been better. There were some funny little quirks, though, that pulled up this book's grade. There was wit, while other times, there was blandness. The start of the book has a slow timeframe, while towards the end, it speeds up, and you feel like it was rushed. This book did have a nice little development of the main character, which is always entertaining in book about reluctant teens. Maybe, due to this development, you wouldn't want to read this book more than once.Also included in Cuba 15 was a crafty selection of Spanglish. I don't know about you, but any book that has little cognitives in it catches my eyes. This book made ME want to learn Spanish. Violet uses her crazy, domino playing, Polish/Cuban family in a Comedy act, which is quite unexpected to me. When first reading the book, I don't think that I could've made an act out of an event like a party gone bad. The first person narrative almost makes you side with Violet on everything, as if you're seeing through her eyes. Violet was the image of a tomboyish comedian making her way in a household where gambling was life and crazy Cubans prance about in yellow monkey shirts. It's a story about finding your culture.I prefer Sci-Fi books, and would highly recommend anything by Nancy Farmer, or The Uglies. Forged by Fire and books by Jack London are other recommendations. If you like Cuba 15, I would suggest more culture from Romiette and Julio. (...)"},{"Title":"Cuba 15","review":"I wouldn't reccomend Cuba 15.

Cuba 15 is a Pura Belpre honor book as well as being recognized by half a dozen other associations for excellence. It is the story of Violet Paz, a Cuban-Polish American girl living in present-day Chicago. In hilarious first person prose, she educates the reader on the quinceanero, a bat mitzvah-type ceremony for fifteen-year old girls celebrated in Latin American countries. Violet is preparing to \\"make her quince\\" in spite of complications presented by her \\"loco\\" family, her typical teenage girlfriends, a possible boyfriend, and her nerve-wracking speech team competitions.An abundance of Spanish words and phrases sprinkle the text with head-scratching regularity (if you don't speak a word of Spanish, which I do not). By the end of the book, however, even I could guess at what was being said, with the help of my Spanish-speaking daughter.Among the book's many strengths are the well wrought characters, the funny and tender situations, and the mind trip to Chicago (a city I love). Especially convincing are Violet's family. Her relatives seem very real with their lack of fashion sense, volatile emotions, and love of dominoes. An example of an outfit Violet's father is wearing (\\"He wore one of those canvas coin pouches the volunteers used at the Lincolnville Petunia Festival every year. Blue plaid pants and penny loafers stuck out below the pouch, and above, he'd tucked in his favorite sunshine-yellow long-sleeved shirt with the monkeys on it\\") paint a grim, embarrassing picture for a fifteen-year old girl.There are a few four-letter words throughout, but nothing that would be extremely disturbing for most people. Sex is limited to one or two chaste kisses between Violet and her speech team friend, which rang sweet and true to life.I was sad to see the last page of Cuba 15 - there were actual tears - and I look forward to reading more from Nancy Osa."},{"Title":"Cuba 15","review":"A well-written and funny coming-of-age story about fifteen year old Violet Paz, this book really keeps the pages turning! With the help of her two best friends, Violet struggles to change tradition at her quince party, a Cuban celebration for teenage girls turning fifteen. Violet also tries to uncover more information about her Cuban roots, which her father and grandparents are unwilling to talk about. The humerous side of the story is found in Violet's crazy family domino tournaments and get togethers, and her adventures competing on a speech team in original comedy. Sure to be a big hit!"},{"Title":"Cuba 15","review":"Violet Paz's family does not understand her, which is hard enough when you are 15, but even worse, SHE doesn't understand THEM. Her Cuban father and Polish mother maintain a lively, loud household where dominos rule, extended family members feel free to meddle into everyone's business and large parties are annual events. When Violet's grandmother insists that Violet have a quinceanero (a 15th birthday celebration announcing her arrival to womanhood), Violet does not see how such a tradition fits into her suburban Chicago life. After all, her father refuses to speak of his life in Cuba and Violet barely speaks the Spanish her parents and grandparent use so easily. Plus, Violet and her girlfriends are much more interested in boys and school than in some archaic Cuban rite of passage. But planning the party is just one of Violet's concerns this year; she also has to come up with an original comedy piece for the Speech competition. As Violet's creativity and poise develop, she learns to better appreciate and understand her loving-if loco-family, and her Cuban heritage. Violet and her friends are lively, well-developed female characters, and this book will be of most interest to teenage girls. But it humorously and touchingly reveals the dynamics of a multi-generational and multi-cultural family, making it a good read for everyone."},{"Title":"Cuba 15","review":"Violet Paz knows little about her half-Cuban, half-Polish heritage.

She finds that quince is instead about tradition, family and self-discovery.CUBA 15 is a wonderful book filled with humor. Armed with &quot;The Dummies Guide to Quinceanera,&quot; Violet learns that she can have a theater theme for her special day, a subject that's very important to her. She does not have to employ all of the old traditions, but she does use enough of them to create a magical mix of cultures with old and new traditions.While preparing for the big event, Violet studies and writes about her family in an attempt to understand them. Her family's marathon domino games become the subject for a comedy sketch she performs for competition. She secretly participates in a rally for Cuba, inspiring great anger and division in her family, who lived among the political strife there. She also finds her first boyfriend and discovers again how valuable her two best friends are to her.The actual event is anticlimactic but fun.

But this is not the ideal birthday present for Violet Paz. Half Cuban on her father's side, and half Polish on her mothers but raised in America Violet doesn't really know what she is. One thing's for sure, she is having a quince&ntilde;ero whether she wants one or not. This is due mainly to her grandmother who speaks a mixture of spanish and English when she's around violet. Violet only really knows what it was like in Cuba when her grandparents throw crazy domino parties while smoking and dancing the conga to loud Latin music. Coming up with the theme of the party, learning how to dance the waltz, trying to glean information abut Cuba from her father, practicing comedy speeches for the speech team, and schoolwork Violet has so much on her plate. But she still finds time for her boyfriend and her two best friends Leda and Janell.Blending Spanish and English words may be confusing for some people but I thought that the author Nancy Osa did a great job of it. She also wrote in first person, it gave me an insight into violets life and made me feel sad or happy for her at times.I really liked this book because I learned a lot about a different culture and what a quince&ntilde;ero is. I thought that Violet was a very believable character and that she fitted in with the story perfectly. El Fin"},{"Title":"Bring It On: Tough Questions.

The feds were breathing down my neck pretty bad, and I needed some advice quick.Luckily, I remembered that Mr. Robertson owned a slave operated gold mine in Liberia, and had worked hand in hand with the tyrannical leader of that nation, Charles Taylor (if you're interested, google \\"Pat Robertson Charles Taylor\\"). I phoned Mr. Robertson and asked him what to do about my problem, and I'll never forget what he told me. He said \\"Son, I don't know who the hell you are, but I'm too damn rich and important to bother with your petty crap.\\" Then he hung up the phone and went back to dealing with corrupt foreign polticians for the sake of his own personal greed. It was the solution I'd been looking for.God bless, Pat. I'll see you in hell, buddy."},{"Title":"Bring It On: Tough Questions. Candid Answers","review":"The intro of this book reads,.... \\"Shortly after America was attacked on September 11, 2001, a survey was taken, asking if the horrific attacks might be part of God's judgment for our sins..\\" For those of you who might remember, Robertson and his buddy Jerry Falwell got in some hot water two days after 9/11 regarding their theory that certain sins -- homosexuality, the ACLU, etc. had caused the tragedy.What's interesting is that Robertson left out some sins.\\"Medical supply planes\\", purchased for donations under the guise of Operation Blessing, were actually used by Robertson's company African Development to ship diamonds from Zaire. According to chief pilot Robert Hinkle, only two of almost 40 flights were actually humanitarian in nature, with minimal loads on each trip. Robertson embraced Mobutu Sese Seko, the currupt dictator of Zaire, three weeks after Mobutu's soldiers opened fire on thousands of peaceful Christians on Sunday, Feb. 16, 1992. To Robertson, Seko was a Christian democrat, rather than a dictator who killed Christians. Local missionaries claimed as many as 250 were killed. Of course, Liberian dictator Charles Taylor was also a Robertson ally with \\"Freedom Gold,\\" until the U.S. supported a coup of that leader a decade later.Was it the sin of the people that led to 9/11.... or corrupt leadership who, because of their ties to regimes like Saudi Arabia, led to the tragedy. Dubya and his dad are bosom Masonic buddies with the MUSLIM Saudi's... and most of the terrorist obviously were trained in and hailed from Saudi Arabia. Saudi government officials openly support organizations that fund terrorist activities.Go figure.As for this book, it's interesting enough and hits many Christian issues.

Dr. Oaklander describes many techniques using play and art therapy, including use of drawings, music, games, puppets, and many other effective avenues to assist children and adolescents in coming to terms with emotional needs, wounds, and challenges. Windows to Our Children is interesting, relevant, and easy to read.

But the actual book offers no evidence whatsoever for this. Peters just THINKS that Shaw comes off as sort of gay. I don't think Peters has much insight into either gay men or Shaw, who not only had a number of well-documented flirtations and sexual liaisons with women but who wrote about male-female relationships with a frankness and insight that only comes from being a deeply involved participant. Shaw was certainly no homophobe, as his sensitive introduction to Frank Harris' biography of Oscar Wilde reveals, and his writings reveal an affectionate respect for certain male-phobic bachelor women (such as Lesbia Grantham in \\"Getting Married\\"!)The rest of the book offers no new insights into Shaw's life or work (the frequent paraphrasing of Shaw's own memoirs gets tiresome.)

As a hardcopy book, it would be invaluable. If it had been implemented properly on the Kindle, it would be even more useful. As it is, the implementation as a Kindle ebook is so poor as to make the reference almost unusable.The problem is that there is no index, and other than scrolling through the entire book it is not practical even to look something up alphabetically. Using the Kindle \\"search\\" function for a keyword is barely usable, as the search find every occurrence of a given word in the entire book, without distinguishing between main topic headings, or, say, the initials in the name of an author quoted within some entry. If you look in \\"Table of contents\\", there are just 4 entries: Preface, Dictionary, Symbols and Endnotes. Clicking on \\"Dictionary\\" just brings you to the first entry, \\"A\\", in the entire dictionary. You then have to scroll through the entire book, page by page (about a second delay for every page turned) to find anything.As an example, I wanted to look up \\"speed of light\\". This is often represented by the symbol \\"c\\". However, searching the book for \\"c\\" comes up with 263 entries, including initials in names, and mostly nothing to do with the speed of light. Searching for \\"speed\\" comes up with 109 entries, mostly not relevant, and searching for \\"speed of light\\" still comes up with 17 entries. One of them (I later found), the 13th in the list, is the main \\"speed of light\\" entry, but it's not distinguished by the search as being a main dictionary entry in any way. It was only by accident, while trying to find something else, that I stumbled independently on this main \\"speed of light\\" entry in the dictionary.If this had been a printed version, I could have found my entry, in alphabetical order, immediately. To try to make the Kindle version somewhat usable, I have now made my own 26 bookmarks, for the start of \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\" entries etc., so that at least I can start my scrolling search at the right letter of the alphabet.This is a great disappointment. It should have been easier to find references in the computer (i.e. Kindle) version, rather than becoming as now almost impossible.

Kingstone's writing style is refreshing and fun, and the organization of materials allows you to instantly become immersed in Barry Harris's brilliant ideas, while also making it easy to find, with a few page turns, any particular concept for review and deeper study. The big payoff is the solo on \\"Like Someone in Love\\" at the end of the book: the solo is lovely, and it is also pedagogically tight in that he manages to display many of the ideas from the book in a musical context. There is a beat by beat analysis showing readers which concepts were put to use at any given point. I have a strong musical background, and was very skeptical at first about the Barry Harris method in general. I am very glad that I went ahead and gave it a shot, and I think my improvising will never be the same! I think debate over whether this is the only way to do things is beside the point. Everyone should try this out for themselves and see what they think! This doesn't make you sound like anyone in particular, it just helps you to explore a vast amount of musical possibilities in a fun and accessible way, and, in this case, that can't be overstated.

The book includes accompanying CD that contains about 2/3s of the flats and models in digital format, including grid paper and spec sheet samples. The book includes sections for men, women, and children, and has most of your basic spec sheets laid out for everyday clothing like pants and skirts as well as shirts and jackets. The tables and charts are helpful for those starting to understand the relationship of the fit clothing to making and how to quantify it to spec sheets, although it is a reference manual not a step by step instruction so further understanding or education is required that you won't find in the book that you would find in a patternmaking book."},{"Title":"The Spec Manual","review":"Easy to read, great resource for students or people in industry, the CD is great too it includes a library of flat sketches and illustrator files."},{"Title":"The Spec Manual","review":"Pretty expansive and I'm wondering if I can find these resources somewhere else.

Her dry sense of humor livens even the most dense chapters on inner history and spelling reform. The book is intended to serve as a text for a graduate course on the history of English, and it is useful for both experienced linguists as well as those who have no prior coursework in linguistics. The text begins with chapters on language, phonology, and writing to provide the novice with background on linguistics, phonology, and phonemic transcription. The chapters that follow on Old English, Middle English, Early Modern English, and Present Day English have dense, but easy to read, overviews of both inner and outer history of the language. Millward intersperses humorous vignettes with her main text and heightens the reader's appreciation for the language"},{"Title":"Biography of the English Language","review":"This book was one of the first books to turn me onto the field of Linguistics. --BUT-- you don't need to be a linguist to enjoy this book. All you need is a curiosity in the history of the English language. Suddenly, all the crazy &quot;rules&quot; of grammar, and the seemingly senseless spelling of many words start to make sense. It is fascinating to see how the language has evolved, and you learn to appreciate the nature of language."},{"Title":"Biography of the English Language","review":"I was fortunate to have Celia Millward as a professor at Boston University. This book was the textbook for her own class on the history of the English language. The book offers an excellent history of the English language that I think any English speaker would find simply fascinating. We use this language every day, so it is interesting to know where it came from! It is also very readable and enjoyable--Mrs. Millward's wit and humor comes across as strongly as her knowledge as an authority on the subject. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Biography of the English Language","review":"There are books on the phonology and such of the English language. There are books on the history of the English language. There are books on the English language today, discussing how it varies from place to place. This book has the distinction of covering all, and covering them all very well. The historical linguistics part is particularly good, whth complete and detailed chapters on the stages from Old English to the present day, but going back to Indo-European. But the first chapter of the book, on present-day English phonology, is also very good. And so is the last one, on \\"English around the world.\\"The only point that could be criticized is the price -- extremely high. I got my copy as a used book on Amazon Marketplace.

It was the textbook required in my recent English class \\"The History of the English Language.\\" I would rate it four or possibly even five stars IF, and this is a BIG if, the author had the courtesy of including page numbers along with location numbers in the Kindle version. This is a TEXT BOOK, and will probably be used along with many others in a class setting. Paying the same full price as the printed version for the luxury of having to ask the professor at every turn \\"What Chapter and paragraph are you reading from?\\" each time he told the rest of the class to look on page 'so-and-so' in the second paragraph. Absolutely worthless for use inside the classroom until this little issue is resolved. So buy a used book instead for classroom use. If this problem is eventually reconciled, then definitely buy the Kindle version, for the information in this book is worth having at hand wherever you may be writing.

There are many typos in this edition, beginning with the cover (transformtum is not a Latin word). More surprising, given the content, is how many grammatical errors it contains as well. Also, the book often uses phonetic symbols that are never explained. The chart on the inside cover, because concerned only with present-day English, omits them. I think this book would cause a lot of frustration for students, and it reaffirms my belief that Cengage is a profit-driven press that does not care much about the quality of the texts it produces."},{"Title":"Biography of the English Language","review":"I have always had a desire to know more about English. This had been a desire for me since my third grade English teacher, Mrs. Phua-xing-chen, told the class she had to go back to her own country. This disappointed me for two reasons:1) I had yet to learn proper English.2) I had no idea how to pronounce her last name.At this moment, a desire awoke inside of my heart, like bologna when you set it on a hot pan and it starts to bubble. My heart bubbled for English. Not that nasty English that you find walking the countryside of Lancaster by those men with big hats and beards. No. I wanted true and genuine English. The kind of English that, when spoken, makes Beowulf dream of roods and tell tales of Canterbury.This was greatly difficult because I still had no idea how to read. So I logged into my amazon account and looked at reviews everywhere. I tried every series on Amazon. Even Hooked on Phonics. Yet none of them did the trick. The bologna in my heart started to wilt. THEN I came by this book! The cover is what got me. Its mildly off-white and yellow cover with ancient writing on the front made my heart race! I ordered it right then and there. Now I speak eloquent English and would not have it any other way.If you are going over this review and cannot read, I urge you to buy this book. Whale-paths will flow for you, Caedmon will sing for you, and Sir Gawain will dance for you! Not the kind of dancing that you would find at a ninth graders' halloween party- where they flail their arms all pretending they're ghosts. No. He will drink a pint, stand on a table, and show you how a true knight dances: by alternating his feet as he kicks, knocking off large turkeys, fruits, and plates full of undercooked mutton! From this book, you will know english better than Leonardo Da Vinci, Napoleon Bonaparte, Gandhi, or even Buddha!"},{"Title":"Biography of the English Language","review":"Millward has written an interesting explanation of the evolution of English, but her modern, progressive, anti-traditional, anti-prescriptive, pro-change bias often gets in the way. Her first mistake is to describe language as \\"conventional\\" rather than traditional, as if people create language by committee instead of inheriting it from others and passing on it others. Her second mistake is to describe language as \\"arbitrary,\\" a rather loose use of the word for someone with little good to say about prescriptive arbiters of language. That's her third mistake: She cannot bring herself to admit that change can be bad and that prescription often serves good purposes, like making it easier to conceive and communicate difficult thoughts, and making it possible for people to communicate with other people from different times and places."},{"Title":"The Scope of Military Geography: Across the Spectrum from Peacetime to War","review":"A fresh approach to the study of Military Geography. Palka and Galgano truly understand the impact of geographic information on the conduct of military operations! Moreover, they clearly appreciate the changing nature of conflict and as a result have addressed the effect of geographic conditions across the full spectrum of military operations. From peacekeeping to small scale contingencies to all out war, they precisely address the range of geographic challenges encountered by military commanders in the past and the anticipated challenges of the future. The vignettes address key issues that the military leader must understand to make timely and accurate decisions.Overall, this book is essential reading for the military leader and a must add to his professional library. Although this is a great military book, the geographic community and public in general would most certainly enjoy looking at classic military operations through a geographic lens. Additionally, all will benefit from the information presented as the traditional lines between peace and war continue to blur."},{"Title":"The Scope of Military Geography: Across the Spectrum from Peacetime to War","review":"This is an essential book, for professional stewards and for students of our national and international responsibilities.

For professionals in all fields it is an essential tool. The authors are top professionals, professors at our United States Military Academy, the world's premier institution for leader development."},{"Title":"The Scope of Military Geography: Across the Spectrum from Peacetime to War","review":"SCOPE is more than a fantastic contribution to the growing list of military geography books; it is simply the best text available!

It is visually spectacular (what else would you expect with such a topic!) and the narrative keeps you entertained as well.This is a book which has universal appeal.

Not only are the pictures gorgeous (is there a calendar format of this?) but the letters are hilarious and I never cease to find something new each time I look at it.

But there's a frilled frog hidden in every picture!! This book is witty, beautiful, and enchanting. I have to buy another 2 copies for friends!!"},{"Title":"Discovery of Dragons","review":"This is the kind of book you leave on a coffee table for visitors to peruse. It has beautiful large color plates of dragons on every left-side page and amusing anecdotes on each facing page.The author is presuming to be an authority on \\"the discovery of dragons\\" and in a tongue-in-cheek narrative is trying to professionally prove the disclaimers of his \\"one time colleague Marty Fibblewitz\\" who has now \\"chosen to side with the doubters.\\" THE DISCOVERY OF DRAGONS is divided into three sections of nine pages each: The Discovery of European Dragons, The Discovery of Asiatic Dragons, and The Discovery of Tropical Dragons. The first page of each section is an introduction to the section that describes the distinctive qualities of the dragons of said region, introduces the adventurer who discovered those dragons, and throws pot-shots at 'Professor' Fibblewitz. The following eight pages of each subsection show the author's 'proof' of these discoveries.European dragons, says the author, were discovered by Bjorn of Bromme, Viking, from A.D. 856 through A.D. 863. He discovered Great Snow Dragons in Greenland, an Emerald Dragon in Ireland, a Welsh Red Dragon sleeping on a horde of treasure, and the St. George Dragon (yes, that very same dragon). The author's proof comes in the way of letters found, scrawled penmanship on linen to his cousin Olaf back in Norway (who seems to be having his own problems Rampaging the countryside).In The Discovery of Asiatic Dragons, we meet heroine Soong Mei Ying, faithful daughter of a thirteenth-century Chinese Silk trader, who--while taking her ailing father's silks to a far away market--discovers a pair of Mongolian Screamers, a Japanese Butterfly Lizard with medicinal qualities, and Eastern Temple Worm, and a Great Golden Worm.Now, the Letters of Dr. E.F. Liebermann in The Discovery of Tropical Dragons might be just a tad funnier than those of Bjorn of Bromme (it's a close tie, actually). Dr. Liebermann went to Africa in 1847 searching for the African Frilled Frog. He never finds this frog, but along the way he discovers four kinds of dragon (Livingstone's Demon, the Crested Dipper, a monstrous Common Green Draak, and several deadly Spotted Marsh Draaks). He also invents the typewriter and figures out the theory of continental drift.This is an adorable book! Each section has its own style, and the characters--illuminated by their letters home--are unique individuals with great quirks. Each page is laden with tiny details that enthralled this reader. The letters home all have subtle changes as the adventurer passes from one discovery into the next--some of them quite hilarious. There's footnotes and maps and scale diagrams and miniature picture story reels across the bottom of each page . . . all done in glorious and changing detail work. But the best part are the dragon plates themselves: these large color paintings are gorgeous. THE DISCOVERY OF DRAGONS is a real winner, the perfect gift choice for a true dragon connoisseur."},{"Title":"Discovery of Dragons","review":"&quot;The discovery of dragons&quot; is an academic textwrittenby Rowland W. Greasebeam B.Sc., the author of such works as&quot;Uncle Greasebeam's big book of scarey dragons&quot; and&quot;Hiss or myth?&quot; (or possibly by Graeme Base). Despite thedefection of his one-time collegue Marty Fibblewitz, Mr Greasebeam haspublished facsimiles of letters written by three great dragondiscoverers, with explanatory notes.The book features colourillustrations, the known world distrobution of the discovered dragons,and handy diagrams indicating size. For example, the Common GreenDraak can be recognised by it's stench, call: &quot;DRAAAAAKDRAAAAAK,&quot; carnivorous nature, and the fact that it is abouttwice the size of an elephant, whereas the more dainty JapaneseButterfly Lizard can be quickly seen to be only about the size of amouse. (This could be very useful to Dragon Watchers, as one would notwant to confuse the two!)As well as dragon afficionados, this bookwould appeal to readers of &quot;Lady Cottington's Pressed FairyBook.&quot;"},{"Title":"Discovery of Dragons","review":"I stumbled upon this book when I was looking around in the Children's Section (yes, I do that), forthe role-playing books. Terribly annoying that they put role-playing in that same category, but ohwell, I'm not so prideful that I won't go there. And I found, much to my surprise, a similar outcast -Base's books are written with amusement and sophistication, and while they could be entertaining ifread to a child, they are not children's books. This one is gorgeous, with the dragons fully rendered,amusing (and fictional) notes in reference to them from various explorers, tiny cartoons in theframing illustrating the stories involving the dragons, and maps of the world which show where thedragon comes from. Also, the dragons have a size comparison, from a man (who happens to berunning away in the silhouette comparison), to an elephant. The only flaw?

I received it only recently, but I am astounded at this spectacular selection.It begins with the letters from Bjorn of Bromme, a 9th century viking. This section is the funniest one in the book. This humor is very hard to describe, you'll have to read it yourself to get the idea. Anyway, this viking travels to many countries for various (and often humorous) reasons. On the way, he discovers four different species of European dragons, while writing letters to his cousin Olaf the Grim about his incredible finds. What is unique about this section is that he loses men every time he finds another dragon!The next section is my personal favorite. A 13th century girl named Soong Mei Ying had a sick father. In order to pay for her father's medical bills, she sets out to Kathmandu, in the hope of gaining money by selling her father's silks. Unfortunetly, the curageous girl's silks are destroyed by a pair of Mongolian Screamers (a kind of dragon she discovers). As she glumly returns home, she discovers a Japanese Butterfly Lizard (my favorite dragon in the book) that could heal her father. This discovery leads her on a fantastic adventure, in which she discovers two more dragons.The final section in \\"Discovery of Dragons\\" tells of the adventures of Prussian cartographer Dr. E. F. Liebermann. He wants to prove the theory of continental drift and so travels from Africa to Madagascar to Tasmania in search of the rare African Frilled Frog that can prove his theory. Instead, however, he discovers four extremely bizarre dragon species. He types letters to his sweetheart on a typewriter he built himself and, unfortunetly, he meets a meets a tragic end.You will love this very unique book. You'll be surprised by the Saint George Dragon, dazzled by the Japanese Butterfly Lizard, and repulsed by the \\"unique\\" Common Green Draak of Madagascar. This book seems to be a mix of a storybook and a zoology book. The illustrations, as mentioned before, are beautiful and detailed and there is one for every dragon.

I agree, too, with his sense of humor, which is probably pitched a bit high for children. My only argument with this particular book is that I wish the artwork had been treated better. The illustrations were originally for a calendar with nearly square format. The book has a conventional &quot;portrait&quot; format, with the major illustrations covering the entire right-hand page and extending onto the left. Since they weren't planned for this format, important detail is often lost in the gutter and that's a shame."},{"Title":"Discovery of Dragons","review":"This book is wonderfully written as if it was true.

Each section has 4 letters written by that serpentologist with a massive picture of the dragon in question. There is two reasons why I haven't given this 5 stars. One because it should be formatted less as a story and more factual and two because the 18 dollar price tag is outrageous. Base should really write more about this subject because he's really in his element here.NOTE: While this is considered a 'picture book' it is not for anyone under 10 years old(and not many 10 year olds will get it either)."},{"Title":"Discovery of Dragons","review":"This is in fact a good book but it has one big problem.The price is way off.I spent 19 dollars for a book with some letters and paintings.Don't get me wrong it does have great dragon species and info and more that will delight any dragon lover but the price should be racked down to around 10 dollars.Believe me if you are a serious dragon fanatic get the dragonology books(dragonology,dragonology handbook and dragonology 2006 calendar).If you are obsessed with dragons though(like me) you might still want to get this book.But i doubt it will be one of your favorites."},{"Title":"Blessed Are Those Who Mourn; Personalized Prayers of the Faithful for the Funeral Rite With Disk","review":"&quot;Blessed Are Those Who Mourn&quot; is an excellent resource for prayers for funerals.

Soon, competition is breeding and jealousies erupt.This story is a great lesson on money, its corrupting influence, and also friendship.

It is a great story, as per usual with Asterix and friends."},{"Title":"Asterix Obelix and Co.","review":"As a child, I read all of the \\"classic\\" Asterix books in Swedish. As an adult living in the U.S., I am reading them again to my children, but this time in English. In brief, Asterix and Obelix live in small village in Gaul(Ancient France) that Julius Caesar never succeeded to subdue. This is because they have a magic potion that makes the villagers super strong.In this story Julius Caesar is trying something new. Julius Ceasar is encouraging the villagers to become business men in the menhir market. He then hopes to make them so busy, wealthy and decadent that they forget about resisting Rome. All that \\"old Julius\\" accomplishes is wrecking the Roman economy.This book is one of the funniest in the series, laughs are guaranteed. Some feel this book is an attack on Capitalism. I think it depends on how you read it. I think it was a critique/satire of vanity, greed and human nature rather than an economic system.These comic books are a great way to teach children ancient history. Naturally, the adult needs to help with the differentiation between fiction and history.
