A hobbit is (or was) a quiet, peace-loving creature who usaully lived on hills and disliked normal human, or, as they say, &quot;the big people.&quot; They didn't believe in modern technology and got most of their resources from nature.

This is a fantasy adventure like no other. I would recommend this book to lovers of fantasy adventures.

Tolkien. A young Hafling, name Biblo is drafted against his will into an adventure that forces him to face down trolls, goblins, and a horrible dragon. The Hobbit is a tale of magic and adventure that any Tolkien fan will enjoy reading, for the simple reason that it is a good example of his wild imagination.Readers above the age of 12, however, will find the book somewhat childish, as was Tolkien's intent. The story he wrote for his children, as is apparent in the ease of reading, and toned-down violence. If you do not plan to read The Lord of the Rings, I suggest you ignore this book. If you do, however, plan to read the best adventure story of all time, read the Hobbit only because it leads up the story about Bilbo's nephew, Frodo Baggins, and his adventure in The Lord of the Rings. You can finish it relatively quickly, and better enjoy the sequel trilogy. I read at only 350 words/minute, and I was able to finish this book in two nights (a total of maybe 6 hours).If, however, you would rather read a story to a young child, this book would serve as great entertainment. I further suggest that you be sure to purchase an illustrated version, as if your reason for purchase is thus, a child would enjoy to see Tolkien's monsters monsters come to life."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This book is about a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins that has a lot of courage and spunk. i wish i had that much courage. i think this book is for advanced readers that are very sufisticated."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The main character, Bilbo, starts out hating adventure, but in the end he has a slightly different opinion.

The character development is top notch and the book is a very quick read. Tolkien's ingenuity in creating a time and place is surpassed by none. The one odd thing I noticed is that it appears that the Lord of the Rings was written for a more mature audience than the Hobbit. All that being said, I find myself re-reading the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings every two to three years with the same amount of enjoyment and a growing appreciation each time."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I am not a fantasy/sci-fi reader, and I did not overly enjoy Tolkien's extreme run-on sentences. I admit that I had to read more carefully. But aside from those issues...I Love This Book! Tolkien talks directly to the reader, interrupting himself every now and then to define a term, give a background fact, and sometimes to show the reader just how anxious he is to tell us the ending before we get there! Pictures are easily created. Puns are very intented. Characters are realistic in their personalities and traits. Any reader who gives the book a chapter's chance will become involved in Bilbo's adventure of a lifetime."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I recently re-read The Hobbit, a story I first read in High School. My children are of an age to read it, so this time I read it with a critical eye, rather than for the sheer joy of immersing myself in a story of adventure and fantasy.It is unfortunate that the Hobbit has apparently become required reading in some schools. Forcing young adults the read a fairy tale in these literal and cynical times may only dampen their enthusiasm for literature. This book was written to be read for enjoyment, not a grade.So read it and enjoy a tale that will take you far from the fast paced industrial world we live in, into the land of imagination and adventure. Read it aloud to your children, and you will find them very attentive.Now, on to the review.A significant obstacle to enjoying this story is Tolkein's British English, which carries a startling variety of idomatic phrases and terms not currently in use here in America. I have had to translate a lot of words and terms for my children when they have had trouble with understanding.The style is light hearted and conversational. You feel as though the story teller is speaking to you in a friendly voice. The frequent asides and blatant foreshadowing add a personal touch to the story that enhances, rather than detracts, from its accessability.The themes are fairly easy to discern, and particularly good for young audiences. Far from beng a whimsical fairy tale, there are simple messages here, even for the un-alerted reader. Such as:Heroes arise from unlikely sources. (This is certainly true in real life.)The sedentary life has little flavor-- get out and have an adventure.Self interest and greed are dangerous motivators.Trying your best can produce results for unexpected reasons.Ones actions can have unintended consequences for others. The devastation of Lake Town is a poignant illustration of this concept, often overlooked in today's self oriented culture. At a time where the lawsuit and strict liability grossly punish unintended outcomes, the conscience driven resolution in the Hobbit is a refreshing concept.Is this the best story ever written? Hardly. Is it an engaging and enjoyable adventure story? Absolutely!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"In honor of the upcoming movie The Hobbit The Unexpected Journey (part 1) coming out in theaters on December 14th, I have requested to review the newest edition of The Hobbit from .I have started reading the book with the kids after we have done all essential school work and they love it. We sit down in the living room and proceed to get projected into the world of Bilbo and his friends. The kids always want to know what will happen next when I completed on chapter. Unfortunately for them, my throat is dry by that time and I think that keeping the suspense is perfect because they look forward about our time together to discover the adventures the characters are living.This book is definitively a classic. I remember reading it in French when I was younger. I enjoyed it and was looking forward to read it again. However, this time I am reading it in English and with my kids. Deep down I hope and pray that this book will become a classic that they will re-read again in the future. Knowing that the movie is coming up, my oldest son keeps telling me that he wants to see the movie. I think we will start with the Lord of the Rings which we have already at home. The Hobbit is the prequel of the series The Lord of the Rings.I highly recommend this book to everyone. If you have never read it, you have to discover this story. It is simply fabulous (though sometimes the names or English is written bizarrely) and it will keep you entertained from cover to cover.

Great book and a great edition."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"After seeing the epic motion picture trilogy, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" saga can be difficult to picture individually for readers. This happens all to often when the adaption between a book to a movie or play takes place. Luckily for readers of \\"The Hobbit,\\" the story of Bilbo and his adventures haven't yet had that transformation, and leave us to create a new picture of our own within Middle Earth.\\"The Hobbit\\" is the prelude to the widely known \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" series. It is one of few preludes, in my mind, that is actually effective. In the book the reader finds out much about J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"Middle Earth,\\" and has insight into its following books. This story faintly foreshadows many things that are to take place in the upcoming trilogy. However, for those of you who have read the book amd trilogy, you will have noticed the difference in Tolkiens voice and personality in \\"The Hobbit.\\"In my opinion \\"The Hobbit\\" is much lighter and not as dramatic as \\"The Lord of the RIngs.\\" It has serious parts no doubt, but the prelude seems to be more of a pleasing and joyful story, where as the trilogy focuses more on a moral and getting a message across to the reader. I enjoy both reads, but when you are in need of something that will brighten you up and excite your imagination as well, \\"The Hobbit\\" is definetely the better way to goI guess you could also say that's why i enjoyed \\"The Hobbit\\" more than most books out at the moment. Lately all authors have been focused on is creating something,\\" brutally honest!\\" or ,\\"heart-wrenching!\\" and ,\\"so sad i wanted to cry!\\" Sure, those things are good in some parts of a book, but if all the book your reading does is make you even more sad than you already were... what's the point in reading it? And as for it being \\"brutally honest,\\"... well lets just say somethings are better left unsaid,and definetely better left unknown.As I said earlier, that's what is different about this book though. It seems that Tolkien was simply recording his fantasies about the most appealing and envied life-style we can imagine, then creating a story based around that dream. Then he took it further and created this entrancing tale into a epic saga getting an important and major point across to the readers of the book. The whole collection of stories is simply amazing, and it's hard to believe that one man can come up with all these details and individual tales of fiction.Enough about the series though, I'd like to talk more about the book at hand. \\"The Hobbit\\" starts with an explanation of our good friend Bilbo Baggins and his dwelling within the earth. It takes a moment to explain to us just a little bit about the life-style of a hobbit, and the Shire that they dwell in. The first chapter waists no time introducing the true story however, and after the brief explanation of a hobbit it jumps into the tale. In the next two chapters we have already left the Shire, and surprisingly Bilbo has been accompinied by 13 dwarves and an old wise wizard name Gandalf. In no time at all the reader has entered the Misty Mountains to the West and read as the company of travelers encounter orcs within the mountains.In the mountains, perhaps the most major part of the book takes place; Bilbo discovers the Ring. With the discovery of the ring, he also comes across an odd creature that later turns out to be known by the name of Gollum. Both of these discoveries are key points with in the entire prelude and trilogy.Once out of the mountains, the company meets a giant of a man named Beorn, and with his warnings proceeds into the Mirkwood Forrest.The story then goes on to tell of the expeditions capture by the elves of Mirkwood, and their encounter with Dragon, Orc, Goblins, Wolves, and more. To end the book the group of hobbit, wizard, and dwarf ends up with a vast amount of jewls and riches(which was their original goal to start out with) and has Bilbo return to his home in the shire safe, yet not untouched.Altogether i think the story of Bilbo was successful in being a book new and different for its time. It proved to be a happier and more enjoyable read than almost anything i can think of at this point in the world. And it surely opened up a new world to readers and introduced the magical world of Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"In a mythical or maybe just forgotten time, many creatures lived in places like the Shire, home to Bilbo Baggins, Hobbit. Hobbits are comfort loving creatures with no real sense for adventure. A knock on the door and Bilbo's life is about to change.Calling this book children's book is like calling \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" [see \\"The Annotated Alice\\"] a children's book. Yes children can read this book and it is fun. How ever there is a lot more to this book than a cute story. And it has all the depth of the other Tolkien works with the exception of being shorter.Many people look at this story as a prequel to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", where in reality it is a stand-alone story with a perfectly good beginning, middle, and end. When you read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" there is enough description to forgo \\"The Hobbit.\\" Personally, I find that reading The Lord of the Rings first gave me the in-depth background to better appreciate The Hobbit.Many of the creatures and adventures will put you on the edge of your seat. You will recognize the personalities and grow along will Bilbo as he faces new challenges as he learns to deal with life.A good book to read first would be \\"The Power of Myth\\" by Joseph Campbell. Then you get a clearer picture of why the story progresses as it does."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I recently read \\"The Hobbit\\" as well as the main \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, and I really enjoyed all four books. However, I have to note something. Before reading the series, I was under the impression that \\"The Hobbit\\" was an unnecessary, but related book mainly telling you more about hobbits. However, it does more than just tell you about hobbits, and, in my opinion, it is necessary to read \\"The Hobbit\\" before reading the main trilogy. There is a lot of content in it that will make the trilogy even better. For example, \\"The Hobbit\\" tells you how Bilbo happened to find the ring, it tells you a fair amount of useful \\"history\\", and it can help you make more sense out of much of what is mentioned in the trilogy, such as locations and such.This book could very well be read without reading the trilogy. However, I would definitely recommend reading all four books, because they are all very exciting, and each one builds up more and more interest as the story unfolds.As other reviewers have mentioned, the writing style could have been better.I only gave this book 4 stars mainly for that reason. The style isn't too bad, however, it can be a little annoying at times. Sometimes it sounds more like an uninvolved person commenting on the situation, other times it is like a storyteller getting distracted too much by a similar story or by history. That is one of the very few problems I found with this book.Overall, I am glad that I finally read these books, and I am especially glad that I was able to read \\"The Hobbit\\" before I read the main trilogy. I highly recommend all four books. They are all very exciting with constant surprises and twists in the plot to keep you interested. Read and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This book really is a genius story, although, if yur someone like me you have to wonder, with the way Tolkien writes this story, how did he know when and how all this happened?Anyways, as some might have thought his style of writing, odd, I thought it entertaining, he kade it seem like he was telling you, you sitting there reading this loooong book, what's going on. I swear at some points I could here him telling it to me. It's just such a wonderful way to write.As for the ending, although odd, for those who haven't read it yet don't read this next part! I still wonder how such a magnificent dragon, as described in the book, is killed so easily!When I started reading the end finally) I couldn't put it down, so much happens in the last 20 pages, you have to wonder how he crammed all that story in there.Seeing as it took me forever to read, I liked how in some chapters he would take you infor the detailed begining of one of their many adventures, and then in the last 2 pages of the book would sumarize what happenened to the gruop in the end!I'm more into realistic fiction, but I have a few exceptions here and there, this is fantastic, if you have a lot of reading time on your hands, then this is a good book for you."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I didn't read any of Tolkien's books until the movies(awesome) came out and made me interested. So I started with The Hobbit. Amazing. The whole book feels like this big classic adventure and its fun to read. It is also very important in setting up The Lord of the Rings books. Gandalf has got to be one the best characters ever created along with Bilbo of course.There have been many people who have tried to imitate Tolkien's works(Christoper Paolini who wouldn't know originality if it broke his nose) is one example. And sadly no one has made fantasty equal to The Hobbit, Narnia is close but not quite as good. Because if someone did make a fantasty equal to The Hobbit we could have the joy of reading another book that captures your imagination and takes you to another world."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Although \\"The Hobbit\\" exists alone in the Middle-earth realm, it preludes (and is fairly crucial) as the foundation to the masterpiece story \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". The novel follows the comfortable hobbit Bilbo Baggins as he reluctantly leaves his secure home in the company of numerous dwarves and Gandalf, a wizard of good character. The author expertly combines delightful riddles, the singing of well-versed songs, and adolescent banter amid charming creatures, spooky monsters, and minor magic to craft the ideal tale for young readers.The continuous adventure may start with many characters, but Bilbo composes the storyline from a third person view and interjects his own pleasant personality. Other than one affair relating to Gandalf and a Necromancer, all events are resolved in a thorough yet amusing manner. \\"The Hobbit\\" helped define expectations for a reader and laid the groundwork for future fantasy novels with the introduction of different races including Dwarves, Elves, Goblins, Hobbits, and their relationships between each other and with Humankind.The collection I own has \\"The Hobbit\\" along with all books of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and contains inside the final novel a comprehensive appendices and index, the ultimate standard for any author wishing to compile a comprehensive series. Original artwork by the author highlights storyline events and sufficiently illustrates the path traveled by the adventurers. As with about every film-based novel, I would suggest at least not watching the movie prior to reading the book if not forgoing the movie thereby leaving the story entirely to the imagination.I highly recommend the book collection to any fan of the fantasy genre.Thank you."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I visited an old friend I hadn't seen since the fifth grade, my first 'Hobbit' book. Although I like what they did with the movie, they couldn't have copied the depth of the novel onto the screen, it's something different. The movie will only wet your appetite, so read the book for the full Tolkien experience. I enjoyed visiting the characters again as an adult, re-visiting the Hobbit's wonderful world with a tear in my eye. As a youngster I didn't get the 'feel' of how J.R.R. Tolkien's feelings about war spiced the pages, but they rang in my ears reading it as an adult.

Not sure I ever read it as a young adult. Read in a few days so a fast read."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"What has always impressed me about Tolkien is the attention to detail he puts into his work, and The Hobbit is no exception. You almost get the feeling that there really is a 'Middle Earth' out there somewhere.The saying \\"out of the frying-pan and into the fire\\" comes to mind when I describe The Hobbit to you, because this is a very fast-paced story, though not in the sense that the book is made of one epic battle scene after another. The plot spans over about a year, but the journeying itself is described sparingly while their (often dangerous) encounters with monsters and other races are described in great detail. The downside to this was that the climax seemed a bit rushed,but I enjoyed it nonetheless.The narration is old-fashioned, yet perfectly understandable. It reminded me of my middle grade teacher who used to read out loud to us in class. Sometimes the narrator speaks directly to the reader by commenting on the current happening in the book and it made me feel as if the narrator was letting me in on a secret of his by sharing the story to me.I really liked that Bilbo was, ironically, a very unenthusiastic participant in his own adventure. Though his almost dormant Took family genes, who are known for their odd adventurousness, is what in the end makes Bilbo accept his job as \\"The Burglar, \\" I'd dare say he is pretty much dragged into the whole thing. Tolkien uses a simple but effective way to show the great character development that Bilbo makes throughout the story by comparing the two sides of his heritage to each other. When he starts out, Bilbo sees himself as a hundred percent 'Baggins', a respectful and proper hobbit, but later comes to acknowledge that there might be a bit of the adventurous Took in him after all.There are thirteen dwarves (and a wizard) that Bilbo travels with, a number which I found a bit unnecessary. I think that Tolkien could have used half the number of dwarves and it would still have made the same story. Overflow of dwarves aside, I really enjoyed reading The book."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I finally got around to reading this book.

This book is so enjoyable, i find myself smiling as i read the book! This book makes me feel young again. Like im listening to stories of adventures long ago around a bonfire. This book speaks to every individual reader and grabs their attention for every page of the book. I higly reccommed this book to all age groups. Young ones will like the adventures, the old will like to feel young again with the tale of Bilbo Baggins, &#34;the burglar&#34;. With an undercurrent of modest humor, the book get you to laugh at the silly things the Dwarves, and other characters do. I was also surprised to find illustrations in the book! How cool is that?! Please read this book! it is worth your time!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Okay I know that alot of people liked this book but I doubt its for the reason that it was a good novel but rather because J.R.R Tolkien wrote it so it must be a good story right? WRONG! I found it to be extremely silly at the way that Bilbo got out of all the different situations he got himself into. Very very silly and why exactly did he have to be in this grand adventure that Gandalf insisted he be in. Nothing about Bilbo appealed to me and I absolutely found the style way to dry and dull to the point where I had to stop reading it for awhile just to get a refreshed feeling.The only part that was slightly good was with Gollum but I found a lot of the ways that Bilbo solved the riddles so really pathetic that I wondered what the point was. I meen afterall Bilbo is soooooo smart that why even ask a riddle at all? I found Gandalf extremely annoying as well.Sorry but I hardly think Tolkien is deserving of the title 'master of fantasy.'"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I&#65533;m thrilled that I read something by Tolkien the whole way through, so that I can now, without any doubt, say that I absolutely hate his writing, and I will never pick up another one of his books again. I love fantasy, and it's about the only genre I read these days, but Tolkien does absolutely nothing for me.The story was extremely childish (which, I suppose, makes sense, since it was written as a children&#65533;s story). Bilbo and company would get themselves in trouble, and the solutions and the ways they got out of seemingly overwhelming circumstances were&#65533; laughable at best. Trolls get turned to stone by the coming of dawn, giant spiders easily abandon their prey at the sound of a taunt, and even the dragon proves to be less than fierce. Very silly indeed. The writing style was incredibly repetitive! If I had to read, one more time that &#65533;Bilbo wished he was back in his hobbit hole&#65533; and not for the last time!&#65533; I would have had it. As it was, the repetition was really trying my patience. Also, the first person narrator bothered me. Who WAS this person? If he constantly refers to himself as &#65533;I&#65533;, then he should make it clear who he is, and how he knows all about the hobbit&#65533;s adventures! Even the storyline was incredibly linear and predictable. There was little to no excitement in the entire book, and nothing caught me by surprise.Overall, I know my opinion is an unpopular one, and there are many fans of Tolkien's writing. I'll just have to accept that I'll never be among them."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"You know, I was so excited to finally read the &quot;legendary&quot; Hobbit. It turns out that it is a fantasy book for a 3rd grade reading level and a 1st grade imagination. After reading literary masterpieces by Robert Jordan, and Aurther C.

Well here's some news for you. There are some actually good childrens' books out there.Not all would doom this 1 star, but no way would this book be receiving so many 5 star reviews unless it was written by Tolkien.I'm not saying someone couldn't like it, but from any sane point of view it just isn't *good*.

The Hobbit is terrible. The Hobbit is down right boring. It's hard to follow and is extremely dumb. It faces in on Bilbo Baggins, a lonely hobbit. Suddenly, he is left with a band of dwarves, who take him on an adventure. All he worries about is that he left his handkerchief at home. While he faces evil orcs, goblins, and wolves, he gains the respect of the other dwarves with the help of a magic ring. He also ends up in mental challenges as well as physical, such as a riddle contest with Gollum, a creature from the sea. The last few chapters about facing the dragon Smaug, are very hard to follow. To tell the truth, I probably don't know how it ends. I strongly recommend that you do not read this book. I think that J. R. R. Tolkien did a terrible job of tying the book together.

Until one day a wise and mysterious wizard, Gandalf, and thirteen lively dwarves unexpectedly disrupt his life. They manage to recruit Bilbo as a burglar to help them with their quest to The Mountain where they plan to reclaim their lost treasure, stolen (and now guarded) by a fierce dragon. Throughout their journey they encounter many dangerous obstacles, including trolls, goblins, riddle solving, spiders, and of course, the fearsome dragon, Smaug the Magnificent.Portions of the book drag, but overall The Hobbit is a captivating read.

The book hasn't disappointed me, but hasn't overwhelmed me either. Tolkien's writing is charming, endearing and very enjoyable, but I couldn't really see why The Hobbit is considered one of the 20th century masterpieces. Unless I missed a whole different level of meaning, the book can hardly qualify as serious reading material that is supposed to evoke deep thought, but for what it appears to be, a harmless fantasy tale, it serves its purpose.If you have never read The Hobbit and have some free time on your hands - do read it, if only as a tribute to a classic. If you don't have too much free time - don't bother with it."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Set in a magical land filled with adventure in the \\"old days\\", J.R.R. Tolkien's novel, The Hobbit, is a story of a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins who has an unexpected, unwanted, adventure of a lifetime. The main character, Bilbo Baggins, is just a normal, modern day hobbit that lives in a normal, modern day town (modern for the &quot;old days&quot;). He just wants to live in peace in his \\"hobbit hole\\" and to drink tea and eat cake all day. He enjoys visitors and certainly isn't looking for an adventure. But what he gets are unexpected guests who are strangers and an adventure he'll never forget. Over the edge of the wild, through the Misty Mountains, through Mirkwood forest, and to Lonely Mountain where the dreaded Smaug the dragon lies, guarding the not forgotten cache of treasure once belonging to the legendary dwarfs under the mountain whom once existed. Bilbo's job is to assist the descendents of the legendary dwarfs (yes, they are dwarfs too) in taking back their precious treasure. On this epic journey, they battle trolls, goblins, wolves, giant spiders, and encounter many more mysterious creatures and obstacles. I thought that this book was great, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes adventurous stories with a fantasy like quality to it. It has many bold, diverse, built up characters involved that make it exciting. It was an unpredictable adventure all the way through."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's book &quot;The Hobbit&quot; Is about Bilbo Baggins (The Hobbit), his Dwarve friends and Gandalf the wizard. They are all on a hunt for this treasure. But the treasure is guarded by a dragon. They all come into several encounters with: elves, giant spiders, eagles, goblins, wolves, and many more. It is a very far adventure. They myst travel hundreds of miles to get to the treasure through haunted forrests, across rivers, and through caves. &quot;Must we go any further?&quot; asked Bilbo at many parts in the story. And the answer was always &quot;Yes&quot; They all tried so hard at everything they did. Especially at getting the treasure and defending themselves and eachother when they were in dangerous situations. I think this is one of the best books that I have ever read. It is amazing how good someone can describe some things. Such as J.R.R. Tolkien does in this book.

Adults will enjoy it for the historical value and amusing style.The only thing I would criticize is the simplicity of the story. Too many details are left out for my taste (of course that is part of the magic, it requires you to use YOUR imagination to flesh out the story!), but I think that is mostly due to the looooooooong storylines I have read in the last 3 years.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This book was written by a linguistic professor in the armed services in WWI in a series of letters to his son, Christopher Tolkien. Before this book was published, fantasy did not exist in the realm of fiction. The depth of the world created and the play with language make it easy to forget this book was written for a child. This book is in many ways the Sgt Peppers of Rock and Roll, the Beethoven's Fifth of symphonies, the Romeo and Juliet of love stories. Each time I read it, I discover something new about writing and about myself. Do yourself a favor and get to know this particular Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The writings of Professor Tolkien are absolutely Timeless. These books are the gauge by-which all Fantasy books are measured. The Hobbit and The Trilogy have been the Inspiration for decades of works by other authors, yet I have not ever seen these works surpassed by anyone. Terry Brooks is the only author I have read who even compares to J.R.R. Tolkien and his epic style. I became fascinated with The Hobbit and Trilogy when I was in the seventh grade. I borrowed them from a friend and snuck them home. I was completely enthralled with the world Tolkien created. I was not allowed to read anything that was even remotely related to Wizards, Witches, Astrology, D&amp;D, etc., so these books were like nothing I had ever seen, before. I was captivated and felt the call to become a Writer. Previously, the poetry and such that we were studying in school BORED me to tears. I found my schooling to be mind-numbingly BORING and Tolkien became my Inspiration to Learn, create Poetry, Write stories, Study, become an Anthropologist, delve into Masonic Lore and so much more.... Throughout High-School, I had pictures of Prof. Tolkien on my wall and I desired to be like him. Not-only was he the Greatest Fantasy Writer the world has known, but he was &quot;Professor of Anglo-Saxon, at Oxford University, from 1925 to 1945....and professor of English Language and Literature....and a Fellow of Merton College from '45 to his retirement in '59.&quot; Check out his translations of (book title:)&quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl, and Sir Orfeo&quot; (J.R.R. Tolkien) Also, Prof. Tolkien wrote wonderful stories like &quot;Smith of Wooten Major (&amp;) Farmer Giles of Ham&quot; for children. Pop those titles into the search box! I can honestly say that reading Tolkien changed my life...for the Better! Tolkien created the highest standards of writing for generations of authors....I am quite sure he would be deeply disappointed with the majority of books published today, with numerous spelling errors and pathetic grammar. I believe Tolkien is a god-send to English teachers. Perhaps, he can still inspire young people to elevate their Writing and English skills, from beyond. I would fight to keep his works on the shelves. I was not allowed to do my Senior Thesis about this author, despite the fact that he is such an amazing author and advocate of Literature. I lost interest in doing my thesis and threw something together at the last minute. Perhaps teachers should Recognize the potential for inspiring youth, via the works of J.R.R.

That is a great many years too many. My memory of this book was one of boredom, dryness, and an overall lacking. It is quite apparent that either my memory is lacking or I read this book much to young to appreciate it fully.This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. I particularly appreciate and identify with a hero who is not macho. He is not strong. He is not selfless and morally superior. He is made of real things, and is enjoyable with his flaws. You root for him when he comes through in a pinch; he has an ability to come up with clever ideas under pressure. But he, good old Bilbo Baggins, would rather prefer being at home taking tea and eating cakes.There is great wealth here - in imagery, action, character, conflict, and, yes, humor. This classic fantasy is so entirely engaging that you are constantly eager for what happens next. How on earth can they escape the goblins? Surely the party will all die at the legs of giant spiders!Often you hear of books that are \\"must reads\\", and there are so many of those that you just brush off as fluff an nonsense. This is one to not be brushed off, as it is timeless in its appeal to all audiences (well, above a certain age, since I in my single-digit youth didn't fall under its spell, naturally).

Perhaps it is because I read it as a child, and it first introduced me to dwarves and elves in a way far different from their Disney counterparts. Perhaps it was the humanity of characters laid out for me to see. I am not sure exactly what it was, but after rereading it for the upteenth time, it still has not lost a smidgen of its charm.Sure, Lord of the Rings is the serious book, the more adultish, more classic quest fantasy to save the world from mortal peril sort of thing. The Hobbit is more of a quest to save Bilbo from living his life without a single thing happening that was unexpected. I think this central difference, combined with a younger target audience for this book, makes this book have a much more carefree attitude, and a generally much more merry tale.The pace of the Hobbit is pretty rapid, since really the journey of this story would have been of a similar length as Lord of the Rings, with a lot of detail simply missing from this book. The first leg of the journey was almost identical to Frodo's in route at least, yet it is over in a couple of chapters. Really, the lesser significance of this quest required a lot less development early on.What you really do see happen in the Hobbit, which is nearly absent in Lord of the Rings, is how a bit of a fussy homebody is changed into a daring and wise companion by means of the journey. Bilbo proved to be the lucky 'fourteenth' man on the quests of the dwarf Thorin to reclaim his homeland and treasure, and that was lucky for not only the dwarves, but for Bilbo himself. Even Gandalf discovered that there was more to Bilbo than meets the eye, as the hobbit proved himself useful in a lot of very different situations.It is a wonder to see a character develop like Bilbo during the course of a single novel. It is an exceedingly rare sight these days, to see something like this happen, and it is refreshing to see it again here.The songs in this book aren't the poet things from Lord of the Rings, but more like drinking songs with simple rhymes. This [songs] is not a favorite now a days, but I kinda like them. Trying to figure out a tune to go with each one is difficult at times, but it makes it that much better.

Even Gandalf discovered that there was more to Bilbo than meets the eye, as the hobbit proved himself useful in a lot of very different situations.It is a wonder to see a character develop like Bilbo during the course of a single novel. It is an exceedingly rare sight these days, to see something like this happen, and it is refreshing to see it again here.The songs in this book aren't the poet things from Lord of the Rings, but more like drinking songs with simple rhymes. This [songs] is not a favorite now a days, but I kinda like them. Trying to figure out a tune to go with each one is difficult at times, but it makes it that much better. You can always just skip them, like I did when I was a kid.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This book is phenomenal.

I picked up the book years after seeing the LOTR Trilogy motion picture and I thought to myself how did I not pick the book years before and felt I've wasted my time reading other fantasy books when we have the granddaddy of all fantasy literature just waiting to be read?The great thing about this book is, it is surprisingly readable (since the story was originally for JRRT's children)and not bothering to rack up your brain trying to decipher excessive archaic writings. This is one of the best literary treasures to own along the lines of Tolkien's sagas!The only drawback is also the very thing that made this book great; you will not stop reading it and feel the need to read and know more of the canonical characters, places and events. But worry no more, Tolkien's preceding/succeeding stories are in no way short of stock.All in all, I am awestruck and amazed how a children's book could still enchant a grown up like me.

The pages practically turn themselves in this tale of Bilbo and the Ring. Bilbo's journey is epic. Our humble hobbit faces up to great dangers, is morally and physically challenged. In the end Bilbo is transformed by the journey: he becomes more courageous, more generous, and more a complete living being. I read this as a twelve year old and absolutely relished every page: it's readability is outstanding. The far more imaginative Lord of the Rings trilogy is often badly written and overdrawn. The later work has obviously lit the fires of fifty million dreams, but this first book is the more taut.

Although there have been countless versions of The Hobbit, this version has the illustrations to match the wonderful and timeless story. The story is about a young hobbit who is rudely torn from his comfortable surroundings to embark on a heroic, sometimes horrific, sometimes hysterical adventure. The Hobbit started a fantasy tradition that has only gained momentum with time. Tokein's discriptions of the adventuring party's trials and tribulations are both heartwarming and at times gut-wrenching. The pictures in this version definitely do this classic justice. I especially enjoy the rich picture of the dragon Smaug hording his vast treasure and the evil swamp creature Gollum harrassing poor Bilbo the Hobbit.

Tolkien is the master of fantasy, it has been determined, I decided to judge for myself. I had started reading the Hobbit a few times before, and enjoyed it, though I would always put it down for something slightly more riveting, interesting, or something that just came out :::cough Harry Potter book 4:::: and I had to read. When I finally picked it up again, determined to read it before I read the LOTR, and determined to read them before the movie, I was pushed gently at first and then given a sudden yet enthralling shove into the Middle Earth.The adventures of Bilbo Baggins are like no other. They are calm enough to make you feel cozy inside, yet interesting enough to make you keep reading. Tolkien's gift for writing, though celebrated many times, is never as strong as the first time you read the first page of the Hobbit. I lived through each moment, and found myself picking up the book subconciously and just reading it, as though I was thumbing through my life story, as oppose to that of Bilbo.Tolkien created one of the most subtle and real realities I have ever come across. He created a totally believable spiecies of creature (many, actually), a totally believable plot and a wonderfully magical tale that will leave you all warm inside, and wanting more! The perfect push-off point for the Lord of the Rings. Every time the LOTR got slightly boring, or slowed down, I just remembered how calmly I had been able to read the Hobbit, and it kept me from giving up altogether.

From the beginning I was enthralled with the characters as well as the tale, and soon found I was reading it while walking home from work, on the stairmaster at the gym, and at night when I should have been sleeping.

Tolkien was the ultimate &quot;philologist&quot; in both a literal, academic sense and in a broader, more general sense. That is to say, he was a true &quot;lover of words&quot; and no writer has ever &quot;sub-created&quot; a magical world on the basis of a deeper knowledge of, and love of, words. What is more, as any true philologist, he saw very clearly the power of myth and how language and myth interweave. The longer trilogy with followed allowed him to unfold all these aspects of his writing in a fuller, deeper way...and yet there is still something about the Hobbit, the antechamber of Middle Earth that draws one back to it again and again. It is eminently readable and approachable, for one thing. One can easily plow though it for a light evening's reading.

Yes, there are goblins, and elves, and dwarves in the book but it is not just a fantasy that just throws out shallow fantasy characters. Tolkien makes you understand the characters and makes you want to be a part of their lives. Even though they are creatures of fantasy you will begin to fel for them just like you would the characters of any great book.

You are also able to get to know the key characters and feel the dilemmas that they go through. One weakness that I felt was that it takes a lot of time and pages to get to each of the thrilling spots of the book. Also, at some points it can feel like the plot is slow moving.

Many people who have read Lord of the Rings expect The Hobbit, (because it deals with events that set up the plot and action of Lord of the Rings), to be written in the same style and to the same standards as Lord of the Rings. If so, those readers will be disappointed.The Hobbit is written for a younger audience. Simpler language, shallower characters, broader humor, less rigor. It is just fine as a tale for younger readers and listeners, and just fine as an introduction to Middle Earth for youngsters, but if you start your Tolkien reading with this work, you should understand how different it is from Lord of the Rings.Interestingly, if you have heard the audiobook version this point is driven home by the entirely different performance given by Dale from the one in which he reads Lord of the Rings. Dale's Lord of the Rings is gripping and dramatic. His reading of The Hobbit is light-hearted, almost casual in places, as though he felt the material only warranted a very broad interpretation.So, enjoy this pleasing and light-hearted tale, but then be ready to be captured by Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.Reading the first 10 words of J.

I knew immediately that Mr. Tolkien's hobbit hole would take me somewhere I had never been before, somewhere that would lead not to Alice's Wonderland but into the complete unknown.That's the appeal of much fantasy fiction like The Hobbit. That's the secret. It is the unknown that stimulates the imagination and keeps readers turning pages. Quite a feat, too, considering how even children's fantasy isn't known for brevity. J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is over 750 pages. Nevertheless readers of all ages press on with wide yet perhaps tired eyes for answers to the mysterious and often tantalizing questions presented by fantasy authors.What is a hobbit? Why does it live in a hole?Only by continuing to read will answers be discovered. And by reading, audiences are transformed into the explorers of faraway, strange places. They become Neil Armstrong, Sacajawea, Magellan, and Captain James Cook. New worlds await!In my youth, no work inspired me more than The Hobbit.

That is were I stumbled into \\"The Hobbit\\" on amizon.com. I first read this book in eighth grade for a book report. I am now eighteen years old. The first time I read this book was five years ago and I still can remember every bit of it. This book is very exciting and imaginative. There is a new adventure for Bilbo Baggins, one of the main characters, on every page. The one thing that you must have is an imagination. J.R.R. Tolkien gives us a very detailed description of the characters, surroundings, and events the characters encounter.I remember when I read this book, I felt like I was apart of the adventure.The description in the book gave me the ability to see how the characters looked like, so as I was reading it I felt like I was able to see the characters speaking to each other. Like the time when Bilbo finds the ring and runs into the Gollum. Tolkien's description of the Gollum and of what Bilbo was felling made me feel like I was Bilbo hiding from the Gollum. If you read the book, you will now what I am trying to say.Another grate thing about this book is that it is easy to read. The chapters are very interesting, and you will never get bored from it. This book is great for all ages, especially for the people that liked the Lord of the Ring. If you were still wondering how Frodo's family gets the ring, this book would clear all that up for you.In my opinion, this book is a classic and will always be one. This book shows great descriptions, and keeps you wanting more. The Hobbit is filled with mystery and adventure. You will not be able to put the book down.

And what's worse, your friend Gandalf the Grey has helped them. That's exactly what happened to Bilbo Baggins in the book, The Hobbit.The plot of the story is amazing. It follows a story line that is so imaginary, it almost isn't imaginable. The main hobbit in this story is Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo is whisked away on a dangerous journey with 13 dwarves, determined with the task of recapturing the grand dwarf city. Thorin, the greatly respected dwarf king, is determined to be the King Under the Mountain, as his grandfather and great-grandfather once were. Smog the Dragon has captured the ancient dwarf city and has destroyed the once prosperous city of Dale, the mortal man's city. Thorin and Co.(Bilbo and the 13 dwarves) are determined to kill Smog (well, at least the dwarves are. Bilbo thinks this is all a wild goose chase!) and recover the lost treasures. But before they get to the mountain to destroy Smog and recover the lost treasure, they must get there. On the long way there, they drag themselves into mortal danger many times. Some of these dangers are hungry trolls, giant spiders, and an entire underground kingdom of goblins. There are many more, but it would take a full page to name them.This book was extremely good, especially if you like books with a lot of suspense in them. Tolkien uses intricate detail and vivid words. I could just imagine every part in the book as if I was there.Bilbo is a touching character that we all can relate to. Poor old Bilbo just wants to be left alone and wants to have everything just so expected and predictable. But on the other hand, he loves adventures (sometimes) and he loves suprises. But he alsc just wants a good pipe to smoke, a comfortable hobbit hole, and some good company. And surely we can all relate to that!!I recommend this book to children and adults of all ages. Some parts of the book are a little intense, such as when the Wargs try to eat the 14 travelers plus Gandalf in one part. Otherwise, this is a touching, loving, humorous book. Although, you might not like the book so much if you don't enjoy action/adventure books.In conclusion, this book is wonderful. I really loved it.

I would recommend it for readers over thirteen that are in to adventurous books. Readers might find it particularly interesting because the story The Hobbit precedes The Lord of the Rings. The book gives readers a little bit of back ground to the three Lord of the Rings movies.The story is about a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. One morning in his Hobbit hole he awoke to a loud banging on his round wooden door. In came a wizard and twelve dwarves for what Bilbo thought was breakfast. He was surprised to find that they were planning to take him along with them on a journey to reclaim their lost gold from a dragon in the depths of a distant mountain. The journey to the mountain makes for an interesting story. They encountered goblins, great wolves, eagles, wood elves, and of course the dragon. They have very high times and low times along the journey, coming to near death on several occasions. As I read this book I almost felt sorry for all the little things that Bilbo was dragged into. By the end Bilbo becomes the hero, which was pleasing to compare his hero status to how he started the journey.JRR Tolkien uses his knowledge of the rural environment and his imagination to create an enticing piece of writing. Tolkien uses foreshadowing countless times to make the reader find the book irresistible. He has an interesting way of talking to the reader about the story by using \\"you\\". It is almost as if he is telling his tail directly to the reader.I thought this book was very entertaining and well written. I recommend it to anyone looking for a good piece of literature.

If you are a fan of Tolkien, this is the edition of The Hobbit to buy."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Who would have known that J.R.R. Tolkien's dark, war-ravaged epic fantasy Lord of the Rings would have sprung from such an innocent, light-hearted adventure?When a peace-loving Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins has his humble home visited by the legendary wizard Gandalf the Grey and an entourage of 13 dwarves, Bilbo finds himself embarking on a quest that will take him all across the great lands of Middle Earth, meeting a host of characters and creatures both friendly and not, and stumbling across great treasures and wild predicaments.I truly feel sorry for anyone who would dismiss the Hobbit as a \\"children's book.\\" While it may have been intended that way, it hardly reads as so. The Hobbit is intelligent, gripping, sophisticated and wondrous. I found that I always had a smile on my face for the greater portion of the book. Tolkien's vivid and often times comedic approach to Bilbo's situations help convey an intriguing and entertaining story that can be enjoyed by anyone.The characters, for the most part, are very well developed. The main characters (Bilbo, Thorin, Gandalf) get the most attention, but Tolkien balances the 12 remaning Dwarves and other side characters quite well. Bilbo's encounter with Gollum is chilling and memorable, and the finding of the Ring seems so very insignificant in the grand scheme of things...yet who would've known that such an innocent discovery would have led to the tragic, dark and terribly evil events to follow in Tolkien's legendary Lord of the Rings?This book should definitely keep you enthralled and reading to the very end. Like I said earlier, though this may have been intended to be a children's book, it hardly reads like one at all. I don't ever remember reading any books way back when I was a kid that were this epic, descriptive or intelligent. All you need is an open mind with a little twinge of fantasy, and you'll definitely enjoy the Hobbit. You can't read the Lord of the Rings without reading the Hobbit out of principle. I don't know why I waited so long to read this book, but now that I have, I am very glad that I did. It's probably one of the best books i've ever read. I very highly recommend it to anyone remotely interested in fantasy. Most of the fantasy today is inspired by The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings.This Leatherette Collector's Edition of the book sports some illustrations inserted into key areas of the book,gold embossment on the cover of elvish 'moonletters' and runes, as well as a leather sheath for the book. Definitely worthwhile for any Tolkien fan! On a side note, if you REALLY want to add dimension and life to the characters, I suggest watching The Fellowship of the Ring and The The Towers either before or just after you read this book...Gandalf and Bilbo and company just have so much more personality afterwards!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Tolkien's deceptively simple story of the well to do hobbit named Bilbo Baggins who has adventure thrust upon him is a land mark book in the fantasy genre. Just about Every fantasy novel written since owes a debt in one form or another to Tolkien. I think part of the reason why Tolkien's work resonates strongly with so many people lies in Tolkien's reoccurring theme of the ordinary person thrust into extraordinary circumstances. Bilbo, like all of the Hobbits in Tolkien's Ring Trilogy, is at heart a simple fellow who shows great courage in the face of terrifying odds. Tolkien, a Medievalist and professor of Linguistics at Oxford University, took his vast knowledge of language and ancient myths and used them to create a world unlike anything we've ever seen before. Frank Herbert's Dune trilogy is the only series I can think of which has come close. The Hobbit has it all. Vast armies, an underdog hero, dragons, wizards, lost treasure, giant spiders, and magic rings. The Hobbit is my absolute all time favorite story.Preston McClear, MalibuBooks.com"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This book called &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, is about a little ordinary Hobbit called Bilbo Baggins, who had an unexpected adventure. This adventure was filled with lost treasure, magical dwarves, mystical elves and fearsome dragons. Here, is Professor Tolkiens first book that takes place in Middle-Earth. Just the fact that such a small and &quot;un-adventurous&quot; little person like Mr.Baggins going on an adventure made this book a great page-turner. But with the addition of magical creatures, fierce warriors and Smaug the Dragon, I believe that this book should be recognized in the &quot;Authors hall of Fame&quot;.The detail in this book was magnificent, letting you picture the lush environment of Rivendell, the harsh, cold Mountain range of the Misty Mountains and the dark forest of Mirkwood, with its hidden eyes of darkness and spiders the size of elephants. The characters had complex personalities, family tree descriptions, and their appearances were, in my opinion, described perfectly.Smaug, the dragon who guarded the dwarves' treasure, was quite a funny character. Not comically funny, but in the way that he talks to burglars, and the nasty habit of exploding with fury, when so much as a single coin is missing from his stockpile of gold. All in all, this book was a work of literary art, and descriptive genius. On a scale of one to ten, I would give it a ten and a half, and I believe it is suitable for all ages.

Denny's blog. I wanted to publicly thank him for such a wonderful prize which, of course inspired me to re-read the novel.The Hobbit is a tale that I will always hold near and dear to my heart. My father first read it to me when I was around five years old and I have had a love of fantasy in my heart from that point forward. The time that we spent together journeying with Bilbo and Company in their quest to the Lonely Mountain is one of my treasured childhood memories and I cannot talk or think about Tolkien without bringing up fond images of my Dad.Luckily, the story also holds to the test of time. It is a fast-paced, sometimes humorous, adventure story with an almost continual stream of action. The poor party seems to go from one peril to the next to the next in such rapid succession that it is truly one of those books that is almost impossible to put down for any significant span of time. The characters, especially dear old Bilbo, are lovingly crafted and presented to the reader in such a way that they become stamped into the memory for all time.Truly one of the greatest stories of all time and forever one of my favorite books.

It was fifth grade when I was first introduced to the Hobbit by my teacher who read the book to us in class. I was fascinated by the story and have read the story on my own at least five times as well as the subsequent trilogy. The Hobbit accomplishes something few books can. It draws into an entirely different world, full of advenure, magic,and wonder. The characters are so believable and authentic that we treat them as if they really exist and we are just reading accounts of there deeds as if the book were a newspaper. This world is also an improvement on our own in that this world has clear cut heroes and villains and the issues it addresses are not muddled, but are presented in black and white.

I was suprised at how well the story was rounded, even though it had been translated into a cartoon. I had no idea, however, that the real magic of the story is told in the pages of Tolkien's masterpiece. When it was first published in 1937, the publisher and Tolkien had no idea that it would blossom and grow as it has (few authors think that their books will do as well as Tolkien's, and can only hope for the high mark which Mr. Tolkien has achieved.) Now, 62 years later, we find that it is perhaps THE most beloved book of the century.The well rounded plot and interesting, dynamic characters make &quot;The Hobbit&quot; the finist book in it's genre. Many other authors have tried to emulate Tolkien's masterful performance, but have all fallen utterly short of the high mark which Tolkien sites at. In my book, J.R.R.

I'm not sure whether the effect stemmed from the great quality of the book or from my particular developmental stage when I read it. Probably a bit of both. It's really just the simple story of a bourgeosis everyman who is thrown into a world of dragons, goblins, wizards, and dwarves and is forced to discover the greatness within himself. The plot arch might be that of Beowulf, substituting a typical well-to-do Englishman for the mighty thewed hero of the legend. The splendor is in Tolkien's wizardly story-telling and poetic vision. The story is worked to a minute perfection on every single page, every single sentence, even. Each chapter is punctuated with songs, or poems, making the Hobbit a true prose romance, in the tradition of the earlier great fantasists, such as William Morris, Lewis Carrol, Kipling, or ER Eddison. And every song is good.The Hobbit evokes a sense of nostalgia in this particular reader, a nostalgia for a lost pre modern world of primordial Northern England and Europe. As CS Lewis wrote somewhere, no other writer is able to capture the feel of Norse mythology, its symbols and moods, and weave them into a story the way Tolkien does. Tolkien employs his own private mythology, later published as the Silmarillion, to give the setting a sense of historical depth. For example, at one point the heroes find swords \\"forged duing the goblin wars of Gondolin,\\" foreshadowing a subsequent encounter with goblins. Each encounter brims with invention and unique imagination seldom found in any other author, but at the same time invoking an homage to the other great heroic stories of the world. The eyrie of the giant eagles recalls the story of Sinbad in the rocs' nest. The riddle game with Golum, one of the most inventive scenes in any story, reminds one of the Sphinx from Greek mythology. And each riddle is brilliant.All Tolkien's works are incomparable, but the Hobbit is his greatest, I think, mainly for its simplicity. It lacks the Manichean overblownness of the Lord of the Rings or the Silmarillion. Here is not a cataclysmic war between absolute good and absolute evil, but a simple quest to get some loot from a dragon. The story is thusly more like real life, and closer to primeval mythologies of Europe in that there is no Zoroastrian conception of good and evil.The Hobbit has some real life relevance too, I suspect. I think there is a message in the Hobbit, about a cataclysmic world event, but to recognize it requires one to have an encompassing understanding of twentieth century history, a familiarity with Tolkien's own life (i.e. a sense of when the book was written), and penetrating awareness of the tropes of the fantasy genre. The story sort of picks up the thread started in the Worm Ouroboros, as pertaining to the allegory behind Gro and the ambassador. I've always wondered if any one else can answer the riddle of the Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This really is a coffee table treasure. For reading convenience get a lightweight paperback, but for incredible, lush, artwork meshed perfectly with the text look no further."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I'm fairly picky when it comes to books. I love action, twists, turns and plenty of suspense. Unfortunately, I was only given half of my portion of expectations. First, I must admit that I really enjoyed reading this book, and it had a few unexpected twists. It was a remarkable story that frequently changed my opinions about the characters. But a fair warning to those of you who are determining whether or not to read this book; the beginning is extremely slow, due to its descriptive nature. Personally, I like having full description in suspenseful areas of text, rather than full description consistently. The rest of the book is occasionally slow, yet when compared to the beginning, the rest of the book is full of nothing but excitement. It seems that Tolkien rambles off on something unimportant once in awhile, which was most likely his only downfall. Although the beginning was slow, and he tends to get off subject once in awhile (which is not always a bad thing), this book is extremely creative. Who would have ever thought of such things as hobbits that live in hills that eat 6 meals a day? His descriptive settings really helped me feel as if I were in Mirkwood, or gazing upon the dreary Lonely Mountain. The story overall was incredible, and I especially love the poetry and songs. \\"Alive without breathe, As cold as death; Never thirsty, ever drinking, All in mail never clinking\\". Gollum was the most interesting of characters in my own opinion. Living most of his days alone in darkness with nothing to talk to but himself and his \\"precious\\". On the other hand, Smaug's personality did cause me to laugh several times. Tolkien brought each character to life, and really portrayed the contrast in each of their personalities. His ideas were imaginative, funny and sometimes suspenseful. His style of writing makes the book more humorous and interesting to read, plus his fantastic description of objects left a perfect picture. Although this perfect picture remains, the overall reading was for me, fairly easy. It is often thought of as a child's tale (although it is definitely not written as one), but it seemed to be so much more than that. It is definitely a book worth reading, and has plenty of description. So don't get upset when the beginning starts off a bit slow, for trolls, goblins, wargs, elves, spiders and a large dragon are awaiting you!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Although a fan of LoTR, it was only movies I had ever seen.

After reading \\"The Hobbit\\" I might have to read \\"Lord of the Rings\\" in its entirety to see the differences between Tolkien's work and the Peter Jackson films (I'm sure both Tolkien's and Jackson's work are masterpieces of literature/film).While reading \\"The Hobbit\\" I could see/hear in my mind the faces/voices of Ian McKellan, Hugo Weaving, Ian Holm and Andy Serkis (who played Gandalf, Elrond, Bilbo, and Gollum, respectively, in the films). I heard these actors had agreed to reprice their roles from Lord of the Rings one more time for \\"The Hobbit\\" (not sure about Ian Holm). It's too bad about the rights to a \\"Hobbit\\" movie remaining in legal limbo, but Tolkien's work is a literary masterpiece and I'm so happy I finally read it."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"If you love adventure or just a fantastic story I highly recomend that you read this book.

Later that day I started reading it in class, and found it extremely interesting.I liked the way J.R.R. Tolkien writes. He doesn't just simply tell the tale, he describes it and makes you feel like you are part of it. I felt like Bilbo Baggins from the beginning to the end, and even pretended I was there, solving the riddle(which I did try to do), talking to the dragon, and even climbing the mountains.I've often heard good reports and bad reports of this book. When I found it in the library, I thought what I thought every time I see a book I've heard of, &quot;Well, I'll give it a try.&quot; And through thinking that, I've probably read as many wonderful books as simply terrifying and horrid books. Through that also, I have found out what makes a book good, and what makes a book uninteresting to the reader...Since then, I've also noticed an improvement in my own books and novels. With every good author and good book I am encouraged more to write, since I suddenly pick up another technique of writing. Tolkien has taught me the most, and I never will forget that. All I hear is, &quot;Oh, I read that book when I was ten. It was okay.&quot; I am rather disappointed that was all they to say about a masterpiece of a book. I could encourage so greatly anyone to read and think about what they read here in this book, if they have read it yet. Above all the different types of books, I love fantasy the most. It gives me such an imagination, and also such a tale to think about or add to on boring days. My goal as a writer is to one day, become half as good as Tolkien is, for I think I could not become any better."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"A cheery hobbit named Bilbo is confronted by a wandering wizard and a truckload of dwarves, then suddenly finds himself trekking across the wilderness in a search for a dragon's treasure!

While The Hobbit obviously doesn't go as far in depth into the history of Middle-Earth as Lord of the Rings does, in many ways The Hobbit's simplicity is its charm. The book is quite simply the quintessential adventure tale. I love how the book begins quickly and follows with a series of short, ordered adventures. Tolkien handles the character of Bilbo brilliantly allowing him to become more adventurous, but also making sure that he doesn't lose his Hobbit roots. Best of all, Tolkien throws in a few twists that make the Hobbit far more interesting than most fantasy stories. The trouble doesn't end with the slaying of the dragon (for those few who haven't read the book yet, I won't spoil it). For readers wanting more than an adventure story, Tolkien also weaves a compelling commentary on the power of greed and the nature of adventures. No wonder this has become a classic. I can't wait for Peter Jackson's Hobbit movies to come out."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This book is great -a bit pricey but if you're a Tolkien Fan, worth it.

Apart from Sean Wadley's The Legend of Rudwin, I don't think I have ever read a book like this. It literally leaps from one magical scene to the other, like a deer flitting through a glade!The imagination in this one book cannot be equalled. To me it's a singular piece of work. Many refer to it loosely as a type of prelude... but no! It's far more than that. A classic to stand alongside the greats.The charming humour throughout the story is a reminiscent of forgotten times, and through the narrative you can read and see an old way of life - a forgotten way of story telling. And the author's love of nature blooms through the verses of every page. The characters are marvellous, and Bilbo - the hobbit in question - is without doubt the greatest of anti-heroes. He would rather spend all day eating and smoking pipe weed! Top man I say!Though I do read the new fantasy books that have followed in its wake, The Hobbit is still the very best as far as I am concerned. I'm just so glad the book is still loved and bought and reread multiple times.

The Hobbit is both a great story for younger children, as well as an interesting tale for adults. The characters are great, Bilbo and the Dwarves being just one example. The world is in-depth and very magical (well duh, it IS Tolkien after all). The story keeps you interested and having fun, and the book itself isn't even lacking in action. Now, don't hate me when I say this, but I actually think this book is better than the Lord of the Rings. That's not to say I don't think LotR is good, but I think this book is a lighter read, and more geared towards everyone.

It has everything a fantasy book should have - Trolls, Goblins, Elves, Wizard and of course the magic ring.I loved the book because it keeps you hooked from the first page and keeps the excitement right till the end. It's descriptive and a light read .All throughout history , we human beings have been fascinated of being Invisible - Invisible Man, Hollow Man, LOTR and of Course The Hobbit.

But it seemed appropriate to note that since I first read the Hobbit some 30 years ago and wanted to read it again, the purchasing options were surreal.My first version was just the mass market paperback, published during the seventies, it may have been a public library book, although I'm sure I owned it, or one like it later (after I read the Lord of the Rings series, I re-readThe Hobbit.) Having recently purchased LOTRO MMORPG software (Lord of the Rings Online Massively-Multi-Player Role Playing Game) because it's characterized as 'adult' friendly RPG, I've not yet selected a server to subscribe to (there are several stateside, as well as international locations.)I'm just as enthusiastic as everyone in J.R.R.'s fan club to see the up-coming release of The Hobbit at the theater. I can hardly wait to see how the screen writers deal with the crisis point of the Arkenstone. And, beautiful as New Zealand makes Middle Earth to appear on the silver screen, I even find traces of Africa and America in the novels.

A children's book that grew into so much more. Professor Tolkien's written words are the true magic that the movies can never truely portray.

Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\" is a classic of children's fantasy for good reason - it is fun, light-hearted, full of adventure, episodic in nature (so no need to follow a complex plot), and simply BEGS to be read out loud. All this combines for a perfect adventure tale.Those coming in fresh from \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" should be forewarned, the tone here is much lighter that the \`trilogy,' the writing very much meant for children (or to be read to children). It's a great read, but if you come in expecting more of what you got in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" you will be disappointed. Be prepared to read a children's book, because that's what this is.For those willing to plunge into children's fantasy, however, \\"The Hobbit\\" is simply a delight. Bilbo Baggins, something of a homebody, is the hobbit in question. He is pulled into an adventure with a wizard, Gandalf, and a troop of dwarves. Their quest is to venture across dangerous mountains and dark forests to reclaim treasure stolen by a terrible dragon, Smaug.What follows is a series of adventures that have our heroes meeting trolls, goblins, wolves, giant spiders, elves and more. Each encounter is an adventure unto itself, with a thrilling climax that leads us to the next. The adventure is nonstop. Each chapter brings a new discovery.Tolkien's writing is clear, straightforward and very \`English.' It is also written with an ear for reading aloud, breaking the \\"fourth wall\\" on occasion to speak directly to the reader. This book is meant to be read to children - and no wonder, since Tolkien wrote it specifically to read to his own kids.Fans of Middle Earth discovering the wonderful land through \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" will find things to enjoy here (if they are willing to sink into the lighter tone). We see our first glimpses of Gollum and the One Ring. Elrond, too, appears in Rivendell. We hear about some of Middle Earth's ancient lore, like Gondolin, see the origins of famous swords like Sting, and meet dwarves who play a part in \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" The cross references, while not vital, will bring a smile to your face and will enhance your enjoyment of the famous trilogy.For those looking to explore Tolkien's world, \\"The Hobbit\\" is a no brainer. Along with the classic trilogy and \\"The Silmarillion\\" (a difficult read for some), it makes up the three essential Middle Earth works.For those simply looking for a good children's fantasy in the same realm as C.S. Lewis' Narnia Chronicles or Lloyd Alexander's Prydain saga, you won't go wrong with \\"The Hobbit.\\" This is fun stuff that even adults will enjoy."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"If you like fantasy books, the Hobbit is a must read. This book inspired me to read all three Lord of the Rings books that are also amazing. It is one of my favorite books of all time. Despite what people say, the book is not boring at all. The begining can be a little slow, but once you get into it there is no putting it down."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien Published by Houghton Mifflin CoBilbo stooped down to pick up the shiny object. It was a ring. He slipped it on and... Want to hear more? This is one of my favorite books because it is fantasy and that is my favorite genre. There are wizards and battles and lots of cool things in it. It is a long book but it needs to be to have all of the right details which it does have.The main characters of the story are: Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf the Grey, all of the dwarves, Smaug and so many more that I could go on and on. First of all the character that the story focused on is Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo is a hobbit that lives in a hole in the side of a hill. Hobbits travel in bare feet and they are about 3 feet tall. He calls his home Bag End. Bilbo is a normal hobbit who doesn't like adventure and who eats 3 or 4 breakfasts. The only thing is that Bilbo finds a liking for adventure and that is how the book begins. Gandalf the Grey is a wizard who has taken a liking to Bilbo. Gandalf is a traveler who fights evil and befriends the good. Gandalf is the reason for the whole book because he starts the adventure. The dwarves are about the same size as the hobbits though they look nothing like them. Dwarves have beards and wear hats and are the greatest miners and blacksmiths. They are in the journey only to get something they own back from Smaug. Lastly as you know, there is Smaug. Smaug is a dragon that lives in a mountain. He is almost indestructible though he has one weakness that is revealed in the book. Smaug is also an important part of the book.I would recommend this book to anybody who likes fantasy, wizards, battles and old things like that. This is one of my favorite books because I like all of the old beliefs. I couldn't put this book down because it was so exciting. This book was put together so well that you were never lost and you could always find something good about any part of the book while you could almost never find something bad. I think that anybody with reading talents can easily read this book although some of the words are a little hard to pronounce so you might want a parent or an older person around to help you with them."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Have you ever thought of slaying a dragon? That is what Bilbo Baggins does in this book. Bilbo is an innocent hobbit who does not know anything about the wide world. Suddenly he finds himself in a great adventure to slay a dragon. Bilbo leaves the Shire and goes to the city of Dale. He goes though seven obstacles. On the way he finds a ring that makes him invisible. This story will lead into the series Lord of the Rings. J.R.R Tolkien makes a whole new world in your imagination. People ages 6 to 60 would love this book. This book is much like Brian Jacques. I think you should read this adventurous and magical book."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I loved this book. I have never been able to read a book very easily because I could never pay attention long enough, but this book really caught my attention the whole time.To begin with, a wizard visits the hobbit, whose name is Bilbo Baggins. The wizard puts a mark on the hobbit's door and then leaves. Later twelve dwarves visit the hobbit. They hire him as a burglar to help in their quest.He finally decides to go along, but highly against his own will. They start on the journey and have all sorts of strange happenings that occur. They encounter goblins and are taken into the depths of a very large underground network of tunnels. Here, Bilbo finds a ring that is quite magical. He does not know it yet, but the ring will prove to be a very vital part of their quest.After the goblins, they meet a man who is both Man and Bear. They manage to ask him for food and lodging for a while, though he does not like strangers. At night, Bilbo hears sounds of scratching and thumping, but does not dare to get up for fear of being eaten by Beorn, who is the Man/Bear. In addition, Beorn's animals have the ability to communicate with him and can do most anything that a regular man can.The Mirkwood Forest is quite peculiar in itself. The group of twelve dwarves and Bilbo must travel through a forest that is extremely dark. Although it is daytime, the forest is very dimly lit because all the trees form a canopy, which blocks all the light. Near the end of the forest, they become lost. They are forced to battle huge spiders and are eventually captured Wood-elves.Bilbo slips on his ring in time and is able to follow the elves as they take the dwarves to the cavernous hideout. Each dwarf is questioned to try to find out why he is traveling through the Mirkwood Forest. None will give the answer that the Elf King is looking for, so he throws them all in prison.While the dwarves are in prison, being quite well fed, Bilbo figures out a means of escape for all of the dwarves and himself. He also has time to learn quite a lot about the inside of the elf cavern. Bilbo gets the chance when a guard and another man go and taste the new wine that has been brought. Both become drunk and fall asleep. Bilbo is able to get all the dwarves out and himself.After this, they are not far from the dragon's lair. Smaug has taken all of the dwarve's treasure in gold and jewels and is in a cave on the Lonely Mountain. The quest of the small company is to reclaim the treasure that is rightfully the dwarves'. Bilbo faces Smaug and...I cannot tell you what happens, that would ruin it. They also face a war, but you will have to read to find out.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The characters were very well developed and easy to remember. I usually lose track of who is who in a book, but this book was easy to keep track of the characters. The book is actually quite believable if the reader looks past the fact that the characters are dwarves and a hobbit. I was quite lost throughout the book wondering what the characters were actually feeling. I felt this was a very believable story.I have never been able to sit down and read a book as easily as I did this one. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants a good book. It keeps the reader on the edge of his or her seat and has action in almost every page that is read. I recommend this book to anyone, no matter who he or she is. This book is deserving of five stars."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Well, I think this is a good book for ages 11 and above.

As I read the book, I actually forgot where I was because it was so interesting. I loved the sarcastic vocablulary that J.R.R. Tolkein used throughout the book. This is an excellent book for middle grade students to read. It gives them the chance to step out of reality and broadens their imagination."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit was a wonderful fantasy book that portrayed the new ideas of modernism throughout the turn of the century.

The Hobbit was an interesting book and I enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I just read The Hobbit for school. I liked it very much. Itis a wee bit childish, but I don't think adults can't appreciate it,too. Besides, it was based on bedtime stories Tolkien told his children, so why shouldn't it be childish? I skimmed over a lot of the descriptive passages at times because I was more interested in just getting it done (That isn't the book's fault, it's just that I wanted to get it done). But what I did read was very descriptive. The adventures were pretty exciting and the story was pretty engrossing. Interesting characters and lively plot, as well. I would like to read the Lord of the Rings books; no doubt they're just as good."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I really liked that book, it was fun reading, not to difficult from the language yet still binding! - the only reason it got only 4 stars is that 5 stars should be reserved for The Lord of the Rings! One thing I don't like about this book (as well as about the LOTR) is that there are so many different prints - having pictures in them from different artist rather than those painted from Tolkien himself."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I fell in love with this wonderful children's book at the age of 8. It was so simple and fun, yet in its own way so magical and incredibly entertaining (seven for an eight year old). Tolkien seemed to be, as a front, writing a children's book.Coming back, though, I read it again and on a completely different level. Yes, it was still entertaining, fun. But not once, NOT ONCE, upon the reread did I think of it as a children's book. It was still light and cheerful, but now a stark parable was presented in every character; a viscious greed that made two enemies (Thorin and Smaug) more similiar than they ever would realize; Gollum, who condemned himself by his own idiocy and corruptness; and, most of all, Bilbo, who secretly longed for adventure, though he himself didn't know it.In the style of Hemingway and Steinbeck, Tolkien uses simple words to create an elegant writing style and a complicated tale. In his sequels, The Lord of the Rings, however, he loses his simple eloquence and falls into the same pit Dumas fell years before him. Don't read the Lord of the Rings, whatever you do.And here's to all of you who dislike this enchanting, warm-hearted tale: maybe you still can't realize its warmness and brightness that brings alive a piece of childhood in all of us, or maybe, you are to disgrateful to fully appreciate the beauty of the magical Middle Earth, and the charm of Bilbo, THE HOBBIT."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings are my favorite books of all time. You are missing something if you don't love these books. They are charming, quaint, sad, funny and FANTASTIC! I can't even come close to describing how wonderful they are. I first read them when I was in high school in the 70's and have re-read them countless times since. They are awe-inspiring!I deeply regret that Tolkien passed away before I ever got a chance to meet him. I would have done just about anything to talk to the man who wrote these stories...he was a genius! He wrote his own language! He was fabulous!There is also a book that was published of letters he wrote and illustrated for his children from Santa Claus...he would send THEM letters from the North Pole every year. Can you imagine being a child and RECEIVING letters from Santa Claus? What a cool dad!Tolkien changed my life and my way of thinking with his books and I pity anyone who has never entered Middle Earth. I've never read anything that comes close to these books.

I'd give \\"The Hobbit\\" 100 stars if possible. I've wished to go back home just like Bilbo many times. I could also relate to many fantasy books I've read.

I have read many, many books since then - some great - some good - some just ok... but I can easily say that none of them have I read more times - nor loved better than this one. Bilbo's story is the classic fantasy yarn. The quest, the surprising courage and wisdom that comes in most unexpected packages - the sheer magic of it all - makes it a pleasure to read every single time. As the movie(s) are getting ready to come - and a wider world and audience will see Bilbo and Company's great adventure - I hope there are still some 7th graders (or younger and older) out there who will pick up the book for the 1st time and watch Middle Earth unfold on the movie screen of the mind! For my money it's still the best one out there."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Picked this up on a whim at Wal-Mart. I'd never read any Tolkien before this. I'd seen the first Lord of the Rings movie and some of the second, and liked them, but I wasn't exactly wowed. I guess my main aversion to Tolkien has always been the same as my main aversion to almost all sci-fi and fantasy literature and film in existence: that, aside from humans, all races are either 100% good or 100% evil. Example, hobbits are 100% good whereas goblins are 100% evil. This just annoys me and turns me off from a lot of \\"high fantasy\\" and lots of sci-fi as well.Anyway, as for The Hobbit itself as a novel, I have to say, I was both underwhelmed and impressed at the same time. Having finished it, I was left with two distinct, seemingly incompatible impressions. Firstly, I didn't get how it had become regarded as such a great literary classic. It was good, I reasoned, but not great. Just a basic adventure story. And a little repetitive in its descriptions sometimes, and overall just chock with too many characters when, besides Bilbo, Gandalf and Thorin, they're all essentially just fodder, all basically the same guy with identical personalities (except for Bombur), with the only differences being their names.The adventure itself was also very episodic. Which is fine I guess, but it left me wondering whether Tolkien was just killing time to fill out the book before getting to Smaug. And the ending was somewhat anti-climactic after all of the buildup.There's also the distasteful revelation of what Beorn did with the goblin and warg he caught (killing prisoners makes him better than the evil goblins how?).Now, you might be wondering, why did I rate it so high if I have so complaints about it? Well, my friends, just because something isn't perfect doesn't mean I didn't thoroughly enjoy myself while reading it. As I said, I don't get how or why this became such a literary classic, but, for what it is, a fun adventure story, it's pretty great. It's funny and has a lot of tongue-in-cheek moments. Tolkien does comical stuff quite well, in a very deadpan way. The character of Bilbo was also very endearing and easy to identify with, and I liked how clever he was in figuring out problems using cunning and intelligence instead of fighting skills or strength.And, randomly, I liked the explanation given for Gollum's name, \\"Gollum\\" being the closest verbal approximation to a particular compulsive swallowing noise he makes. Very gross and creepy.All in all, despite my complaints above, I did really like this book, so much so that I got a second copy as a \\"backup\\" in case something befalls my first. I even sought out and enjoyed the animated Rankin-Bass film (I actually liked its Gollum better than Andy Serkis') and am looking forward to the new movie version of it coming out soon too.So, good book, loved it, please don't hate me for finding faults with it 'cause I did honestly enjoy it. :)"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Last year NPR published a list of books which were chosen by their listeners and a special committee that are considered the best 100 Science Fiction and Fantasy books ever written. I am not sure if I agree with the selections made here but nevertheless one of my current reading projects is to read through the list. There are many old friends of this list; books that have become a part of my life over the years and have gone through multiple readings by myself indeed, but this reading project I am now on requires me to give them all a reread...I cannot wait!Anyway, the first on the list, as printed, is Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit is not on this list. It is my personal feelings that LOTR cannot be appreciated or fully understood without having first read The Hobbit - ergo I have taken it upon myself to start with The Hobbit and proceed from there. First though let me do some house keeping.Amazon, in all of its wisdom, had thrown the reviews of ever edition of The Hobbit all into one bag. There have been quite a number of editions of this book since the first which was in 1937 with the first American edition being in 1938. I note from reading the reviews here that there is mass confusion, and indeed a lot of disappointment over ordering this book. The only thing I can tell you is to do your research and MAKE SURE you order the edition you want. Many of the sellers here do not know one from the other. This review is on the book, not on the edition. I first read this work in 1961 from a very ragged old paperback I found in a junk shop in Istanbul, Turkey. I think it was the Puffin edition, but cannot be sure. Since that time I have collected quite a number of these books - all different, but with very minor \\"errors\\" all the same story. (We silly Americans changed \\"Dwarves\\" to Dwarfs\\" because we felt Tolkien had made an error in spelling...Tolkien was NOT happy!) If a person is interested in such things, I personally would suggest an edition which includes Tolkien's original illustrations. That is of course just my personal preference.Anyway.....Before Lord of the Rings there was the Hobbit. I am most certainly not going into a plot summary here as all that has been well covered in the 2,000 plus reviews already posted. There are some important points I feel that need to be pointed out.First is the fact that to consider The Hobbit as a simple children's story would be a big mistake. Yes, older children will, do and can enjoy it, but like LOTRs, The Hobbit is still and all an adult book despite what others might tell you. This book needs to be read very carefully and savored.Second, the reader should note that when Tolkien transitions to LOTRs his style does change somewhat and the overall tone of the story darkens. It is noted that the story of how the \\"Ring\\" came into the hands of the Hobbits (Bilbo), is told. It should also be noted that the caste of characters changes from The Hobbit to LOTRs. Gandalf the Grey is present as is Bilbo and Elrod along with a couple of the Dwarves. For the most part though, the old characters found in The Hobbit are left there as the story moves on with the next three volumes.Third, the reading level is lower in The Hobbit than in LOTRs. This is important. I have found, over the years, than many young people an handle The Hobbit quite well, but when they then go to LOTRs, they find themselves in a bit over their heads and loose interest quite quickly...not all kids, mind you, but enough to be significant.Forth, Tolkien has used more of a fairy-tale mode in writing The Hobbit than he did in LOTRs. This throws some folks off when they transition from the first to the later.I have thoroughly enjoyed this read over the years. I as sorry to find that NPR had not included it on their \\"official\\" list along with LOTRs...but then I suppose that everyone that will conceivably read the list will have some disagreement...that seems to be the nature of lists.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This book is magnificent.

I read it in one night and loved the childhood memories it invoked. I also forgot how much the Hobbits like to eat, a funny little quirk that makes these characters even more loveable. I got much more from it now and can not wait to see the movie. Reading the book gave me an idea on how Peter Jackson is going to present the story in two parts. I ordered the LOTR blu-ray's and an going to read the book again before I watch them. The book I got was not the book I ordered though. I ordered the green version where the pages looked molded but got a golden 50th anniversary edition. I believe the one I got costs a little more then the one I ordered and I paid the lower price but I would have rather have had what I ordered.Update: 07/31/12 at 03:35. I just read on Variety's web site that Peter Jackson will be releasing 3 films for the Hobbit. He is going to pull from the Silmarillion & other Tolkien works as well as embellish on the gaps in the book The Hobbit. He is going to address the rise of the Necromancer aka Sauron and go into more detail on Bilbo, Gandalf, Galadriel along with Legolas Greenleaf. If you do not own this book buy it now, the prices will only increase as the DEC 14th 2012 release date for the movie draws near. I hope you will cherish this masterpiece as much as I do.

It is one of the best fantasies ever written."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbitt elegantly presents an entertaining fantasy quest story in which the main character, a hobbitt named Bilbo Baggins, is an antihero (or, at least, a reluctant hero). The story describes a beautiful world in which live all manner of fantastic beings - dwarves, elves, hobbits, goblins, trolls, men, and a dragon named Smaug. These various somewhat disimilar beings live in such proximity that, if they only move around a small bit, they will affect each other in significant ways. That is what I like about the story. Mr. Tolkien succinctly describes and compares and contrasts these different beings as the story goes along in a way that, I think, provides a metaphor for relationships among different cultures in the real world in which we live. He shows that some differences are tolerable and, even, desirable and advantageous; that some differences are insurmountable; and, that this is just the nature of the world that must be handled, sometimes carefully.Some may not agree with me when I say that Mr. Tolkien's descriptions are succinct. This leads to what I dislike about the book. I wish for even MORE elaboration. I wish the descriptions had been as full and elegant and as wide in scope as I know Mr. Tolkien could have made them - as in The Silmarillion (in my opinion, the real Tolkien masterpiece). Of course, I know this would have dramatically changed the realized audience and that may not have followed Mr. Tolkien's intentions. This is just a personal wish of mine.This is a wonderful story for readers of all ages (8+ ?); however, I would not rank it as one of the greatest stories of all time as many other Tolkien fans seem to do.The story contains some wonderful lessons for younger (and, I'm sure, some older) readers about self-reliance in the face of adversity and fear; commitment to one's values and relationships, especially when that is difficult; and, realizing that sometimes one must (even reluctantly) do things one would not have normally chosen to do in order to lead a life worth living."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I am currently rereading this book for maybe the sixth or seventh time. If you don't like this book you haven't an imagination nor a soul."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This is modeled on Beowulf, but yet anti-Beowulf, in that the fierce dragon is stalked not by the toughest guy around who prefers fighting hand-to-hand, but by a rag tag collection of dwarves blundering around the countryside, at times the opposite of intentionality.The lair, the hoard, the smoke--but games of wit and tricks of evasion, culminating in some other guy shooting down the dragon based on inside information mediated by a bird.Another opposite trend of this is the way the characters strengthen and develop, whereas in Beowulf, the hero ages and deteriorates. These dwarves, by contrast, are already old, but become more adventuresome, and more bold.The skeleton of the story, though, is still Beowulf. But much improved by the inversions. Another refreshing twist on the old story is the way both Gandalf and Baggins both hold their accomplishments lightly, Baggins preferring to go home to his pouch of tobacco and his pantry, and Galdalf vanishing somewhere undefined after closing off a conversation with Bilbo on the terminal point of how individuals acting on their own, yet have a part in fulfulling someone else's prophecy.All the while as I was reading through this, for the first time since grade school, I was reminded of what I guess I'll call &quot;Middle Led Zeppelin&quot; and the Song Remains the Same scenes with Robert Plant dramatizing the songs of quest and discovery, many words of which seem lifted from the same old English sounds reflected in Tolkein's work, particularly this text.So if Tolkein is updating Beowulf, were Robert Plant and Jimmy Page revising the Hobbit, or at least struggling to interpret it? Dwarves on a far cliff with dueling stratocasters? Elves down below churning and hopping around in curious pagan synchronicity? I'm thinking sure, why not?"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This book was great. Bilbo Baggins was a perfect character for this book.At first he seems like a coward at heart, then he becomes a fighter when he sees how much he is needed. The plot was interesting, Gandalf meets Bilbo, and so do dwarfes. Bilbo goes out and faces trolls,Gollum, and other funny things. If you would like to read a really good book, read this."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The hobbit is maybe the best way to enter the world of Fantasy, it is one of the first books of the genere, and everyone eho writes today a fantasy book - takes something from it.

Like the person who previously reviewed it my only regret is not reading it sooner! This is the thrilling and mystical story of a respectiful and sqeamish little hobbit named Bilbo Baggins of Bagshot row who is visited one day by an extrodinarly renowned wizard selling, er, adventures and eventually somewhat &quot; tricking &quot; Bilbo into accompaning thirteen easily likable dwarves in their quest to reclaim their lost gold. I won't tell any more, for that would ruin it but it is a wonderfull and whimsical story that sweeps you away from your troubles into the land og wargs and wizards and things as evil Goblins and as good as Elrond the occupant of the last homely house in the mysty mountains. I will probably read this book again one day because it is wonderfull. J.R.R Tolkien was one of the most original and creative writers ever with his brilliant poetry and songs and descriptions of far off places of fear and brilliance.

From start to end, the Hobbit never seases to amaze and delight. With a cast fo characters, ranging from Gandolf, a wizard to Smaug, a dragon, the reader is taken through the ups and downs of the adventure.I would have to say that my favorite part was where Gollum was challenging Bilbo, the hero of this book, to a game of riddles. Here is where the real story begins as Bilbo finds a ring, that Gollum refers to as his precious.This is the best written and thought of book of its kind. A must read for anyone. I give it four stars."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit is a true classic fantasy tale. It can spark the immagination of the young and the old. In this respect it is much like the Harry Potter series. I am 33 and I enjoyed Harry Potter as much as any fantasy tale. The Hobbit was groundbreaking in that it paved the way for generations of future science fiction writters. It was written in 1937 and to this day it sparks the immagination of the young and the old. It is a great book to introduce young minds to reading and it is a fun tale you can later enjoy as an adult. The Hobbit has passed the test of time. Not too many books written in the 1930's are still so loved as the Hobbit. It is a treat that should not be missed."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This book is certainty up there with my favorites.

J. R. R. Tolkien writes incredible fantasy, especially in his vision of Middle-Earth. Bilbo Baggins is a lovable character, and Smaug, the worm, is a worthy adversary of Bilbo. The whole story is injected with humour and wry observations during Bilbo's journey. All the characters are carefully wraught through Tolkien's imagery and language. I hope to get through &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; (I think that's the title), but unfortunately can't get into &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Oh well.

I decided to write my own review after skimming over a few of the ones already here. First off, I just want to say that if you don't enjoy reading fantasy-adventure books, you most likely won't enjoy this book; that is just a straight out simple fact. But those of you who do enjoy fantasy-adventure books will probably find this a refreshing and entertaining book. So it isn't exactly full of deep philosophy, and doesn't explain the meaning of life, but it did allow me to escape the horrible world I'm in now and take part in a fantastic adventure that I normally couldn't.... and isn't that the point of fictional books??"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit, which is the prelude to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, is an extremely entertaining book for something written so early in the twentieth century, and always gives the reader the impression of belonging to a larger world that is only hinted at in this first novel. Somewhat naive and innocent compared to the immense dark forces displayed in the rest of the trilogy, but if you plan on reading the other books, you absolutely must read The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I originally read The Hobbit in 7th Grade. It was the first full length book I ever read. Up until that point I had no real desire to read. I lost my virginity to The Hobbit and went from reading my first book in 2 days to reading a book a week for the rest of my life.The Hobbit is a great first book for anyone new to Fantasy. Although it is not sophisticated enough for some readers; it sets the stage for the true masterpiece of fantasy: The Lord of the Rings. You cannot read TLOTR without first reading The Hobbit. I would categorize The Hobbit almost as a children's book. Whereas The Lord of the Rings is definately for adults.Please take the time to read The Hobbit and then read TLOTR. You are in for a wonderful treat. Then do your kid's a favor, read The Hobbit to them at an early age. You will see their eyes light up with wonder and fascination.

An unexpected party shows up with lots of dwarves and a wizard named Gandalf. They go on a mission to find the evil dragon Smaug who has stolen treasure from thier ancestors. They are trying to win it back It is the first book of a series of 4. If you read this book you should read the other three called The Lord of The Rings trilogy. J.R.R.

Everything in here that seems cliche is because other people took it from Tolkien. Nevertheless, it is hard to get past how clumsy the writing can be, and how simple the plot is -- a challenge appears and is solved in a few pages, usually by luck. Fans of R.A. Salvatore or Terry Brooks or any more modern fantasy writer will probably be disappointed. There is action, but it is scant. Where this book really shines is in the description of an amazingly fleshed out world. And while the plot is simple and straightforward, it is certainly extensive.

It is a great story about bravery, suspense, and drama. In the story friends have to trust friends to be able to stay alive. The author ( J.R.R. Tolken ) makes you feel like you're in the story, and you can picture what's going on. The story is about a hobbit who lives peacefully in his little hobbit hole with no intention of ever leaving it. But one day a wizard and dwarfes appear at his door wanting him to go on a dangerous adventure with them. At first he says no to the idea, but once he finds out how much gold is in it, he just can't resist. He and the dwarfes face many dangers. What I learned from this book is that you need to be brave and that it doesn't hurt to try new things because you might like them.

This book relates that adventure.Though it explains various parts of the Lord of the Rings series (such as how Bilbo got the Ring), this is truly a tale independent of the well-known trilogy. Very little of the journey actually deals with the finding of the Ring, and the focus rests on Bilbo and his journey with Gandalf and a troop of dwarves.The story, as it is told, is of Bilbo's part in a quest to defeat the dragon Smaug and recover lost treasure and land of his dwarven companions'. The tale abounds in adventures, encounters with mystical creatures, hardships, and every other element for which Tolkien's stories are famous.This book was written for children (the reading being much easier than Tolkien's other works), but is a timeless classic which can doubtless be enjoyed by young and old alike."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Perhaps THE BEST little adventure story every written. Written for kids but certainly enjoyed by all. It has trolls, dragons, a kindly but strange wizard, dwarves, and of course Hobbits. It's really a story of bravery and strong friendships in the face of mishaps and evil things. What stands out in this book and The Lord of the Rings is that the world Tolkien creates sucks you in hopelessly. It only takes a few sentances and you really feel like you are along for the journey.Tolkien creates a world with a huge history full of peoples and monsters and dwarves, with nature playing a large role in all of his books. The history part is small in The Hobbit since its focused on the journey and characters. The Hobbit is meant to be a lead-in to The Lord of the Rings, which has much more history and nature and more characters than the Hobbit. 'Rings is a darker tale and much more serious. Its harder to read, much longer, and I think the best adventure story ever written.In response to Chris Fletcher, you have some valid criticisms of Tolkien. His writing style is a bit, well, sticky. When you think things should be moving faster and faster and the action is coming, you instead get \\"and then the big troll (or whatever) was killed. On to the next adventure.\\"However, the upside to this is you really feel like you are reading a kind of history book found in Middle Earth. I think Tolkien was a bit nuts and that's why his stuff was so good. He half-believed he really was writing and living in the world of his own making. He created entire languages, maps, unforgetable characters and mostly sad but gripping tales of adventure. Some people can't get through Tolkien's sticky prose when reading the lengthy The Lord of the Rings and I understand why, but stick with it! After reading the whole thing you will be glad you did. Remember no one can tell you how to read a book. If you come accross a paragraph about Bilbo's half-sister and all her family and the history of her cat, just skip it if you want. Tolkien really does go out on a limb sometimes escpecially with all the names and family trees and fictional history.However, this same strange Tolkien style allows for re-reading and getting much more information, and a sense of depth and life to Middle Earth that is truely amazing. I have read the series, both the Hobbit and LOTR twice and I got much more the second time through. I read it slower and tried to keep the characters and places in my head. You can buy a nice map book which lays out all of tolkiens worlds in detail including battles and paths that the characters follow. Its by Karen Wynn Fonstad and has a lot of detail. Careful though, some plot happenings are given away in the tracking of characters and the battle maps :DIf you really want to get background info you have to start with the Silmarillion. And that beast can drive you crazy. Parts of it are amazing to read however and it explains some of the history that was confusing in LOTR. Where did Galadriel come from? What or who exactly is Gandalf? What's a wizard? What are the counterparts to Sauron and other evil in middle earth? Surely there must be some good gods or angel like beings? So, Silmarillion: very difficult, for tolkein fans mostly. Its long, hundreds of names, not a continuous story. It does explain a great deal about the gods and formation of Middle Earth and many things and people and places that show up later in the Hobbit and LOTR.Hobbit: very easy fun read, not a whole lot of depth, short, great characters, great adventure.The Lord of the Rings: medium difficulty, lots of depth, some history, lots of names, some difficult and confusing paragraphs, but a truely great tale. The kind of book where you find yourself kinda stunned after reading the last sentance. (The movie is not bad, but messed things up a bit, read the book! Notice that Tolkien's name is not on the movie. The family took their name off it because of the Hollywood treatment.)"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit is the best book i have ever read!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Tolkein's now classic fairy tale of the land of Middle Earth and its inhabitants, the Hobbits, is an enchanting and mythical story of the underdog hero Bilbo. The so-called prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy is actually a splice or intersection of the Ring in which Bilbo discovers the ring in Golem's cave. The story of Bilbo and his adventures is classic lore of slaying the dragon to win the pot of gold. With his band of misfits and hungry tweedle-dee and tweedle-dum gnomes, there is a comic ambiance to the story that helps the reader through some of the slow scenes. While this is not a must read to understand the Ring Trilogy, it certainly is a worth while read unto itself without the burden of two more books to complete the journey. Tolkein's writing is fun and witty while asking the reader to understand a few new words in his created language. There are times as well that the story slows down either for narrative purposes where the writing speaks to you, the reader, or for the group to sing a song to celebrate their happiness in the style of medieval celtic literature. While the book is reccomended and in some cases manditory, it's an overall enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"It is very exciting to follow up to half of the book, but eventually becomes kind of boring.

You cant go wrong with this book."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit is a very exciting book. It has wierd and interesting creatures that were unique and not your average fairytale copy cats. It makes the reader feel as if he/she is traveling and starving and tired and scared along with the rest of the characters. I also like how the author describes the scenery so vividly. He paints a picure in your mind that of all the places bilbo and his company of dwarves visit.Gandalf the wizard is my favorite character. He always seems to know what's going on, even when he isn't around. He is smart and uses his cleveness and magic to help the group out of tough situations. Sometimes he tricks people in a harmless and friendly way. He makes friends with the alot of people through out the novel. He has human , dwarf, hobbit, elf and magical friends that can transform into animals.I liked the plot in this book alot. It kept my attention and made me want to keep reading until I found out what would happen next. The best part was when bilbo tricked Gollum in the Goblin caves. Even though the plot was complex it was not too hard to understand and was very interesting.This is an interseting book that will keep your attention until the end. It is fun and exciting and describes everything in great detail. It is so good that I can't wait to begin Tolkien's other books."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit, by J.R.R. Tolkien is truly a \\"precious\\" piece of the fantasy genre. As the book is about a group of dwarves, a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, and a wizard named Gandalf whom embark on a journey through the world of Middle Earth. Along the journey they will meet new and unthought-of characters that will make the story even better. For example, along the journey the group meets dangerous goblins and giant spiders. You will not want to put the book down, as the adventure never stops from the beginning of the journey in the Shire to the end of the journey in the mountains where the dragon Smaug lives. However, the book can get a bit slow at some points when you are just waiting for them to do something. As a reader though, this book will attract the eye of a young reader interested in fantasy or someone who has read the Lord of The Rings trilogy because The Hobbit is a prequel to that series and written by the same author. The book is overall a good and a well-written book."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I love the book \\"The Hobbit.\\"which I purchased from Amazon.

And considereing the other book was Gulliver's Travels (yuck) my fears were justified. But when I read this I was surprised to find a very entertaining tale filled with adventure, beautiful description, and colouful charecters. When Bilbo Baggins has a wizard come to his house for tea he never knew it would change his life. The next morning she gets 13 dwaves at his doorstep and soon he is setting out on an adverterous treasure hunt and wondering how he ever got roped into it. With each turn he takes he faces new challenges and forced to find a hidden bravery and confidence in his heart with a little magical help. But when he reaches the end of his journey, getting the treasure may be just as hard as the journey he had to take to get there.I found this book to be entertaining and thrilling. It's classical fantasy and now I see why everyone talks about it. So many people say this is &quot;almost as good as Harry Potter&quot; or &quot;even Better than Harry Potter&quot; but it's so differnt than the Potter books that it would be like comparing apples to oranges. But still if you like fantasy and adventures in strange lands, this book is for you. I think I'm also gonna read the three books that come after it, the famous Lord of the Rings Trilogy.

A wizard with words, JRR.

Gandalf the Wizard comes by asking if Bilbo was interested in a quest filled with intrigue and treasure. Being the respectable Hobbit he is, he declines and instead invites Gandalf to tea the next day.This is how the greatest fantasy book of all time starts. Not just a book for children, I myself am 14 currently, and have read this book 5 times. It is a tale that leads you through an exciting quest filled with adventure and mystery with the reward of insurmountable wealth at the end, if they complete the quest at all.If you are looking for a book that will keep you entwined for the rest of your life, pick up a copy of the Hobbit, or any of Tolkien's other books."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit was grappling!

It is filled with songs and poems that help the flow of the story. Don't expect sing alongs some of them are in a different language that isn't used by humans on earth. As you read the story you realize how much meaning the little hobbit really has. You also realize that there are so many things that happened before that particular story. Even when some people tell their own name you can tell that they are the sonn or daughter of an important person long ago. No one should miss out on such an amazing story."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I collect editions of Tolkien's work, and received this one from my wife for my birthday.

It's fascinating and it's a part of the British literature. You will also find that this book is not the same as the other book because J.J.R Toliken had made such careful and intensive on this book, he created one whole new world with language, culture, calenders, etc. I am sure that it will help you because it have given such great influence about different methaphors.

Bilbo Baggins sets out on an adventure with Gandalf the Grey and a band of homeless Dwarves, to the Lonely Mountains to retake the dwarves' home and confront Smaug (a dragon). Bilbo had to fight evil orcs, salvage wolves, giant spiders, and gollum. He found a ring that could make him invisible. When they got to the lonely Mountains Bilbo, Gandalf, and the dwarves could find the entrance to the Dwarves home. Then after days of camping out they Bilbo saw the little tiny keyhole of the door. Bilbo went in alone and he talked to Smaug. Bilbo ran out because Smaug was trying to chase him. Smaug came out of the shaft and the dwarves, Bilbo, and Gandalf went in, but the key was outside. They had to get out through the front entrance. After days of walking in the place they came to the front entrance. The people of Laketown saw a small flicker of light. It was Smaug. The people cut the bridges to the town. Bilbo told a bird to tell an archer at Laketown to shoot at Smaug's left breast because it was open. The archer shot his best arrow and it went through Smaug. That was the end of Smaug. The elves and men learned of Smaug's death. They came to the Lonely Mountains to take the treasure, but the Goblins came also. The elves, men, and dwarves allied to fight the Goblins. A stone that hit his head knocked out Bilbo. When Bilbo wakes up he finds out that they have won, but some of the dwarves were wounded. Thorin, the leader of the dwarves was wounded and later died. Bilbo returned to his home and told the other hobbits about his adventure.I recommend this book for others to read because it is an interesting, adventurous, and great book to read. A moral from the story is to never give up and face your enemies. It also teaches you courage. Once you start reading this book you will probably keep reading to the end.My favorite part of this book is when the Laketown people were fighting Smaug. That's my favorite part because it has a lot of action. It tells how fierce a dragon could be."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I received my copy of The Hobbit from my ex, Lee. He and I were in the process of running off together when I decided that maybe it wasn't that great of an idea.

It's The Hobbit! His own, personal, old, favorite, copy of his favorite book! Well, I have no idea where he is now and I'm not giving it back.I read it while we were dating, in 1999, and again when I heard about the movies. I wanted to brush up on my Tolkien so I could be an educated viewer. Yes, I'm one of those annoying people who sat in the theatre and cringed when you could see the Moon-letters on Bilbo's map in the background (Moon-letters should only be seen when held up to moonlight...they were on a mat board. But I digress.)Oh, how I love this book. I carried it with me everywhere. I read it while trying to drive. I sat on the grass and read it when I couldn't stand it anymore and just stopped where I stood. I brought it to restaurants and ignored the person I was with. It's engaging. It's beautiful. It is the quintisential story of good versus evil. It is incredibly satisfying. I fell in love with Bilbo, Gandalf, and the Dwarves. (Especially the fat, sleepy one...Bombur?) Any child of mine is getting this book when they are capable of reading it. I made Annie read it. I actually lent her MY copy...the one with Lee's inscription in the front.

It is filled with a multitude of characters; from short, plum hobbits, to gigantic, black spiders. There are adventures at every turn, and encounters with unexpected, and un-invited visitors. I enjoyed every venture in the book; from the songs of the dwarves, to the battle of five armies.One especially strong part of the book was how easy it is to read. The chapters are so interesting; it's not hard to follow the story at all. An example of a remarkable event is one minute Bilbo is fighting off huge, hairy spiders, and the next, he is sneaking into an Elf village ( page 157-172). The exciting events flow so well to one another, it was hard for me to put the book down. Another reason The Hobbit is so easy to read is the fascinating storyline and characters. The whole story revolves around a collection of bizarre characters; hobbits, dwarves, wizards, elves, and their adventure to find and slay a dragon. Their party is faced with many other terrifying villains before the dragon too. Like when they stumble upon the goblins' caves unexpectedly; they are brought to the Goblin King, who is huge, ugly, cruel and shows no mercy. Sections like that are definitely page turners. The flowing plots, storyline and characters are just a few of the many reasons to read The Hobbit, but there are many more too good to give away!I would definitely recommend this book to others, for many more than the basis I've acknowledged before. One big reason I recommend this book is that it isn't written to just one age group. Any age can enjoy following a mere hobbit Bilbo, outwit Gollum (page 80), or sneak up on a treacherous dragon's lair (page 211). A seven year old or a twenty seven year old can find pleasure in reading of courageous tales like that. And although anyone can enjoy The Hobbit, one thing that can help a great deal in reading this book, is good imagination. Imagination is needed in certain places, like when a character like Gollum is described, or when reading what the Misty Mountains look like in the sunset. So if you cant imagine or don't believe in what you're reading, it spoils the book. There are lots of mysterious, unbelievable events that take place in this book, that any-aged person with a good imagination can take pleasure in.In my opinion, this book is a classic, and of its own time. From short, bearded dwarves, to gigantic, jewel-covered dragons, the book shows great descriptions, and keeps you wanting more. The Hobbit is filled with mystery and adventure, and is a definite page turner. If anyone's looking for an enticing book that no on will want to put down, The Hobbit is the choice by far."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Unfortunately I never this book as a kid, or in school; but in a way I am glad that I didn't.

I did get to see 'Lord of the Rings' before reading it, but it only helped to enhance my imagination and awe of the world that Tolkien has created.

That's just what he did until a band of dwarves led by a wizard came with an interesting proposition-stay home safe and happy or help kill a dragon and face certain death? What will Bilbo do? Will he accept? Of all the mysterious and adverturous things in this book there is one drawback. There are so many characters that it gets confusing. But do read the book. To help, write down the characters and a few personality traits to help understand them more. This book is enjoyable for all ages, but is suggested for teens and adults. The plot is amazing and keeps the readers eyes glued to the pages. The story pulls you into it as if you were helping Bilbo and marching off to fight the dragon. The details are magnificent and the adventure is enough to make your heart throb.

For instance, in the first chapter when Bilbo had his visitors and it was time to wash the dishes instead of saying the dishes the author chose to name every single solitary dish(the plates,pots, pans, glasses, cups,etc.) I feel that he lost a lot of interest like that. In short this book could have been a very interesting 100 to 200 page book instead of a long drawn out 300 plus book (paperback)."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"No doubt The Hobbit is classic work of literature. Unfortunately, this dramatization (as with the related Lord of the Rings Dramatization) suffer from three problems:1. Recording Quality. This is a simple technical issue, but the audio mix is atrocious. Voice levels are unmodulated rendering many passages inaudible even with your volume set to 11. Much of the dialogue is muddy at best. Just hearing what is being said is extremely challenging.2. Dramatization, Not a Reading. This is not a book on tape, it is a re-written interpretation of the original. It relies almost exclusively on dialogue to tell the story. The original story is driven and paced by Tolkien's beautiful description of locations, thoughts, feeling and atmosphere, so cutting all that out is akin to selling a dramatization of the Mona Lisa under the verbal description of \\"a portrait of woman in the country\\" - it just utterly falls short.3. Gaps. Wow. They have simply edited out huge plot-line swaths of the story.

Lets just say that this book and I don't get along. Its well written and has a good plot. But its just the way the narrator and characters speak confused me whole time. It deserves stars for just being an ok book, but I would never read this of my own will."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Even with the understanding that 'The Hobbit' is a children's book (despite the views of those who want to lump everything Tolkien ever wrote into a single 'fantasy' category), 'The Hobbit's main problem is that it just isn't very exciting.There is certainly a lot of potential,but the story moves much too slowly, and seems twice as long as it actually is! There were some mildly entertaining scenes early on, but the endless descriptions of rather mundane activities(such as the dwarves' past, present, and future mealtime activities, and the various kitchen utensils they used)took up too much space! After a while, even the exciting parts of the journey began to blend together, and it all got very monotonous by the end.Even as children's literature, it's not very compelling. Maybe I'm just biased, since I'm not a big fan of this type of fantasy literature, and prefer having at least one 'Earth human' character along. Tolkien's rambling sentences, bad dwarf poetry, and the general 'smugness' of his narration (which seems to change from being a typical unseen, omniscient storyteller, to Tolkien himself making asides to his children)make 'The Hobbit' a chore to read. Where many people got sucked into the story, I just felt disconnected and boredIn fact, I didn't quite finish the book, skimming quite a bit of the middle, and not quite making it all the way through the last two chapters.I tried reading 'The Silmarillion' first, and found it too dense, then found this one to be a very simple story which the author made far too complicated because he didn't know when to embellish and when to keep it simple. I still plan on reading 'LOTR' someday, but for now, I need a break from talkin' about Tolkien!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I love this book. Okay, so when I first read it at age seven i freaked, but i still love it. It's a nice little fantasy book, with a nice tidy ending that still does leave some strings hanging loose (the Ring being the most important). It's pretty simple (the plot, that is), and the adventures involved are fun to read, although the narration style occaisionally encroaches on this. It does contain fairy-tale-like characters and elements -- the dragon, the treasure, the elves (though they are not the typical fairytale elves), wizards, dwarves (who are also not-so-typical) -- but is half the adventure-quest sort of book. It's not the serious quest tale that The Lord of the Rings is, but it's certainly a necessary part of the story. Light, quick, and adventurous. A great book."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"It is just great! If you're a fantasy reader you just need to read this book.

You'll read about a whole new world and there are such lovely characters!!!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"A friend of mine had told me about the coming of the movies for the LOTR series about six months ago. I had always wanted to read the series, but just never found the time to do so. This announcement came as a wonderful way to get me to start it though, and I have to say that once I started reading, I just could not put the book down.I like a decent story just as much as anyone else, but this one had me positively hooked! I read this book, just as I later read &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and was constantly finding myself gritting my teeth, correcting my posture, and feeling my heart beat faster and faster and faster. There is just no way to accurately describe just how gripping this book really is. The only thing that could have brought me any closer to the story was actually being there and witnessing these things happen firsthand, for through much of the book, that is how I felt anyway.Traditionally, I have found my niche within the realm of contemporary fiction, but this may lead me away from that path. If you are not one who likes books about fantasy, magic, or even science fiction, you probably aren't here to read this review anyway. But if for some reason you are here reading this review and you still don't like those things, have no fear. Tolkien's mastery of detail in this truly dramatic and suspensful precursor to the Lord of the Rings trilogy will keep you on the edge of your seat.Further, if you enjoy this book, let me just add that the Lord of the Rings trilogy itself offers ten times as much excitement as is packed into &quot;The Hobbit.&quot; It is without a doubt, a book that should not be missed by anyone!!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"[...]There are enough adjatives already said on the book (maybe I'll write a full review of it later) but for now lets talk about the comic (or as it is refered to the paperback version, click the link below, you'll like what you see.)It's a collection of three part comic book adaption of The Hobbit put out in three issues back in 1989. I considered it the best comic book adaption of anything I ever read and the passing of a decade, and a new cover for the trade paperback has done nothing to change my opinion.It should be said up front that 134 pages are just not enough to give the entire book its due. If you want the actual novel then read it. This is a comic book, it is a GREAT comic book and on my list of best ever, but it is a comic book.That doesn't mean avoid this this is a great adaption. The artwork is supurb, colorful, and \\"takes\\" you into the story quickly. David Wenzel does his job well. When I think of the characters in my mind. The faces I see are these drawings. And I've seen every cartoon adaption and the movie. He also did some very nice prints from this book.Charles Dixon adapts the story well. This was version I read to my children when they were six and eight and it was kept by my youngest son near his bed for easy access over the last two years.This will definately get your brood especially the younger members of it into the story and into reading as a consequence.A great addition to any person's collection of Hobbit or Tolklen stuff.

Tolkien is a book meant for those who have an imagination, or those who whish to enter the world of dragons, magic, treasure, goblins, gloomy figures, but most of all adventure.I thought a big reason that the book is great is that it's so great, is that its so vivid it feels like you are in the book, that you are seeing the characters right there, facing danger. The whole story of going to take back what is theirs even though they must face impossible odds, they themselves spoke that they wouldn't make it, the book is also written in some old English to make the characters seem older and mature. Though the book does a good job in letting one know what the characters are thinking and feeling, one cannot get a good grasp of what the characters are like. I believe the book lacks in this, because the characters are in such extreme emotional and physical conditions. I liked the message of I got from the book which was the underdog taking a stand, and not going out without a fight no matter the odds.This book makes you feel what the characters are because like I said it feels like you are right there in the middle of it all. It also does a good job of guessing you do not know whether something is going to pop out or where the must go next.

Tolkien was an excellent book. I really like all imagination and creativity the author put into it. It is a book about a creature called a hobbit. The hobbit is named Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo goes on an adventure with some elves to reclaim a stolen treasure. They must retrieve the treasure from the dragon namd Smaug who gaurds it. Along the way there are many adventures and exciting things the travelers encounter.This book is for young teens to young adults. It has a good theme that kids can relate to. Bilbo is different than everyone else and he doesn't think he is much of an adventuror or hero. In the end though he realizes that even though he may be small an different he can use those things to his advantage. All he needs is to believe he can do it and then he can. Kids can relate to that and realize that if they believe in themselves they can achieve anything.This book stirred many self motivating emotions. It made me feel courageous. If there was something I needed to do and I was scared of it, I should just be brave and face it. I'm sure it would make many younger kids feel the same way.I thought this book was a very interesting book. Some parts were less interesting and exciting than others but there were really exciting moments which made up for the dull ones.

I can see even now how his world got turned upside down and what amazing adventures awaited him. He was the quintessential reluctant hero, who delivered grandly in the darkest hours. What an amazing story!What really tickled me later was to realize all the minor ways and passages that Tolkien created in this masterpiece were but gates that lead to entire worlds. Each of those little plot offshoots would yield millenia of history, entire sagas, in the later books.Back then who would have known, least of all I, how far and wide the world was. I don't think Tolkien himself knew, and the biographer's may agree with me.The Hobbit is forever enshrined as a classic children's book, but to me it carries a greater significance. It is essential reading to be weaned into the stupendous world Tolkien created, to journey through the agonies and bliss of The Lord of the Rings, and finally to flood the senses and overload the emotions in Silmarillion.But to begin the voyage, one must read the Hobbit.To not complete the voyage, one must forever wonder, to what depths and heights of genius did Tolkien's mind travel?"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit is about a band of dwarves, a wizard, and a hobbit.

The introduction is first rate, though mysteriously it uses end notes while the rest of the book uses annotation in the margin. The notes that delve into the possible sources and influences on Tolkien's thought and work are mostly interesting and informative. The main negative I find is how many marginal notes are devoted to textual variants between the various editions. For example, in the section where the company meets the trolls, a note explains one version has \\"they dropped him\\" while another version has \\"he dropped him.\\" Although the textual variant notes are usually more extensive than this, they are an uninteresting disappointment to me.

An excellent adventure and treasure-hunting story, (think of The Elder Edda meeting Treasure Island.)This book is the archetype for all other commercial 'dungeons and dragons' fantasy that follows in floods. But rather then delivering the sedentary life message that most contemporary fantasy readers would like to hear, it delivers an entirely different message: GET OFF YOUR MEEK BUTT and START LIVING! START AN ADVENTURE! That's a message from a World War 1 veteran/author, not a hackneyed, cardboard-style, fantasy author who is today at your local mall convention.To many, (not just me,) The Hobbit is superior to the Lord of the Rings in that it is basic, it's wordplay and wit is constant, it has more humor. Though the LOTR's is an epos, an epic. The Hobbit is a lot more of a fairy tale...you read it when your young and it stays hidden - but not forgotten - in the back of your mind so as long as you live.In this postmodern age of cyber-hacks as fantasy acts, CGI modelsas 'imaginary' flesh and blood creatures, passive escapist adventures as real authentic adventures, The Hobbit is again a refreshing read....it should inspire one to see and hike mountains, to carry a walking stick instead of a laptop.Like Virgil, Tolkien's message is simple: FORTUNE FAVORS THE BRAVE....not the meek, not the docile, not the lazy.(AND YOU CAN QUOTE ME ON THAT)-Myles P."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit, written by J.R.R. Tolkien, is a fantasy novel at its very best. This story introduces many extraordinary characters such as Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf, Thorin Oakenshield, and Gollum; who continue to live in the imaginary world of the trilogy, The Lord of the Rings, a sequel to The Hobbit. The story emerges in the quiet, peaceful town of Bag End, where the unadventurous Bilbo Baggins lived. He had much enjoyed his comfortable lifestyle until the arrival of the dwarves followed by Gandalf, who persuaded him to embark on a great quest to acquire the treasure guarded by the dragon Smaug. Along the journey to the dragon, the travelers encountered many dilemmas including mountain trolls, the disturbances in the Misty Mountains (the leaving behind of Bilbo and the conflict with Gollum), evil wolves (Wargs), and spiders. The climax of the story occurs after all of this believe it or not. They finally arrive at Lonely Mountain and defeat Smaug. However, the adventure does not end here, the tired travelers still have to overcome one last obstacle. They must defend this newly acquired treasure from the viscous goblins and wargs to determine who got the treasure.The Hobbit is one of the most interesting and entertaining novels that I have ever taken the time to read. The author, J.R.R. Tolkien, is able to completely entrance the reader with his very descriptive details. Along with this, the plot of the story is incredible, making it seemingly impossible to put this novel down. If you are looking for a book that takes you on a quest through a new world and grabs your attention from the get go, then I highly suggest that you read The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit, written by J.R.R. Tolkien is fantasy writing at its best. The story, a prelude to Tolkien's immediate classic trilogy, The Lord of the Rings sets up the enchanting world of Middle Earth filled with memorable characters like Bilbo Baggins, the hobbit and main character in this story, Gandalf the Grey, a wizard and mentor for Bilbo, and the unforgettable dwarf Thorin, the leader of the dwarves who embark on the quest with Bilbo.The story begins in a quiet, peaceful hobbit hole in Bag End, the home of Bilbo Baggins. That is, it is peaceful until Gandalf the Grey persuades Bilbo to set out on a quest with thirteen militant and lively dwarves in search of reclaiming their treasure from the dragon Smaug, and Bilbo is to be their chief \\"burglar.\\" On their adventure, they run into three hungry trolls, visit the great elf lord Elrond, in Rivendell, they become prisoner to a group of goblins who live within the caverns of the Misty Mountains until Gandalf saves the day, Bilbo meets the unforgettable Gollum, a hissing, whining creature who lives in a pool in the caverns and hunts fish and goblins who also possesses the magical, and long forgotten Ring of Power. When Bilbo escapes the clutches of Gollum, he rejoins the dwarves; they are chased by evil Wargs, monstrous wolves, and are saved by enormous eagles and a creature that can change shape from a man to a bear, known as Beorn. The company eventually enters Mirkwood and is left on their own when Gandalf leaves on important business. The adventure continues through Mirkwood and on toward Lake Town, at the base of the Lonely Mountain where therein lies Smaug, the dragon and Bilbo must test his newfound wits, strengths, and skills to attest not only the deadly dragon, but the ending battle that will determine who gets the treasures.This book is one of my favorite books of all time. Tolkien is a master at what he does, and the world in which he creates, with its dozens of magical creatures, entwined with invaluable lessons of friendship, loyalty, and bravery are just some of the reasons of why this book is a masterpiece, in every sense of the word. It will always leave you on the edge of your seat, wanting to know what happens next, whether its your first time, or your fifth time reading the book.The only fault with The Hobbit, in general, is the intricate detail that Tolkien goes into to describe places and people. Although this is helpful, allowing the reader to get a better perspective of what Tolkien sees in his mind, his descriptions can sometimes last for pages on end (at least, that's what it feels like). But other than that, the book, overall, is very well written and will be an instant favorite of anyone who enjoys adventure and fantasy, masterfully entwined into one ingenious piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Hobbits, wizards, dragons and dwarves - that's what you will find in this classic story by Tolkien, one of the greatest fantasy-writters ever.First of all, the descriptions makes you fell like you're reading an old fairy tale, and that's really sets up for the rest of the book. The story is great and the characters really is something only a man like Tolkien can create.To make this a short review, I can only say: this book is magical, and truly a classic, who never will be forgot."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit; Tolkien, John Ronald Reuel.The Ballantine Publishing Group, 1745 Broadway, New York, New York; 306 pages; published August, 1965Jones Magnet Middle School LibraryDo you like magic? Do you like action? Do you like short, fat, little burglars? Then The Hobbit is the book for you. This is a hilarious book filled to the brim with magic and action, and the main character is a miniature burglar who always has his tea at four. Or will he?The reason that J.R.R. Tolkien wrote this novel was to entertain teenagers and adults. He has accomplished his goal as a writer at least fourteen times over.This book takes place in Middle Earth, a medieval-type world with creatures and people of all sorts. Just to name a few: Dragons, Dwarves, Elves, Goblins, Hobbits, Wargs, and Wizards. This is how you can tell that this book is fantasy. Here is a quote from page 145 \\"'Bombur has fallen in! Bombur is Drowning!' he cried. It was only too true. Bombur had only one foot on the land when the hart bore down on him, and sprang over him. He had stumbled, thrusting the boat away from the bank, and then toppled back into the dark water, his hands slipping off the slimy roots at the edge,\\" I think that this book has great plot, good characterization and an awesome theme.I think that Tolkien accomplished his goal in The Hobbit. One thing that I left out was his characters, they are Gandalf the Wizard; Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, Fili, Kili, Dori, Nori, Ori, Balin, Dwalin, Oin, Gloin, and Thorin Oakenshield the Dwarves; Bilbo Baggins, the hobbit burglar. They have been over hill and dale, through an ominous wood, forded several rivers and fought a great battle. My opinion of this book was that it is 100% totally absotively posilutely AWESOME! My personal connection to this book is the fact that I had a grandfather just like gandalf (except for the fact that Gandalf was a wizard) he was cool, calm, and collected. He had a great sense of humor, and he knew the way out of any tough situation.Bringing this review to a close, I think that you should read this book. I rate it 11 out of 10. I think that this will be the only book with this rating.Your reviewer,Ben Jammer"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Great graphic novel adaption with beautiful illustrations for the younger crowd, or those just wanting a new view of Middle-earth. I got a bunch for the 10 and under crowd in the family."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This was the book that introduced me to the incredible and expansive world of Middle-Earth...or should I say the cartoon?...i first saw this in the old cartoon version, catching it ocassionally on TV, but never from the beginning (closest I saw to the beginning was the scene where the eagles rescue the company from the top of the trees) and I enjoyed watching it each time. A few years after seeing it the first time, I happened to pick up The Hobbit at my school library (this was in the 6th grade), and started reading it. I did not recognize it till I reached the same event in the book, and I realized I was reading the source of the cartoon. That discovery, that there was a book form of the story, eventually led me to find the LOTR Trilogy and the other books of the Middle-Earth universe...that being said, I love this book. The narrative style does seem a bit more geared toward younger readers, which was wonderful given the age at which I first picked it up, and that might turn away older readers who are getting their first taste of the Middle-Earth. However, having read the Trilogy numerous times through, as well as having read the Indexes and Silmarillion, going back to the Hobbit opened a whole new world. Things like realizing that the same Elven King that held the dwarves prisoner was the father of Legolas, or that Gandalf meeting Thorin was possibly by chance yet the events he set had a much greater purpose than getting rid of a Dragon and reclaiming a treasure (Sauron's attack in the ROTK might have gone differently had the dragon still lived...and an alliance between the Dwarves and the Men stood in his way). It was like finding invisible ink on many of the pages that gave bits of information here or there. Since I am a diehard fan, I found rereading the Hobbit was even better the second and third times through...and there is still so much know and find out, and that is what I find so wonderful about the LOTR and Middle-Earth.This book certainly might not be everyone's cup of tea, just as there are differences in tastes of music. The very descriptive style of Tolkien does turn some people off to his works, and others, like myself, find ourselves embracing every word.It is certainly a great read for the Tolkien fan and for younger children, and can be, if you let it, the first step into a much larger world."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I first read this book in fourth grade and I loved it to the last sentence.

The detail was great, and made it so you could imagine the surroundings and actions almost perfectly.Some think it's a book for teens and kids, but I think I'll love rereading it through my life.

The Hobbit has lots of suspense that makes you want to hit yourself if you have to go to sleep and not read the next chapter, it scares you so much you're so scared you don't want to read tha next chapter and finally, it brings you to fight with yourself. A little bit like this, is the character making the right decision, what will the consequences be, and how will the problem be solved.

Children might like it but it isn't 'for' children any more then the fantasy genre is in general.I think this books stands above the LOTR triology quite easily because it's primarily a book about good vs evil as opposed to the two blended and mixed on so many levels as to leave you feeling depressed. This is a straight out story. Beautifully written, no axe to grind or weird theology to push (or confused theology) it just is.I like it.I gave it five stars for the quality of the writing and the storytelling magic it conveys. The characters are very memorable and leave you feeling inspired.I think it was on my top ten books list for over a decade or so.(a fantasy novel doesn't have to have depression and horror stories to make it 'adult'.)PS. I don't generally like the fantasy genre because it often glorifies all kinds of things that arn't healthy (harry potter for example). But that being said, I think that the hobbit would fall less into that category then the narnia series (personally) and those are marketed as 'christian books'. It's the heart of a book that strikes you the most - not necessarily the vehicle that carrys it. I think the hobbit is pretty harmless compared to the majority of stuff that's out there.I'd read it to my children if they were old enough and wise enough to understand the implications of what they were hearing."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I'm ashamed to say I have never read the Lord of the Ring series before (I may have started one once but didn't like it and put it back down) and even after seeing the movies, which I did enjoy, I still didn't dive into Tolkien's world. Well I decided to remedy that and picked up the Hobbit, the prequel of sorts to the Lord of the Rings series. I have to say I wasn't all that impressed. It was an inventive story for sure, and Tolkien had a lot of imagination, but there were a lot of flaws in this book in my opinion.We are introduced to Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit that likes to make sure meals are regular and a comfy chair exists in his hole in the ground. He is surprised one day by the wizard Gandalf who brings thirteen dwarves to meet his acquaintance. They tell him he is to come on a journey and help the dwarves so that they may regain their homeland and treasure from a dragon who has stolen it all. Nothing is ever as easy as it seems though and they encounter many hardships and perils on the road. Not a lot of people seem to like this merry band of travelers and they are constantly fighting for their lives and freedom. But some other things do happen, and a lot changes when Bilbo finds a very mysterious ring.The characters in this novel are well developed. I was glad to see Gollum as he is my favorite character in the movies and he was well written in these pages. Bilbo was also done splendidly and you were able to get a good sense of what Hobbits are like from him. Even the dwarves, as many as there were, had distinct personalities.The writing is where I found some faults. This book is extremely rushed! It seems like they were no sooner getting into trouble than they were out of it and into some different sort of trouble. Because of this, there didn't seem to be any suspense to the novel and it would have been nice if Tolkien had settled on a few instances and described them well, then had many that hardly got any description at all. He seemed to repeat himself too with our heroes getting captured at least four times, although I stopped counting after awhile. That being said, even the violence in this novel was tame and nothing was offensive that I could find so it is appropriate for all readers.I wish I would have enjoyed the book more. I do hear that this is the weakest out of the series so I will continue on. I just hope they get a little better as right now I'm not sure what all the hype is about.The HobbitCopyright 1937306 pagesReview by M.

I hated this book with a passion!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I know for a fact that there are several of Hobbit fans. Though personally, I hated the first book and the entire series. Most of these people who've reviewed books by Robert Jordan, claim that his series is just another set of stories based on the writing of the Tolkien series. Many of my friends seem to agree with me that this story was a total bliss. Bilbo is a Hobbit who seems not to do much in the story. Of course, the whole meaning of him being their, is to keep the story revolving around a world of addiction. The ending of the story is horrible and it seems that Tolkien wasted his POOR and SENSELESS usage of his brain. No offense, but the suspense was not at all amusing and you felt as if you wanted the book to end on the first page. Bilbo practically does nothing to defeat the vicious (funny word to use here), dragon, Smaug. Surely this book was a waste of energy. The intricate details which are suppose to consist within this &quot;story&quot; are no where to be seen. The book does not unwind itself to a twisting and strange plot, but clearly a purposeless one. I despise and loathe this series tremendously. Bilbo is not exactly the character which you would find addicted to. He stammers and is basically a coward. Dwarves. Now where have I heard this word babled by little five year olds? Oh, that's right, Snow White and the Seven DWARVES! For the dwarves in the story, remind you very much of the ones in the Disney classic. Idiotic and Irritating. This book is a story of your everyday savior (supposedly Bilbo) having adventures and slaying a dragon. So it's like your medieval classics of a prince saving his beloved, only with a more dull and tasetless...yawn. Excuse me. Just remembering that I read the book makes me just faint in exhaustion. What was I drinking when I decided to read this piece of junk? And like all stories, there are monsters and strange happenings. Flipping through the pages, the words &quot;been there, done that,&quot; echoes through your crying mind. Crying because the story will NOT END! Agghhh! Gandalf the wizard is a bogus, he does absolutely nothing that would benefit to anything worth mentioning. Come to think of it, Bilbo reminds me of a pig. Small, always desiring food, foolish, cowardly, lazy...I can go on forever. Also, the series is quite poorly written. The words used remind me of the time when I picked up my first book around the age of four. Take my word for it, this is not the sort of book which makes you read till past your regular bedtime. One more things on the dwarves. They are useless characters and this story makes me want to vomit. No originality whatsoever is involved and the pages make me wish I was not even in existence. There you have it. I wouldn't even give this book a star, but since that was not an option, I had to settle for a WHOLE star.

Overall it is excellent although not as epic or deep as Lord of the Rings, but it was aimed at a younger audience. Bilbo is very much the reluctant hero and gets swept away on an adventure to slay a dragon with a band of dwarves. Alot happens in the novel and it is well paced. I like the interaction with the goblins and wargs. Tolkien's mythology is rich and detailed. I think this could have been longer as some parts feel glossed over such as the episode in the forest with the elves.Some find the ending unsatisfying but it was important for Tolkien to tie up the story of the dwarves; the squabbling over the treasure with the elves and men after the death of Smaug was realistic.I can't really see how this will justify three movies (2 is pushing it) but I am sure it will be fantastic. A shame Tolkien never lived to see his imagination brought to life."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I ranked the book 5 stars because I just loved it I would recommended it to any one I know"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This book is very good.

I could not put it down. Now I am older (I\`m 20) and I see and read books deferently. I judge them and try to be more critical about them, but THE HOBBIT is still one of my favourite books. I admire the author because of his imagination that has no limits. The language is rich and colourfull and the characters very interesting. It is something everybody who want to escape the everyday life and spend at least a couple of hours in a magical world, should read.We get to know Bilbo - a hobbit that starts on an adventure. he travels trough the Middle Earth with a group or dwarfs. He joins them as a thief (he cam move very quietly) on a quest to the home of the dragon Smaug, who guards an old treasure that origilally belonged to dwarfs. On his way he also meets a strange creature called Gollum and from him he gets a very special and magical object (I will not tell you what it is in case you haven\`t heard it, read it, or seen the movie yet :), but you can imagine what it is right?)It is also the begininng of something much larger, it is the starting point for the Lotd of the Rings.Tolkien\`s source was the celtic and nordic mythology, but he created creatures of hisown also - the Hobbits and also the Vargs. He created a new elven lenguage.It is less complicated than Lord of the Rings and notably written for a slightly younger public, but it is one of the masterpieces of fantasy and it always will be."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"&quot;First published in the United States more than sixty years ago, J.R.R. Tolkien's 'The Hobbit' has become one of the best-loved books of all time. Tolkien's fantasy was then adapted into a fully painted graphic novel, which became a classic in its own right...&quot;These words are found on the back of the graphic novel's cover, and I'm glad that's all they say about the possible quality of the book. Thankfully, the graphic novel isn't praised to be as equally good as the actual book, because while it is indeed good, it doesn't compare to Tolkien's early literary masterpiece.I'm not familiar with American graphic novels (Japanese manga is more my trade), so I can't fairly compare this graphic novel to other graphic novels. However, I can say that this book does make use of the term &quot;graphic novel&quot;: it runs somewhat like a comic book, using pictures, and is occasionally filled with excerpts of storytelling from the original book. So it's not really a comic book, and it's definately not a novel, so it most likely really is a graphic novel, but I really can't say for sure.The artwork of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; graphic novel is like everything else that's been used with the Middle-Earth licence: some will like it, some will hate it. The color scheme reminds me of an oil painting and the character designs appear somewhat &quot;old-school,&quot; although some people won't have any trouble with that style. To my knowledge, all of the story of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is in the graphic novel, but expect some scenes to be condensed. The pacing can be a little off, and sometimes things just happen out of the blue. Still, the execution of the entire graphic novel is very well done and, and it does manage to capture quite a bit of the believability of Tolkien's world of Middle-Earth.This is where the biggest problem arises. The graphic novel is good, but it is no substitute for the actual book. To read this graphic novel as a substitute for the book is like reading Cliff Notes in place of an enjoyable literary classic. It's interesting to read after reading the book, but that's it. Reading the graphic novel before the book and expecting to get the exact same experiece takes away a lot of the magic Tolkien created.All in all, this graphic novel is good, but it's nothing compared to the real deal. I recommend only reading this after reading the original book; to do otherwise would be denying to yourself the beauty and magic of Tolkien's early masterwork. It's a classic graphic novel, but nothing more."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"There isn't much to say about a book that has a great story, magical yet believable characters, and a magical world full many a creature.

Now Bilbo will have to adjust to new situations daily as they encounter wolves, goblins, giant eagles and spiders, and other creatures just to get to the mountain.

It's very easy to feel for Bilbo as they face one obstacle after another. &quot;He thought of his home, not for the last time.&quot; I smiled every time I saw that line. My biggest complaint about the book is that it is a bit episodic in nature. Their many adventures don't seem that interrelated for most of the book. This is a minor issue, however, and it's very hard not to like the characters and root them on in their quest to reclaim their rightful place.I've read this book twice, and hope to get to the Lord of the Rings soon.

Tolkien was published on September 21st of 1937. It is the success of this book that paved the way for \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". \\"The Hobbit\\" is definitely geared towards younger readers, and it received favorable reviews from papers in the U.K. and the U.S., and it was nominated for the Carnegie Medal, as well as the New York Herald Tribune Children's Spring Book Festival Award in 1938.\\"The Hobbit\\" is often over-shadowed by \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", and this is especially true when one treats \\"The Hobbit\\" as the prequel to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". To consider it as such is both fair and unfair. It is fair, because clearly the events in \\"The Hobbit\\" took place prior to, and are key to the \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", and of course there are common characters in both stories. However, it is also not fair in that \\"The Hobbit\\" clearly was written for a younger audience, and even when reading one of the revised editions, where some passages were altered to better fit with \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", the overall tone of the work is much lighter. There was a brief attempt by Tolkien to rewrite \\"The Hobbit\\" in the same style, but he soon gave it up because it destroyed what was so good about the original. As a result, it would be better to consider \\"The Hobbit\\" as the children's telling of the events which took place prior to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and not attempt to hold it to the same standard.Another thing that people have noted about the two stories is that at a high-level outline the two stories are very similar. The adventures both start in the Shire and are initiated by Gandolf, they travel to Rivendell, they go through caves and have to deal with the goblins/orcs therein, they meet elves on the other side, there is a huge war between numerous armies, and of course they return to the Shire to find things changed that they have to put right. Of course, that is an overly simple way to look at either of the two novels, especially \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", even though it is true on the surface, but it is an interesting observation.As beings that are roughly half the height of a man, Hobbits make an ideal hero for a children's story, as it gives them a hero with whom they can identify. The story has a fair amount of humor in it, and a light-hearted feel through most of it, though certainly as an adventure there is a fair amount of peril, whether from the trolls, worgs (wolves), goblins, spiders, and even the wood elves, not to mention the dragon, Smaug the Magnificent. Despite being accessible to younger readers, older readers can still enjoy \\"The Hobbit\\" as well."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"A true classic. After recently slogging through most of the pre-Hobbit works (e.g. the Silmarillion, Chidren of Hurin, etc.) it was refreshing to re-visit the easy-to-read Hobbit. The book runs through the story of how Bilbo Baggins ended up with the One Ring around which the events of The Lord of the Rings revolve - though it really is a small plot element when compared with the adventures the characters have in enchanted woods, dark caves, dragon hordes, elven dungeons, and battlefields that occur in the rest of the book. The book gives a wonderful introduction to Tolkien's universe and weaves a spellbinding tapestry of sorcery and adventure that provides a great prologue to Tolkien's greatest work. A short and easy read (especially compared to Tolkien's other works) that I've added to my short list of books that I read again and again.

Written very well and truly enjoyed."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"[I originally wrote a review back in 2000 for \\"The Hobbit\\", detailing the differences between \\"The Hobbit\\", \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", and \\"The Silmarillion\\". In 2012 I wrote a new review, and am editing my original text to include this new review. Mike London 10-3-2012]New Review 2012: \\"In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit.\\" Thus begins the most famous series in fantasy literature. For such a universe of high caliber, the sentence is a rather unassuming beginning for quite an unassuming, down-to-earth race known as Hobbits.Unfortunately \\"The Hobbit\\" has become overshadowed by \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", seen as an \\"enchanting prelude\\" to the more substantial sequel. C. S. Lewis said in \\"A Preface to Paradise Lost\\" that to accurately judge an item, you first must know its purpose. The books were written for different purposes - \\"The Hobbit\\" as an entertaining story for his children, and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", initially a seqeul to \\"The Hobbit\\", became much more a continuation of \\"The Silmarillion\\". For those who underestimate \\"The Hobbit\\" using the criteria of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" as their guide are missing out on a rich work.What are Hobbits, you may ask? If you go researching where Tolkien got inspiration for the Hobbits, you will soon get mixed up in \\"The Denham Tracks\\" (a 19th century list of various folk-lore creatures) and E. A. Wyke-Smith's \\"The Marvelous Land of the Snergs\\". Honestly, neither of these will get you very far.The Denham Tracks reads like a laundry list of folk-lore creatures, and though the actual word \\"hobbit\\" appears, there is no context for what a \\"hobbit\\" actually is. \\"The Marvelous Land of the Snergs\\" will get you a tad bit further. Snergs are creatures about half the height of man (like the Hobbits), enjoy their food (again, like the Hobbits), and there the resemblance ends. The World of the Snergs is far removed from Middle-earth, having more to do with 19th century adventure stories set in fantasy with such dispargant elements as a vegetation Troll (by far the best character in the book), witches, knights similiar to stories of King Arthur, ad a waylaid sea crew hailing from the ship [on the ship] \\"The Flying Dutchman\\"Tolkien certainly anticipated the question, for he answered this inquiry within the opening pages of this very book. They are a race two to four feet high, shy of \\"Big People\\", and have no beards, unlike dwarves. Hobbits are chubby, \\"dress in bright colours, (chiefly green and yellow)\\", and wear no shoes because of the hick tufts of hair and thick leathery soles of their feet. They eat as often as they can.The story of \\"The Hobbit\\" is well known, having been published in 1937 and continually in print (save only for a brief interruption in the early 1940s, when Great Britian were facing paper shortages due to World War II).\\"The Hobbit\\" began life as an entertaining story of Tolkien's children (as so many of Tolkien's stories began as well). Written between 1929-1933, the book details the adventures of Bilbo Baggins. Gandalf the Wizard meets with Bilbo in the opening pages, telling him he is looking for some \\"to go on an adventure\\". Bilbo, not quite as respectible as he would like to believe himself to be, tells Gandalf life was much more interesting when Gandalf was around, but no, he would not have any adventures, thank you very much. Naturally, thirteen dwarves show up, and ultimately Bilbo sets off to reclaim the gold that the Dragon Smaug has stolen from the dwarves. Like the later Aragorn, Thorin Oakenshield, the chief dwarf, is a king-in-exile, and wants to reclaim both his throne and his gold stolen by the dragon..The real meat of \\"The Hobbit\\", and one of the reasons why I believe the book has had such a long lasting appeal, is the book's transformation of Bilbo.\\"The Hobbit\\" shows the reader how an unassuming modern character ([for [all his]] though Bilbo lives in the far removed past, he is THOROUGHLY MODERN) goes from being an out-of-place bumbler in situations far removed from his life expereince to an equal among beings and races that belong only in the distant past [When - give examples of this]Although initially inept, Bilbo, just as Gandalf predicted, proves to be a worthwhile companion, coming through for the dwarves on several key occasions, such as freeing them from the Elven prisons, fighting back the spiders, and facing the dragon alone. He even eventually aids in bringing about a resolution to the growing distress between the Dwarves, Men, and Elves after the fallout of Smaug's demise (albeit, rather unconventionally, using the Arkenstone, the Heart of the Mountain and the jewel which Thorin prizes above all others). [the whole affair of ] This journey, this transformation of Bilbo into something more, something greater, is the true heart of the book. Tolkien himself said that he removed Gandalf from the story shortly after Beorn's house, due to the dramatic need for Bilbo to proove himself without assistance from the wizard. Fortunately, Tolkien was able to use Gandalf's absence as a springboard into more expansive story ideas when he began developing \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" after the unbridled success of \\"The Hobbit\\".Also, the book displays a moral complexity often not seen within the confines of children's liteature. By this, I am referring to the whole matter of Bilbo's handling of the Arkenstone, the chief jewel of the hoard that Bilbo and the dwarves are setting out to recover. The claims of the Elves and Men, and counter claims of the dwarves, and Bilbo's claiming of the Arkenstone and how he wants to use the Arkenstone to move the uprising [ever renewing] battle toward resolution are complex and startling legal in tone.For all its story-book qualities, \\"The Hobbit\\" is a much different work from its subsequent [work] heir, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". Although early manuscripts explicility prove Tolkien was casting the \\"The Hobbit\\" in the universe of his mythology from initial composition, \\"The Hobbit\\" features several elements and passages that are altogether incongruous with \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", especially in the First Edition published in 1937.For one, the ring found in Gollum's cave is not the One Ring, the Ruling Ring of Sauron. The magic ring was simply that - a magic ring, a stage prop that, in the words of Tom Shippey helped equalize Bilbo in the archaic world he found himself in. Tolkien only began developing the concept of the Ruling Ring AFTER publication of \\"The Hobbit\\" when he was trying to come up with ideas for a sequel. When reading \\"The Hobbit\\", readers, especially those who know the sequel, may approach the Ring as though this was truly a dark and sinister ring, which the text does not simply support. Indeed, Bilbo's deception about the ring, so important in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", is not explicit in \\"The Hobbit\\".Next, and probably most fascinating of all, is the nature of Gollum himself. We all know he's a hobbit, long ago corrupted by his long possession of the One Ring. However, prior to 1951 when Allen and Unwin (Tolkien's publishers) published the revised version of \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" that Tolkien had written in 1947, not only was Gollum explicitly NOT a hobbit, we were not even sure what kind of creature he was (or what his physical size was). He was more akin to Tom Bombadil and Beorn, a one item category unique unto himself. There were no textual indications of Gollum's size in comparison to Bilbo, leading some illustrators in foreign editions to show Gollum as a much larger creature than he would later become.Then there's the matter of the original version of \\"Riddles in the Dark\\". Initially Gollum was going to give away his magic ring as a gift if Bilbo won the contest as well as show him the way out; after winning, Gollum is unable to find the ring (naturally, as Bilbo had already found the ring), so he showed Bilbo the way out, constantly apologizing. In \\"The Return of the Shadow\\", Book Six of \\"The History of Middle-earth\\", we find Tolkien trying to work within the parameters of this original chapter. Naturally, Tolkien ultimately abandoned the original conception and rewrote the chapter in 1947 as a specimen of what a new chapter could look like and sent this to his publisher. Tolkien was quite surprised to see that, four years later, Allen & Unwin published the rewritten version, and Tolkien accepted the text as authoritative.While that's the most interesting of the differences, there are still several passages at odds with Middle-earth as described in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". There is no Shire. There are references to policemen and an unnamed \\"king\\". The trolls fit more into fairy-book stories than Middle-earth, and, as Douglas Anderson points out in \\"The Annotated Hobbit\\", Tolkien references other trolls with multiple heads, a thing not found in Middle-earth. Then there are the stone giants, which only appear once and then are never heard of again in any other story, before or after. There is speculation that one of Bilbo's ancestors took a FAIRY wife, a conception wholly alien to Middle-earth. There are no fairies in Middle-earth. Then there's the matter of the ruins of the mysterious city upon which Lake-town is built upon. This ruined city is mentioned only in \\"The Hobbit\\"; it goes unnamed, unreferenced, and undocumented in any of Tolkien's other writings regarding his legendarium.Probably the single biggest difference between \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is there is no developed nomenclature in \\"The Hobbit\\". The majority of the names are simple descriptions of the things involved: Bilbo lives in The Hill, is traveling to the River Running, visits a city named Dale, as neighbors across the Water, etc. There are very few proper names in \\"The Hobbit\\". The thirteen dwarves names and Gandalf (with the exception of \\"Balin\\") are all simply lifted from \\"The Devergatal\\", a section of the Elder Edda In \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" however, nomenclature is king, and Tolkien spent vast amounts of time creating vast landscape, cultures, and races all with their own unique linguistic flavour.There are also some geographic inconsistences between the two works. From the bridge to where Bilbo and the dwarves meet the trolls is within sight; however, in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", this same spot takes Aragorn and company SIX DAYS to go from the river to the spot where the trolls are.Tolkien was aware of these differences, and in 1960 wrote several different passages and revisions to bring \\"The Hobbit\\" stylistically more in line with \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". These passages were published for the first time in 2007 with \\"The History of The Hobbit\\". However, he showed the revised passages to someone (it is unknown who) who discouraged him from changing \\"The Hobbit\\".Ultimately, \\"The Hobbit\\" is a much different experience than \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", much more akin to classical fantasy fairy tale books such as \\"The Wind in the Willows\\" and \\"The Marvellous Land of the Snergs\\" in both style and tone than \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". Too its credit, the success of \\"The Hobbit\\" was what prompted Tolkien to write the sequel.In the seventeen years between initial publication and the appearance of the first volume of its sequel (1937-1954), \\"The Hobbit\\" never went out of print (save only for a brief period during World War II due to paper shortages) and was a tremendous seller, without support from \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". It is indeed a rich work, and is an undisputed classic. This book is so much more than a \\"prelude\\" to bigger and better things. It's a keystone work in children's fantasy, and stands among the titans of literature.....-----Original Review: \\"Inferiour to L.R.? I think not! No, just different!\\"The biggest problem with this novel is perception. Tolkien wrote this story for children; to be more specific, this was written for HIS children. There were several stories like this, but it was this, The Hobbit, that was his master achievement in children's literature.The Lord of the Rings ( a single epic, NOT a trilogy) was written to cash in on The Hobbit's success. Tolkien wanted to get on with the more serious work of his mythology, and ultimately that is what happened with The Lord of the Rings. It became attached to his mythology, and became as important to him as The Silmarillion.So delineation is required if you want to read this. Do not go in with the thought that The Hobbit is a \\"precursor\\" or any such nonsense to The Lord of the Rings. Think of it like you would think of any other children's classics: children's classics. If you take it on The L. R.'s terms, this is a failure, primary because it is not written to be like that. But, on the flipside, The L. R. is as much a failure in children's fiction. It is not children's fiction, it is epic fantasy, and one should not equate it with children's fiction. That is EXACTLY what people try to do with The Hobbit. They try to put it in the same type of genre or playing field as The L. R. They are both masterpieces, and I love them both dearly. But one is for children, the other with adults.Of course, Tolkien is part of the problem. How many books do you know that is a children's book and has an adult sequel? Not very many. The Hobbit, scarcely 300 pages, was written and published in the children's market. He then talked to his publishers, and they wanted a sequel. So he began \\"the new Hobbit\\", as C. S. (Jack) Lewis so aptly put it. He was preoccupied with his mythology, and the sequel was drawn into it. So we have two works, spanning two different genres, and as far as surface connections go its little more than prequel/sequel. Instead of looking at The Hobbit as a prequel, a precursor to his ADULT masterpiece, an inferiour version, think of as his CHILDREN'S masterpiece. The Hobbit is top of the class in children's fiction, one of the few contenders against such other great children's works as Narnia and Wrinkle in Time. The Lord of the Rings, likewise, is THE crowning masterpiece of the fantasy genre, of which its influence is incalculable to that fantasy market. Both are as important as the other, just in different fields.I haven't talked about The Silmarillion much. I have already reviewed it, so I won't go real in-depth here. But the same thing happened with it. People, expecting another Lord of the Rings, were inevitably disappointed with the Biblical style of the published version. If Tolkien wrote that book out in narrative form as he did Lord of the Rings, it would be ten times longer than Lord of the Rings. The biggest problem with Tolkien is people have to many preconceptions that are incorrect.So, basically, in conclusion, think of it like this:1. The Hobbit - Children's masterpiece. He scores big with this one.2. The Lord of the Rings - a single fantasy, not a trilogy. (Tolkien was always quick to point that out). The Crowning achievement of modern fantasy.3. The Silmarillion - the Bible of Middle-earth. Much more for students of his work than the causal reader.[From the Amazon.co.uk review: Enjoy Tolkien's Middle-earth! I certainly have!Mike London]"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"No, this book isn't \\"better\\" or \\"worse\\" than any of the volumes in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. It's just different. Less serious, for sure. And for me, that meant a much more enjoyable experience. This is a book that reads like an extended fairytale, with all the associated delights, while the LOTR books read like a chronicle of war. Both good, but you have to pick your poison. Humor plays a huge part in this story, where it plays only an ocassional part in the later Tolkien volumes ... As for the story, it's engaging from the beginning, and because it's earlier Tolkien, it is not burdened by any undue pressure of having to produce something better soon: in fact, a lot of it was just notes Tolkien read out loud to his kid before bed. When he went to compile it, he had to think back to how the tale went. Bedtime stories, in other words, which I think adds to its charm.The chapters are mostly fun, and wholly unpredictable; I loved finding out what happened next, and rarely saw it coming.Some negative points involve the \\"songs\\"; just as in the LOTR volumes, personally, I could have done without. Tolkien is no poet.Some unforgettable scenes here, and most will linger in your memory, like the image of the group of adventurers lingering for weeks (months? years?) near the dragon's lair, unable to figure a way inside. Or the \\"Invisible Bilbo\\" chapter. Haunting stuff.Then there are the precursors: the introduction of Gollum, the Ring of Invisibility (which was not the One Ring at first), and Gandalf, among other things.All in all, not only one of the best books-for-children I've read, but one of the best books period.And the title of the new movie should be \\"The Hobbit, or, There and Back Again,\\" stupid Hollywood people.

The tone of the story is lighthearted, yet it holds treasures of imagination and character development well worth exploring.Though I am no Tolkien scholar, like any thoughtful reader who compares this story to his later work, the Lord of the Rings (of which The Hobbit is supposed to be a prequel) the differences in the Middle Earth of The Hobbit versus LOTR are several, but not irreconcilable. Hobbits are, for the most part, as hobbits should be and are expected to be; when tossed (or dragged as in Bilbo's case) into adventure they prove themselves quite worthy of the label \\"hero\\" in the most unexpected ways. But you'll not find orcs; here they are goblins. Elves are very lightly sketched, being either rather silly as they sit in trees and sing la-la ditties, or as in Mirkwood where they are more ominous, magical folk who toss unsuspecting travelers into dungeons without a by-your-leave.It's Middle Earth in its infancy, in my opinion, but nonetheless has special charm. I enjoyed the magical \\"talking\\" birds and the shape-shifting land of Beorn. The dragon is deliciously evil, though his part short-lived.There are powerful characterizations. Bilbo's growth into a true Heroic type is treated honestly, showing both his errors in judgment and self-serving tendencies, as well as his golden moments. We watch Thorin's descent into greed with a clenched heart of sympathy and horror as the fairytale devolves into all-out war among races. Death and destruction are dealt with head-on and realistically, and the reader feels the impact of it.The first time I read it, I barely noticed that there is a total lack of female characters in this story. As to why, who knows? I doubt Tolkien was being mysogynistic and more likely, the product of his own time - as I am of mine, when we do expect to see more heroic females in literature.Overall, it's a gem of a story, a modern classic for good reason, and time well-spent for the lover of Fantasy. And if you want to understand Bilbo's finding of the One Ring, you need to read The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"\\"In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit.\\" J.R.R. Tolkien first scribbed down the opening line of this book on an extra sheet of paper.And years before \\"Lord of the Rings\\" was seen by anyone outside Tolkien's circle, Middle Earth was first introduced to readers. \\"The Hobbit\\" is simpler and less epic than the trilogy that followed it, but Tolkien's brilliant writing, magical world and pleasantly stodgy hero bring a special life to this early fantasy classic. And with the first \\"Hobbit\\" movie coming out in a few months, it deserves revisiting.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life, in a luxurious hobbit hole under a hill (\\"it was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\"). He's the picture of dull respectability.But his life is turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield. They want to reclaim the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar, even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life.So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. The quirky little band ends up battling goblins and spiders, nearly getting eaten, and imprisoned by Elves, while Bilbo finds himself in possession of a magic Ring from the treacherous Gollum. But even with a magic Ring, can he defeat a monstrous dragon and win a war against multiple enemies?Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and ancient Men for years before he ever came up with Bilbo's quest. But it's fortunately that he did, because while \\"The Hobbit\\" is overshadowed by the epic sweep of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and the \\"Silmarillion,\\" it's still an entertaining story that lays the groundwork for his more famous works -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.Tolkien's writing is swift, light and full of songs and poetry-laden descriptions, such as interludes in the shimmering, ethereal Rivendell and the cold, terrible Lonely Mountain. The pace in this is much faster than in most of his other works -- not surprising, when you consider it was originally a bedtime story for his children.Most of the book's action is about Bilbo trying to keep himself and the dwarves from getting eaten, torn apart, or rotting in elf dungeons, but with some quiet interludes like a night at Beorn's mountain home. And the last chapters hint at the epic majesty that Tolkien was capable of, as well as the idea that even little people -- like a mild-mannered hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.This book also first came up with hobbits -- the peaceful fuzzy-footed countryfolk -- in the form of Bilbo Baggins. He's a likable little guy, if the last person you'd ever expect to be a hero -- initially he seems weak and kind of boring, but his hidden strengths and wits come up to the surface when he needs to. By the end, he's almost a different person.The dwarves are more comical, and the elves more whimsical in this book, but the supporting characters are still impressive -- the crotchety, mysterious wizard Gandalf, the dignified, flawed Dwarf king Thorin Oakenshield, and a Guardsman who becomes a king. Even minor characters like Beorn, Elrond and the menacing Smaug are given plenty of dimension.\\"The Hobbit\\" started as a fluke, grew into a bedtime story, and became one of the best fantasy stories in literary history -- a charming adventure in the time that never was.

A hobbit is creature who likes peace, and quiet. Their most favorite hobby is of course eating. But one Hobbit changed how the world would see them forever.Bilbo Baggins was an ordinary Baggins as some Hobbits say. He lived in one of the biggest houses in the Shire. One day sitting on his porch smoking pipe weed. Gandalf the Grey shows up on his doorstep. Bilbo didn't know how much Gandalf would change his life. In the very beginning of the adventure Gandalf introduces the dwarves to Bilbo. At first the hobbit was shy and didn't like them, but towards the middle he thinks of them as best friends.The dwarves are very cool in this book. They all have different personalities but they all love two things, riches and most important FOOD. They are all funny and are really cool to learn about but the most serious is Thorin. Thorin was the leader of the dwarves and is the heir to the throne of his people. The reason he went on this adventure is because he wants to avenge his people by killing Smaug.Smaug is a dragon that terrorizes a country side to kill, and steal riches. The reason Thorin wants to kill Smaug is because he destroyed he home. Smaug lives in mountain and comes in and out as he pleases.One of my favorite books got to be The Hobbit because of one thing, it was unexpected."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"It's been decades since I read The Hobbit last and, with the movie coming out soon, I thought it would be a great idea to pick it up and read it again. Additionally my five year old son had been begging me to read it with him and wanted to know all about Smaug.Do I seriously need to do a recap here? I will just for the sake of completeness. Bilbo is visited by Gandalf and a number of dwarfs who want him to be their burglar on a journey to steal the dwarves' gold back from Smaug. Bilbo very reluctantly agrees to go on a journey that has him confronting trolls, elves, goblins, and eventually the dragon itself.Is there anyone out there who hasn't read this? If not please go read it. This is where fantasy got its roots from and is a must read for any fantasy fan. This book has it all; humor, adventure, friendship, magic, danger. You name it. This is how I first met elves and goblins and other fantastical creatures.I was amazed rereading this at how much humor is in this story and just at how well the story is put together. The imagery is excellent and the story completely engaging. My five year old begged to read this book every night until we were through; the picture books were never picked up until we had finished this book. My son was desperate to meet Smaug and find out what happened to him. When we finished he wanted to start reading it again.I am also amazed at how well this story withstands the test of time. Yeah, it gets a bit wordy at parts and yes, there are some turns of phrase that are pretty outdated. But that is part of its charm. It was so much fun to see my five year old enraptured by the same story my dad read to me when I was young. Seriously this book shaped my taste in reading forever.This edition of the book is lovely, I got it as a gift from my parents, and there are many lovely and exquisitely detailed drawings throughout. They are every few pages and were really something to look forward to as we read the story.Overall still an absolutely wonderful read. This is a book that stands the test of time and is enchanting for all ages. This is where fantasy starts and it was wonderful to see my son enjoy it as much as I did when my dad read it to me. Hopefully one day my son will read it to his kids too! Highly recommended for everyone."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit is a wonderful book. It is entertaining for all ages. I first read this book when I was eight and I still love it. My parents love this book too. It is very creative. For those who have started reading the book: Keep reading. The beginning is a little slow, but once they leave Bilbo's house it is wonderful. One of my favorite things about this book is that the villians are not SOOOOO SCARY. They are funny. If you liked Harry Potter you would love this book. This is one book I consider equal to Harry Potter even though it is a bit slow moving."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"My personal feeling is that not many books in literature today even come close to the adventure contained in the Hobbit. 'The Hobbit' has everything from the magic of wizards to the bravery of knights to the simplicity of Bilbo Baggins, the hobbit. The culmination of this book at the battle of five armies as a backdrop for the slaying of a giant dragon named smog is untouched by any book I have ever read since. This story sets the table for J.R.R.Tolkien's opus trilogy 'The Lord of the Rings' which is a masterpeice in itself. When I first read the hobbit many years ago it captured me for days and still a part of my heart today resides in 'Middle Earth'. I think you will feel the same way when you read this great story. It's truly magical. A really great one indeed."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit (in my opinion) is the best book that was ever written! It is an extrodinary adventure for people of all ages. All of the characters are very well developed.

Acompanying Thorin, King Under the Mountain, his 12 dwarves, and Gandolf the Gray as the &quot;expert treasure-hunter&quot;, Bilbo undergoes many new experiences and meets a lot of people (not all of them friendly).

It opened a Whole new world to me."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"When I was but a child, having seen no more than eight years my mother read to my siblings and I this most beloved of tales. Amazing in both its simplicity and its scope Tolkien's Hobbit is a delight to readers of any age, and should-as others have proposed-be read over and again, at different stages of one's life. It is in this humble reviewer's opinion that it remains a jewel in the crown of fantasy literature, timeless in its appeal and its applicability.I am now in my twenties, and have only recently re-read \\"The Hobbit\\", and while I am more critical of the book now than I was when I was eight, I cannot in any way belittle or take away from its effect. While I read it, I fought against the constant exclaiming of the characters, more often than not a sentence ends in \\"!\\". However, once I understood the simple, cheery, and kindhearted nature from which our vantage point sprang, I embraced it.\\"The Hobbit\\" or \\"There and Back Again: a Hobbits Holiday\\" draws the reader into the first adventure of the honorable Mr. Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit. We are privy to his journey, along with a band of Dwarves as they venture off across the Wilderlands in search of treasure and nothing more than vengeance against the venerable and most feared Smaug the Dragon. No doubt, the story is familiar to you, but if not, I will not be the one to ruin any of the suspense or wonder you will behold.This wonderful story is necessary for every respectable reader, and I whole-heartedly recommend it to anyone of any age without remorse. And I'll always take one thing away from it with me, best summed up in these words: \\"If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.\\" Indeed, I believe old Tolkien hit the proverbial nail on the head."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This book is great for people of all ages.

YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This is the work that made Tolkien famous, and rightly so. Written in a light tone, it is nonetheless not a book solely for children; as Tolkien himself has said, adults are in greater need of fantasy than children, and 'The Hobbit' shows us just how true that is.The focus of the story is, of course, on Bilbo Baggins, the Hobbit indicated by the book's title. Initially, he is a solid member of his society -- well respected for doing nothing rash or unexpected. After being essentially co-opted into an Adventure by Gandalf the Wizard, he is forced, little by little, to grow from someone who bewailed having left his pocket handkerchief behind to one who is able to face down Smaug the Dragon (admittedly while invisible) and give up the Arkenstone to prevent a war between Dwarves, Elves, and Men. These are serious matters, even if told in a faintly whimsical manner.Finally, however much one might want to analize what makes 'The Hobbit' a great book, what comes out most clearly is what an outstanding story it is: one that can be enjoyed by almost everyone, whatever their age or temperment, and read over and over again without losing its flavor."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"My parents had tried to get me to read The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings series since I was 11 or 12 years old.

It was such a great story, so interesting, so descriptive, and with all the action and adventures, there was never a dull moment! I just want to know why Mr Bilbo Baggins and the rest of the Hobbit tales (which I am presently reading) are not part of school reading lists. Tolkien is an excellent writer."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"As far as fantasy books go, this is the best one yet (that I have read). The Hobbit, one of J. R. R. Tolkien's masterpiece works, is clearly one of the most amazing pieces of literature ever dreamed up. It is extremely well thought out and written. Now any time my parents go tell me to read I think I will go pick u The Hobbit and read over and over again. After I finished The Hobbit I rushed out to chapters and bought the next novel in the series, The Fellowship of the Rings. After only reading the first couple of chapters I can see that this will truly be another great adventure to read. The Hobbit is the ultimate fantasy book of all time. It starts out by a very mysterious and powerful wizard by the name of Gandalf passing by Bilbo's (The Hobbit) house. Somehow the wizard despite Bilbo's eagerness to get rid of him gets invited back for tea the next day. However before the wizard shows up, a band of dwarves arrive at Bilbo's door. Then when Gandalf arrives Bilbo is informed of what all these dwarves are present for. He has been selected by Gandalf to assist these dwarves in retrieving a stolen treasure, dwarves gold. He becomes the burglar of the band of dwarves. He is the one that must figure out how to steal back the stolen treasure from an evil and incredibly dangerous dragon Smaug. At first the dwarves have no confidence in Bilbo; they do not believe that he will be able to do what Gandalf says he will. Gandalf you see have a great deal of confidence in Bilbo, this will prove to be a very wise decision. It will be a very perilous journey or the dwarves and Bilbo. Along the way many hard-ships will occur, this will prove to be training for Bilbo; it also convinces the dwarves that Bilbo will indeed be able to retrieve the treasure for them. As for the rest of the book you will have to read it to find out what happens in the end."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit is always a refreshing read for me, as Tolkien uses a simpler style of writing than he uses in the Silmarillion or in the Lord of the Rings.

It was the gateway to the likes of Donaldson, Eddings, Kerr, Feist and many others the sort of stuff which I specifically look for when I want to read something relaxing. Tolkien has managed to transport the reader to a completely different world populated with absolutely delightful characters. I have read it countless times in countless situations, in an airliner crossing the Atlantic, in the centre of Picadilly Square, on a bus, on the underground, in bed, by the campfire, during examination time, wether I'm exhausted or bristling with energy... this is stuff that anyone can enjoy at any time and in any surroundings or situation. This sort of literature is a good lesson for all of us to stop taking ourselves and our petty concerns too seriously. It teaches us to be children once again and to experience joy at simple things.

To say that this book fired my imagination would be an understatement. As a result, I have reread it dutifully every five or six years since.I am truly in awe of this commemorative edition celebrating the 70th anniversary of one of the most entertaining books of the twentieth century, and there's not much more they could have done to make this book appealing to a Tolkien fan. The sumptous artwork on the dust-jacket, the maps of Middle Earth, even the detailed illustrations reach out to the reader and expand upon Tolkien's carefully constructed world in the most appreciated way. Seriously, this is one of those times you really want to click on \\"See inside the book\\" and see what all the fuss is about.Oh, and as an addendum for those interested in medieval romance, Tolkien's translation of \\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,\\" the 14th century's gem of the alliterative revivalist movement, is equally compelling. I don't think it's currently in print but it's definitely worth tracking down if you want to see how literature influenced Tolkien's creative spirit.

While most LOTR fans may only be interested in this book because of the finding of the One Ring, there are many elements in here that make this stand apart from \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" This is, very much, a classic treasure hunt tale and a good example of the hero's journey, the hero in this case being Bilbo Baggins. It also has a better view of dwarf and hobbit culture than \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" if you don't includes the prologue and appendices from that novel. And it is far more accessible to the average reader than LOTR due to it's smaller size and somewhat playful tone. However, that playful tone is one of the drawbacks, in my opinion, about this book. Having just finished \\"The Silmarillion\\" and \\"The Children of Hurin,\\" with it's distinctly epic tone and scale, it is quite jarring to go from that to the childlike tone of \\"The Hobbit.\\" Not only that, but due to the fact that this was the first book to be published (ca. 1937), it didn't seem to benefit from Tolkien's extended revisions of his mythology that were published later. In fact, though he tries to put \\"The Hobbit\\" into his mythology, it seems clear that Tolkien didn't have it all fleshed out as he later did in LOTR or even \\"The Silamrillion.\\" Regardless, this is an enjoyable book and a necessary prelude to \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\""},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I usually rip jackets off of my books because I hate the way they feel and look.

But things change when Gandalf the Wizard drops by--along with thirteen dwarves, led by Thorin Oakenshield. Suddenly, Bilbo finds himself on a pony heading away from the Shire and into the great unknown, to defeat a dragon and score treasure.I Liked:WOW! This was such a beautiful, enjoyable book!The Hobbit has never been my favorite Tolkien novel, mostly because it seems so childish (of course, it was written for kids). But the audiobook (and listening to Eldest prior to this) gave me a new appreciation for this joy.Firstly, there are the characters, primarily Bilbo. Bilbo really strikes me as a relatable guy. He's comfortable, content to live at home, and uninterested in adventures. He has to be pushed out of his home by Gandalf in order to get in on the fun. It reminds me so much of how I can be: content to go along, not trying new things until my sister forces me on a new path.My favorite character, though, is Gandalf. I like how quirky he is, how smart and even caring he is to Bilbo. Gandalf knew that Bilbo was perfect for the job and wouldn't let Bilbo back out no matter what. Plus, it's awesome to see recurring characters from the Lord of the Rings.The story itself is so wonderful! Tolkien writes in a third person omniscient, which allows him to employ a great sense of humor. I love how he often directs comments to the audience (explaining hobbits, trolls, and the like) and how light-hearted the tone is. As for the story proper: a pleasure! There is so much adventure, excitement, intrigue...I've read this before, but I still learned new things or was wowed all over again. I loved the tale of how Bilbo and the dwarves evaded the trolls (so simple, yet showcases how brilliant Gandalf was), how Bilbo got the ring from Gollum, and the trek through the Forest (so scary!).And I love how this story fits into Tolkien's vision for Middle Earth. Elrond, Wood Elves, Mirkwood (Thranduil!), Gollum, the White Council...all these and more make appearances.And lastly, the narrator...ah, he was such a pleasure to listen to! I loved his voice, and I adored how he sung the songs and poems in the book! Not many could pull it off so convincingly!I Didn't Like:I don't have a lot of complaints, but there are a few. Firstly, there are thirteen dwarves, and most of them have little to no character. Fili and Kili were young, Bombur fat, Balin I believe had the best eyesight. Only Thorin had any development.One thing I've never liked about the Lord of the Rings or much of Tolkien's works was all the poetry. The Hobbit was no different; a few poems were great, but after a while, I grew tired of the lapsing into a poem.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:None.None.While not graphic, there are some intense battles between goblins and the troop in the Misty Mountains and in the final battle.Overall:I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this book. I've never been a Hobbit fan, but this time around, I might be converted. It's fun, it's enjoyable, it's a piece of your childhood in novel form. Highly recommended for those who want to be kids again.Brought to you by:*C.S.

I have read many of the classics, such as Beowulf, Frankenstien, and Fahrenheit 451. As great as these books are, I believe that Tolkien's works rise far above.The Hobbit is a lighter adventure story, suitable for children, though even adults will find it a superb story. Tolkien's words paint a vivid picture of Middle Earth - of its beauty and its darkness. He does such an excellent job of portraying the characters that by the end of the book, you would be able to predict how any of them would react in a given situation. I believe that this is a book which would appeal even to people who think of fantasy literature as wierd and far-fetched. After you have read the Hobbit, which everyone capable of breathing should be required to do, run out and get Lord of the Rings and read it. This is a continuation of the story began by The Hobbit, and is a much darker tale. In L.O.T.R. we catch a glimpse of the deep and rich history of Middle Earth and its people. If you have not read any of these, then, by all means, stop what you're doing, order these books, shut yourself in a room, and don't come out until you've finished.

It's been a favourite of mine since I was a little girl. We actually read it at school as one of our \\"book list\\" books.The story of Bilbo Baggins is an exciting one. Hobbits don't usually leave the Shire but as Thorin and his dwarves along with Gandalf turn up on Bilbo's door he is encouraged to take an adventure with them. From the minute the book starts I was pulled into the story and found it hard to put the book down.The way Tolkein writes is pure genius. He paints a picture with his writing and Middle Earth, possibly thanks to the films, was so easy to picture. The characters are very easy to like or hate depending on how Tolkein intended them. Bilbo, the hero of the story, is someone that stays with you when you aren't reading and I found myself wanting to read more and find out what was happening.I think it is fair to say that since childhood the books have always been quoted as amongst my favourites. The Hobbit was one of the very first books that made me fall in love with fantasy and even now, 20...... years after my first reading I loved the story as much as I did when I first discovered it. It will stay in my heart probably until the end of my days.If you haven't read the book yet I would highly recommend it to you. If you don't fall in love with Middle Earth like I have I would be highly surprised.\\"There is more in you of good than you know, child of the kindly West.

And Bilbo is enticed into setting forth on a journey, which becomes very adventurous and dangerous. Bilbo acquires a ring, which belonged to Golum. And, finally, there is Smaug's treasure. Every thing, seemingly, turns out good for Bilbo. It, eventually, will turn out that the ring that Bilbo acquired is a very special ring. But, that is another tale.This adventure is fantasy at its best. Though, once upon a time it might have been called a fairy tale. There is adventure and magic throughout. And, this is where the author, Tolkien, begins to build his reputation as the finest fantasy writer of the twentieth century. This book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"After reading the Silmarllion first, I read this book. Wow! What a contrast. If men are stupid, the hobbit is small AND wise. How refreshing. It has been a long time since I have read a book so entertaining. Reading The Hobbit is a most cherished experience. All illustrations were created by JRR Tolkien. There are four (4) colored illustrations and the rest are black and white. The black and white prints are of very poor quality. What a shame. The binding is solid, the black hard cover is well made, the paper is standard quality with intermittent annoying ink blotches, and the paper book jacket is well done. Of interest is the paper book jacket. It is reproduced exactly as JRR Tolkien wanted it since he was the artist. Which leads me to think, the 70th anniversary version was an attempt to recreate what JRR Tolkien wanted when originally published but budget wouldn't allow. Also annoying is that at the end, the book publishes the first chapter of the LOR? What? Everyone knows of the LOR! Even with the short comings of the publisher, JRR Tolkien's genius shines thru in this little Masterpiece. I recommend this gem (or Arkenstone of Thrain) to anyone who has not read this book.

This story tells of the finding of the Ring of Power, though at the time it seems a mere piece of luck and comes in quite handy for Bilbo during his adventure. More important to this story is the journey of Bilbo and the dwarves toward their ancient home, the Lonely Mountain, where Smaug the dragon sits atop their hoard of treasure. Always, the goal of reaching the mountain and reclaiming the gold (somehow) is foremost in their minds, even though they become sidetracked several times along the way. This is a perfect adventure story, ideal for reading to children or for anyone of any age. Bilbo, a seemingly insignificant person of a seemingly insignificant race of people, is a wonderful hero, as he finds that he possesses more courage and wits than he ever imagined. This is one of those books that everyone should read, if not for its relevance to the Middle-earth saga, but also because it's simply a wonderful story."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This is a wonderful book to read out-loud. I dont' think I had ever read this before. I know it was assigned reading in middle school, but I never read it then. I have a strong anti-authoritarian streak evidently.I found that Bilbo was quite engaging, as he is somewhat like myself. He likes to eat, and entertain, but doesn't much like uninvited guests. When Bilbo gets a call from a childhood acquaintence, Gandalf the wizard, he gets quite a party of uninvited visitors that accompany Gandalf the next day for tea. The party sets in motion a most tumultuous adventure which is not very hobbit like.Throughout his adventure with the thirteen dwarves, Bilbo grows from a squirming dunderhead in leading his comrades into danger with the trolls, to the fearless leader whilst conversing with a dragon. He proves his bravery many times over. Despite the growth of his testicular fortitude, he remains a humble being. Which is a trait that is perhaps lacking in myself.Some people can go over the top with humility, and in their baseness turn humility into self-depreciation. This Bilbo never does, and I am glad of it. He does not boast of his successes, nor does he lament to long on his follies. The hobbit is too balanced for the everyman appeal, but is fun nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"\\"In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit.\\" J.R.R. Tolkien first scribbed down the opening line of this book on an extra sheet of paper.And years before \\"Lord of the Rings\\" was seen by anyone outside Tolkien's circle, Middle Earth was first introduced to readers. \\"The Hobbit\\" is simpler and less epic than the trilogy that followed it, but Tolkien's brilliant writing, magical world and pleasantly stodgy hero bring a special life to this early fantasy classic.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life, in a luxurious hobbit hole under a hill (\\"it was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\"). He's the picture of dull respectability.But his life is turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield. They want to reclaim the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar, even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life.So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. The quirky little band ends up battling goblins and spiders, nearly getting eaten, and imprisoned by Elves, while Bilbo finds himself in possession of a magic Ring from the treacherous Gollum. But even with a magic Ring, can he defeat a monstrous dragon and win a war against multiple enemies?Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and ancient Men for years before he ever came up with Bilbo's quest. But it's fortunately that he did, because while \\"The Hobbit\\" is overshadowed by the epic sweep of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and the \\"Silmarillion,\\" it's still an entertaining story that lays the groundwork for his more famous works -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.Tolkien's writing is swift, light and full of songs and poetry-laden descriptions, such as interludes in the shimmering, ethereal Rivendell and the cold, terrible Lonely Mountain. The pace in this is much faster than in most of his other works -- not surprising, when you consider it was originally a bedtime story for his children.Most of the book's action is about Bilbo trying to keep himself and the dwarves from getting eaten, torn apart, or rotting in elf dungeons, but with some quiet interludes like a night at Beorn's mountain home. And the last chapters hint at the epic majesty that Tolkien was capable of, as well as the idea that even little people -- like a mild-mannered hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.This book also first came up with hobbits -- the peaceful fuzzy-footed countryfolk -- in the form of Bilbo Baggins. He's a likable little guy, if the last person you'd ever expect to be a hero -- initially he seems weak and kind of boring, but his hidden strengths and wits come up to the surface when he needs to. By the end, he's almost a different person.The dwarves are more comical, and the elves more whimsical in this book, but the supporting characters are still impressive -- the crotchety, mysterious wizard Gandalf, the dignified, flawed Dwarf king Thorin Oakenshield, and a Guardsman who becomes a king. Even minor characters like Beorn, Elrond and the menacing Smaug are given plenty of dimension.\\"The Hobbit\\" started as a fluke, grew into a bedtime story, and became one of the best fantasy stories in literary history -- a charming adventure in the time that never was. Brilliant."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Most of us have seen or read the lord of the rings, but have you ever wondered what happened before this? Well, you can find out by reading The Hobbit, by J.R.R. Tolkien. This story is about a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins and how an adventure changes him and the rest of middle earth.In the hobbit, Bilbo Baggins is met by a wizard named Gandalf, who sends him on an adventure with thirteen dwarves: Thorin, Balin, Dwalin, Dori, Nori, Fili, Kili, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Bifuf, Bofur, and finally, Bombur. These 14 companions are sent on a quest to travel to the Lonely Mountain for the purpose of regaining the dwarves' treasure from the evil dragon, Smaug. On this journey, they will travel across the Misty Mountains, through the Goblin Caves and into the Dark Forest of Mirkwood. They will encounter Elves, Men, Goblins and various creatures of all sorts as they travel across Middle Earth.One such event occurred soon after they left the Shirt. This encounter was with a group of three trolls. After hearing noises in the forest, the dwarves sent Bilbo to investigate. When he did, he found that the trolls were eating. So, he tried to steal from them while they were distracted, but was caught in the act. While a prisoner of the trolls, the dwarves, hearing the commotion, gave themselves away by trying to save Bilbo, causing them to be bagged and thrown by the fire. The trolls then started arguing on how to cook the dwarves and the hobbit. Little did the trolls know, Gandalf was hiding in the bushes where he kept the argument going by disguising his voice as their own. Gandalf kept them arguing until daybreak, knowing that trolls cannot survive sunlight and turn to stone. When daybreak arrived the trolls failed to seek cover from the sun and indeed turned into stone. After this, Bilbo and Gandalf freed the dwarves who were cranky, angry and upset from being in the sack all night. This was just one of many adventures in Professor Tolkien's book The Hobbit.This story has many strengths. I believe the biggest is how Professor Tolkien paints a picture of the character's surroundings. An example is: \\"The lands opened wide about him, filled with the waters of the river which broke up and wandered in a hundred winding courses, or halted in marshes and pools dotted with isles on every side.\\" Another strength is how he leads up to an action scene. An example of this is how he has the dwarves and Bilbo wandering around Mirkwood, chasing lights before they actually get to the spider colony where a battle follows. A third strength is how the author uses song to relate to scenes or stories written the book. An example is from the beginning of the story, when the dwarves are all gathered at Bilbo's house. During this time, Bilbo gets anxious about the dwarves no being gentle with his belongings. So Tolkien ha the dwarves sing a song about breaking his plates when they clean up after a meal. Evan though this is a great book, it does have some weaknesses. One weakness is how the book has more narration then dialogue. An example of this is how Tolkien focuses more upon Bilbo's thoughts during a conversation that he is having than the conversation itself.This book is similar to other fairy tale/medieval novels. This is because of the creatures, weapons, and technologies used. Also, they have castles and every \\"kingdom\\" is for the most part independent and uncaring of one another. It is different from these types of novels because this story is used more as a prologue to The Lord of the Rings than a full story in and of itself.I believe The Hobbit was written for all audiences. Although there can be big words and weird phrases, even young readers would enjoy this wonderful story. The genre of this book is fantasy. I know this because this book has many wonderful fictions characters and places in it. There is no other book in comparison to this one (with the exception of The Lord of the Rings).Ultimately, I believe The Hobbit is one of the best books I've ever read. I think this is because it's written very descriptively and the storyline is amazing.

Yet, when I reread it this week I still became completely engrossed in it once again. Tolkien crafted a nearly perfect faery-tale here. In some ways it presages the Lord of the Rings, yet it is somehow different. It has a different feel to it. Had LOTR never been written this book would have still stood on its own as a classic.When I choose to reread this classic I searched out a copy of the edition that I first read in High School (a friend lent me his treasured copy.) This was the 1966 Houghton Mifflin hardcover edition- 25th printing. I had heard some negative reports on the quality of later editions and I knew that this one was first rate. It has Tolkien's own illustrations in it and on the dust cover. Plus, after over 40 years it has still physically held together- and probably shall for 40 more.So many books have copied this one over the years, but most of them are quickly forgotten while this one will last forever.

This 272 page book is filled with page turning fantasy that will keep you reading for hours.Hobbits are creatures that don't like to leave the comfort of their home, and especially don't like to go on adventures. One day Gandalf the Wizard comes to Bilbo's hobbit hole and asks him to join him on a gigantic excursion to get the dwarfs' gold back. One day latter about one dozen dwarves come to Bilbo's house encouraging him to come. Bilbo finally gives in even after being warned that the journey will be long, hard, and dangerous.

It is an adventure where he finds out more about himself than he himself knows.Unlike the later volumes the songs are of a higher quality (or so I think) but that again could be because I have actually heard them sung in the old cartoon. The story is both exciting and calm and easy. Not even the climatic battle near the end seems to take the focus off the Hobbit.The book seems to keep the calm and relaxed pace that a Hobbit likes in his life. In my opinion it adds to rather than takes away from the telling. Lots of time for more adventure in the next series.I think the pace of the book more than anything else makes it. It doesn't thrust itself upon you.

The wizard Gandalf and the dwarf Thorin, along with the rest of the company of dwarves, came to the doorstep of Bilbo's respectable hobbit-hole in the Shire, in need of a burglar on their &quot;adventure&quot; to regain the treasure currently in the possession of the great dragon Smaug. Reluctantly, Bilbo agrees to the journey.J.R.R. Tolkein weaves a wonderful story, following Bilbo's adventure. Along the way, Bilbo and his counterparts meet trolls, goblins, elves, humans, giant spiders, and many other dangers. As Bilbo learns more about being a burglar and going on adventures, he slowly gains the respect of his comrades. And in the end, it was Bilbo alone who took the weight of the company, when worse came to worse.This is a classic tale, one that has already been immortalized in literary history.

A round trip in the book, yet a beginning to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. A round trip, yet an intro into Middle Earth. A spectacular story about a Hobbit, his journey, and a ring.As you can see, there have been over 900 reviews of this book. All told, this book has a 4.5 star rating. What can I say that will change your mind on this? What can I say that has not been said already? Most likely nothing. I can shed no new light on this piece of fiction. All I can do is chime in with an opinin that has already been stated but by using other words. This book is excellent.Well, so be it. The book is a great read. It's a great tale in a great locale. This book is certainly required reading for anyone who reads various genres. Be it normally fantasy, sci-fi, history, or satire, I'd be surprised if you picked up this book and did not at least like it.Is this a high level brain teaser? No. Is this going to change the world? No. Are your problems going to be solved after you read this book? I doubt it. This book is an escape, an escape into the world that JRR Tolkein pulled from his mind's eye and thrown down on paper. This is the intro to that world he saw. And what a great advaneture it is.I'm not into revealing polt when I write reviews. I think that's silly stuff and I don't want to be told what to expect when I read a review. However, you have to give hints. And the book here is all about an adventure. An adventure that goes over hills, under hills, and around them. An adventure that meets with various good and bad people/things. An adventure that sometimes goes well, and seomtimes not. An adventure that finds its way to the lair of a dragon and his hordes of gold. This adventure is the prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but only a small find by Bilbo along the way links the 2. That and the wizard Galdalf.In reading this for the first time in about 10 years, I found it just as interesting as the first time, if not a lot easier to blaze through the pages. The writing is fantasy. You could easily digest this whole book in a solid day if you wanted to. And it would be a crime to do so because then the adventure would be over barely after it began.The only point of my review is this. Read it. Even if you hate it (which you probably won't), this is something you should have read in your lifetime. If you are 10 or 100, it is a fun book to pick up. It appeals to all ages and is something that no home library should be without. I can say I've read American history, Tom Robbins, Kurt Vonnegut, Doglass Adams (and Coupland), Middle Eastern history, as well as other fantasy books and escapism novels from the likes of Clive Cussler. And this belongs on my book shelf just as much as any of those."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Dating back to 1937, THE HOBBIT is truly a timeless classic. This wonderfully vivid fantasy stands perfectly well on its own, but also sets the stage for Tolkein's grand work, &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot;Hobbits are (or were) little people, smaller than bearded dwarves, but without beards or magic. They dress brightly and are somewhat fat in the stomach. They don't need shoes and have good-natured faces. Bilbo Baggins is a very well-to-do hobbit.When Gandalf the Wizard comes calling on Bilbo, offering a great adventure, Bilbo graciously declines. However, Bilbo is cleverly tricked into joining, or rather leading, 13 dwarves on a long and dangerous quest for a long lost golden treasure.The Hobbit captures the hearts of young adults and adults alike; a classic to be read over and over again."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"As I was planning to read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, I found it essential to read &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. Kind of like a background preparation. I was instantly captivated and brought right along with Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf and the dwarves as they made their journey to the treasure. I could not put this book down until I was through with it. (That is actually true). As the first fantasy book I read I recommend it to anyone considering joining the world of dragons, trolls, dwarves, elves, etc as this was a wonderful start to MY fantasy reading."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"To see children writing bad reviews for this book because it was too difficult to read and because it wasn't interesting is truly depressing; no, abominable! These children's parents should be ashamed to have raised such illiterate children who (apparently) are bankrupt of imagination. My father read this book to me when I was a little boy; it is one of my most dear memories. I can say that I am a better person for having read this book (and The Lord of the Rings), and that any young person can reach a deeper level of understanding of the potential of their mind and of the possibilities that exist in their life by reading, or by having read to them, The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This book is one of the best books I have ver read!

If you are buying it for the side notes in particular, my opinion is that it's okay but not great.I was expecting deep insights about Tolkien's writing, such as whether he had something in mind (like from WWII, etc.) and symbolized it with something in the book or not, if he &#34;massaged&#34; something over time to finalize and perfect it, etc., and there are some notes like this, but most of them are mildly interesting to boring notes on word derivations, etc., which disappointed me. Do the &#34;Look inside&#34; thing at Amazon or something to see if it appeals to you. Not bad but not what I was expecting.Of course, you still get the book text itself, which is a great read, and this is a good price for that alone (although I prefer the edition that has &#34;illustrations by the author&#34;, with more Tolkien, and obviously includes the entire book text too, and also at a good price).

The Hobbit was one of the first books I downloaded and I loved it. I read the book many years ago and I listened to the unabridged version on CD, and I loved reading it on Kindle. It is a great story and one I like to read or listen to from time to time. As one who enjoys the pleasures of being home, I can relate to Bilbo as he ventures forth on this great quest. While many of us are comfortable with things we know and are familiar with, I think Bilbo's story is good for all of us to read and enjoy.

Written for children, it is a wonderful piece of magical fiction that was loved by children and adults alike from the 1930s onwards. When Tolkien eventually wrote the more mature \\"Lord of the Rings\\" story, he went back and changed some parts of the Hobbit to tie in more closely with that story - and it was this revised version that I read.But this book works well on its own. Despite being written a long time ago now, it still reads well. It is exciting, hugely imaginative and with nearly all the classic story elements that make a good tale.Hobbits are a people who keep themselves to themselves, so a company of dwarves are confused as to why the wizard, Gandalf, chooses one Bilbo Baggins to be the company \\"burglar\\" in their quest to find and defeat the dragon Smaug. But before long Bilbo proves his worth.The final part of the book is amusing. I won't detail it to avoid spoilers - but it wraps up the grand adventure very nicely.The Hobbit is Tolkien's most accessible work. Many people skip it and go straight to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", but I think this is a mistake. The book was clearly written for children, but that should not put off older readers - there is plenty to enjoy in this book."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Bought this book for my 11 year old son at his request.

What did surprise me- and what did not translate into the movie- was the clever, convoluted and crafty writing style J. R. R. Tolkien used to capture the reader's imagination and unleash the power of the mental image. Would it be pretentious of me to say that it is more how the book was written than what it had to say that fascinated me? If so, forgive me. It's the truth.

Tolkien is a must read for young adults who love fantasy literature.One reason I enjoyed reading this novel so much was because of its unique storyline set in a fantasy world called Middle-Earth. Its storyline is so exclusive compared to all other books because it is almost like a lost part of Earth's history, set in the Middle Ages, and yet includes fantasy items such as immortality and magic.Another reason I took pleasure in reading this story is because it is the prequel to the Lord of the Rings series. If you have already read the series, this will give you a very good background on how the One Ring of Power was originally discovered and passed down to Frodo.On the downside, I disliked the Old English elements in the story and high vocabulary used by J.R.R. Tolkien. I must have picked up the dictionary fifty times to look up words that I was unaware of their meanings. Also, the author usually goes into great depth using detail to describe the setting and characters.

I immediately loved it. It is much easier to read than The Lord of the Rings. Bilbo was funny, and I liked the riddle game between Bilbo and Gollum. Fat ol' Bombur was humorous,too (mostly by the fact that he was so lazy and fat). I felt sorry for poor Bilbo. He was forever wishing to be back at home in his nice hole, the kettle just beginning to sing. The Hobbit definitly showed Bilbo's Tookish side. I would reccomend this amazing prelude to The Lord of the Rings triloqy. The amazing thing about J.R.R. Tolkien is that he didn't just create a few characters, he created a universe! He made cultures and empires, from the men of old to the graceful elves, from the evil orcs and goblins to the peaceful and food-loving hobbits. This is, in my opinion, the best book of the century.

First a bunch of dwarves come and visit the main character without any notice. Next the main character (Bilbo) starts this adventure to try to kill a dragon. Bilbo is only 3 feet tall and not very strong. They face many adventures and during one of these Bilbo finds a magic ring that can turn you invisible. The problem is that the ring has an awful magic power. It will consume and take over the person who wears it. The ring doesn't consume him in this book but it does in the next. Bilbo also faces many creatures like wargs or wolf-like things. He also meets trolls and with the help of Gandalf, a wizard, he defeats the trolls. Then Gandalf leaves their traveling band and they think all hope is lost until elves capture them. The elves put all the dwarves in prison but not Bilbo. Eventually Bilbo figure out a plan to get them out. They finally make it to the land of the dragon. The dragon is bigger than Bilbo could ever imagine. Bilbo steals some gold from the dragon and that makes it mad. At the very end the enemies who were fighting each other become friends to fight off the goblin hordes that come and try to take over. As they gain friends throughout the story all of them come together to fight. A funny part is when Bilbo gets home he sees people are auctioning off his house and all of his other stuff.

Not one to consider himself adventurous Bilbo with the nudging of his friend the Wizard Gandalf the Grey accompanies thirteen dwarves (Thorin, Balin, Dwalin, Kili, Fili, Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur and Bombur) on a quest to reclaim their lost treasure from the dragon Smaug in the Lonely Mountain. Known as the Burglar Bilbo encounters many strange creatures including monsterous trolls, pony eating goblins, wargs, wolves, giant eagles, wood elves, man eating spiders, a talking dragon and Gollum.While lost in the Misty Mountains, Bilbo finds a golden ring. To hearing the cries of the creature Gollum he puts the ring in his pocket. Gollum has lost his precious (the ring). Upon meeting, Bilbo and Gollum strike a deal. They will play a riddling game. If Bilbo wins, Gollum will lead him out of the mountains. If Gollum wins, he gets to eat Bilbo. Although Bilbo wins, Gollum has no intention of helping Bilbo when suddenly the ring finds its way to Bilbo's hand and puff...he disappears. He becomes invisible. Bilbo uses this ability to escape the Misty Mountains with its goblins and many other pickles he will find himself in throughout the rest of his adventure to Mirkwood, Lake-town and the Lonely Mountain.Although this is a fantasy novel, it is not necessarily appropriate for small children.

Then something Tookish woke up inside him, and he wished to go and see the great mountains, and hear the pine-trees and the waterfalls, and explore the caves, and wear a sword instead of a walking-stick.\\"Growing up in the back country, I frequently slipped away in the afternoons to hold tadpoles in my hands at the pond or to run through the woods and crawl into the hollow beneath an ancient and dead tree, pretending I was hiding from giant birds, the wind from whose wings might have knocked over my parents' house. Or I would climb the hill and look out on the peaks of the Cascades, snowy and massive against the sky. What child has not dreamed of going somewhere far over the misty mountains cold?And what adult has not experienced brief moments of nostalgia and wonder -- of considering whether it might, after all, not be a good idea to dash from one's house or one's office without hat or handkerchief, to go slay some dragon or find a treasure? And what adult had not learned, as Bilbo does, the high cost of an adventure not taken and the high cost of an adventure pursued? Or come home at the end of a long journey or a fierce project to realize, as if for the first time, just how sweet a thing home can be?More than just a children's book, The Hobbit takes us \\"there and back again,\\" into the adventure we long for and back again to our own hearth only after we've been provoked to reconsider both the costs and the rewards of going across the Water, of stepping outside one's home onto roads whose end we can't see.It's a beautiful novel.Also, the dragon is quite good.Dragons in stories don't often live up to our expectations, except perhaps in Pern. But this one is quite satisfying.If you haven't read this before, you're in for a treat. If you have, drop a comment below and celebrate with me. This book has quite a venerable age now! Yet it still feels young, and you might feel young reading it, and then perhaps older and wiser at the end. Or so I think; I am going to go re-read it now and find out.

And there was a little boredom with the denoument, which is the quiet relaxed winding down of the book plot after the dramatic climax, which I think is one of the most satisfying parts of reading The Hobbit or The Lord of the Rings but which my child did not yet appreciate.The only parts that I skipped were the many references to smoking pipe tobacco, which is portrayed as a positive pastime. I am not telling anyone what they should or should not do, it is just that in my family my spouse is trying, so far unsuccessfully to quit, I am an ex-smoker and my six year old is starting to pick up on the anti-smoking campaign, and saying such things as \\"smoking makes you sick.\\" I am beginning to open up a conversation about personal choice and trying to be a good person yourself and not judge other people but I just did not want to deal with the topic at the 9 pm reading time with a sleepy six year old.

This semester in my English 250 class, we read the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings trilogy and watched the motion pictures, all to get a better understanding of the amazing imagination of J.R.R. Tolkien.After reading these books, i found that the Hobbit was truly my favorite. The Hobbit was written for the entertainment and pleasure of children, and it seemed to do just that. It is full of adventure, action, and imagination. It is easy to follow and very hard to put down once your expedition. With the introduction of the quiet and timid hobbit named Bilbo, and a very wise old wizard Called Gandalf, you can start your journey to a very distant land that contains glory and treasure.Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit who enjoys a peaceful and pastoral life, finds his house invaded by thirteen dwarfs, all looking for their fourteenth member that will accompany them on their way to reclaim Lonely Mountain. Once they have reached their destination, they must take back their old home and treasures from the evil clutches of a mighty dragon, who goes by the name of Smaug.On the journey, Bilbo and the dwarves encounter all sorts of villains and obstacles. They do not traveled very far when they stumble upon a group of trolls. A combination of Gandalf's wizardry and Bilbo's burglary land the group out of harm's way, enabling them to continue on their way towards the treasure. This is not the only time you get to meet all the wonderful new creatures within the land of Middle Earth. On their way, Bilbo and his companions meet a kingdom of wood elves, a nest of giant spiders, a man who is also an ancient bear, and a strange, devious creature by the name of Gollum. Tolkien sure has a way with words in this book as he describes all of the new places and creatures that his characters encounter.Throughout the entire book, Bilbo and his accomplices find many different problems to over come and people to befriend. The soon-to-premiere film that is to be based on the Hobbit, should be very interesting. The animation that was made earlier to reenact the book lacked in profession, and by making the book into a movie, you will be able to better understand the novel and be closer to the adventure then you could have thought.The Lord of the Rings trilogy was very detailed and interesting, but not quite the reading material for children, or people with short attention spans. The movies help the reader visualize the new characters and lands that the books contains. The movies also, in my opinion, are much better then the books, because they keep you inthralled. The books are much too tedious and long for my liking, while the movies cover the main points and give you the adventure and action in a way that everyone can experience.In conclusion, the Hobbit is the only book worth reading, and if you are interested in learning about the Lord of the Rings trilogy, you should just watch the movies and save yourself a lot of time and headache."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"****************************SPOILER ALERT****************************SPOILER ALERT*******************************************Before Frodo, there was Bilbo, Mr. Bilbo Baggins. He is the Hobbit who led the Dwarves to the Lonely Mountain to reclaim their treasure from the dragon named Smaug. Bilbo is middle aged and resides in a clean, warm burrow dug into the side of a hill (the place is called \\"The Shire\\", home to many hobbits). In the beginning of the story Bilbo is a very weak character. He is easily frightened, and very shy (one of the conflicts, but I'll get to that later on in the review). Bilbo is also a Hobbit. Hobbits are known for their skills in thievery and spying. The Hobbits are very small creatures (they can only grow up to three feet... if they're lucky) with big feet, covered by tops of thick hair. They are very simple, and never wish to partake in very exciting activities. A very common profession found in their lives is gardening. Some of the other important characters are Gandalf; he is the wizard that accompanies Bilbo and the dwarves on their quest. Thorin Oakenshield is son of the king of the dwarves who were driven from the Lonely Mountain. Smaug is the dragon of the Lonely Mountain who hordes the treasure he stole. Gollum is a slimy creature that was born a Hobbit but had the ring too long; this is the character that Bilbo steals the ring from. Bard is the archer that kills Smaug.I'm not going to go into depths with the story, but I'll give a brief summary. Bilbo enjoys his simple and peaceful life, but all this changes by a simple knock on the door, a surprise visit by the wizard Gandalf. To Bilbo's surprise, Gandalf has arrived with a company of dwarves led by Thorin Oakenshield. They are embarking on a journey to recover lost treasure (from the town of men \\"Dale\\") that is guarded by the dragon Smaug, at the Lonely Mountain. Gandalf has decided, much to Bilbo's chagrin, that he will make an excellent addition to the team and Bilbo is going to play the role of a burglar. As they start on their way, Bilbo has serious misgivings. During their journey, they encounter various obstacles and, and all sorts of villains. They also encounter various creatures such as giant spiders, goblins, wolves and many others. In the end, they endure all of them. They eventually kill Smaug and on their way to claim the treasure, they are forced to battle armies of goblins and wargs (of course, Bilbo's party aided by several allies, otherwise they would've been out-numbered and killed). In the end, the wargs and goblins are vanquished and Bilbo returns to The Shire with treasure, the ring of power and a heart full of adventure.The world of the Middle-Earth is a complicated one. Tolkien took great care in representing this world, from creating new languages to including very particular cultural details that add to the richness of the world's fabric. Tolkien states that Middle-Earth was the planet we live today in an imaginary time (supposedly 6,000 years ago), but of course, this is just fiction.As I said, in the beginning Bilbo is the shy, weakest, and most frightened character of the group, but in the end he amounts to be the strongest. And now is when the conflict comes in. The main conflict is man vs. himself, or should I say Bilbo vs. Bilbo? Bilbo has to overcome his fears of dragons and other creatures in order to carry out his part of the mission.Now, let us talk about the theme shall we? I have noticed the story has several themes and morals, but the main one is this: never let your fears get in the way of what you want to do or be in life. Bilbo is an excellent example of this. And then there comes greed. Whilst greed is a recurring theme in the novel, with many of the episodes stemming from one or more of the characters' simple desire for food, or a desire for beautiful objects, such as gold and jewels, it is only by the Arkenstone's influence upon Thorin that greed comes fully to the fore in the story and provides the moral crux of the tale. Bilbo steals the Arkenstone, a most ancient relic of the dwarves, and attempts to ransom it to Thorin for peace. However, Thorin turns on the Hobbit as a traitor, disregarding all the promises he had previously bestowed. In the end Bilbo gives up the precious stone and most of his share of the treasure in order to help those in greater need (this theme can also be seen in Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy with Frodo and the \\"One Ring\\").Normally people read this book after watching the LOTR movies, and I don't blame them, I did the same thing. But some people look at this book as a prequel to the trilogy, and I really think they shouldn't do that. This is a completely different story to LOTR, one that may not be as good as the trilogy, but it definitely has more color than it.My thoughts on the book? It was brilliant. I loved the way that Bilbo grows up from a shy humble tea-maker into this great, mature adventurer. It's fairly short, and easy to understand. The plot is fantastic, and the build-up is very well done. Anyone can easily read it, the story is written in a very lighter tone than the actual trilogy (even has its comical parts) and I do recommend it for those who have a thirst for adventure, interested in taking a journey to a new land, to Middle-Earth."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Not only is it great fun for all ages, but a must read for fantasy fans.

The story also works well to introduce the ring into the lexicon of this universe.This story is so ubiquitous now that some see it as cliched. However, I like the book as an introduction into the fantasy genre. This book also brings into focus many of the races that become important in later areas such as dungeons and dragons. The quasi-pagan universe is one that builds as one goes through this story and also the installments of Lord of the Rings.I teach this book to Freshmen in High School English class.

Bilbo Baggins is so hesitent to go on this adventure with Gandolf and the dwarves (Hobbits aren't supposed to have adventures), but the more situations he gets into, the more inner strength and creativity he finds. The adventures through the Mirkwood and the escape from the Wood Elves were thrilling. The description of the Mirkwood was done well and you get a good feel how dark and forboding the place is. Tolkien really brought the characters alive. The Battle of the Five Armies was more an overview than a detailed fight.

It tells the tale of how Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf the wizard and a bunch of dwarves set out to &quot;rescue&quot; a treasure-trove of gold from Smaug the dragon. The journey takes, to my recollection, something in the space of a year. In the course they experience all the classic elements found in a fantasy world - giant monsters, weird and wonderful characters, fantastical battles, spirited and magical helpers and loathsome dungeons. And all this told in the most easygoing and kind-hearted prose imaginable.For more serious fans of the Middle-Earth universe, the linkups to LotR give the tale an extra twist of flavour.

The book is quite simply the quintessential adventure tale. I love how the book begins quickly and follows with a series of short, ordered adventures. Tolkien handles the character of Bilbo brilliantly allowing him to become more adventurous, but also making sure that he doesn't lose his Hobbit roots. Best of all, Tolkien throws in a few twists that make the Hobbit far more interesting than most fantasy stories. The trouble doesn't end with the slaying of the dragon (for those few who haven't read the book yet, I won't spoil it).

Its wide, sprawling story of wizards, dwarves, goblins, eagles, elves, orcs, ordinary men and treasure is diverse enough, but also understandable enough, to attract and entertain almost anybody. However, it would be a mistake to dismiss \\"The Hobbit\\" as a mere episodic adventure fantasy, just as it would be a similar mistake to do so with \\"The Wizard of Oz\\". I believe the main secret to \\"The Hobbit's enduring appeal is its optimistic assurance that no matter how small, timid, and scared you are, you have the tools, the ability, and the courage to confront life in all its hostility and triumph over it, if you really want to. As I said in the title (which sounds like an Obama slogan), you can, and you always could.I'm not going to go into slavish detail about the plot in this review. Basically, a mysterious wizard named Gandalf yanks a bourgeois, complacent hobbit (who are even smaller than dwarves) named Bilbo Baggins from his comfortable middle-class life and compels him to accompany a motley assembly of 13 boisterous dwarves on a quest to recover their homeland from a fiery dragon. The group has many adventures along the way with various beings, most of them dishearteningly harsh and hostile. Understandably, for the majority of the trip, reluctant, accidental hero Bilbo grumbles, trembles, and complains about his wretched circumstances. However, two things keep us on Bilbo's side. One, we would do the same thing in his place. Two, Bilbo gradually reveals latent aspects of his character that help the dwarves progress in their mission, even after the wizard leaves them to pursue his own adventure. Bilbo finds he has skills (like stone throwing and subterfuge), resourcefulness, and even daring that actually save the dwarves' lives on more than one occasion. He has the wits and luck to snatch an invisibility ring from the loathesome amphibious creature Gollum. He manages to keep up the dwarves' morale, especially when they finally meet the dragon Smaug at the dwarves' mountain home. He find Smaug's Achilles Heel which enables the Lake Men (namely Bard) to slay Smaug. Despite Bilbo's almost-constant fear, he forges ahead and even becomes an inspiration to the dwarves, even to their stalwart leader Thorin Oakenshield.In a way, \\"The Hobbit\\" is a mythological life metaphor, since life throws so much adversity, pain, and suffering at us. Sometimes we think we don't have the stuff to keep going. But we do and always did. If a little hero like Bilbo can persevere, the story tells us, we certainly can. But surprisingly, \\"The Hobbit\\" demonstrates a little bit something more - the deadly, foolish futility of stubborn greed and the stupidity of war for material gain.With Bilbo's unassuming help, the dwarves regain their mountain stronghold and their vast treasure that the dragon had kept for eons. However, Smaug's attack and death decimates Laketown and its dispossessed people quite logically demand restitution (i.e. part of the treasure). Consumed by avarice, the normally-sensible dwarf band leader Thorin refuses. A siege and standoff ensues. It may remind you of many modern-day conflicts, like, I don't know, the Israeli/Palestine impasse.Peaceful Bilbo attempts to break the stalemate by sneaking off and giving the siege leader the Arkenstone, the dwarves' most prized possession. When Thorin finds out, he conveniently forgets how Bilbo helped his crew and threatens to dash him on the rocks. Sadly, Bilbo throws his lot with the siege men. However, a more noble reason to fight arises as the goblins and their wolf allies the Wargs attack the compound. Man and dwarf are forced to become allies and repel the threat. Thorin's Iron Dwarf relatives also arise as the brutal Battle of Five Armies commences. Bilbo turns invisible and wisely stays out of it. Man and dwarf (and elf, I think) prevail, but its a Pyrrhic victory. Young creatures in their prime needlessly perish. Thorin does too, but not before seeking Bilbo's forgiveness. One gradually realizes that if you must fight a war, do it for freedom and right, not for gold. Also, to paraphrase Thorin, if more people appreciated a good meal and ale, like Bilbo, instead of gold and fighting, the world would be a much better place.

If you read every footnote, you will find the difference between each edition which may be of interest if you have more than one edition and wondered why the text is not always the same. The history behind the writing of The Hobbit is as interesting as the story itself.I would recommend this edition to just about anyone interested in the story including those who may want to read it to young children to introduce them to Middle Earth.

Yes children can read this book and it is fun. How ever there is a lot more to this book than a cute story. And it has all the depth of the other Tolkien works with the exception of being shorter.Many people look at this story as a prequel to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", where in reality it is a stand-alone story with a perfectly good beginning, middle, and end. When you read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" there is enough description to forgo \\"The Hobbit.\\" Personally, I find that reading The Lord of the Rings first gave me the in-depth background to better appreciate The Hobbit.Many of the creatures and adventures will put you on the edge of your seat. You will recognize the personalities and grow along will Bilbo as he faces new challenges as he learns to deal with life.A good book to read first would be \\"The Power of Myth\\" by Joseph Campbell.

One day a wizard shows up with a band of 13 dwarves. The dwarves are out to win back their gold that was taken years ago by the evil dragon, Smaug. Thus begins a journey through treacherous land where terrible enemies roam, in which many challenges are faced and adventures sprung. Bilbo surprises himself and his companions with his helpfulness along the way and they are forever grateful.&quot;The Hobbit&quot; involves many conflicts. Bilbo is troubled with himself in that he always wishes he were back in his snug little hole in the ground. Then there are the obvious conflicts between the travelers and the enemies. In order to pass through the mountain, the dwarves must defeat the goblins and later in the story, the goblins side with wolves and go after the. The dwarves must pass through a dangerous forest that goes on for what seems like forever and the most important thing they must do is stay on the trail.

However, I feel truly sorry for the unfortunate children who were forced to read this book against their will; not because they were made to read garbage, but because their closed minds and lack of literary drive kept them from appreciating this work of art. I can only wonder if any book they have been assigned will ever bring them joy. Best not to ever make them read the works of Dickens, or Shakespeare, or Hemmingway. As one child pointed out, &quot;it had paragraphs with 20 or 30 sentences...&quot; Oh dear, I guess Oxford University was wrong to let Professor Tolkien be the dean of their English department for 50 years. It is a shame that children cannot appreciate such great literature! This book moved me as no other has before. It is a treasure, a joy, a work of art. It is in the same league as Beethoven's 9th symphony (I can only assume this too would be despised by our MTV non-reading &quot;yutes&quot;), the Sistine Chapel, a '29 LaTour, and a Shelby Cobra GT.

The Lord of the Rings came next with me through junior high and high school (I've read the trilogy 3 times) and now I'm a few pages away from finishing The Silmarillion. Tolkien's imagination and attention to detail cannot be outdone, and those who slapped Tolkiens first literary triumph with a &quot;1&quot; or &quot;2&quot; rating had really take another look. The Hobbit intruduced us to a world as real as our own, therefore it stands to me as a real masterpiece.

Everything from the heroes quest to the world building, from the wizards and dragons to the goblins and elves scream fantasy to you and you can't help but realize that this was one of the first, and that definitely gives you pause and something to think about.Everyone knows the story of Bilbo Baggins. The poor Hobbit gets caught up in a quest that he embarks on with a little help from a wizard (Gandalf) and the adventures that unfold as this hired burglar journeys with thirteen dwarves to face a dragon that has conquered their home. Though initially reluctant and timid, Bilbo comes into his own as he journeys with the dwarves facing trolls, goblins, whargs, spiders, elves and more on the way to facing the evil dragon Smaug.With the help of his sword Sting and a ring that he picks up in Gollum's cave he soon becomes a formidable hobbit indeed, and also soon finds that the timid hobbit from under the hill will end up deciding the fate of an epic battle as five armies come to meet on the the slopes of the Lonely Mountain.I loved this book! The details, the storytelling, the narrators voice, the songs, all of it was just so readable and enjoyable and a very comforting read to snuggle up with on a cold January day. I would recommend this book to people young and old, and especially to any and all fans of fantasy.Whether you are reading is as part of the LOTR story, as a piece of fantasy's history, or as an introduction to the world of epic fantasy, I think you will enjoy reading The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This is my first Kindle book, and probably the first 'proper' dead wood book I ever read!

He goes through caves, meets humans and has a close call with a dragon called Smaug.The book is a fun fantasy adventure story with a great deal of depth to the world it takes place in.

My New Year's resolution was to finally do just that - with the help of Rob Inglis. His unabridged reading of the story on CD engages the reader so much more with the use of inflection, characterization and personality. It was surprising to discover a few of the words being read were different in my book, and in three places whole sentences were missing. Still, I am currently in the middle of the book and can safely say that I will repeat this experience once a year for the rest of my life! I love the story, the narration, and it is time well spent.

The digital version comes with all the maps and writings. Most importantly, the table of contents is pretty thorough that I could jump between chapters or go back to check the maps. The only problem with the Mac version is that I could not listen to the audio of Tolkien singing and narrating the chapters... That was a huge disappointment.

Fear, friendship, greed, courage, jealousy, sacrificial giving, lies, and loyalty all play out before the reader's eyes. Most often the greatest danger lies not in a fire breathing dragon, but in the heart of the hero.Sources: Based on an incredible imagination and expertise in ancient English history, Tolkien weaves a time tested story.Agreement: This is probably my favorite book of the entire Fantasy genre, and probably Fiction as well.Favorite Quote: \\"There is more than meets the eye.\\""},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I have never read this book, and was looking for it to read to my son.

The Hobbit by J.R.R Tolkien deserves even more then 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"If you like books about wizards, goblins, hobbits, and other mythical creatures, you must read The Hobbit, by J.R.R. Tolken. This epic story is about a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. Hobbits are small people who love peace and quiet, and certainly don't like to embark on big adventures. One day, when a wizard named Gandalf comes to Bilbo's door with a band of dwarves. Gandalf and the dwarves are going across the countryside to find some gold and they invite Bilbo along. Bilbo Baggins isn't exactly prepared to meet evil goblins, carnivorous wolves, scary trolls, and definitely not a dragon. I would strongly recommend this book who like the Lord of the Rings series and the Percy Jackson series because this book will help you extended your knowledge about mythical creatures. I also would suggest this book for people who like to read about fantasy and adventure. If you read this book, I hope that you will enjoy it because I did!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I've read The Hobbit about five times. Every time I read it I enjoy it tremendously and I take a deeper meaning from it. I've just finished reading it again and I think (if there is a message at all) that it is a message against vanity. Thorin immediately tells Bilbo he never wants to talk to him again when he finds out that he gave the Arkenstone to the other side. On his death bed, however, Thorin says Bilbo is as worthy of the treasure as he is. Bilbo and the Shire represent, in my mind, a happy people whose minds and desires have not been corrupted by the lure of wealth for its own sake. There are valuables within the Shire, sure, and people obviously want the nice things, but the main theme of the book to me seems to be that the Shire folk are not willing to risk their lives or dignity to get material things that they do not need.I've read hundreds of books and this is one of my all time favorites. If you have not yet read it I envy you for the experience you will have when you do."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit is one book in the top rank of Fantasy books.

The Silmarillion describes the ancient history of Middle Earth that provides the introduction.The last three books present the consequences of the finding of The Ring of Power.The Hobbit describes the events that led to the finding of this ring. It is tightly plotted and action flows smoothly and entertainingly. The book is full of wonderful poems and rhymes that everyone uses from the heroes to the villains. It is full of humor and, although reading like a children's tale at points, has more than enough serious content for any adult.This is an audio book.

I am very pleased with the quality of the book binding, paper, and the inclusion of many of Tolkein's own drawings that are to be found in the appropriate places throughout."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit tells the story of Bilbo Baggins, who leaves his quiet life of many meals a day to join a treasure-seeking company of dwarves. He encounters trolls, elves, giant spiders and magic of every kind. He returns home in the end to find his comfortable life waiting for him. Though he now has riches and a magic ring of invisibility, Bilbo will never again rest comfortably.Tolkien wrote this book for his own children, and it has the chapter-by-chapter pacing of a tale to be told at bedtime to eager young ears. It is not mere childishness, however. While the magic is exciting, there is also an underlying system, a consistency to what magic will work and who it will work for and against. This encourages thoughtful questions and recognition of order in even a make-believe world.Tolkien's hero grows as he journeys through Middle-Earth and through the book's chapters. Early in his adventures, Bilbo is rescued by either Gandalf the Wizard or by the more experienced dwarves. As the story develops, Bilbo takes a trembling hand in defending his companions and solving their problems. By book's end, he acts independently and makes his own decisions about what is right. In this entertaining and light-seeming tale, Tolkien shows his young readers what it means to grow up, to become capable and confident.Having enjoyed the Hobbit's happy lessons of childhood, adult readers ofThe Lord of the Ringsface maturity's darker challenges. Bilbo's simple adventure is retold, with secrets laid bare and threatening implications revealed. Bilbo's magic ring is a consuming burden that cannot be easily destroyed. His homeland is safe only because others struggle to keep evil at bay. The most frightening monsters Bilbo has encountered, the goblins, are merely tortured offspring of a world-threatening evil that must be fought. This change of perspective is more than the shift from a children's book to one written for adults. It captures the jarring difference between what children know, and what adults must know to protect them.This book has the reviewer's highest recommendation. Read it to enjoy a delightful children's story, and to see a childlike hero grow toward adulthood. Also read it to appreciate more deeply the adult themes in Tolkien's books that follow it. Analytical readers may also enjoy the psychological insights offered by Timothy O'Neill inThe Individuated Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"When I first picked up this book at the bookstore, with my parents, I didn't know what to expect. I decided to get The Hobbit because of its immense popularity. Being 7 years old at the time, this was one of my first 300+ page chapter books. The introduction was simple enough: A hobbit named Bilbo Baggins was sitting lazily outside his hobbit hole, with a long pipe, when the wizard, Gandalf, came by. Our first exposure to Gandalf is quite a bit different however. \\"Gandalf came by. Galdalf! If you heard only a quarter of what I heard about him, and I have only heard very little of what there is to hear, you would be prepared for any sort of remarkable tale.\\" To the reader, Bilbo Baggins seemed the lazy type -- content with his quiet life, baking seedcakes, smoking pipes, and living in his father's enormous hobbit hole. One must question Gandalf's motives for choosing such a person to go on a daunting quest. The \\"daunting quest\\" is helping 13 dwarves, including the great Thorin Oakensheid, recapture their gold from the dragon, Smaug. Smaug smashed down on the merry village of Dale, utterly destroying the village itself, eating up all its inhabitants, and (to add insult to injury) taking all of the gold and moving it into the Lonely Mountain. Thorin himself was the grandson of The King Under the Mountain, and so was even more outraged at this attack. After eating most of his food, the dwarves sang a song, which made Bilbo feel many adventurous things. Hobbits do not normally even appreciate this type of music. Bilbo must use all of the qualities he never knew he had (i.e., bravery, wisdom, ingenuity, and unselfishness). Along the way, a major part of the book takes place in Bilbo's legendary meeting with Gollum, a peculiar underground creature who calls himself \\"My Precious\\". Here Bilbo picks up a magic ring that gives the wearer the power of invisibility. Now, to fully understand the curiousness of a hobbit going on an adventure, you may want to know details about them. Hobbits are half the height of humans, love to eat, dress in bright colors such as green and yellow, live in holes in the ground, and hate adventures or anything that is unpredictable. The Tooks are an exception to this, and are the unpopular relations of the Bagginses. This is why Bilbo has his \\"Tookish\\" side. Another amazing part is Bilbo's memorable confrontation with Smaug. I would recommend this book for all ages. As this was also the intended age, since J.R.R. Tolkien wrote this book for his children (unlike the darker, yet still fabulous Lord of the Rings). And many other children will probably also enjoy this book. Lastly, I have to say that my soft cover edition of The Hobbit has lasted four years, an amazing feat for a soft cover book."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Normally this wouldn't have made my reading list... J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit: or There and Back Again. I was well aware of Tolkien's books, but I wrote them off because \\"I don't do fantasy.\\" Elfs, dwarfs, hobbits... just not my thing. But I'm also a techno-geek, and as such the Lord of the Rings books and movies are required in order to maintain your geek cred membership card. I 'fessed up on Twitter that I hadn't read any of them, and immediately was pilloried by my peers... Then I was subjected to the debate as to whether Hobbit or LOTR should be read first. My peers even went so far as to send me BOTH of them via mail (thank you, ladies). Since I had both at the same time, I decided to start with Hobbit.Having explained the backstory as to *why* I read this, the question becomes did I enjoy this. And the answer is yes, I enjoyed it very much. Bilbo Baggins was quite human in his personality, and I could relate to his struggle between wanting to be left alone vs. living up to the expectations that others had of him. Watching him go from a timid hobbit afraid to do much of anything to a leader able to stand up to anything others could throw at him was something you could definitely learn from. And of course, his traveling companions mirrored much of society... totally behind you when you have something they want, but also ready to throw you under the bus moments later if fortunes turn.My friends didn't tell me until after I was done that this is technically considered a \\"children's\\" book. Could have fooled me. :) I enjoyed it, and it was probably the best way to get my mind wrapped around the LOTR concepts and imagery (since it's not a normal genre for me).

He said that when he was growing up, \\"The Hobbit\\" was one of his favorite books, so I decided to give it a try. It was worth it.What I truly like about the book is that there is almost always something going on. You never find yourself bored with it or wishing that the characters would be more exciting. I could not find a truly dull moment in the book. I love Bilbo's evolution as a character throughout the story. I don't think that I found anything that I didn't like about this book.If I had to recommend this book to someone, it would be to anyone who enjoys a true adventure. There are times in the book that you get sucked into the adventure and don't want to put the book down.

Every single book I have read since first discovering The Hobbit has been compared to this one. Rather than bore you with all the things I love about this book and it's companions (The Lord of the Rings), I will just note what distinguishes this book for me: the denouement, the &#34;after story.&#34; Every adventure changes us, and Tolkien lets us know exactly how the adventure changes the life and spirit of his characters. Enough said, I have read the book in hardback, and tattered paperback and have listened to it on audiotape, cd and recently MP3 (Rob Ingliss does a fine job bringing Middle Earth alive for me).

I began reading the Hobbitt and the Trilogy later, when i was around 14, and even today i get different things out of each reading. Although the book appeals to children, it is not simply a children's story and the information contained inside is essential to understanding the Trilogy, both the books and recent films.Beware: this is no frolic in the woods with friends. The subject matter is violent, frightening, and even sinister. I'm not just talking about the encounters with giant spiders and cruel goblins. Here are some of the themes:The greed of the Dwarfs. If you think they came to kill Smaug so that Lake Town could be free from tyranny, think again. They were there to get revenge and riches, pure and simple, and it led to much more violence.Bilbo's job title. He's called a what? THIEF. He is brought along because these dwarves need an experienced burglar to help them procure necessities on their journey. Bilbo is far from it when he leaves the Shire, but becomes much better at it along the way -- aided by the ring, of course. The shrieking cries of Gollum attest to that when Bilbo escapes the mountains (\\"Thief! Baggins! We hates it forever!\\"). Once endowed with the ring, which we later discover is pure evil, his thievery increases exponentially. Of course, he steals from the Elves to feed himself, but what *need* did he have of the Arkenstone?The twisted evil of Gollum. Here's a character whose full villainy can't even be extracted from \\"The Hobbitt.\\" Taken in context with his role in the Trilogy, he is a demented and pitiful being who is murderous, treacherous, and mono-maniacal. We've all met Gollum face to face in our lives.The arrogance of the Elves. Yes, they're beautiful people, and yes, they are \\"good,\\" but their high-mindedness and bigotry towards dwarves and men is rampant through all four books. They're holed-up in their forest hideout because they are so mistrustful of everyone else. They are isolationists without repentance, because they only see themselves as good, and all others as inferior.The spectre of life's Orcs, Trolls, and Spiders. The world is, and has always been, full of dangers. These are presented plainly in the \\"bad\\" characters, but also more subtly in those characters deemed \\"good.\\" Bilbo experiences the worst behaviour from nearly everyone he encounters, except Gandalf, who only abandons him to look after greater matters. Even Beorn, who houses the company and delivers victory in battle, is deadly and fearful. Bilbo is ridiculed for being a peacemaker, driven away in anger by his \\"friends\\" the dwarves, considered useless by men and elves, is seen merely as food for Gollum, the Trolls, and the Spiders, and faces death numerous times. His travels, like our own lives, are full of peril and rife with unpleasantness, even from those we love or admire.Bilbo's journey is not a happy one. Through it all, he remains mostly his cheery self, though he becomes tinged with cynicism from his experience (note his response to the thrush). In other words, he grows up. We can all relate to what he goes through.It's a much more sophisticated and complex book than most people will give credit for, yet is so well-written and timeless as to have the broadest appeal. There is no \\"type\\" to which this book would appeal, if read with discerning and open minds. One of the BEST pieces of fictional literature EVER. Pure Gold."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"When I read this book for the first time, I didn't get it. But the second time, I loved it.

Bilbo Baggins, the main character, along with 12 dwarves and Gandalf, a powerful wizard, as his companions must make the dangerous and peril filled journey to the lair of Smaug, the terror of an entire countryside!This book is a must read for anyone with a love for exceptionally written literature. Tolkiens descriptive language makes you feel that if you could meet the characters, you would be able to sit and talk as if you knew them.

The font is larger than is commonly used today, as is to be expected from a children's book. It would be easily read by young and old alike. The text is distanced from the edge of the pages somewhat by about an inch and a half which makes reading a bit awkward at times but is otherwise merely a matter of style. As for giving this as a gift I would recommend it to those that are probably over age 10, and with caution at that, as a younger sibling might take revenge on the older by destroying the book, which is rather nice. Preferably it would delight the heart of an older Tolkien fan, a teenager or older, One who would appreciate what it is.

Its violence and general scariness level is about the same as most traditional fairy tales, making it suitable for most children although decidedly unsuitable for kids who get nightmares easily (I was one of those myself - \\"Hansel and Gretel\\" absolutely freaked me out). Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit who lives contentedly in a very comfortable hobbit hole, welcomes first a wizard named Gandalf and then a band of noisy, hungry, demanding dwarves into his home.

He'd prefer to stay in his clean hobbit-hole all day and night instead of going outside to the Hill. He dressed well, was fairly smart, and didn't mind company, but prefered his home to himself.Then, one day, an unexpected party forms in Bilbo's home. It included 13 dwarves and one wizard-Thorin Oakenshield, the leader, Balin, Dwalin, Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, Fili, and Kili, and the wise wizard Gandalf. They had a merry feast, Bilbo still quite confused about the whole predicament, and began to sing in one of the many rooms of Bilbo's hobbit-hole. Bilbo was then given the shocking news that he would go on the dwarves' treacherous trek to the Desolation of Smaug as their burglar. Bilbo, being the respectable hobit he is, had never done any thieving, but Gandalf said he would satisfy them. They battled first the goblins going across the Misty Mountains, Gandalf saving all of them but Bilbo from the goblins' clubs and weapons. Bilbo had fallen, and in their rush, they had forgotten all about the little hobbit. When he regained conciousness, he stumbled around in the darkness until he tripped over something-a ring. He put the ring in his pocket and continued to stumble down the damp cave. His feet touched the edge of an underground lake later, and met a strange character by the name of Gollum. Gollum lost a riddle game to Bilbo, then realized that his \\"magic ring\\" had gone missing. Bilbo put on the ring in his pocket, and descovered that he became invisible when he wore the ring. Gollum began searching around the cave, leading Bilbo unknowingly to the exit of the cave. Bilbo escaped and met up with the dwarves and Gandalf, and they continued into the forest-until they met up with a wolf pack! They nearly didn't escape. After that little adventure, they quickly visited Beorn, a bear of a man, then traveled into Mirkwood-then taken captive by giant spiders! Again they escaped, and were taken captive again by the elvenking, and escaped there by floating down the river by barrels. After visiting Lake Town, they traveled onto the Lonely Mountain-the Desolation of Smaug. Later, Smaug is killed, and the treasure that was sought for so long was divided between the remaining-everyone but Thorin, Fili, and Kili-after the Battle of Five Armies. In the end, Bilbo returns to his little hobbit-hole, suddenly taking a liking to poetry.The main conflict is that Bilbo and Thorin and Co. are searching for Smaug's stolen treasure, and encounter many problems along the way. The resolution? They work together. They may fight along the way, but they get out alive.I guess the theme of the story could be that if you work together and think things through, you can get through anything.I reccomend this book to anyone who loves fantasy, sci fi, and adventure!It really is an enchanting tale, and I can't wait to continue the Lord of the Rings!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"If you liked Lord of the Ring's and want to know more about what happened befor Frodo then this is Well Worth a Read."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"When I was ten years old I was introduced to the world of Middle-Earth by an older friend. I had to struggle through the section of the book that describes hobbits and their habits, but the story that followed made the struggle worthwhile. Every lover of fantasy owes a great debt to Tolkien -- his success, both literary and commercial, made the fantasy genre viable. If this story seems too familiar it is only because every fantasy writer since &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was published in 1937 has drawn from the well of Tolkien's creativity and imagination. Now my son is ten years old and I am a proud father to be sharing this timeless classic with him. Like many other readers I preferred the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy, but reading this book first enables the reader to truly mine the depths of the masterpiece that follows. Brian Jacques and Piers Anthony have learned well at the foot of this master, and if you enjoy their work you need to go back to the beginning with &quot;The Hobbit.&quot; While it is clearly a children's book, the depth of meaning contained within &quot;The Hobbit&quot; spans all ages.

Now, the reader of this might be questioning the validity of this statement, however, in every case a new \\"empire\\" rises to introduce something so revolutionary that it shakes the foundation of the Planet itself. Understandably, overthrowing tyranny, introducing governments for the people, and building understanding for all that is good in the face of evil mark monumental events in history. Unlike previously mentioned events, The Hobbit is the first book to use fantasy to capture interest in the struggle to overcome pure evil from an underdog. The Hobbit is the world's first view at a self-help book that uses a magical world created by J.R.R.

A Hobbit is a small person, only about three to four feet in height, with a taste for beer and food, a life without adventure, and normality. Bilbo Baggins represents the boring life of a Hobbit, constantly in uniform behavior with which he is expected to partake in. However, surrounding the land of the Shire, home to Hobbits, lies an immense world filled with goblins, trolls, dwarves, elves, dragons, and other fantastic creatures eager to be explored. Bilbo Baggins is the book's main character and symbol for taking on the unordinary and challenges contemporary theology. Living in Hobbiton, there are key differences between men and Hobbits, all of which Bilbo represents. Hobbits are only about half the size of regular humans, have hairy feet because they do not wear shoes, and are foremost opposed to taking up adventures, much rather preferring to Garden or drink tea. Bilbo's quest into adventure begins with the introduction of Gandalf, the Grey Wizard, and 13 dwarves in search of a \`burglar' to accompany them on a mission to hunt out the marauding dragon Smaug, who took their gold and hordes it on Lonely Mountain. Surprised to find himself involved in such a quest, unbecoming of a Hobbit, Bilbo accepts the introduction to the \`unexpected party' and heads out of his comfort to the land of Middle Earth.While on his quest, Bilbo learns about relying on others, himself, and bravery. Bilbo partakes in fighting goblins, tricking trolls, riding upon eagles, and saving his entire band from killer, giant spiders. The themes of the novel and motifs are not very well exhibited, except through Bilbo's narration and the chapter titles, such as \\"out of the frying pan, into the fire\\". Through the chapter titles, and Bilbo's personal queries into fighting off creatures unknown in his homeland, the Shire, Bilbo learns the most about himself and displays the book's message: if faced with adversity and doubt, anyone can do anything if they just try and push through the comfort boundaries. Overall, The Hobbit is a wonderful book because it introduces things children and adults can come to enjoy in fantasy, with real world, mature lessons about life that connect to a broad range of readers. Like the Magna Carta, Declaration of Independence, and Roman Empire, The Hobbit teaches its followers to rise up against the tyranny of doubt and fight for anything previously linked to doubt, a true historical masterpiece of the human spirit and escape to a world of Fantasy.BY SEAN CAMPERSON (NOT CYNDIE CAMPERSON)"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"There are several important facts to remember in history: the first being the signing of the Magna Carta, the first movement towards democracy; the second is the rise and fall of the Roman Empire; the third is the Declaration of Independence in 1776; and lastly is the creation of The Hobbit. Now, the reader of this might be questioning the validity of this statement, however, in every case a new \\"empire\\" rises to introduce something so revolutionary that it shakes the foundation of the Planet itself. Understandably, overthrowing tyranny, introducing governments for the people, and building understanding for all that is good in the face of evil mark monumental events in history. Unlike previously mentioned events, The Hobbit is the first book to use fantasy to capture interest in the struggle to overcome pure evil from an underdog.

Our protagonist, Bilbo Baggins, finds himself drafted most unwillingly into the role of burgler for a band of dwarves who seek to reclaim the treasure stolen from their ancestors by the dragon Smaug. But before they can accomplish this goal, they must survive the journey to the Lonely Mountain, where Smaug dwells. The trip is long and dangeous, and Bilbo proves his worth along the way.While this book doesn't have the deep and powerful themes of the subsequent trilogy, it still provides a cautionary story about the dangers of greed, and of unintended consequences. Bilbo's companions allow their greed to cloud their judgement (as it does many others along the way), and while they only intended to reclaim what they considered rightfully theirs, their actions provoke the dragon into attacking a nearby town, with potentially disasterous consequences. Only the arrival of a common foe prevents these natural allies from fighting among themselves.An enjoyable fantasy tale, with a simple message, this story is still a classic because it sets the stage for the powerful battle between good and evil in the Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien is a great book \\"you read before bed\\". I would recommend this for ages 10+. You could also say that there are three different climaxes, in the beginning, middle, and end, so this is a long, detailed book. The plot is detailed and is a classic example of fantasy literature. The book starts at the house of Bilbo Bagins, which is in a place where houses are built in hills and the people are very short or hobbits. His peaceful life is shattered by a party of dwarves and a wizard who takes Bilbo on a adventure through the Misty Mountains: with cold winters and hordes of evil goblins, Mirkwood: a forest where giant spiders and bloodthirsty elves live, and last, the Lonely Mountain, where a great treasure is guarded by the dangerous dragon, Smaug. Soon a series of events lead to the ultimate treasure hunt for an unsuspecting Bilbo Bagins. But as interesting as the settings are, it is the characters that bring the reader inside the story.One of the main characters is Bilbo Bagins. Bilbo is short so he is shy and wants to look big at times, yet he is shy in most other scenes. Gandalf is the wizard of the party and is the wisest. He saves the party many times and is a great negotiator. Thorin and the many other dwarves are the others in the party. They are seen as a bit short, fat, but strong warriors. Thorin and the other dwarves love the adventure and each one has unique traits that give the story a variety. Many of these characters bring the reader inside the story, and combined with the setting makes The Hobbit a classic fantasy.All in the fun, classic fantasy book \\"you read before bed\\" The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This is a great book, that everyone should read.

A prequel to \\"Lord of the Rings\\" (which I have already read), \\"The Hobbit\\" provides a much lighter tone than his more famous epic trilogy, but also provides the same wonder and excitement. \\"The Hobbit\\" may be more of a children's novel, but it sets the stage for his more ambitious Middle Earth trilogy, and is anything but childish in its storytelling.\\"The Hobbit\\" is a great introduction to Tolkien's Middle Earth and the rich tapestry of legends and songs that imbue a sense of aura to his world. Tolkien knows how to pique the imagination, and his vivid descriptions of dragons, elves, goblins, and the like let the reader's imagination run wild. Yes, this may be geared toward children, but any adult will thoroughly enjoy this reading as well.Perhaps Tolkien's most important lesson is that it does not take a strong, valiant warrior to become a hero. Indeed, Bilbo is the antitheses of a typical hero, being small of stature, pudgy, and reluctant to explore the world. Yet, when all the chips are down, it is this brave little hobbit who turns the epic quest of ancient treasure from mere certain death to an opportunity for success. Sure, he didn't single-handedly deliver the goods or slay the dragon, but he provided an instrumental part to their success, a success that seemed nearly impossible at the onset.Tolkien also warns about the effect of money and greed. As the dwarves (with Bilbo's aforementioned help) are ready to claim the spoils of their victory, their intense longing for treasure turns into unabashed greed. Indeed, if not for an outside event, this greed would have caused them to war against their allies. Even Bilbo is tempted by the treasures and outright steals a priceless jewel. It seems that no one is immune to the allure of treasure and gold.Overall, this is a great introduction to Tolkien's work.

I've only heard him on the audio productions of Tolken's 4 books, and wouldn't mind hearing his other stuff.The Royal Shakespearean actors are well represented by Ingliss. He has a different voice for each character, and the voices aren't too hard to distinguish from each other, which is no mean feat for a single person. (kind of reminds me of Mel Blanc (Looney Tunes, Bugs Bunny & gang) in this regard).If you loved the Hobbit, you'll love this book on CD.Just don't make the mistake of setting your PC or CDPlayer to \\"Random\\", or you'll be just as confused as my new-to-Tolkien friend was when he first heard it."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Since about 1500 other people have written summaries of this book, I'll skip it.

On their quest to restore the dwarves wealth and pride; Bilbo, Gandalf, and the 13 Dwarves encounter numerous challenges of both the emotional and physical nature. Bilbo's revelation from a timid, do-gooder hobbit to a daring thief is the most exciting transformation experienced.

They travel far across Middle Earth in this dangerous journey but before they can defeat the dragon, they must overcome trolls, wolves, orcs, and some of the most wicked creatures imaginable. They often need the powerful wizard, Gandalf, for protection though sometimes he cannot help them and they must overcome these grave dangers themselves. The Hobbit is one of my all time favorite books. If you like The Lord of the Rings, then you will love this book. If you've never read The Lord of the Rings this is a great novel to enter the enchanting world of J.R.R. Tolkien. J.R.R. Tolkien is a writing genius, no other author can compare. No one can create a fantasy world like J.R.R. Tolkien can. He creates the Middle Earth, a land laden in fantasy, full of Elves, Wizards, Hobbits, Dwarves, Men and so much more. In this novel the magic comes alive and assists in the classic story of good versus evil. Yet the novel has a human aspect one that we can relate to as mere mortals such as dwarves, hobbits and men conquer evil. This is a timeless novel that will always be considered a classic.

The story begins at his cozy, quiet home in Bag End; where he is invited to join 13 dwarves and a wizard, Gandalf, on quest. He is supposed to be the thief in their master plan. Along the way, Bilbo obtains a ring which turns the wearer invisible. He uses the ring many times to save the group from danger. Eventually they end up at their destination, Lonely Mountain, where a dragon guards Thorin's treasure. After the dragon dies, the people of a nearby town come to claim their share of the treasure, but Thorin refuses and locks them out. So the humans and elves besiege the mountain. Then goblins arrive and everyone joins to defeat the goblins.This is my favorite book that I have read so far. It took my imagination through a great adventure of magic and monsters. I liked it because I am a fairly big Dungeons & Dragons fan. Although I have never played the board game, I have played similar games since I was five. Though the games I play have come along way since then, it's the same concept.If you're the type of person that is fascinated by adventures, especially with magical creatures, objects, and places, this book has them. Maybe you enjoy Role Playing Games, or maybe you have just seen The Lord of the Rings trilogy on DVD, then this is defiantly a good book for you. It's also a fairly easy read; any person from an eleven year old kid to a middle-aged adult would enjoy this book very much.

But you know, as I sit here, I cannot think of much to add to what's already been written. I mean...if someone has already read The Hobbit, then she's already got an opinion. And if someone hasn't yet had the honor of being among those who have journeyed along with Bilbo through Middle Earth, then odds are she's been exposed to enough \\"Hobbit 101\\" background information on this famous subject to the point where anything I say is merely added noise. And if by some rare chance a person who has neither read The Hobbit nor knows details of it should locate this review, then is it really fair of me to say anything at all to influence how this potential reader might feel, or alter what he or she might know? Funny, but I've never felt this hesitation about any other work, and perhaps that says something unexpected about the sacredness of this book to me even now, a dozen years after I first spent a wonderful Saturday in June 1993 reading it. Maybe writing this review has been more of a voyage of discovery about myself and my regard for J.R.R. Tolkien, that right-wing, nature loving Oxford professor, whose life's work made him an icon among those of the political left. So let me end here by saying this: The Hobbit is a work of wondrous scope that was huge to me at one time in my life, is still of more importance than I knew a moment ago, and if you are about to read it for the first time or the thousandth, I hope you enjoy it as much as I always have."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"'The Hobbit: Or There and Back Again' is a wonderful book by author J.R.R.

As is well known the book was written for children, because of this alot of people try to insult the writers style. Like I said, they just don't understand. That is what attracts me to the book. The drifting, whimsical style that makes you feel like a child every time you read it. Some of the other reviews said that it was poorly written, that could not be farther from the truth.

My favorite part was the part where Bilbo challenges Gollum to a riddle game. The two had a deal. If Gollum won, Bilbo was lunch, but if Bilbo won, Gollum had to show him the way out of the gobin's layer. Bilbo won and then Gollum got mad. Gollum went a way to find his ring that could make one invisible. He was planning to surprise Bilbo and when Bilbo finally sees Gollum, it would be too late for Bilbo. But Gollum couldn't find it! Bilbo had it. He found out when he put the ring on and Gollum ran past him, trying to find his ring. Then Gollum sat down, whimpering the most horrible sound, whining the instructions to get out of the cave because he thought Bilbo already knew and Bilbo just wanted to get his ring. Bilbo followed Gollum's instructions and rode on Gollum's boat ( Gollum was rowing his boat to the entrance so he could find out if Bilbo had escaped.) The only problem with doing this was that Gollum wouldn't dare go near the goblins, though he sometimes ate them, but only with his ring on, so Bilbo had to jump. Unfortunatly, Gollum either heard or smelt him just when he was jumping. Gollum grabbed for Bilbo but missed. Bilbo finally got to the entrance but to his mishap, it was guarded by goblins. Fortunatly, Bilbo had the ring so he just walked past the goblins. Then the scariest part happens. The ring fails Bilbo and the goblins sees him. Luckily, he got out and returned to his friends. The reason why I like this part is because it makes you keep on reading and it is hair-raising. I could go on, babbling about the rest of the story but I can't because of the maximum of words.

Tolkien first scribbed down the opening line of this book on an extra sheet of paper.And years before \\"Lord of the Rings\\" was seen by anyone outside Tolkien's circle, Middle Earth was first introduced to readers. \\"The Hobbit\\" is simpler and less epic than the trilogy that followed it, but Tolkien's brilliant writing, magical world and pleasantly stodgy hero bring a special life to this early fantasy classic. And with the first \\"Hobbit\\" movie coming out in a few months, it deserves revisiting.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life, in a luxurious hobbit hole under a hill (\\"it was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\"). He's the picture of dull respectability.But his life is turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield. They want to reclaim the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar, even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life.So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. The quirky little band ends up battling goblins and spiders, nearly getting eaten, and imprisoned by Elves, while Bilbo finds himself in possession of a magic Ring from the treacherous Gollum. But even with a magic Ring, can he defeat a monstrous dragon and win a war against multiple enemies?Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and ancient Men for years before he ever came up with Bilbo's quest. But it's fortunately that he did, because while \\"The Hobbit\\" is overshadowed by the epic sweep of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and the \\"Silmarillion,\\" it's still an entertaining story that lays the groundwork for his more famous works -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.Tolkien's writing is swift, light and full of songs and poetry-laden descriptions, such as interludes in the shimmering, ethereal Rivendell and the cold, terrible Lonely Mountain. The pace in this is much faster than in most of his other works -- not surprising, when you consider it was originally a bedtime story for his children.Most of the book's action is about Bilbo trying to keep himself and the dwarves from getting eaten, torn apart, or rotting in elf dungeons, but with some quiet interludes like a night at Beorn's mountain home. And the last chapters hint at the epic majesty that Tolkien was capable of, as well as the idea that even little people -- like a mild-mannered hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.This book also first came up with hobbits -- the peaceful fuzzy-footed countryfolk -- in the form of Bilbo Baggins. He's a likable little guy, if the last person you'd ever expect to be a hero -- initially he seems weak and kind of boring, but his hidden strengths and wits come up to the surface when he needs to. By the end, he's almost a different person.The dwarves are more comical, and the elves more whimsical in this book, but the supporting characters are still impressive -- the crotchety, mysterious wizard Gandalf, the dignified, flawed Dwarf king Thorin Oakenshield, and a Guardsman who becomes a king. Even minor characters like Beorn, Elrond and the menacing Smaug are given plenty of dimension.\\"The Hobbit\\" started as a fluke, grew into a bedtime story, and became one of the best fantasy stories in literary history -- a charming adventure in the time that never was.

Surprisingly, it was much simpler than I remember, or at least its prose has a simpler, much more folksy writing style than I recalled, and was certainly breezier than the denser pre-LOTR works (the Silmarillion, and so on). Nevertheless, the book is a lovely entryway to Tolkien and his Middle Earth, offering plenty of marvelous characters and lots of adventure.All the usual suspects are here as a precursor to Lord of the Rings: elves, dwarves, goblins, trolls, wargs, enormous eagles, dragons (very interested to see what Mr. Cumberbatch does with Smaug in the film version), and of course the timeless Gollum. The book is a much smaller companion piece to each book of the later trilogy (it weighs in at around 250 pgs usually). All in all an epic tale for a lovely and mystical evening of reading."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This is not the first time I have read The Hobbit but it's exciting to have it on Kindle.

September. Part of my grade in my English class was to come up with ten words out of our current books, write them down, and define them. We would then hand these words (with their definitions) into our teacher. There was a probelm, though. The Hobbit contained maybe one word that I wasn't exactly sure of in the whole book. This resulted in a bunch of failing marks in my English class.The Hobbit just &lt;i&gt;flows&lt;/i&gt;. That's really the best way to describe it. A third grader could read this, and yet an 11th grader is set to read it again. I read the Lord of the Rings trilosy, and while that was good, it was much harder to read.

It takes place in the underground world of Trolls, Elves. Goblins and Dragons. Its about a hobbit named Bilbo. Hobbits are fat fuzzy creatures with long toes and fingers. He meets a lot of elves and they have to go steal back gold from a cave guarded by a dragon. I recommend this book because it is funny and the dialogue is great. The humor of the book is fantastic. For example in a cave two creatures start telling riddles and people will laugh and love it. I loved this funny and incredible book. Other people might say this book is terrible and dialogue free but it thinks it's magical. The Hobbit is a dialogue filled book but people sometimes don't understand. S0 READ CAREFULLY AND ENJOY...

Tolkien, should be made into a movie and in the hopes that you would be willing to direct it.Mr. Spielberg, it came to my attention some time ago that the story The Hobbit should be remade into a feature film and although I know that you probably have an extremely busy schedule it would be a great honor if you would see about directing my movie. As you may already know, The Hobbit has already been made into a movie and that the movie The Lord of the Rings is already in the makings, I still wish to have a remade and revamped version of the story, preferably using live action rather than animation. I feel that the adventurous story of a hobbit as he and his friends make their way to a dragon's lair, in order to slay him, would make for a wonderful movie. There are many fantasy adventure fans out there just waiting for another movie based on this popular book. This story has all the makings for a great movie: a likable and funny main character, a old and wise father figure, a multitude of helpful friends, and the freedom of creativity that only a fantasy story can give. The basic structure of a good lesson, namely the advancement from complacency and boredom to adventure and mystery, and the combination of action packed adventure could possibly even make The Hobbit a better seller even than E.T.The wonderful tale of an adventurous hobbit, of the new friends he makes and their struggle to take back their home should make for a superb movie. Along with the possibility of several sequels if this first movie works out there are the endless possibilities for creativity and ingenuity on the part of the director. Thanks to the advancements in visual arts and computer graphics it is now possible to create the vivid and vibrant universe that was originally created by J.R.R. Tolkien in his wonderful story. My only hope is that you will accept my proposal for a movie based on The Hobbit and that you might be able to direct it yourself or at least pass it on to someone with as much vision as yourself. I thank you for taking the time to read my request and I hope you consider the opportunities available for success."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"POSSIBLY THE BEST BOOK OF ALL TIME, AND IT'S ONLY IN 300 PAGES!

The plot is also incredibly boring, and unbelievable (i know, i know... it is fantasy), but we can't blame Tolkein for that, seeing as he was one of the first fantasy writers. For the more experienced fantasy/sci-fi reader out there i suggest Orson Scott Card, Samuel Delany, William Gibson, and Ursula Le Guin.

Since Peter Jackson chose to stretch one small children's book into 3 long movies it turns out you can easily read the book chapters covered by the movie faster than you can watch the movie, and reading the whole book only takes a few hours.As a children's book I think it is pretty damn good. You can see Tolkien building up ideas for Lord of the Rings: the easily-killed but numerous spiders are the building blocks for the much more sinister and powerful Shelob, the swords taken from the trolls were very reminiscent of the swords acquired from the Barrow-wight and used to kill the Nazgul, and the Battle of Five Armies is a smaller scale template for the epic battle of Helm's Deep.On a less positive note, I found the foreshadowing fairly annoying, and I'm not sure why it is there. Maybe Tolkien thought kids needed to be reassured that everything was going to work out in the end, or needed all the dots explicitly connected?&#34;...which shows he was a wise elf and wiser than the men of the town, though not quite right, as we shall see in the end....And the knotted ropes are too slender for my weight. Luckily for him that was not true, as you will see.&#34;Great children's book, and I'm going to score it as such, I certainly loved it as a kid.4 stars.

Personally, I've never been quite sure why a single book would be in a box, but I suppose it does protect the lovely gold embossed cover with Tolkein's runes all over it. The full page color reproductions of Tolkien's watercolor illustrations also really added to the quality of this edition of the book. Some of them are very pretty, and were not present in my smaller copy of The Hobbit. This is definietly the collector's edition, not the small portable copy to read in waiting rooms.It had been a while since I had read The Hobbit, so it was nice to refresh my memory of the story before seeing the movie. It has a little introduction in the beginning, which may have originally come from the Lord of the Rings, explaining dwarves and that orc and goblin are interchangable terms. I would say this edition is well worth the cost for an enthusiast willing to wait for it to come out of backorder. If you haven't read The Hobbit before, you should, whether you buy this or another copy, but be warned: there is a lot of singing and other poetry.

Each time I have read it I haven't tired of Tolkein's marvelous storytelling abilities and the depth and staying power that this tale has.Called &quot;The Enchanting Prelude to the Lord of the Rings,&quot; one might come away with the erroneous perception that &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is a preface of sorts that can be easily skipped. Frankly I don't know how anyone who has not read this book could fully appreciate any part of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; either in print or on the big screen.&quot;The Hobbit&quot; is the story of THE Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins. Yes, Frodo's adventures are literarily noteworthy but do not exceed in any sense the heroic adventures of Bilbo. The book also introduces readers to the dwarves who are the precursors of Gimli. In fact the tomb discovered by the Fellowship in Moria is that of Balin, one of the dwarves introduced in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and one of Bilbo's favorites.This book also gives us our introduction to Gandalf, the wandering wizard, and to Gollum, the hapless possessor and slave of the great Ring of Power, along with a wonderful cadre of other enchanting characters.If you haven't read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; but have enjoyed &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, &quot;The Two Towers&quot; and/or &quot;The Return of the King&quot; either in print or on film it's not too late. &quot;The Hobbit&quot; will fill in many of the blanks that inevitably arise when starting with Tolkein's trilogy.Once you've read it please join with the rest of us Hobbitophiles in screaming bloody murder until Peter Jackson consents to bring this one to film.Douglas McAllister"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"&quot;The Hobbit or There and Back Again&quot; is the first story of Middle-Earth that was ever read by the masses, and it remains a beloved favorite due to Tolkien's exceptional writing, lovable characters, and the fantastic, complicated world with its unlikely hero, a tiny fuzzy-footed hobbit.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life in the Shire, in a luxurious hole under a hill. (&quot;It was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort&quot;) His life is completely turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. The dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield, want to regain the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug, who drove out the dwarves long ago. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar.So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable adventure. Bilbo and the Dwarves battle goblins and spiders, are nearly eaten twice, are captured and Bilbo is forced to riddle with the treacherous, withered Gollum. But even after these obstacles, the dragon Smaug is still in the Lonely Mountain, and Bilbo is not entirely sure what to do...Author J.R.R. Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and Men for years before writing &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; but &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is the first story that people had the opportunity to read. It began as a line scrawled on a sheet of blank paper, and then into a bedtime story for his children. And even though it's overshadowed by &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;Silmarillion,&quot; this book is an essential link. It's definitely sillier and lighter, but it provides the springboard for a lot of the stuff in &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.The concept of hobbits started in this book -- the quintessential peaceful &quot;wee&quot; people, based on British countryfolk, with simple pleasures and unexpected depths of strength and resourcefulness. And, of course, fuzz on their large feet. Tolkien's Elves are a little more ethereal and less dignified, and his dwarves are a bit more comical and less grim. But Elrond hints at the full majesty of the Elves, and Thorin Oakenshield is still the most dignified, proud and impressively flawed dwarf there is. The last chapters of the book hint at the epic majesty of &quot;Lord of the Rings,&quot; and some of the same victory/loss themes. And of course, the idea that even little people -- like a hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.Tolkien's writing is quick and light, while providing sufficient detail to let you picture what's going on. The dialogue is less influenced by Old English, and the pace is a lot faster (not surprising, since it was originally read to his kids before bedtime). Bilbo is a likable little guy -- he seems to be the last person whom you'd expect to be a courageous hero, but he shows incredibly strength and smarts when he's under pressure. Supporting characters like Thorin, Bard the Guardsman-turned-King, the king of the wood-elves, and even Smaug himself are never cookie-cutter, but multidimensional and immensely interesting to read about.&quot;The Hobbit&quot; was written for children, but adults can appreciate and enjoy it just as much. So read this book, then scoop up &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and continue reading. A timeless treasure and classic."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This book was a gift from a family friend who knew of my passion for reading (as a 9yr old kid).

Finally, one day I decided to give it a chance and to my surprise I couldn't put it down! I finished the book in a day and in the following 3 weeks devoured the entire Lord of the Rings series which had also been sitting on my bookshelf for years. I have never been a fantasy fan, and still don't consider myself one... which just goes to show how excellent an author J.R.R. Tolkien is to have captured my imagination. The Hobbit is altogether a most charming read, filled with endless moments of adventure, humour and suspense. It is hard not to fall in love with the characters and the fantasy.

Reminiscent of the radio dramas of the 1940's and 50's, these productions were usually aired on Sunday afternoons, when a family could listen and enjoy the week's story. Released on Jabberwocky Audio on cassette tapes, I remember the Christmas when I received the entire collection of Jabberwocky's stories on tape. From &quot;The Hobbit&quot; to &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; to &quot;The Red Badge of Courage,&quot; all were classic tales. They even re-released on cassette some of the original radio productions, such as &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; and &quot;The Gift of the Magi.&quot; These stories were designed to get the listener interested and promote reading the books the productions were based on. They were not designed for an adult audience, but rather for children and families to share. Wonderfully edited and masterfully performed, many modern audiences find these old productions a little silly or even perhaps dated, but play it for a child, and they will listen in rapture, just as I did 25 years ago when they were new. Of all my collection of the Jabberwocky tapes, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; are the only ones that I have trouble playing today, because they have been played so many times over the years that they are worn out. We would play them in the car on road trips, I would play them in my room while putting together a puzzle, and I played them for my friends, who enjoyed them as much as I did. I am delighted to have it on CD to listen to over and over again. At seven years of age, I had not yet read the books when I first listened to the tapes. But the tapes were perfect for a small girl just getting interested in reading. If only all the rest of the old radio dramas were also on CD! I would buy them all. It was unfortunate to come to this website and see the poor reviews written by people who have no understanding of the history of the production or what demographic it was originally intended for. I look forward to the day when I can play these CD's for my own children and see the wonder and delight in their faces when they hear the same stories that I grew up with."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I first fell in love with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings in 6th grade.

But, it is most certainly small and light weight enough to fit comfortably into my rucksack back pack and go with me wherever I go, which was the whole point of getting this so I'm very pleased with it, especially for the price. This is far superior to any previous paperback print of this book. The imitation leather cover is awesome as well."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"\\"The Annotated Hobbit\\" stands as the definitive edition to Tolkien's classic work. Douglas Anderson works from a simple premise - start with the final intent of Tolkien as can be reasonably determined and issue that as the main text, and then provide textual commentary, noting changes from previously published editions of the book, discuss possible sources and allusions, and frame characters, settings, and plot events in the context of Middle-earth and Arda at large.The book itself is a large, coffee table type book, featuring Tolkine's painting of Smaug set against the \\"Mirkwood\\" painting. Tolkien originally modelled the painting after a previous work, a color drawing, illustrating the elf Belg meetign Flindor (later renamed Gwindor) in the forest of Taur-na-Fuin. This watercoloured was first published in \\"Artist\\", No 54, and also appeared in the Tolkien Calndear 1974 under the title 1973. The back of the cover includes Tolkien's original description of \\"The Hobbit\\" from the original 1937 British edition.This edition contains Douglas Anderson's acknowledgements and thanks, Tolkien's \\"Preface to the Second Edition\\" and Anderson's extensive introduction to the book, and then obvioulsy the main text. There are two appendices: \\"A: The Quest for Erebor\\", \\"B: The Runes\\", then the Bibliography, and the Map of Wildernland. The introduction is an extensive essay on Tolkien, featuring information biographically and frames \\"The Hobbit\\" and its development and its sources in terms of its effects on Tolkien's mythology and also his writings for his children, even alluding to \\"The Oragog\\", an unpublished, unfinished story written by Tolkien in the early 1920s about a strange creature going through remarkable landsacpes. The intro also goes into detail regarding the composition of \\"The Hobbit\\", includes a facsimile of a page from one of the original manuscripts, and goes through the processes that led to the publication of the book, and also gives us extensive information on the revision history of the book as well as various foreign editions.The format of the book goes like this: there is the main text aligned so that is a large amount of white space on the left side of the left page, and the right side of the right page. [, with different sections of the text unobtrusively numbered at the end of the respective sentences. Then, onnumerall ]Different sections of the text unobtrusively numbered at the end of the respective sentences, with the annotations appearing on the aforementioned white space made available. The format works wonderfully as you can read the text uninterrupted and only refer to the annotations if you so desire. Unlike the 1988 edition of \\"The Annotated Hobbit\\", the annotations are in very close proximitiy to the text under discussion, so you can easily just read the annotation by looking right next to the text and then continue, and (in most cases) not have to flip pages and then return to the spot where you left off. Due to the length of some of the annotations, some [of the textual annotations] flipping will be required, but that is the exception, not the norm.Removing the textual annotations from appendicies in the 1988 edition and incorporating them in the main body of the book greatly assists in the ease and study of \\"The Hobbit\\" that this version actively accomdates and encourages. That is the key change between the original and the revised versions of \\"The Annoated Hobbit\\" in terms of format. In terms of content, there is not a lot of change, with one very significant exception. The second edition [also] features \\"The Quest for Erebor\\".Originally slated for publication in appendices \\"The Return of the King\\", this text was removed for considerations of space from the final product. The first text published was in \\"Unfinished Tales\\". Christopher Tolkien then published an earlier version in the 1996 book \\"The Peoples of Middle-earth\\", which was unknown to Christopher at the time of the 1979 \\"Unfinished Tales\\". The \\"Unfinished Tales\\" version is Text A. Then Tolkien wrote a typescript, Text B. Tolkien then wrote short, compressed version (most likely in order to retain this material in the final book). This is the third version (Text C).The version found in \\"Unfinished Tales\\" is an amalgamation of Text C with long extracts of B appearing after it, with Christopher's extensive commentary. The text in \\"The Annotated Hobbit\\" is Text B, which has never been published in its entirety before now.Although some previous reviewers have found this strange (which too me is odd, given the nature of annotated books), Anderson represents every single revision, and the original reading the revision replaced, in the form of annotation. Although some of these revisions are trivial, there is some highly interesting content present in the revision history of \\"The Hobbit\\". Most notably is the publication of the first edition version of Chapter Six, \\"Riddles in the Dark\\", where Bilbo first encounters Gollum. The first version radically differs from the 1947 rewrite that first appeared in 1951 and has become the definitive version of the chapter ever since. In the first version Gollum freely wants to give the ring away, and apologises profusely for not having the Ring to give to Bilbo after Bilbo wins the riddle contest, and shows Bilbo the way out in recompense for not having the Ring to give to him.Other interesting textual annotations are revisions where Tolkien brings consistency between his two major Hobbit books. He brings the geography of \\"The Hobbit\\" more into line with \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" (changing \\"One afternoon thney forded the river\\" to \\"a river\\"), and most interestingly changes the original 1937 reading \\"swords of the elves that are now called Gnomes\\" to \\"swords of the High Elves of the West, my kin\\". Tolkien used Gnomes as the name for the Elves tribe of the Noldor in the 1920s and 1930s, and associated iwth the Greek work \\"thought, intelligence\\". Tolkien stated he abandoned the name, because \\"it is quite impossible to dissociate the name from the popular associations of the Paracelsan gno-mus = pygmaeus\\" (Letters, No. 239). Both examples are from Chapter 3, \\"The Last Homely House\\". There are several more examples like this, including one where Tolkien changed \\"after the sack of the mines of Moria\\" to \\"after the battle of the Mines of Moria\\", due to Tolkien's changing conception of his mythology\\".Some more interesting annotations deal with the stone giants from \\"Over Hill and Under Hill\\", which never appear anywhere else in the legendarium, and likewise the older city upon whose foundations Lake-Town was built upon, likewise never elaborated on anywhere else. Also included is a previously unpublished poem from Chapter 3.In regards to artwork and various editions, \\"The Annotated Hobbit\\" includes numerous illustrations from forien editions of the novel, sprinkled liberally through out all ninteen chapters of the book. Due to space I won't list them all, with the exception of Josef Madlener's \\"Der Berggeist\\", a painting of an old man in a long hat sitting feeding a goat. Tolkien wrote on his copy of the picture that this was the origin of Gandalf.However, here is the artwork by Tolkien present, with page and chapter listed.

The next morning, thirteen dwarves were crowding his living-room and enrolling him to steal the gold guarded under the lonely Mountain by Smaug, the last of the great dragons.So off he went, through forests old and mountains cold, deceiving trolls, solving riddles in the dark, escaping from goblins and elves, and most of the time rescuing the dwarves from the many perils he himself inadvertenly put them in, thanks to a magical ring he found in Gollum's cave, a ring that has to power to render him invisible.This was the second time I read The Hobbit, and looking at it now with the critical eye of the (amateur) reviewer, I'm afraid to admit I was somewhat annoyed at the beginning by Tolkien's paternalistic tone, by how he sometimes addresses the reader and makes references to the real world, or hints at what's coming up later in the story. This makes the book seem clearly targeted to a young audience, and indeed, The Hobbit would be perfect for reading aloud to a child. However, this tone changes in the course of the story, and especially during the final Battle of the Five Armies, where it reaches a more epic scope, more suitable for young adults.

It starts too slow, is too pensive and descriptive at times - these are features that a fan will forgive, but for an initiate, these can be motivation killers. I got my daughter hooked through the Hobbit, and her interest has endured. We're into Two Towers now. The Hobbit moves at a quick pace, and is light-hearted enough to entertain younger readers. It is utterly lacking in a romantic angle, but this is more than made up for by the themes of friendship and homely virtue.

When one talks about Tolkien \\"dilly-dallying and such\\" one is referring to his complex style of writing. Quite frankly, Tokien is not \\"less,\\" he is \\"more.\\" He demands that one pay more attention, he gives one more information. If one wishes to say that more isn't always better, then fine. The rest of us don't expect them to understand. Let me put it this way: It is like Champagne. People don't dislike Champagne, they merely don't understand it. These idiot reviewers \\"Larry\\", \\"Curly\\" and \\"Moe\\" don't prefer the taste of Champagne to 7UP, they simply can't taste it. Is it their limited capacity for intelligence? Is it upbringing? It doesn't really matter what it is, all that matters is that they can't \\"taste\\" The Hobbit. But those of us who can, can- and we love the taste. After all, we have no choice. These are people who would rather eat Aunt Jemima pancakes with fake syrup than have hot crepes rolled with fine preserves. Really, do the opinions of these people actually count? It is understood by many that an opinion is only an opinion- how untrue this is! In the legal world an opinion is something that is ruled and weighed to be best, to be most true. There _is_ such a thing as a good opinion, even the best opinion. And opinion can be right and an opinion can be wrong. I daresay that giving The Hobbit 3 stars is wrong. And why do I dare? Because if someone told us that cow manure tasted better than ice cream they would be wrong. The bottom line is this: Mozart is better than The Beetles; Ferraris are better than raced out Subarus and Ice Cream does, in fact, taste better than manure. If, like this idiot, you are a simpleton who can can neither hear, taste nor see then don't bother to post your opinions to the rest of us. Instead, take my advice and cozy yourself up with something you can understand like Harry Potter and let yourself float away to the world of un-imagination. You will be much happier and won't have to deal with the headaches of trying to figure out what Tolkien is trying to say, nor will you have to deal with the frustrations of not being able to see in full color and dimensions the Dwarves and Elves and Wizards they way that the rest of us can. I almost pity you, but then, you wasted 60 seconds of my life with degenerate reviews so on second thought, get out of my gene pool and stop breathing my air. It's people like you that make the rest of our lives so two-dimensional by preventing more work like The Hobbit from ever being created with your lack of understanding and abundance of stupidity.P.S. The Hobbit is a great book, arguably the greatest, certainly the greatest in its own league. It was written by an adult and is absolutely suitable for adults. The fact that it may also be enjoyed and understood by children is only a further credit to Tolkien's genius. Don't let the altogether too commonly found ramblings that this is a book for children discourage you from reading it if you haven't already. While not everyone is capable of enjoying it, it is criminal not to at least expose everyone to this book for anyone who is capable of enjoying it who is denied the oppurtunity has been cheated of one of the finest intellectual pleasures of this past century. My advice to you is to read it slowly and thoroughly. It is an experience like nothing else that will never be quite as magical the second time around.P.P.S. If you don't know what The Hobbit is about, in short, it is about Adventure. A great Adventure full of Swords and Magic; of Dwarves and of Elves and of Wizards and Hobbits; Good, Evil; Trolls and Goblins; Suspense, Excitement, Comedy and Tragedy; Music, Riddles and Poetry. All of this presented in one of the most unique styles of writing ever encountered; a style of writing that paints every detail of Tolkien's fantastic world in your mind as if you were there. Not a single word is wasted and every element of the story is to be enjoyed. If any of these things sound even remotely fascinating then read this book- you won't be disappointed.P.P.P.S. Comments about the illustrated versions for those trying to decide between the two illustrated versions of The Hobbit done by Alan Lee and Michael Hague: I recommend the Michael Hague edition hands down. The illustrations seem to fit the book much more than Lee's. Lee's anything but poor, but Mague's are more merry, bright and rich. The characters appear heartier and the colors set a better mood. More simply put, when I look at Lee's illustrations I feel like I'm standing in the dining room of somebody's grandmother- wallpaper, china dolls, lace and all- they just seem old and dry. Hague's characters, the dragon especially, seem more believable- when I turn the page I don't get a feeling like what I'm looking at is out of place. Another difference with Hague is that I am confident that anybody would enjoy his illustrations, but with Lee I merely see why some people 'might prefer it.' Hague really does have that illustration feeling I expect to see in a book; Lee's look like they belong on a museum wall. Also, I feel that Hague took a more direct interpretation of the book while Lee seemed to illustrate as he liked to fit his own style without much less regard to the book. Still, before buying I suggest you sample the art on the internet just to be sure of your tastes. However, if you're uncertain then I am confident that you and especially your children will enjoy Hague."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"(paraphrased) You dont believe the propheses because you had a hand in making them?

I was considering that I should read this series of books, since it is one of those classic \\"good versus evil\\" things that are never boring, and always tons of fun to read. Since it came out as a movie as well, I decided that I cannot hold it up longer, and started the series.The hobbit, for some of you who don't know, came first in 1937, before the wars, and it became the fourth best-selling novel ever. After it showing a lot of success, Tolkien decided to write series of book afterwards, which eventually became the infamous lord of the rings trilogy. The book (now a major motion picture) itself focuses on adventure and travel, giving you wonder and satisfaction as you read through them.The story goes on like this: there is this hobbit who goes by the name of Bilbo Baggins, who like any other hobbits, like their comfortable homes and teatime at 4 \`o clock, keeps things tidy and scheduled, and never goes out on adventures. Well, never till now since Mr. Baggins was the first one to ever be out on a grand- scale adventure and return with a lot of success. He goes out on a great and a dangerous quest with 13 other dwarves and a magician to reclaim the great city of dale from Smaug, the dragon. In the end he manages to lead the dwarves safely to the destination, finish the quest in the end, and returns home, living happily ever after.There are classic adventure funs to be read from the story, about trusts and friendships, magic and discovery, and all sort of that great stuff, so read this book to begin the whole lord of the rings trilogy."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Reading it as an adult, I found that there is much more to the story than when I read it as a teenager!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Awesome!

In fact the tomb discovered by the Fellowship in Moria is that of Balin, one of the dwarves introduced in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and one of Bilbo's favorites.This book also gives us our introduction to Gandalf, the wandering wizard, and to Gollum, the hapless possessor and slave of the great Ring of Power, along with a wonderful cadre of other enchanting characters.If you haven't read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; but have enjoyed &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, &quot;The Two Towers&quot; and/or &quot;The Return of the King&quot; either in print or on film it's not too late. &quot;The Hobbit&quot; will fill in many of the blanks that inevitably arise when starting with Tolkein's trilogy.Once you've read it please join with the rest of us Hobbitophiles in screaming bloody murder until Peter Jackson consents to bring this one to film.Douglas McAllister"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The hobbit is a great prequel to the lord of the rings.

I was ten years old and it took me an entire summer to read. This was a time when we (my family and I) didn't have a VCR, cable TV or home computer, and I spent a great deal of time reading. Now, I'm definitely not the type of person who curses any of those modern technological wonders (especially since I consider myself a tech-junkie), but it's taken me many years to realize how fortunate I was to discover them later in life.The Hobbit was a milestone in my life, something many avid readers will be able to appreciate. It became the standard by which all other books would be compared for years to come, and made all those Hardy Boys books I'd been reading forever obsolete. It's the first book I can remember reading where I was actually transported to another world, an alien world so full of magic and color that my own seemed drab in comparison. It was also the first time I can remember feeling true regret after I'd finished reading it, because I knew there would never be another \\"first time\\". Granted I was only ten, and there would be bigger fish to fry in the years to come, including bigger and better books, relatively speaking, but at the time I thought I had reached some sort of literary Nirvana.I remember watching the animated movie after we got our first VCR and how it became a household staple for years. It hasn't aged very well, but when I was a kid I must have watched it a thousand times (amazing how kids can do that). When we went on vacation I'd listen to the radio-dramatization over and over again on those long road trips. I kept those tapes all the way into my teenage years until that fateful day they had played themselves out completely. I remember a cheesy old Gandalf shirt my uncle gave me and how devastated I was when I burned a hole in playing with fireworks. Ok, you don't want to hear my life story, but I'm just trying to illustrate how this book became something completely inseparable from my childhood.Strangely enough, I didn't read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy until I was an adult, for obvious reasons. The Rings books are far darker and more complex than the Hobbit. I loved them when I finally did read them, of course. Now that the movies have arrived, interest in the books, and especially \\"The Hobbit\\" which provides needed back-story has risen, and all the books are selling like crazy. Good. These are some of the best books ever written and deserve to be appreciated in their true form as much as possible. It's one of those few books which have the perfect blend of story, language and theme. It's probably one of the most perfect books ever written and will always be a personal favorite to re-read no matter how old I get.Do yourself a favor, turn off the VCR, log off of the internet, and read this book. If you have kids, buy it for them, or read it to them; something every parent should do. Good stories never go out of style, and this is one of the greatest books ever written for anyone of any age. Read it once or read it a hundred times. There's never a \\"first time\\" again, but the trip to that magical world never fails to satisfy."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"My first memory of my father is him reading me the first page &quot;The Hobbit&quot; when I was a small boy.

The slow beginning confirmed my suspicions that such high expectations could not possibly be realistic, and I prepared myself to be gloriously disappointed. Quite honestly, by the end of the first chapter I shared the opinion of the protagonist, the hobbit: I was rather unenthusiastic, and doubtful that the &quot;adventure&quot; which lay ahead could truly be as exciting as it promised to be.But Tolkien rarely disappoints. Within pages, along with our hobbit hero, Bilbo Baggins, I found myself launched into the famous fantasy world that is the product of Tolkien's imagination, a world of never-ending adventure, mystery and magic. As I joined the hobbit on his remarkable quest to defeat the dragon Smaug and reconquer the dwarves long-lost treasure, I met a wonderful array of friends and foes - wizards, dwarves, elves, trolls, goblins, and a myriad of other fantastic creatures - and my imagination and interest never waned.By the end of the hobbit's adventure, like Bilbo, I was thoroughly satisfied. At the conclusion, the wizard Gandalf remarks to the hobbit: &quot;My dear Bilbo! Something is the matter with you! You are not the hobbit that you were.&quot; Yet it was not only the hobbit that had changed as a result of this adventure. As a reader, I had to confess that I too had changed. My initial lack of enthusiasm had entirely vanished. I had participated in the hobbit's adventures, and like him, returned the better for it. Tolkien's imaginative world is a world so vivid, that you cannot fail to return to the real world a changed person. His descriptive abilities cannot fail to imprint his imaginary world in your memory. This story is not deep, but it is delightful and unforgettable. And like the hobbit, you will return to life the better having read it.What's more, you can go &quot;there and back again&quot; again, and again, because the joy of this fantastic adventure won't quickly wear off. For all ages, this book is eminently readable and re-readable, and belongs on every bookshelf. Don't miss it, because you will miss one of the most enchanting escapes that literature has to offer."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"After just finishing the book I am left speechless with how outstanding this book actually was, another must read Tolkien book."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"After reading Lord of the Rings and watching the movies, I was drawn to read this book.

Though it lacks the powerful poetry of Lord of the Rings, its prose is that of a charming bedtime story, but with all the cleverness and antiquity of Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia. Bilbo is a wonderful character, now a clich&eacute; of the genre, the unwilling, comedic, yet wise and brave hero. And, though Tolkien falls into flat characters based on race, many of his characters, particularly Thorin (a flawed, yet heroic, character), defy classification. Bilbo and Gollum, are in fact, very childlike; two sides of the child: the greedy, selfish child, and the selfless, adventuring, heroic child. One grows up through adventures; one horrifically stagnates. Many of the scenes, particularly the Riddles in the Dark and the final ending, are the quintessential Tolkien: thoroughly engaging, deceptively simple, and totally, utterly brilliant. A fairy tale, hero tale that is a classic for a reason, even if it is just a book to curl up with with a cup of tea and a quilt.

But, do some of you wonder where it all started. For example, where did Bilbo find the ring? Well you're questions will be answered when you read the Hobbit. This is the exciting prequel to the Lord of the Rings. We meet Bilbo Baggins a hobbit who is thrust into an adventure with a band of dwarves and the wizard Gandalf. Gnadalf tells the dwarves that Bilbo is an excellent thief and so he must go on this journey. The dwarves seek the treasure that was stolen by the dragon Smaug. The dwarves are led by Thorin Oakenshield. Along the way they meet trolls, goblins, elves, and the dragon Smaug. This is the first book where Gollum is first introduced and where Bilbo finds the ring and uses it. This book is a masterpiece that draws you in to every battle and makes you believe you are part of the story. If you loved the Lord of the Rings you will certainly love every action paked page of the Hobbit.

My mother used to read this book to me as a child, and I also used to watch the cartoon almost everyday. I recently picked up a copy of this book just to read for fun and I loved it as much as I always have.\\"The Hobbit\\" is about Bilbo Baggins of the shire. One day he is disrupted by a band of dirty dwarves and the famous wizard Gandolf. This band is looking for a burglur to travel with them to reclaim the dwarves old kingdom and fortune from the dragon Smaug.Chapter by Chapter find Bilbo and his band of Dwarves facing a new problem. It is in this book that The one ring that rules all, or the ring of power is found by Bilbo, and starts the wonderful story of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". This book is wonderful. Do not pass it up.Do keep in mind before reading this book though, that Tolkien wrote this as a book for children. There is a lot of singing and whatnot in here that can get a little annoying at times. But other than that it is a good story. The plot is very uncomplicated, as it should be for children, but dont let this turn you away. I would highly advise this book before you dive into the Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This novel itself is one of the greatest works in the fantasy realm to date.

This is the sort of thing Tolkien should have stuck with."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"&quot;The Hobit&quot; is about a Hobbit(named Bilbo Baggins) who is manipulated into helping a pack of dwarves. They play on his &quot;Took&quot; side which is his mothers side. The Tooks were adventure seekers, they liked going on journeys. Other Hobbits found the Tooks less respectable than the other side of Blibo's family. The ohter hobbits loathe going on adventures, in fact they hate going anywhere very far from home.(Adventures make Hobbits late for dinner). One thing you should know about Hobbits is that they really like to eat and sleep. They have about six meals a day. I only gave this two stars because it seemed like the author was in a hurry so he ended the book. Like he really had to go to the bathroom, so he ended the book as fast as possible. It also seemed like the author got really into the story and when he came to the end(Last four chapters) he didn't know how to end it. I am hopeful for the other books in the seires.

This book had a few highly actioned and interresting parts in the book, but overall this book is dull, and Bilbo the main charachter complained most of the time.For instance, there was often a large gap between action scenes. I was really looking up to the death of Smaug, a charachter who's ego was expanded into godlike preportions, died a pitiful death, with hardly any contact with the adventuring gang. And finally, my favorite charachter(Gandalf)left prematurely."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"(...) The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien gets 2 stars. It has some parts that are exciting, but not many. It contains heroes, hardships and good vs. evil, which is were the 2 stars come from. I don't recommend it. While I was reading I had to make myself sit down and read. It wasn't enjoyable like reading should be.This fantasy story is about a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins who didn't like to be bothered. One day the wizard Gandalph and about 14 homeless dwarfs come visit him in his quiet little hobbit hole. They changed everything. He is soon pulled into their quest of fighting goblins, spiders, evil orcs, and wolves in hope of finding the treasure that the great dragon Smaug protects.Most of the book is dull and tiresome. In my opinion you could skip 5 pages every now and then and not miss a thing. For instance, Tolkien uses 24 pages to express what happened when the dwarfs first met Bilbo, when all that was needed was about 8. He wasted about 100 pages total in the book which has 304 pages.Although The Hobbit is a bit slow, it shows the never-ending battle between good and evil. Tolkien portrays this well. When Bilbo comes face to face with evil he uses poems and riddles, which are challenging to figure out.The Hobbit also has a worthy plot of heroes and hardships. This can relate to other books such as the Harry Potter series and Homer's Poem about Ulysses. Bilbo is said to be a hero many times when he is faced with a challenge. One of the dwarfs complain \\"I'm just going to lie here and sleep and dream of food, if I can not get it any other way...\\" They had many hardships such as food, shelter, and ways of transportation.All in all, i would not reccomend this book. Even though it has a few good qualities such as heroes, hardships, and the relationship between good and evil, it is still boring and dull. It only deserved 2 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Ok so the world is a big place and it's full of strange people but I am surprised that anyone could be very impressed with the &quot;Leatherette&quot; editions of LOTR and The Hobbit. These particular editions are not ones I can imagine any discerning collector would want to own.I bought the two books because I am not a fan of Alan Lee's work and I couldn't find any other current hardback editions that used Tolkien's original drawings, (as the &quot;Leatherette&quot; Hobbit does). The truth is though that these are the most tacky and tasteless editions I've seen and the print and paper quality of both books is very poor. The colouring of the drawings in The Hobbit is a disgrace and numerous pages in my copy of the LOTR were so smudged they were unreadable.Don't buy them if you haven't already and if you've already made the mistake send them back with a complaint and write a scathing review to try and save someone else the trouble."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I purchased by mistake, did not read but I'm sure it is a good read and may purchase in the future."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Test review..."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Lots and lots of information about The Hobbit and JRR.

I was hard pressed to find really any kind of weaknesses in this book, which is part of the reason that it is known as a classic. One of the negatives I found though was that of the 13 dwarves in the party, really only half of them are actually useful and have an important role in the story. I cannot even remember hearing Oin and Bifur's names being used in the story besides the beginning where they are introduced and the end. Another small issue I found with The Hobbit was that how Bilbo was able to expertly fight off many different beasts and creatures with his sword even though he had no past experience with one.

They are also called halflings, and are very plump and like to eat about twelve meals a day. Our story begins with a hobbit named Bilbo and he gets a visit from a wizard by the name of Gandalf. They talk and the next day some dwarves come and they ask to go on a journey to get their gold and treasures back from a dragon named Smog in the lonely mountain. So he agrees and they go on a long an perilous journey. Along their way the meet a slew of different creatures; evil and good. For example they meet: orcs, worgs, trolls, goblins, and an evil creature named Gollum. They also meet good creatures like elves dwarves and eagles. So as they were going through the misty mountains, Bilbo meets this creature and his name is Gollum. Gollum wants to eat Bilbo so they play a riddle game and Bilbo gets the better of him and Gollum tries to find him but Bilbo found this ring and it gave him the power to be invisible. So he gets out and meets up with his dwarven friends and they continue to the lonely mountain. They get to the lonlely mountain by the expense of a couple of their friends. They fight Smog and it ends heroicly. It was a great book and I will reread it someday."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"For all of you people who have read the Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien, and want to know just how Bilbo Baggins came to obtaining the Ring of Power, this is the book for you. Immerse yourself into a world of fantasy where hobbits, elves, trolls, goblins, humans, etc. roam the lands of Middle Earth. Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit, is approached one day by the wizard, Gandalf. Bilbo must go on a journey where he travels over great mountains, through the depths of ancient forests, and inside dark tunnels where he obtains the ring of power. Bilbo's journey is full of peril and only his heroism will make him acheive his goal and finish the journey.A weakness in the book is that Tolkien can be describing an action scene but sometimes it can be hard to picture in your mind because everything happens so fast. I wish that this book gave more detail about gollum, because he is so cool, Precious.Overall, Tolkien's books bring you into a world where you feel as if you are part of the story. While reading this book, I felt as if I was right there with Bilbo, fighting off goblins and traveling Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"\\"Far over the misty mountains cold, To dungeons deep and caverns cold We must away, ere break of day, To find our long forgotten gold\\".

Their adventures take them through the deepest, darkest, and most vile places in a land called Middle Earth. The magnificence of the author's word choice allows the reader to almost hear the sounds of battle cries and water dripping in a dark cavern. This is clearly the work of a genius.The story begins in a place called the Shire, which is the home of our hero, Bilbo. The arrival of a famous wizard, Gandalf, disturbs his peace. Gandalf brings with him a party of uncivilized dwarves on a quest to reclaim the gold plundered by an ancient foe. They convince him to go with them into the depths of the unknown, fighting trolls, giant spiders, dragons, and even worse! When it comes down to it, Bilbo must make a split-second decision that could save them all, or condemn them all to death.The setting of the novel is one of the key elements in the book. The unreal location of the novel gives the story a much more fantasy tone, the intention of the author. The author creates a new world, completely different from the known world. This world that Tolkien creates is a magnificent world filled with secret doors in mountains, dark, dark forests, and rivers of water so murky that one could never to see the bottom. It is a truly marvelous spectacle.Spawned in this superlative land, are the characters of this novel. Each character shows a distinctive set of traits. No two characters act the same, which adds to the magnificence of the novel. The intricate detail that Tolkien uses in his imagery enables the reader to mentally draw a picture of each and every character.Tolkien's attention to detail flows straight into the plot, a riveting, spellbinding experience. The story flow is very fluid, with very few jumps or shifts. Each part either progresses the plot, or explains a trait of one of the characters. Unexpected twists and turns in the plot add to the splendor of the novel.Tolkien uses the language of the Middle Ages to make the novel a true work of art. Mostly associated with the Middle Ages, the Old English dialog flows into the novel, making it seem as old as the time of the setting.All of these elements combine to form a literary masterpiece, suitable for all. A spectacular adventure unfolds before anyone who reads this novel. Life and death, loss and gain. All of these and more await within the pages of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Cain CoxELA 8The Hobbit/JRR TolkienBook review10/1/03The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien is about a hobbit named Bilbo.

He first tends to be alittle timid, comfortable, independant, and secure in his little hole, also called his home. He is not afraid to follow his own path, and he craves adventure in a most un-hobbit like manner. He is more of the role model type for others. Biblo is later visited by Gandalf the wizard, and not to long after, twelve dwarves show up in his hole, to tell him about a quest they have planned, and what part they would like him to take part in. His quest is to go and rob Smaug the dragon for the treasure of Lonely Mountain. They want him to be their burglar. He is very creative, and has a large imagination. Overall, i think this book is good, but not great. It is more written for the fantasy type people, and who like wizardry. If you like The Lord Of The Rings, then you would like to read this book because it relates when when he finds a rind of magical powers. So if you like fantasy, wizardry type of books, then you would like to read this book."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"It was in great condition (new) with great price and came in a reasonable amount of time.

This book is incredibly well-written, however, I find the story to be very stale and ordinary. I recommend this book as a prelude to the incredible Lord of the Rings saga and the Silmarillion.

I found this book to be interesting; it kept me reading it and turning the pages. I thought the ending could have been alittle better because it was just too simple for the complexity of the book. Smog seemed to be a big force with a huge wrath but he was killed easily do to the lack of diamonds over the one part of his body that is the most vulnerable, his heart. I think there should have been a big war lasting days, carrying the drama out longer. This book was a bit slow in the middle and beginning but picked up at latter until the disappointing end.

This story tells of the hardships they encounter on their journey and the changes that each character, especially Bilbo, goes through. this book is wonderful because it ties in the world of fantasy with real life. The characters go through the same emotional and sometimes physical struggles that we find ourselves going through. The Hobbit is a great book that everybody can relate to in one way or another.

It is a wonderful story to captivate readers aged 10 to 110. It has inspired much creative work, including the theme of a popular computer game during the 1980's. In essence Tolkien was the father of the Sword and Sorcery genre of literature, which has provided the material for so many successful novels, movies and games.Lighter in tone than the Lord of the Rings, it nevertheless contains many references to things deeper and darker than on the surface, such as Gondolin, the last White Council, the Necromancer, and the ring.The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion provide a deeper journey into Tolkien's Middle Earth. But younger readers can also enjoy it, for it's own benefit.I first read the book, when I was twelve. It wet my appetite for all things Tolkien and led me to then read the Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion.The Hobbit is the story of the adventure of Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit of the green and pleasant country of the Shire, recruited by the wizard Gandalf and a company of Dwarves led by Thorin Oakenshield, to wrest the Dwarves inheritance from the Dragon Smaug under the Lonely Mountain. The company must first battle Trolls , Goblins , Wolves , and Giant Spiders , and comes into contact with Elves , Eagles , Men and other inhabitants of Tolkien's wonderful world."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This is the book that changed my mind about books. In high school we had to choose a book to report on, and a friend said The Hobbit was kind of interesting, so that's the one I chose.To say I was happy with my choice would be a gross understatement. From the first page my imagination seemed to mesh perfectly with Tolkien's world, and without the \\"speed of absorption\\" imposed by a movie, I was wonderfully soaking up all the detail that Tolkien includes in all his works. I was there.I could go on and on, but this is fantasy at its best. And, I feel, that reading it better readies you for the presently popular Lord of the Rings -- it makes the movies all the more clearer, richer, deeper.An excellent fantasy classic."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This book is about a hobbit (a race that are short and are generally very merry and have happy lives). Now this Hobbit's name was Bilbo and he had the average live of a hobbit (routine, organized, planning ahead, being very lazy, and eating half the time). He got a surprise knock on his door one day from his wizard friend Gandalf accompanied by thirteen dwarves. Bilbo and them eventually set out to the other side of Middle-Earth (Tolkein's world) towards the Lonely Mountains where the evil dragon Smaug lived and stole the dwarves mountain earlier. From there, Bilbo has become less lazy and brave and discovered many traits he never knew he had.This book is a prelude of the better Lord of the Ring trilogy. This is a must read for all who wants to read something new. Overall this book has an exciting storyline (kind of funny at some points) and the author has a unique writing style. It has excellent development of the main character that turns from a lazy bum to a brave soul who has wormed out of more than one tough situation"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"There are many many different illustrated editions of this classic and except for Mr. Tolkiens original renderings this is by far the best illustrated rendition of the Hobbit.Michael Hauge is a master illustrator in the grand old style and truly makes the story come alive, his work is reminiscent or Arthur Rackham at times. Of all the illustrated versions on the market today (many of them very weak indeed) I find Mr. Hague's to be exceptional. He also did a wonderful job on another classic, the Wind in the Willows. Any book illustrated by him is worth looking into (literally).Very Highly Recommended!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"In my opinion, there is only one other book that surpasses The Hobbit, and that is The Lord of the Rings Trilogy (which Tolkien originally wrote as one book). J.R.R. Tolkien was without a doubt a true literary genius. The Hobbit sets the stage for the magnificent trilogy which follows, but it is a fine work which stands on its own. Tolkien's vivid imagination transports one to a land whose inhabitants include dwarfs, elves, trolls, dragons and other familiar fairy tale creatures, but these are not the elves and dwarfs of Grimm and Hans Christian Anderson. These are REAL beings which are believable. No tiny elves that flit about here; these are the ancient ones, the healers, the wise ones of Middle Earth, the immortals. They are tall, elegant and powerful beings to respect, and indeed sometimes fear.As for the wizards...Gandalf the Grey is no mere human, but a powerful being sent from above to help the inhabitants of Middle Earth, in this case a Hobbit, an unusual creature one cannot help but love from the start. Hobbits love life; they love to eat, love companionship and a warm hearth. They are the kind of folk one is drawn to, and relates to...a homey kind of people who till the soil and tend their gardens. One can almost smell the hot bread steaming fresh from the ovens.I found the Hobbit back in the mid-sixties and have been an avid Tolkien fan ever since. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes adventure, suspense, wit and humor. It is no mere childs tale...this one is for all ages to enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Literarily speaking, chapter one of The Hobbit is the best thing ever written for children in English. What follows is a series of increasingly improbable adventures, which arose naturally out of Tolkien's storytelling practice with his own children.While by no means proof against enjoyment by girls, it must be admitted that The Hobbit is very much a boy's book, its cozily domestic subtext serving to highlight its absence of female characters, its wilderness settings and grisly violence. Its saving grace is Tolkien's enchanting sense of humor, which continues to be consistently reassuring throughout.What it requires of its readers is not however boyhood, or even childhood: what it requires is a sense of adventure. Anybody with one of those is ill-advised to neglect reading this justly renowned neo-saga, which was legendary in character to begin with, and has since become legendary in nature as well.Its most distinctive features are the maps, the verses, and the medieval authenticity. There are two maps, one of which is used in the story repeatedly. The verses are in ballad measures, including dwarf and goblin as well as hobbit songs. The early section of the Old Norse Elder Edda (Dvergatal), from which Tolkien took the names of his dwarves and wizard, remains even now displaced in an appendix at the end of Hollander's standard translation.Initially published in 1937, The Hobbit's composition was contemporary with Tolkien's pioneering published lecture on Beowulf, which revitalized the scholarship on and initiated a modern criticism of that sternest of British works. Read for publication by Tolkien's future lifelong publisher Rayner Unwin at age 10, The Hobbit sold unexpectedly well in the United States in its slightly inferior first edition (later revised to conform with The Lord of the Rings) and produced an immediate demand for a sequel, which did not however appear until those who had read The Hobbit as children were beginning to have children of their own.Various protestations to the contrary, The Hobbit remains an indispensable prerequisite to The Lord of the Rings. The Fellowship of the Rings movie might have been better, if its producers had filmed The Hobbit first.I trust that it will eventually be confirmed, if it isn't known for a fact already, that the Los Angeles meteorologist, who coined our familiar term for urban air pollution, really did mean to name it after the dragon in The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"I was a little confused at first with all the names in the book, but after the second chapter I had everything undercontrol. I loved the great detail Tolkien put into his writing, it literally made me feel like I was walking along side Bilbo throughout his troubles. Whenever he ran into tough situation, I would stop and think of what I would have done in his place. Tolkien does a very good job of setting the right atmosphere for each scene to make the story even more intense. I was really impressed with how well each new character was described, it really helped me picture what they looked like and how they expressed themselves, no matter how unhuman they were. This is the best book I have read in several years, but from what I've heard best books are just ahead. I am hoping to jump right into the Lord of the Rings trilogy, hopefully they are just as good.

Tolkien is about a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo has never been or had an adventure, until he gets a visit from some dwarves and a wizard named Gandalf. They convince him to come help them win their gold and treasure back from the dragon Smaug. On the way they meet goblins, trolls, wargs, giants, giant spiders, and of course Smaug the dragon. Bilbo shows the dwarves his worth and they grow to respect him.Bilbo Baggins is friendly and likeable, but also scared and confused. Most of the dwarves are strict and ready for anything, but some, like Bilbo, seem scared. The book starts off slow telling about hobbits, but after the first chapter it becomes a little interesting. The ending was very good, since the author goes on a little to tell what happened to Bilbo when he got back home.In the beginning the author gives too many details on hobbits. Some of the vocabulary is old fashioned. In some points of the book, like in between the adventures, the story gets a little slow and boring, but during the adventures it is very interesting.

The Hobbit is classic many would have been familiar with. In country like the Philippines, the book opens the eyes of young people to a whole new world, an entirely different culture. It's a far, far different world from the local tales of legend and magic.This particular edition is handsomely illustrated by the same artist that designed the illustrated centennial edition of LOTR and the movie. It's slightly bigger than the wider than the LOTR centennial. I just wished the publishers did not use matte coated paper for all the pages. The pages stick to each other after some time in a hot and humid environment like the Philippines. I wish only the full-pages of color illustrations were printed on coated paper.As for anyone living in the third world, this is a mighty big investment.

This is because it has a depth that is unusual in a story aimed for kids.This story has humor and great characters and fantastic descriptions...it is simply put, great."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"When placed neatly beside The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, The Hobbit is usually given the precursor of \\"Introduction\\", as if it served no more purpose then to introduce us to critical characters of the upcoming trilogy as well as Middle-Earth itself. When film versions are made of Tolkein's masterpiece, The Hobbit is usually looked over in lieu of a brief summary during the prologue, feeling the only necessary element involved with The Hobbit is the meeting of Bilbo and Gollum and the eventual acquisition of The Ring of Power. This is a sad reality indeed for one of the single greatest fantasy stories ever written.The Hobbit: Or There And Back Again, takes place in the wonderful land of Middle-Earth, created in the imagination of J.R.R. Tolkien. Tolkien doesn't just create a world, but a history, a culture, and an entire new society and existence. Behind every rock lays a story one hundred years old, and the summits of every mountain are steeped in histroy and myth.The story itself begins with the meeting of Bilbo Baggins and the great wizard Gandalf Stormcrow (The Grey). Bilbo is a Hobbit, halflings with hairy feet, great appetites, and wonderful natures, completely against adventuring of any kind. Gandalf, one of the most powerful wizards in all of Middle-Earth, knows quite a deal about Hobbits and has an underlying belief that the creatures will play some role in the unraveling story of Middle-Earth, though he doesn't say as much here. He chooses Bilbo, much to the Hobbit's protest, to accompany a group of Dwarves on a mission to steal back some of their gold, which has been gaurded by the dreadful claws of Smaug, a deadly Dragon who slew their kin and destroyed their home years before. Though Bilbo finds himself in quite an amount of trouble early on, he eventually confirms Gandalf's belief in not only him, but the importance that Hobbits will have in the future as is seen in the terrific \\"Riddles In The Dark\\", where Bilbo meets Gollum and acquires The Ring.Though many dismiss The Hobbit as simply an introduction to The Lord of the Rings, don't allow yourself to fall into that trap. The Hobbit is an absolutely magical story of adventure, hope, and dreams which winds from the quiet hills of the shire, through the dark foliage of Mirkwood, all the way to the haunted ruins of Lonely Mountain and an encounter with Smaug and a war to end all wars. It is a must read for anyone who wishes to call themself a fantasy fan."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"Great book. I have read it many times.

If you've already fallen in love with the writings of J.R.R. Tolkien and are looking for a beautifully illustrated edition of the Hobbit, then look no further. The Alan Lee illustrated edition of The Hobbit is nothing less than wonderful. Upon removing the dust cover you will find green cloth binding with a beautiful gold dragon engraved in the lower right corner, non other than Smaug himself. The pages are crisp and bright white. The illustrations, some in color and others black and white, are scattered generously throughout and intermingle beautifully with the story. The detail in these illustrations definately added to my enjoyment of this timeless classic. It is my understanding that Mr. Lee was in charge of designing and constructing the set for the motion picture Lord of the Rings and I can see why. He has captured Tolkien's world better than I would have thought possible. Tolkien created his Middle Earth at a time when other feet were planted firmly in this world, and in so doing opened us to a whole new experience. What a wonderful joining of talents. Who could ask for more?"},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"If you are going to shell out heavy coin for a hardcover edition of this wonderful book I recommend you go with the version illustrated by Alan Lee. It is a beautiful book with wonderful illustrations and very readable print (no 7 pt grainy characters smeared across porous paper will be found here).As to content, little can be said that has not already been said. Be aware that much of the charm of The Hobbit is derived from the cheerful homeliness of hobbits. They sing songs, smoke pipes and tell stories. They are hardly candidates for action-adventure heroes, but when duty calls they rally to the challenge.So if your reading palate leans toward episodic Harry Potter tales where each chapter calls the characters to brave the gaping maw of death, or Steven King-esque cliff-hanger chapter endings that propel the reader into the next daring adventure, then this book will put a little needed variety into your diet. It contains action and adventure, but these things are tempered by a comfortable quietude.So give it a shot and I think you will find the slower parts of the book are as, if not more, enjoyable than those more adventurous portions."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"This is a tale of gold, dragon, Elves and the wonder of it all. After reading the book for the third time, I must say it is still enjoyable. The book serves as a stand-alone novel or as a prelude to, &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot; (LOTR)Tolkien crafts an interesting world peopled with Dwarves, Hobbits, Men, Elves and others. The Hobbits are a race of comfort-loving people about 2-4 feet in height. If there is one thing they like it is peace, quiet and good food. Adventure and travel to far-off places is something they would really rather avoid if they can.Bilbo Baggins is one such Hobbit and he had lived 50 years in good comfort and does not wish to change that. Then, Gandalf (a wizard) arrives and invites him on an adventure with a company of Dwarves. Bilbo is initially fearful and dismissive of the whole affair and then gradually become a leader of sorts of the company.The style is easy to follow and the story is straightforward with some twists. Of the two books, I must state my preference for LOTR. The complexity of the world in which the novels are placed (Middle-Earth) that is merely hinted at in, \\"The Hobbit,\\" is much more developed in LOTR.The book is good in the old-fashioned sense of good story telling; there are no political agendas here but rather simply courage and the virtues of old. It is refreshing to read a book of battle, heroism, good and evil in our times of moral confusion and weakness. \\"The Hobbit,\\" is good for children and adults; adults will probably appreciate LOTR more though."},{"Title":"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.","review":"The Hobbit is J.R.R. Toliken's book about a young hobbit whose name is Bilbo, goes on an exciting adventure that raises his love for exploration and adventure. Bilbo is someone who hates adventure and trips. He never has liked any excitement in his life other than peace and tranquility. He is also a perfectionist and never likes a mess. But deep down inside of him, he has an uncovered facet that is awakened when he goes on an exciting adventure that will completely change his life.Bilbo unexpectedly ecounters twelve dwarves that are embarking on a journey to reclaim their lost treasure from the evil dragon Smog, who lives in the Desolation of Smog on the other side of the land. On his journey Bilbo encounters dangerous goblins, elves, giants, and demons. He also encouners friendly bears and eagles that help him and his dwarf friends along the way. Use your imagination to solve riddles and find out what will happen next in the suspenseful story like Bilbo and his friends did. To find out more about this book, I suggest you read it.There are many mysterious characters in this wonderful story. Such characters are Gollum who is a scary fish monster who lives in a secluded cave in the mountain of the evil goblins. Gollum is always hungry and wants to eat Bilbo at first sight. But to save his skin, Bilbo pleads for his life and must answer five challenging riddles. With much luck and brain power, Bilbo solves them and makes a great escape from Gollum and from the dangerous goblins.I also would like to recommend this book to anyone who likes to read. It is full of suspense and adventure. It is fun and interesting and full magic.

Unlike the Lord of the Rings trilogy (which are darker and more complicated), The Hobbit is suitable for most children of elementary school age (I'd say third grade and up, generally). While there is danger and adventure (and some very unsavory characters), there is not much violence or bloodshed.

Tolkien is a genius and there is no way to deny that. He has managed to create an entirely different world, every tree, every creature, every nuance of language, every folktale; everything is on these pages that might possibly exist in middle earth. That I believe is Tolkien's true genius, his ability to construct this world in his head and to let us visit it, completely and fully for four glorious books. However, maybe that is not the extent of his genius. Maybe not because Tolkien also tells a ripping good tale throughout these novels. The prelude with Bilbo being swept up by a band of dwarves and being sent against his will to battle a dragon takes about a night to read, despite the fact that it covers over 300 pages. And then you start the true trilogy, and the ring that Bilbo finds which seemed like a neat little trick in The Hobbit (it grants the wearer the benefit of invisibility) this ring is suddenly so much more than a very handy parlor trick. It is THE ring; crafted ages ago in elven halls with unspeakable power and unfightable draw. Men kill for it, dwarves kill for it, everyone would kill for it and suddenly you are swept off on another adventure with another unsuspecting hobbit that covers all of middle earth and includes the fate of the world...all over this little unassuming ring that must be destroyed. The journey you take in these books will not easily be forgotten, here I am getting chills thinking about the epic battles between good and evil that spring up like weeds around the path of this little ring and Frodo, the hobbit who is charged with destroying it.

There is passion and even discreet references to sex-- New Orleans in those days was a very exotic place. The characters are well drawn, and the plot involves murder (of course), jealosy, witchcraft, romantic rivalries. The historical setting really comes to live in every detail. Carr must have researched carefully. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Papa La-bas","review":"Among dozens of John Dickson Carr novels read during the last few months, for some reason this one stands out as a curiosity. It is clearly not as good as many other Carr books, perhaps owing to the author's declining health at the time (1968, a good 30 years after Carr's prime years of output). At the same time, there's more than enough of what was best about Carr in here to recommend it.Real-life Senator Judah P. Benjamin serves as the central \\"detective\\" if not the protagonist of a murder mystery set in New Orleans a few years before the start of the American Civil War. As usual in his historical novels, Carr researched the time and setting well, thus providing a nicely atmospheric backdrop (with a dash of voodoo for creepiness). The characters are diverse and reasonably well-drawn for the genre, although often histrionic in matters of the heart, an element common to several Carr novels. If the means of murder is unspectacular, the murderer's motive is interesting both in a dramatic sense and for the way Carr fictionally places it within the actual history of famous (and scandalous) New Orleans residents. Carr's Notes For The Curious at novel's end illuminate what interested the author about his subject matter. Even so, Carr often takes his time getting to any point here. Like Old Man River, the story alternately meanders and rushes through its turns.While this is nowhere near the best place to start with John Dickson Carr's novels, it might be that it's the best of Carr's last, which would also make it a good place to end a foray into the works of a master of detective fiction."},{"Title":"Commodore Junk ([Boys' own library])","review":"Commodore Junk George Manville FennHave read almost a dozen of George Manville Fenn's novels. All were quite good if not excellent. I would confidently recommend every one - except this one. There is a situation with the main character which seems rather unbelievable, but I suppose it could happen. The real problem is that the theme (justifiable anger with strong leanings towards revenge), which is stated early on and confirmed, off and on, throughout of the novel, is then completely reversed, with no explanation for such a drastic and unrealistic alteration. After that, for me, the plot crumbles to gross nonsense.Sorry Mr Fenn, you truly let me down this time. Without that totally illogical twist I would have rated this book, as with most of your others, a 5 star"},{"Title":"Inferno: The Fire Bombing of Japan, March 9 - August 15, 1945","review":"The author is not shy about putting his point of view in the foreground. Hoyt writes in the Forward that two things stand out in the history of World War II as war crimes, the first being the Holocaust, and the second being the firebombing of Japanese cities in 1945. Regrettfully for the Chinese, the killing of over 20 million Chinese civilians by the Japanese did not seem to make this idiosyncratic list, nor the killing of a like number of Soviet citizens by the Wehrmacht.The reader gets a taste of the historical inaccuracy to come on the first page of the text, when the American aircraft carrier Enterprise is identified as the carrier from which the Dolittle Raid was launched. While the Enterprise was in the task force, it was the Hornet that carried the bombers.And so it goes throughout this 140 page text. Yes, Curtis LeMay served in the Eighth Air Force in Europe, but it was the RAF under Arthur \\"Bomber\\" Harris that destroyed Hamburg in 1943 in a series of raids. The Eighth Air Force participated, but only in daylight missions against industrial targets in that doomed city. The Doolittle Raid had as its objective military and industrial targets, and was hardly the \\"blunderbuss\\" approach Hoyt claims.Other claims include the time-honored chestnut first devised by the Japanese at the end of the war, that Hirohito desired to end the war and was stymied by his advisors and cabinet. Bix's biography on the Showa emperor should put this claim to rest, but I am sure it will continue to be invoked by those who, like Hoyt, wish to exculpate the Japanese from any responsibility for the war and the horrors they suffered.The one redeeming aspect of this book are the stories of the survivors of the bombing. They stand as a powerful rebuke to the Emperor, and the leaders of the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy who launched their country on a militarist adventure in China and the Pacific."},{"Title":"Inferno: The Fire Bombing of Japan, March 9 - August 15, 1945","review":"As a military historian, based on this book, Hoyt is a competent journalist. He is, however, no William Shirer. If this book was exclusively about the oral histories of Japanese people who experienced the terror, hardships, losses, and deprivations of the final bombing campaign of Japan (Mar 1945 to Aug 1945), then it is a good book. However, Hoyt has implied that this is a history and has made some serious charges against the WWII military establishment accusing them of war crimes. This is no trifling matter. It requires much analysis and context to sift through the data to substantiate his claims. Overall any context and analysis is seriously lacking. If you are looking for a real history that covers these events and more, may I recommend Barrett Tillman's \\"Whirlwind.\\" It has a balanced context, analysis, and confronts in depth the issues that Hoyt skims over or totally ignores.The first major problem with the book is the prologue and the last chapter. Here, he launches into a tirade about the bombing of Japan being war crimes against the Japanese and that we should be ashamed. That depends on the context and presentation of facts and interpretation, which Hoyt doesn't provide. The fact is that more civilians were killed in Germany during WWII from precision and area bombing than in Japan. Precision bombing was what we were trying to accomplish via the Norden bomb sight in both Europe and the Pacific, but the results took on the appearance of area bombing. Read briefly about the collateral civilian losses in France during the air strikes leading up to D-Day and although we were practicing \\"precision\\" bombing, there was horrible, unavoidable fallout in civilian casualties. I suppose that the more salient point is that I am not aware of any German Luftwaffe officer who was tried as a war criminal for the area/fire bombing of Britain during the war. It appears that Hoyt is anachronistically applying his vision of what today's standards should be where they didn't exist 70 years ago. Further, his beef seems to be over Bosnia and Kosovo. His leap of logic escapes me. If you skip the prologue and the last chapter, the book is useful as a journalistic endeavor of telling his interviewees' stories of their experiences. However, tied obtusely to an agenda of villifying those who fought and died 65 years ago in Japan does damage to the book because it presents a case that he neither really makes nor can the evidence support. In Japan's case, were there any real civilians if everyone was mobilized to repel the final invasion? He doesn't address this. Nor does he mention the Japanese atrocities against the downed aviators during this brief period. The presentation is completely unbalanced.The real irony of this book is that the strategic bombing effort succeeded in Japan where it failed in Europe. The bomber barons in Europe were boasting that they could end the European conflict through bombing without the necessity of an invasion of Europe. They were wrong. The strategic (and tactical) bombing effort actually worked in Japan. Oh well.....The book is pricey. You can get Tillman's for less money and it is a much better book. It covers everything that Hoyt covers with the context and analysis."},{"Title":"Inferno: The Fire Bombing of Japan, March 9 - August 15, 1945","review":"The eye witness accounts of the firebombing of the Japanese cities is interesting, but the entire premise of this book that the firebombing of Japan was somehow unjustified to me is absolutely absurd.If there was ever a people that deserved to be whipped from the face of the planet it was the Japanese of the 1940's. I grew up with several victims of the Japanese, one of which survived the Bataan death march. I remember his stories of his captors treatment of him and his comrades (most of which never returned). I remember the bamboo shoots that the Japanese had pounded up under his nails on ALL his fingers and toes, a gift from the Japanese empire that he took with him to his grave. I still listen to my friends fathers accounts in Manila where the Japanese soldiers would partake in various forms of entertainment, one of which included tossing Babbie's into the air and catching them on bayonets.For a people that showed absolute fanaticism and willingness to sacrifice themselves defending the islands they had captured and to expect they would be willing to do any less on their homeland is also flawed. The firebombings and atomic bombings in the long run saved millions of Japanese civilians, but more importantly hundreds of thousands of American lives.One thing that is rarely considered is that had the war dragged on, modern day Japan would be a very different place. Had the Soviets taken a greater roll in the defeat of Japan (as they were gearing up to do after the defeat of Germany), that would no doubt put a portion of this nation under their control and the Russians were by no means fans of the Japanese. Perhaps the Japanese people deserved occupation by the Russians after all the crimes the committed on other peoples and nations, but they didn't, thanks in part to the firebombings by the US.One thing for sure, the United States ended World War II with two giant ! ! exclamation marks which prevented the Japanese from enslaving any of their neighbors into the distant future."},{"Title":"Inferno: The Fire Bombing of Japan, March 9 - August 15, 1945","review":"I bought this book expecting to gain a historical perspective of the Air Offensive Japan campaign, which my grandfather participated in as a telephone lineman with the 20th Army Air Force. I was offended by the author's assertion that it was an immoral American war crime, comparable to the Holocaust. WW2 was a state of total war with fully mobilized combatant nation participants. As such, enemy civilians are fair game when the political/military leaders fail to surrender after the application of defensive lethal violence in a just war.American adults and children were supporting the military effort with scrap metal drives, victory gardens, and bond drives, among other things. Do not think think for one minute the Axis powers, if they had the means to reach our shores with their bombers or had developed a nuke, would have hesitated to use them against our civilian population. Have you forgotten about Pearl Harbor or the Philippines where many American civilians were slaughtered in the course of the aggressive war waged by Imperial Japan?As far as I am concerned, they reaped what they sowed."},{"Title":"Inferno: The Fire Bombing of Japan, March 9 - August 15, 1945","review":"My father served on Tinian and was a participant in the firebombing of Japan. I have read about every book on the subject of the B-29 campaign that I can find. This includes books written shortly after the war and recent ones. The ones written shortly after the war did not have to be politically correct and told it exactly how they felt at the time. They called the Japanese Japs, Nips, and Jap monkeys. They did not use the term Japanese.They were quite bitter at the Japanese at the time. They did not particularly approve of the bombing of Pearl Harbor. The ensuing bombing and invasions of the Philippines, Wake Island, Guam did not go over well either. The Bataan death march was also fresh on their minds. They were also aware of the slaughter of the Chinese.Apparently, this was not a problem for Hoyt. He referred to the firebombing as the second holocaust. Really? Did Hoyt not remember there was a war going on? Even though the empire of the Rising Sun was no longer on the offensive, they were hardly defeated at the onset of 1945. Even though there had been bombing missions against Japan, there had been almost no damage inflicted. There was only one \\"precision\\" mission that was declared a success. Billions had been spent training the men and building the planes, yet there was nothing to show for it. Each B-29 cost five times as much as a B-17, yet they were causing no damage.The only way to cause damage was to firebomb. If not, we would have to invade an undamaged Japanese mainland. This would have been a disaster. Hoyt does not mention this. Apparently he was fine with have our boys shoot it out on land. Nobody wanted that. My father can attest to that. The marines trained on the beaches of Tinian and they dreaded the thought. Yet Hoyt talks about how cruel it was to kill civilians. Really? The only reason Japan surrendered was because their country had been annihilated by firebombing. But Hoyt spends his time talking about how people burned to death. I guess getting stabbed in a bonsai charge would be better. Having our boys getting machine gunned on the beaches of Japan is much preferable than burning the enemy.Don't waste your time on this fairy tale. Get the book \\"Blankets of Fire\\"."},{"Title":"Inferno: The Fire Bombing of Japan, March 9 - August 15, 1945","review":"Most people are unaware that the firebombing campaign of Curtis LeMay killed more people - the vast majority of them civilian - than both of the atomic bombings combined. LeMay himself said that if his country did not win the war, he would be tried as a war criminal.Hoyt here alternates between accounts of the bombing missions, the evolution of their inciniary civilian bombing campaign, and the stories of families on the ground during the conflagration. He is in top form here, shedding a bright light on one of the darkest corners of the Pacific War, and it is both uncomfortable and unsettling. In particular, the chapter &quot;Road to Hiroshima&quot; will leave you with both a chill and a tear in your eye. The writing is clear and lucid, and eyewitness accounts are all cross-referenced. The book is short and will be read quickly, in just a day or two, but it is valuable for cross-referencing general histories in which the firebombing campaign is usually (shamefully) reduced to a single paragraph or less.You will leave this book with a bitter understanding of the distilled trajedy that was the Pacific War, of the unchecked destruction and wanton slaughter that became not only expected, but as some would argue, necessary. That such killing could ever become justified is the lesson that we non-veterans must not just learn but know.We must, as armchair historians, allow ourselves to see the practices and results of our great nation's military, so that we might learn from them and absorb whatever lessons we can from the honor and courage of the men who fought there... and, bitterly, the women and children who died there. We owe it to the participants as well as both of our countries as well as the generations of future children to preserve the stories of our victories, however phyrric they might be.Edwin Hoyt has done a superb job of communicating these thoughts. If you have an interest in the Pacific War, this is recommended reading. Its a hardcover as well, so it makes a nice addition to your library.

Bissinger makes us feel the loneliness LaRussa feels at the end of the dugout, shows how the emotional and physical demands of the game take a toll on his family, and gets into the minutia of three games to see how tiny behind-the-scenes decisions like putting on a hit-and-run or stealing another's teams signs can affect the outcome of a game.Weaved around these games are stories of the players, like comeback kid Cal Eldred, still pitching after four arm surgeries and more than 1,000 days between wins; or the insouciant JD Drew, too confident to play with heart. There is also the tragic tale of Darryl Kile, the Cards' pitcher found dead in June 2002 before a series against the Cubs. Bissinger finishes with a short narrative about the 2004 season, the year the Cards won their division with the best record in baseball, but were swept by the Red Sox in the World Series.\\"Three Nights in August\\" is lyrical without being overly romantic and factual without being overly analytical.

The sheer insight into the mind of one of baseball's best managers, Tony LaRussa, is staggering. Bissinger had the access which allows him to have the ability to portray all of the random and intricate thoughts going through LaRussa's mind, a batter, an inning, and sometimes before a game has even started. I loved the concept of this book, the 3 game series, a season within a season, and to study a rivalry such as the Cubs and Cardinals in such detail is a privilege. If you're a baseball fan, and even have a small interest in the intricacies of the game, you'll love this book."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Three nights in August details a battle for first place between the St. Louis Cardinals and the Chicago Cubs. This pivotal series was viewed through the eyes of probably the greatest manager in the game, Tony LaRussa of the Cardinals. This book shows that it is human nature, not necessarily statistics, that dictates the outcome of a ball game. The book gets into the decision making process which goes on in the dugout....when to bunt, when to steal, when to pull the pitcher who is starting to lose his stuff....and they are more than just decisions made by looking at statistics, but the author shows how instinct, logic, and emotion impact the game."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"This was an incredible book! The writing is excellent and now I finally understand why baseball managers make some of the decisions that they make. It was hard to put down once I had started reading it. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Upfront disclosure: I didn't finish this book. Life's too short. Another disclosure: I am a Cardinals fan and, like most Cardinals fans, felt the obligation to read this book. It's about a great subject (LaRussa and his chase for another championship - which, as we now know, was ultimately successful), but as a book, I've got to be honest. As most reviews of this work so irrelevantly point out, Bissinger is the author of \\"Friday Night Lights,\\" a book that most of those reviewers probably didn't read and (another disclosure) a movie I did not see. Bissinger (who is the author of \\"Friday Night Lights\\") gives too much worshipful deference to his subject - although LaRussa is identified as a co-author, so maybe this is really an uncritical autobiography. Bissinger (who is the author of \\"Friday Night Lights\\") claims to be fascinated with and drawn to LaRussa's allegedly intense and brooding mood - something I always identified as boredom. The best parts of the book, in my view, stood on the game accounts, which were too rushed and shallow - I think because Bissinger (who is the author of \\"Friday Night Lights\\") was in a hurry to take the reader back to LaRussa's brooding strategy and post-game rituals. Whatever. Read it if you are tempted - I gave it my best shot."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"If, like me, however, you found Moneyball intriguing and insightful, you will probably hate this book. For some reason, Buzz Bissinger feels that his insider scoop descriptions of Tony LaRussa need to be coupled with this weird defense of the \\"old-school\\" and a puerile attack on Michael Lewis' Moneyball and sabermetrician statheads in general-- as if the statheads didn't love the game or something. This makes little sense, as you have to ask: who would ultimately devote his intellectual life to the compilation and analysis of aracane baseball statistics but a real lover of baseball?Sad to say, but Lewis writes/researches circles around Bissinger. Unless you're a die-hard Cardinals fan and have to lap up every available fragment of Cardinals literature, I wouldn't waste my money on this book. It's too bad that Bissinger has to pick this fight, because he could have written a perfectly acceptable, though fluffy, account of LaRussa and his OCD managerial style without it. Bissinger had all the aaccess in the world to the Cardinals and apparently all the time in the world, as he followed the team around most of the season in order to provide back-fill for the 3 days in August that form the timeline of the narrative.Since he did pick the fight, however, Bissinger is asking us to take sides and to pick a winner. He loses. Badly. Like a Left-handed utility infielder flailing at a Randy Johnson slider. He is not as sharp, talented, or eloquent as Michael Lewis, or even Bill James for that matter.Skip this book."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"An excellent look into the mind of Tony Larussa.

Even the casual fan who may be a bit curious would enjoy this."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"As a lifelong baseball fan, I enjoyed this book very much. It focuses on Tony LaRussa's day-to-day tasks and stylistic choices as manager of the St. Louis Cardinals during a three game series against the arch rival Chicago Cubs in August 2003. It was very enlightening to read about how he makes his lineup for each game, the decisions required during the game itself to position his players on defense, have signals sent to his batters (because if he sends those signals himself they will surely be decoded and \\"stolen\\" by the dozen pair of eyes watching him all the time), or have his pitcher do something special with the next pitch.I also enjoyed learning about LaRussa the man and how he has essentially given up his family life (at least 8-9 months of the year) to live alone and do his job, and I appreciated his honesty in admitting that he may regret his decision to do so. I admired his integrity in the way he fosters the competitive edge amongst his players and how he also must be a dugout psychologist to massage egos and yet act in the best interest of his team.The digressive passages regarding specific players of the past, including Rick Ankiel (still trying to make the big club as an outfielder), Darryl Kile, and others from his days managing in Oakland and Chicago add to the narrative and are quite enjoyable to read. I highly recommend this book for baseball fans who seek greater insight into how the game is played and managed. It is a fine weekend read and well worth the time and effort."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"One of the best baseball books, taking the reader into the mind of Tony LaRussa as he manages his team through a 3-game series with the Chicago Cubs.

Any baseball fan should enjoy this book. The stories Bissinger tells gives you insight into how LaRussa manages different situations.

Having waited, I get to read it with a greater degree of hindsight, now that LaRussa has retired and Matheny is manager. I plan to tag-team this book with LaRussa's new book about last season's run for the championship. Even without all those caveats, this is the best inside baseball book I've read. It explains why few managers are as successful or long-tenured as LaRussa--few managers have what it takes in the way of brains, dedication, intensity, and most of all, love of the game for the game's sake. One part of that hindsight is reading about Matheny as a player and seeing the early makings of a manager. For all those who thought the Cardinals were taking too big a gamble on hiring Matheny because of lack of experience, this book will show you that he wasn't the neophyte everyone thought."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Having been a Cardinals fan since the days of Stan Musial and Bob Gibson, I knew I'd like this book about Cardinals Manager Tony LaRussa. What I didn't know was how enjoyable a read this would be. While detailing a three-game series with the Cubs, the writer makes you feel like you're inside Tony's head. It's incredible how well he explains Tony's decision-making process. Pitch-by-pitch, inning-by-inning, you get to understand why he did, when he did it. A lot of his managing was influenced by his pitching coach, Dave Duncan, who, like Tony has decades of experience in baseball. I like that LaRussa went out on top, after the 2011 Cards made their miracle run for the World Championship."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Using his unlimited access to Tony LaRussa and the Cardinals, Buzz Bissinger takes us inside the fundamental unit of a baseball season: the three-game series. And not just any such series, but one of epic proportions -- a meeting of perennial Midwest rivals, St. Louis versus Chicago, the Cardinals versus the Cubs. And not just a series between rivals but between contenders for the division title. On this August series could depend the outcome of the season and a berth in the playoffs.Bissinger captures the drama of each game, of the entire series, in which the result could depend on a single pitch or one swing of the bat. It also depends, perhaps more substantively, on the manager. We see the games through the eyes of Tony LaRussa, who is at once strategist and tactician, statistician and historian, philosopher and theorist, psychologist and psychiatrist. LaRussa is a purist, a traditionalist -- a baseball man. He loves the game -- eats, sleeps, and breathes it -- and, like any lover, is devoted to it, tosses and turns over it, constantly thinks about it. He frets about whether, and when, to retaliate for batters hit by opposing pitchers. He plans for each game meticulously and focuses on the mechanics, down to individual batter-pitcher matchups.Of course, the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry, and for all LaRussa's planning and strategizing, for all the skill of his players, a game usually -- too often, LaRussa couldn't be blamed for thinking -- returns to that single pitch, that one swing. \\"Anything can happen in baseball,\\" Bissinger writes, \\"the beauty or the brutality.\\" With generous asides on the players' and coaches' backgrounds and the history and evolution of the game, Bissinger reveals the heart of baseball, and the heart is this: it's a beautiful game -- even when it's brutal, it's beautiful."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"\\"3 Nights In August\\", is a very good book that is reminiscent of George Will's \\"Men At Work\\". Bissinger's case study here surrounds a three-game series between the archrival Cubs and Cardinals which takes place in St. Louis in August 2003. While holding La Russa in high regard, Bissinger presents a fairly balanced profile of one of the smartest and most respected managers in The Game today. He delves into the hours of discussion and analysis that La Russa and his pitching coach, Dave Duncan, go through in preparing for the Cubs series. Bissinger shows us the importance of strategy, technology, and statistics: video analysis, index cards, and tactics that evolve with the pitch count. But he also shows us the essential human side: how La Russa deals with prima donnas, slackers, schizophrenic pitchers, lengthy separation from his family, and even the death of one of his players.The most casual of fans may find \\"3 Nights In August\\" to be a bit too in-depth, as Bissinger often provides pitch-by-pitch, inning-by-inning commentary. But there's more than enough high-level and background material to please most readers, and many will discover the game within The Game."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"This book is very good. I recommend it to any fan of baseball. The author definitely has it out for Moneyball and statistical analysis as an approach to baseball and spends too much time attacking statistics. The teams that have succeeded with statistical analysis (A's and Red Sox) admit that it is just one of the tools that they bring to the table. They also rely on good old-fashioned scouting. The problem with Bissinger is that he chooses not to see this and instead sets up strawman arguments just to knock them down. Case-in-point the Red Sox apparent use of a closer-by-committee approach in the beginning of 2003. The Red Sox never said they were going to close by commitee or even that they planned to have multiple closers for different roles. The problem with the Red Sox is that in 2003 they had noone on the staff who jumped out at you as a closer. Thus they tried a bunch of different pitchers in that role, none of them worked so they got Kim. Bissinger uses this to attack Bill James and his analysis about closers. But Bissinger misses the point. James and the Red Sox both realize that if you have a great pitcher in the bullpen, using him only in situations where you have a lead (including 3-run leads in the 9th) is a waste. If you have a tie score in 9th, 8th, or even 7th inning, that may be the most critical point in the game. You may need to use your best pitcher than. If you shut down the opposing team in the 8th and then your offense gets a 3-run homer, in the top the 8th, you can put in one of your lesser pitchers to protect that lead in bottom of the 9th. Statistically, almost all pitchers will be able to protect a 3 run lead. But getting those 3 crucial outs in the 8th was the place to use your best pitcher. Bissinger just doesn't get it."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I thought this book was intellegent and I enjoyed reading how La Russa deals with being a manager, he talked about the loss of Darryl Kile.

In fact, outside of my wife and family, I cannot think of anything I love more than baseball.That said, I am pretty ignorant of the subtle intrececies of how the game is played and managed. OK, I understand the rules, but I am pretty clueless on when to give the light to hit or not, when to call for a hit-and-run, etc.This book gives some excellent insights into the finer points (at least finer from my eyes) of managing and why a manager makes certain calls or decides not to.My only complaint about the book is that it deviates from a discussion of strategy to talk about LaSorta's personal life. I do not know about you, but I could not care less where he lives, where his wife lives and how often they see each other.That said, certainly worth reading. It is helping me get through the off-season. Short of watching baseball, reading about it is a pretty close second."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"You should buy this book for what it is, and not for what many of these reviews say it is. It is not anti-Moneyball, it is an insiders look at a baseball game in the context of the baseball world and the career of one man, Tony LaRussa. Sabermaniacs have brought a deeper understanding of baseball to the layperson, and have challenged conventional thinking about our great game. This book does not set out to refute ther tenets of sabermetrics, in fact, Moneyball is mentioned only three times in 279 (paperback) pages. Any anti-sabermetric review is probably motivated by an almost zealous subscription to the central teachings of Moneyball.Take the book for what it is: an intelligent, thought-provoking, entertaining, insiders look at the baseball world broken down into three games. There is a great deal of context given here for what is happening on the field and in the mind of the manager. As Mr. LaRussa points out in his Foreward, the book is not about three games, and that most of what you will read \\"should really be about baseball in general.\\"As far as recent books, the excellent Moneyball's contribution to the avid baseball fan is thinking differently about the assumptions you make about the game, and that different business models can be adopted that offer advantages that can be observed as teams take the field. The contribution of this book is an insiders look at how the game is tactically executed and how the eyes, ears, and experiences of a quarter century affect the minute decisions that affect the whole.Entertainingly written, any baseball fan will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"The content of Bissinger's _Three Nights_ has been expansively glossed over now, so I'll just get straight to the point-no need for a Summary.My interest in this book was sparked by Tony LaRussa, probably the most polarizing manager in baseball today. To some he's a master strategist, a commander pushing tactical boundaries (anybody else remember how he batted the pitcher 8th a few times to get McGwire more RBI chances?). To others, LaRussa is not nearly as smart as he acts and a poor manager of personalities. I can think of more than one player who left St. Louis disgruntled. He is also almost personally responsible for slow games from his unwavering reliance on matchups. Personally I placed myself in the He's Not As Good As He Thinks He Is camp. Still, from this book I wasn't searching for more reasons to criticize LaRussa the manager, rather I was hoping for a look at The Man LaRussa himself and an understanding of his motives. I wanted to see a human behind those sunglasses. Through the three-game series against Chicago, I was hoping to find reasons to like or respect LaRussa.Under the general's mask is a man consumed by fear. Bissinger pulls away threads of LaRussa's wool armor, showing that behind every strength is a weakness, for every move a looming counterpunch. LaRussa has essentially left his family in the bullpen, which Bissinger is not judgemental about. Rather, this is presented as the downside to a passionate man. It's part of being a Baseball Man.The most anticipated part of this book was LaRussa's attitude towards beanballs and brushbacks. Tony has, over the years, likely been involved in more beanball wars than any manager I've followed. It's part of what causes such polarizing views on him. Bissinger carefully details the conflicts that LaRussa endures when one of his players is hit. LaRussa is literally a \\"made\\" man in the dugout, adhering to the informal Baseball Man code of ethics, agonizing over what the consequences of his moves will be for his soldiers on the diamond.Slightly less effective are instances when the book's focus strays from the three-game series. Specifically, on ocassion I feel that the editorializing about Modern Players is overbearing. The purpose of including the Modern Player discussion is to show another aspect of the game LaRussa must manage, but sometimes this discussion strays into Today's Players Aren't As Good As They Were in My Day arguments that have been made time immemorial. I'm not sure why \\"hit and run\\" is italicized; this is common parlance and suggests that Bissinger indeed fails to cleanly glove basic aspects of the game. And, why not just save us all the time and capitalize the \\"great\\" in \\"great Albert Puljols\\"?What this book displays is that there is a human being behind those sunglasses, and that a manager's code of ethics leaves little room for sentimentality. LaRussa's faults aren't based on smugness, but rather his inability to transcend. His humanness rests in his imperfection, and in his attempts at forming graceful symmetry from an imperfect object. A Baseball Man is a wonderful thing, but every strength is made taught by the pulleys of weakness."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"This superb narrative shows us baseball from the eyes of the manager. Specifically, readers come to know the mind and strategies of skipper Tony La Russa. The backdrop is a key three-game series as La Russa's St. Louis Cardinals host their rival Chicago Cubs in August of 2003. We see La Russa\`s thinking as he contemplates his lineup, pinch hitters, pitching changes, etc., not to mention his overall views of baseball strategy. Readers come to understand the ceaseless pressure that skippers face, one that can take an emotional toll. The author also looks at several players, their personalities, egos, and determination - including a moving remembrance of pitcher Darryl Kile who died tragically (from a heart attack) a year earlier. The pages intersperse action with flashbacks and anecdotes, and the result is similar to NINE INNINGS, Daniel Okrent's superb narration of a game between the Milwaukee Brewers and Baltimore Orioles in 1982.Author Hal Bissinger spent time with La Russa to write this superbly readable narrative, one that should be enjoyed by fans, coaches, and students of the game. Readers might also consider FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, the author's superb critique of high school football in Texas."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Three Nights in August is a great, detailed account of what goes on with the Cardinals and specifically with one of the greatest managers in baseball history, Tony LaRussa. LaRussa is guarded and this book opens up his stragedies, his history in the game and the decisions that he makes. Bissinger has an amazing knack to pinpoint every detail of the game. We also take a look inside the Cardinal clubhouse and the heart-wrenching decisions that LaRussa makes everyday."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I admire Tony LaRussa for his use of the bench and for his intensity, but I think his game strategy is his weak point. He doesn't realize (nor does the author of the book) that the statistical matchups which he relies on do not usually have enough examples to be statisically significant. Further, he (in my opinion) sacrifice bunts too much, and it has been shown that sacrifice bunts increase the probability of one run but overall reduce the numnber of runs scored. The criticism that he overmanages I think is warranted. The book, definitely well written and great reading for any baseball fan, is nevertheless a puff piece dedicated to exaggerating the brillance of Tony Larussa. In my opinion, he is a shoo in to the hall of fame based on the terrific job done by the general managers who have stocked his team with a wonderful group of all-star players. But he still has won a lot of games, and must be doing a lot of things right."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"This is a must-read for all baseball fans--it's a bonus if you happen to be a Cardinal baseball fan. Love him or hate him, Tony LaRussa is one of the best baseball minds in the history of the game. His knowledge of the game is only eclipsed by his passion for it--and this comes across loud and clear in the book.Go Cardinals and Go Tony--we'll see you in Cooperstown!"},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"As usual Bisinger (\\"A Prayer for the City\\" and \\"Friday Day Night Lights\\") does his usual thorough job of research and reporting. But the book was slow to get going and I suspect a non-bebaseball fan will not be patient enough to stick with it.However, this book lacks the wider appeal that made the two aorementioned books so popular. The writing dragged some and several scenes seemed endlessly detailed, with little reward at the end of the section.The upside of the book is that the author gives us great insight into the work of a baseball manager and its many facets that are often unseen, or at least usually forgotten. Additionally, some details around the game time situations are wonderful and they keep the story going.This book will appeal to baseball fans and will have very strong appeal to St. Louis fans."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"This book was a great look into the strategy and mental aspects of America's \\"Forgotten\\" Pastime.

As a fan, you get to see what is going through the mind of a baseball genius. This is a book a person will not be able to put down."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Let me start by agreeing with reviewers that say this book is not simply for Cardinals fans. This is a book for any baseball fan who wants to better understand the strategy and planning for games and series and wants to see, through the eyes of one manager, how all of that can unfold.Tony La Russa is an ideal subject for such a book. He, and Dave Duncan his pitching coach, provide Buzz Bissinger with a rich set of strategies to write about. Along the way, it becomes clear that all of this can easily be upset by injuries, players that make mistakes, or players that simply don't have the right mental make-up to believe in their manager's and coach's strategies. For example, one can easily understand why certain Cardinals in 2003 are no longer on the team or in the organization now.I was surprised the book jumped to the 2004 season in an epilogue and didn't provide closure on 2003 within the main context of the book. Perhaps, this was the desire of the author to provide a happy ending (e.g. the Cardinals go to the World Series), but a better ending would have been the conclusion to 2003 and the influence it had on the Cardinals organization in the 2003-2004 offseason.This is an easy read and one that intense baseball fans not previously exposed to inside baseball will find difficult to put down."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"First question: Did we really need another profile of Tony LaRussa, already the most over-exposed manager in major league baseball? Ever since he popped up in the early 80s, the media has fawned over his every move, evidently impressed by his ability to pull a double-switch and glower at the same time. Dude gets more ink than Brad and Angelina -- maybe they share the same publicist.But if you're as big a baseball fan as I, it's only a matter of time before you succumb to the hype and purchase this universally praised account of (as the title suggests) three nights in August ... i.e., a feeble re-make of 'Nine Innings' spread out over three games so the writer won't have to concentrate as hard. I finished the book in two sittings, so I can't honestly sit here and say that it stank.Or can I?The central premise of the book is as obnoxious as its subject, namely the aforementioned manager of the St. Louis Cardinals, one Tony LaRussa -- attorney at law, in case you needed reminding. According to one Buzz Bissinger, LaRussa's an old-school throwback, a balls-out 'real man' in a baseball universe increasingly lorded over by timid 'thirtysomething' geeks who wouldn't know a jock strap from an iPod nano. Yeah man, those guys just sit in front of their computers all day, crunching numbers, but me, Tony L, I go by my gut! I've got 25 years of experience ovah heah, and I make my decisions the old-fashioned way! If the stats tell me to pull my starting pitcher, maybe I will, maybe I won't -- I'm going to walk to the mound and SMELL him first. Think those MBA Moneyball twerps know what a pitcher smells like? They don't even chew tobacco, mang.Yeah, well, interesting theory. Trouble is, after taking cheap shots at such stat-head losers as Bill James and Theo Epstein, our man LaRussa gets praised for obsessively analyzing pitcher-hitter matchups. That's right -- the guy that every baseball writer hypes as a genius is making out his lineup cards based on some guy going 3-for-7 against Kerry Wood. What the *&^%? Per Bissinger, we shouldn't rely on statistics -- unless they're based on impossibly small sample sizes.Another flaw in this anti-number, pro-intangibles screed is that we never actually see LaRussa go *against* his statistics. Seriously. I mean, if the whole purpose of the book is to illustrate that you have to look beyond the numbers and size up the player himself, shouldn't there be some instances where Big Tony plays a hunch that goes against all logic and pays off huge? or where T straightens out a player with a bad attitude, or picks up a guy in a slump? You'd think so, wouldn't you? Yet such instances are strangely absent.Why? Because LaRussa's an arrogant jerk who doesn't relate to his players. Hell, he doesn't relate to his *family* either, as one of the book's better storylines makes plain. The book confirms the prejudices held against LaRussa by his detractors: namely, that he's a paranoid madman who micromanages his teams to defeat. This negative nutcase appears deathly afraid of *not* making a move, of being second-guessed by the press... or by himself, perhaps? Bissinger relates his relentless fretting about the #8 hitter on the opposing team possibly getting a hit, thereby allowing them to have their #1 hitter lead off the following inning. It's a mildly instructive bit of insider baseball, but LaRussa treats the issue as if he's launching the Market Garden offensive. Dude, it's the fifth inning and there's still fifty games to go! Pop a Paxil or bolt down some Jim Beam -- you're begging for this guy to relax!But Big Tony never relaxes -- and his players never will either. Bissinger notes approvingly that LaRussa routinely expects his guys to play as if it's the seventh game of the World Series throughout the 162-game season. As such, his players are forever under the gun, terrified their manager's going to freak out when they fail to advance the runner to third, even if they're playing the Pirates in June. His players will always press, and ultimately, they'll always lose. That's another major flaw in the book: The author presents LaRussa as the ultimate authority on all things baseball, while side-stepping the little matter of his failing to win the big one. He's managed for 25 years and has won the World Series exactly once; he's also lost it on three occasions, getting swept twice. Fittingly, he lost the 2004 series to a team that famously embraced the very stat-conscious maxims that Bissinger aims to debunk. Chew on that, Buzz. (Blaming the loss on a late flight into Boston? Sell it somewhere else, bub.)The writing, you ask? Let's just say that Boswell and Angell can rest easy. Bissinger's swinging for the fences (!) on this one, desperately throwing in highbrow references regardless of whether they fit. A spate of ill-placed phrases ranging from the Maginot Line to the Hammurabi Code culminates in the downright bizarre description of a blooper as \\"the kind of existentialist hit that would keep Camus or Sartre in the money.\\" Overwrought much? I half expected to spot Vladimir Lenin Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers behind home plate. Add in a surprisingly irritating decision to italicize the phrase HIT-AND-RUN each and every time it appears -- imagine a Neil Young biography that wrote about all his FOLK ROCK BALLADS or a book on Bush that discussed the WAR ON TERROR -- and you have a sad case of a writer getting in the way of his own story. Bad Buzz, Bad.What was that story again? Oh right, here it is: Tony LaRussa's a genius because he doesn't rely on statistics like those other guys, except when he does, and you can tell he's sharp because he wins, except when he doesn't.Did I mention the author gives LaRussa a pass on the issue of steroids, even though Tony's teams benefited disproportionately from turning a blind eye to the problem? It just goes to show you: Never read a book recommended by Tim Russert, the man who ate Mario Cuomo."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"This could have been such a wonderful book.

This book satisfies my \`itch' for both reading and baseball. The author is an excellent writer, and I thoroughly enjoyed his writing style. Often baseball is communicated with the flamboyance (what I really mean is drabness) of the box score. Yes, at times this author waxes philosophical, and he sometimes writes in a way that may be better suited for fiction, but I loved it. I value the statistical, dry, factual part of the game of baseball. But I also appreciate the author's ability to liven this book through good writing. Another great baseball book is Nine Innings, but unlike Three Nights in August, Nine Innings failed in the writing department. Baseball is a long season, with lots of numbers, players and repetition. People who effectively communicate the game (radio announcers, sports writers, and authors) do so effectively through flair and color.In regard to my second \`itch', the baseball in this book is great. Larussa (love him or hate him) is one of the most successful managers in history, and a look at his life is an excellent glimpse into the game itself. I consider myself a big baseball fan, but there was so much that I learned about the game through this book. It is clear that Larussa has a passion and commitment to his job that is rare, not only in baseball but in other professions as well. So strong is his passion and commitment, that I believe it is unhealthy. The author doesn't try and cover up the fact that Larussa hasn't been a very good father or husband. The question is, was this really a sacrifice for Larussa? I doubt he would have it any other way.The book was great, I will read anything else this author writes."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"This book was written with the baseball fan in mind and the writer succeeded in getting the fan's attention, me being a Cardinals fan made the book even more interesting and is on the top of my list. The look from inside the clubhouse opened doors which until now have stayed shut and made Tony La Russa look more human to me and a lot of other people. The book also clarified the lonelines of the manager's job and how hard it must be to live without family and friends. Great read and highly recommended to all baseball fans, this book makes me wonder if Buzz Bissinger's other books are just as good."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"This is Bissinger's account of a three game series between the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs. Interspersed with the story of the games, is the story of Tony LaRussa. The reader is treated to the story of LaRussa's life, his struggles and the vagaries of being a manager in MLB today. Interspersed is the back story of each of the pivotal players in the series, as well as a description of Darryl Kile, who died during that season. Bissinger does a great job of mixing game action with the thoughts and feelings of those involved.The most compelling aspect of the story is the description of how LaRussa strategizes for each game, makes decisions, and manages in the late innings. He truly is one of the most masterful managers out there. Bissinger does get a bit too admiring in his descriptions, to the point where you wonder if LaRussa was the one who actually wrote certain bits of the book. I know Tony's smart, but he's not Einstein. This is a minor quibble, and the rest of the book more than makes up for this small shortcoming.A definite keeper, and a great book for baseball fans."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"My husband is a baseball fan so I bought this book for him, he loves it. The book is very well presented with a great cover picture.I live in Australia and it did not take long for this book to arrive here to us. I am very impressed with the company's service, and prices.Thank-you Amazon."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Speaking as a very casual baseball fan with an extremely limited understanding of the game, I have to say I loved this book.This is a lovingly crafted account of a three-game series between the Cardinals and the Cubs in the summer of 2003. It tracks the strategizing of Cards manager Tony La Russa as he fights for the crucial wins that he hopes will give his team the momentum needed to carry them into October.The writing is exquisite. Like an ace pitcher tossing his best stuff in a big game, Bissinger seamlessly mixes in joy, heartbreak, tension, and humor. There are enough statistics and tactics and historical references to satisfy the serious fan, but the box scores and decimal points are animated by intricate personal tales and nail-biting retellings of the key events in the series. Each game is relayed as though it were a protracted military campaign in which every deed, whether heroic or dastardly, is worthy of the historian's pen.One of the best sections is, sadly, one of the most heartwrenching. That is the story of beloved Cardinals pitcher Darryl Kine, who died of a heart attack at age 33, leaving behind a wife, three kids, and clubhouse full of brokenhearted men who suddenly ask themselves what is so important about hitting a ball around a field.Some reviewers have slammed the book for supposedly staking out a stance diametrical to that of Michael Lewis's Moneyball, which used the example of Oakland manager Billy Beane to argue that statistical analysis was a far more powerful tool for assessing a player's ability than a scout's gut feeling. The criticism is misplaced. Bissinger mentions Moneyball in the preface, calling it \\"provocative\\", then goes on to say:\\"This book was not conceived as a response to Moneyball. Work began months before La Russa or I had ever heard of Lewis's work.\\"Throughout the book's entire 280 pages, there are a couple -- two, maybe three -- oblique references to guys who mistakenly think that stats can tell the complete story of a player.But of course Three Nights is not a refutation of Moneyball, if Moneyball is broadly about winning games by crunching numbers. That is readily apparent from the simple fact that La Russa and his staff rely heavily on statistics to do their jobs. They analyze the past performances of each hitter in the lineup against all the possible pitchers he will face. They agonize over tactical decisions, running through ridiculous-sounding scenarios such as: \\"So-and-so is only 1 for 9 facing right-handed pitchers with men on base and two outs in late innings\\". I exaggerate, but you get the idea.Of course, Moneyball can be read more narrowly, with the key takeaways being that on-base percentage is the only stat that matters, and that bunting, sacrifice flies and stealing do more harm than good in the long run. But even in that case, Three Nights is less a refutation than an alternative view, one that perhaps merits as much attention. After all, La Russa has coached four teams to the World Series, winning one of them. That's something that Beane, for all his talent and managing savvy, is still dreaming of."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I have been a baseball fan for over 35 years, and this book is perhaps the best I've read about the inner workings or \\"game within the game\\" of baseball. I recommend this book highly to any baseball fan, whether or not you are a fan of Tony LaRussa, as well as to anyone interested in the study of human nature among high-profile athletes."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"This was a mesmerizing read for me--someone who usually doesn't stay interested in most books. As an avid chess player, I often read chess strategy books and get engrossed in the mental challenges of the game. I have always tried to delve deeper into the mental aspects of baseball as I have gotten older. This book offered a great insight into how the game really feels and how difficult the decisions really are for a manager. Being a life-long Cardinals fan, this book was a no-brainer for me. But, Cardinals bias aside, the attention to detail and excitement of this book was there, whether or not you care about the Cardinals. Kudos to Bissinger who really knows how to write exciting sports books.

Bissinger writes really well still, hopefully he'll do it again."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"St.Louis Cardinals manager Tony La Russa hired Buzz Bissinger (\\"Friday Night Lights\\") to pen this study of a three-game series between the Cardinals and Chicago Cubs in August 2003. It's a good read, but won't be of much interest to a non-baseball fan. Bissinger clearly read Daniel Okrent's \\"Nine Innings\\" before he sat down to write, for Okrent's book is a detailed look at a single 1982 game, with analysis of personalities, baseball lore, tactics, and psychology sprinkled in as the game goes along. Fortunately, and unlike \\"Nine Innings\\", this book lets a few pitches go by in the name of a smooth and lively narrative. So readers don't get bogged down in too many details but can get through the three-game series in 250 pages. Bissinger clearly knows his audience, since the Cardinals big year wasn't 2003 and the season covered by this narrative, but rather 2004 when the team went to the World Series. So the author apends a few pages at the end describing the fates of some of the key players and the 2004 season -- certain to satisfy any Cardinal fan.The most interesting sections are the discussions of the personalities of the players. Even La Russa, driven and manic and oblivious to the damage he is doing to his own marriage, is not quite as interesting as some of the athletes. There is Cal Eldred's journey from New York phenomenon to effective elder statesman; there is Kerry Robinson, who over-estimates his own talents and squeaks by with the occasional ability to have startling success; there is Yoda-like pitching coach Dave Duncan; the frustrating wasted talents of JD Drew and Garret Stephenson. And of course, there is the great Albert Pujols, with a talent so majestic and sublime that he may eventually rank among the handful of greatest players ever.\\"3 Nights in August\\" is a fun read for baseball fans, and particularly Cardinal fans. Bissinger is a bit rah-rah in his devotion to La Russa, who paid him to write this book, but the cheering --like the book-- is all in fun."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Buzz Bissinger's Three Nights in August is his best effort yet -which says much, given the Pulitzer Prize winner's achievements with Friday Night Lights and A Prayer for the City. Three Nights in August is a marvelous blend of insights into baseball technique and strategy (information that will intrigue even the most knowledgeable of the sport) and revelations about the human condition, particularly in the context of teamwork, role-palying and leadership. This tightly written book, which uses as its setting a three-game series between the St. Louis Cardinals and the Chicago Cubs in the heat of a division race, is one of substance. Anyone who has not read the book and might believe it to be just another cookie-cutter, pedestrian \\"as told to\\" vanity piece is sorely mistaken. Like Bissinger's previous works, this is a must-read."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"3 Nights in August is an awesome look at baseball and why it is such a great game. Buzz Bissinger follows Tony LaRussa around and chronicles a 3 game series with the Cubs. There are plenty of asides - histories of players, coaches, strategy think sessions, etc. It really brought baseball to life for me. For too many years I have lived through \\"fantasy\\" baseball, numbers flying at me through the internet. That is no way to enjoy baseball. To enjoy it through the eyes of a manager and a team that love the game - that was something very fun.However, if you don't like baseball, you probably will be bored silly throughout this book. But you never know - give it a chance and you may appreciate the game a little bit more."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Bissinger's book isn't as inspiring as FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, but he's a careful stylist, and the depth of his take on manager Tony LaRussa may never be equalled. Tony's fights and reconciliations with his wife, Elaine, over family issues and how to work out a long distance marriage are part of the book, a big part, and any honest reader will see both sides to the story and will come away with admiration for both LaRussa's for trying to handle a difficult issue in public.Darryl Kile's death, which ironically occurred in Chicago, the city with which St Louis has such a great rivalry, is presented here in moving detail. I feel sorry for Flynn, Kile's lovely wife, and their children. Their little boy is maybe three or four now and yet he will never know his father.The story of Rick Ankiel is treated more lightly, and will keep you in stitches. Ankiel, the pride of Fort Pierce, comes off in Bissinger's aphoristic prose as a bit of a flake.The three games Bissinger writes about are thrillingly presented, but when I closed the book it all seemed to have happened so long ago, particularly because only in the past year or so has the issue really been broached about steroid use. LaRussa seems honest about this, but it's hard to tell how much he's covering his own ass about rampant steroid use on his team and what he knew about it. After Jose Canseco's book and congressional hearings into the matter, maybe the real story will have to wait until a few more players die brutal and unexpected deaths. Or perhaps, as Canseco implies, you're not really a man if you can't handle the drugs that go with baseball.I must also add a word in favor of LaRussa's work with the Animal Rescue people. No matter what people say about Tony, you know his heart is in the right place, and this animal work is nothing new for him, he's been into it for eons. Good for him. If St Louis ever tires of T, there's a place for him reserved at Rainbow Bridge."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"This is another wonderful book by Buzz Bissinger. It is not only entertaining, but also enlightening. But what else would we expect from a collaboration between a top writer and one of baseball's best managers? \\"Three Nights in August\\" rates as one of my three favorite reads this 2005 season -- with \\"Hank Aaron and the Home Run That Changed America\\" and \\"The Luckiest Man Alive.\\" All three are superb."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"It's hard to believe the Tony LaRussa in 3 Nights in August is the same expressionless man I see in the dugout every Cardinals game.I'm a huge baseball fan and a coach, and I recommend this book to every ball player before he begins playing in high school. The book was educational for me as a coach, and I wish I'd have read it when I was playing. As a fan, it's easy for me disagree with a manager's decisions when he puts in a .230 average utility infielder in a close game, but two of my favorite topics in the book are the importance of bench management and developing younger players.My only complaint about the book is Buzz Bissinger's vocabulary. I read because I enjoy it and it keeps my mind sharp. I have reasonable intelligence and a decent vocabulary. But I think Bissinger, like too many authors, sacrifices the flow of the story to boast his own vocabulary, and, in the process, he makes the reader feel intellectually-inferior. Any word that isn't used at least rarely in a conversation should be equally absent in a book. It's frustrating when I'm reading about baseball and I have to stop to figure out or look up the meaning of words like leitmotif.Aside from the abundance of unnecessary foreign words, I loved the book. Bissinger did a great job of showing the different personalities of the Cardinals players, coaches, and behind-the-scenes workers."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"This book taps into the incredible baseball mind of Tony La Russa, who has managed three great teams - the White Sox, the A's, and now the Cardinals - and spent 40 years studying and absorbing the game. Bissinger is a great fly on the wall - Friday Night Lights is one of my favorite books of all time - and his inside the dugout view is informative, interesting, and occasionally very moving. The chapter about Darryl Kile had me in tears. Buy this for any baseball fan in your life."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"This book gives a good look into the strategy that TLR uses in his management style. If I wasn't a Cardinals fan I probably wouldn't have enjoyed this book as well. I will likely re-read this book."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"3 Nights in August provides an interesting narrative to talk about a baseball team including the players, managers and all of the supporting staff. By limiting the book to just one series of three games, it uses small incidents to imply season-long issues. Yet, the author does blend in backstory to provide context.This is one of the first books I have read that effectively counters sabermetric studies by giving more a detailed view of how a manager is treating particular players on a given night. The book includes glimpses such as LaRussa trying to manage the hurt feelings of millionaire players. Rather than showing sympathy for anyone, it provides a straight look at why LaRussa, who has never been known as a softie, must balance player personalities with their skills or risk having professionals act unprofessional.Since the book is essentially told from LaRussa's point of view, it does gloss over some of the most significant criticisms of the manager. However, that is not the point. Since LaRussa is known for being a manager who feels the weight of every loss, this does a nice job of communicating how last night's game impacts this manager's view of tonight's game. All-in-all, I would recommend the book to any baseball fan who wants a closer look into the dugout."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"3 Nights in August is a very solid baseball book, one that should be enjoyable to any baseball fan. It is interesting to see how an accomplished manager thinks throughout the game, not only about the specific strategies of the three games in question, but also about his players, about players on other teams and about other issues in baseball. While describing the accounts of an important three game series in August, 2003 against the Chicago Cubs, Bissinger also tells us about how Tony La Russa, the manager of the St. Louis Cardinals, thinks about some general baseball issues. These issues include: throwing at hitters, handling individual players, looking at statistics as a guide only, steroids, and family life.Some of his ideas are controversial. For example, it seems La Russa believes that any opponent pitcher that hits one of his batters did it on purpose. In particular, a pitch thrown by Kerry Wood in the second game of the three game series grazes the shirt of Pujols. It doesn't even hit any skin, muscle or bone, just nicks the shirt. In baseball, this is still considered a hit-batsman, and Pujols is awarded first base. However, La Russa still has vengeance in his head, and it is described how he plans to plunk Sosa, and is perturbed when his pitcher does not do the job correctly in the following innings. An eye for an eye, anytime his hitters gets hit, he wants to go after their guys. That's La Russa's philosophy, and in my opinion, it's a dangerous one and a stupid one. If he's going to plunk Sosa, what would stop the opposing manager from taking retaliation himself - especially if Pujols was not even hit, but it only nicked the shirt? I'll bet if La Russa was in the manager of the opposing team too, he would look at a possible Sosa plunking as reason to go after another one of the Cardinal hitters. And that's how these beanbrawls escalate.The book also covers a bit about La Russa's views on steroids. He's one of the few people in baseball that admits that he had an inkling that baseball players, on his team and others as well, were using them. However what bothers me about the account about steroids in this book is the lack of insight into Mark McGwire. La Russa was his manager for many years with Oakland and St. Louis. Yet the discussion in this book is more on Canseco than McGwire. There's even a bit of propaganda that Bissinger writes: \\"He (McGwire) was big when he came into the league in 1986...\\" This was mentioned to mean that McGwire didn't get all that big, therefore he wasn't on steroids. But anyone who has ever seen one of McGwire's rookie baseball cards (just hit it up on ebay and you can find one) can easily see that by 1998, McGwire was about four times as big as he was back in his rookie season in 1986. He was a twig back then, a tall lanky guy with a long swing. In 1998, he was Paul Bunyon in real life, making even Sammy Sosa look like a little man. Why spend the time to harp on Canseco when McGwire is the more important baseball figure, and the one that La Russa knew more about? That was disappointing, but understandable since La Russa is still loyal to McGwire, but not to Canseco.As for some folks that think this is an anti-Moneyball book - it is not...definitely not. There is rare mention of Moneyball or sabremetrics.All in all, I thought this was a worthwhile book. Bissinger does a good job in relaying how La Russa thinks. Of course, not everyone is going to like or agree with every one of his thoughts, but the fact they were presented clearly and in an enjoyable way makes this book highly recommended."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Great inside look at the game.

La Russa is meticulous, always scheming for an edge. He and his army of coaches keep detailed notes on every player and every pitcher in the league including their own.Though the season may seem long and tedious, each game counts. A whole season can change in one game. La Russa knows this and he works tirelessly to win each day.Bissinger's 3 Nights in August is exhaustive look into the mind of Tony La Russa. Though the game has changed significantly over the years with home runs, deep bullpens, sabermetrics, and so on; nothing can replace experience.La Russa managed with an unmatched intensity though he remained stoic and poker-faced. With his retirement at the end of the 2011 season after the Cardinals magical comeback against the Texas Rangers, baseball lost one of its most respected managers.Anyone who loves baseball, who loves the nuances of the game, the joys and the heartbreaks, will love this book."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I came away from 3 NIGHTS IN AUGUST with more respect for Tony LaRussa. Here is an old school manager that anyone who loves the game of baseball can appreciate. LaRussa in action and philosophy is not the pure antithesis of MONEYBALL. A better description would be a heartfelt antagonist. MONEYBALL can't measure the heart, and that is what LaRussa is looking for in addition to talent. Some have talents,others have heart, but the special ones, the winning ones, have both.A enjoyable read, but Bizzinger continues to be a little out of his element when he collaborates with others. A PRAYER FOR THE CITY and FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS both had his distinctive voice ringing through them. This feels more like a book written and then showed to LaRussa, and then rewritten, which makes it a bit long in the tooth by the end. Still quite good, and Bizzinger is a talent with heart, even if sometimes a little hot headed."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"One of baseball's great minds meets one of sportswriting's great pens to produce an outstanding picture of management in modern professional sports.The thread of a crucial three-game series ties together a fabric of exposition regarding Tony Larussa's approach to decision making, player shepherding, coping with events that force changes in strategy and tactics, and a patchwork of stories regarding about his players, competition, the people who taught him and their predecessors.The book makes highly informative and enjoyable reading for aficionados, a mind-expanding experience for less deeply involved fans, and a fine glimpse of a \\"man behind the curtain\\" wizard for anyone intrigued by mastermind managment."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"The NFL is great & maybe game for game more exciting. But I love baseball. Two more games & the NFL is outta here. From April to October, thru the dog days of summer baseball supplies my daily fix of escape from the real world. Three Days encapsulates so much of what baseball is in the format of a late season three game series between the Cards & Cubbies. Buzz Bissinger dissects the games pitch by pitch with the percision of an expert surgeon, through the baseball mind of Tony LaRussa mgr. of St. Louis. In his lifetime of baseball, you'd imagine, LaRussa has seen everything there is to see. You'd be incorrect. Everyday every pitch is new & feeds his love for the game. Buzz roams far & wide on his subject. Games played years ago & anaylyed pitch by pitch could get tedious. LaRussa's experiences provide the basis for many of the stories. Emotionally, LaRussa has experienced more ups & downs than a high speed elevator. Baseball is cruel, especially to relationships. Baseball is & always will be LaRussa's first love. He know this & so did his wife & his kids, now grown. It's very nature ensues long separations during the best time of the year, summertime. Hall of Fame baseball manager, not so much family man. I still admire him. Every pitch of every game has meaning. LaRussa believes in playing it the right way. Most baseball players don't know how & cettainly most fans don't. I've been a fan for 50 years &, swear if I worked at it I'd bee hard pressed to extract the right thing to do every pitch a fraction of the time. Tony does this for a living.

I even attended perhaps 5-10 games per season at old Tiger Stadium, when--in the era before the giant Government-Corporate Suck Machine (GCSM, pronounced \\"Jasism\\") kicked in--you could enjoy reserved seats close to the dugout for the price of taking your girlfriend out for a nice dinner.

To create \\"3 Nights in August\\" (3NIA), he allowed Buzz Bissinger unprecedented access to his team, his staff, and his inner thoughts and feelings. There are still areas which are off limits, of course, but this access allowed Buzz Bissinger to create a more insightful baseball book than the typical \\"fan book\\". For those baseball fans who imagine themselves to be managers (which is probably most fans other than casual fans), 3NIA provides details on what the job is actually like - but it also leaves the fan/reader thirsting for even more.3NIA is a peak inside the mind of a major league manager, showing the pressures and challenges he has to deal with, and the decisions he has to make over the course of a season, a three game series with an arch-rival in a pennant race, and individual games and at bats. Baseball is a game with many layers and complexities, and 3NIA reveals many of the games within the game, the sub plots, and the background. First and foremost is the human element, in determining the composition of the team (the roster), the roles for the different players, and motivating them to perform their best (something that not even a master like La Russa is capable of doing all the time with all his players). Dealing with injuries, adversities and bruised egos is another major element of a manager's job, and 3NIA reveals many challenges in these areas that don't usually make the papers. This reminds us armchair managers that, when we criticize the decisions of the manager of our favorite team, we simply do not have access to all the information that he does.3NIA also delves into the strategic game decisions that a manager makes. These are important, and La Russa is definitely one of the more creative, innovative MLB managers in this respect, but 3NIA shows that managing the human element is even more important. As all managers do, La Russa has to decide when to punish, encourage and reward, and how best to use these tools to extract maximum performance from his players, some of whom care deeply about being the best they can be, and some who do not.3NIA also reveals the personal and lifestyle challenges that La Russa has faced over the course of his career as a manager. He himself is very dedicated to his job and being the best he can be, and his family has paid a significant price because of this.While Cardinal fans will appreciate 3NIA the most, the book definitely makes worthwhile reading for baseball fans in general."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"First of all, I am a die-hard Cards fan and a big TLR fan, but I think ANY true baseball fan will find this book a great read. It kept my interest from cover to cover. You leave the book knowing without a shadow of a doubt that TLR loves the game of baseball, and takes the losses very personally. And also relishes every win. I walked away with an even better look into what makes TLR tick and why he makes the decisions he does."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I'm biased being a longtime Cardinal fan but any serious baseball fan will get a lot of inside information from this book. I couldn't believe all the things I learning reading about St. Louis manager Tony LaRussa matching wits with Chicago's Dusty Baker.They make the game sound really complicated, maybe more so than it should be, but it's pretty mindboggling all the things that go on in LaRussa's head during a ballgame. I can understand why he is good friends with famous coaches like Bill Belechick and Bobby Knight. All of these guys are obssessed about their jobs and teaching their sports to their players. (They are also all big winners.)Buzz Bissinger does an outstanding job giving so much information with such a little premise: a three-game series in 2003. It's a great character study, though, of LaRussa. You'll never look at this guy the same after reading this book, especially when it concerns what he does with this family. Yup, he's a strange dude!Bissinger is the author of the popular \\"Friday Night Lights,\\" so if you like his style of writing, check out this book. You'll learn a lot of baseball, even if you already know quite a bit."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Loving baseball, though not necessarily the Cardinals, is a pre-requisite for enjoying this book. I've never been much of a LaRussa fan, but Bissinger does a very nice job of capturing LaRussa's intensity and philosophy of baseball.The book uses a three game series against the Cubs in August 2003 to structure a narrative that includes flashbacks to the careers of LaRussa and others to give context to the particular moves and situations confronted during the series. It's a very nice narrative device, used effectively by Jane Leavy in her biography of Sandy Koufax, which was structured around Koufax's perfect game against the (who else?) Cubs in September 1965.LaRussa's appeal is his ability to combine Joe Torre's approach to managing personalities, the instincts of an old time baseball man, and a willingness to question old baseball dogmas in the light of experience and new data. I've always thought that LaRussa overmanaged games, but Bissinger's book does a lot to promote LaRussa as one of the game's top managers.Bissinger credits LaRussa with the major innovations in the evolution of the bullpen (i.e., one inning closers, set up men, and the idea of the bullpen as a calling rather than as a dustbin for rejected starters) and use of videotape. That's a bit of an overstatement. I remember the Yankees using Ron Davis to set up Gossage and even before then I remember Dick Williams using Knowles to set up Fingers. But LaRussa certainly was an important part of this trend.The true baseball fan will love LaRussa's experimentation with replacing the one starter with a cadre of relievers, LaRussa's rejection of the closer-by-committee concept, his strategic calculus during the series, his handling of difficult player personalities, and how LaRussa deals with the beanball. Also, Dave Duncan comes across as one of the great pitching coaches, rivaling old timers like Sain and the more recent gurus like Mazzone. Finally, I was unaware of the influence of Paul Richards on LaRussa and the generation of managers who came to the fore in past 25 years.On the downside, Bissinger overwrites. His flowery and overblown language gets in the way of the story. And he is, of course, too close to LaRussa given the constraints of a project in which he is essentially hired by LaRussa to tell LaRussa's story. Should LaRussa have gotten more out of a player like J.D. Drew? What about the tension between him and a class act like Rolen? Does his intensity and tactical assumptions get in the way of managing personalities to get the most out of them? What about his handling of steroid and substance abusers? These issues would have been explored more thoroughly by a more objective observer.This is definitely a worthwhile book for the baseball aficionado. The general reader may want to steer clear."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"This is one of the best baseball books out there. Bissinger takes the reader to many levels of the game, and gives a lot of insite to Tony LaRussa as a manager and tactician. I strongly recommend this book for any baseball fan. It is a really great read."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"St. Louis skipper Tony La Russa took more heat from this book than any decisions or comments he made during his hall-of-fame managerial career.Teaming with writer Buzz Bissinger, the book chronicles a 2003 three-game series the Cardinals had with the Chicago Cubs. The book weaves through the games through the eyes of La Russa, with outstanding pieces on his life and feelings about the game.At least one player made it known to La Russa - through the proverbial baseball grapevine - that he would no longer autograph items for auction to benefit Tony La Russa's ARF due to several comments in the book.There were other grumblings that made it to print in the national press - especially that Bissinger was attempting to debunk the theory of statistical analysis in the bestselling Moneyball - but Three Nights in August is a true account of what a manager is thinking at the moment something is happening on the field or in the dugout. That it was a true account puts the negative comments in perspective.A reader will not get any closer to the action or gain a better appreciation on the life off the field of La Russa."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"The word Genius is vastly overused in society today and I hesitated using it because it's almost lost its meaning. But when it comes to the game of Baseball, Tony LaRussa is a genius. He's one of the great minds and thinkers the game has ever had. he's a four-time Manager of the year. Look at his record and you will see a guy who isn't all that much above .500 with a career .534 winning %. But in the fickle game of baseball, LaRussa has been able to to something few managers have ever been able to do...that is to put a competitive team out on the field and do so consistently. In his 25 year managerial career LaRussa's teams have finished in one of the top 3 spots in their division 18 times including 10 first place finishes. That is truly astounding!This book is a real testament to his \\"genius\\" a man who is so thoughtful and cerebral, you wonder how he can stand to deal with so many of today's primadonna athletes. The book focuses primarily on a three game series versus the hated rival Chicago Cubs. Buzz Bissinger takes an analytical eye and breaks down everything LaRussa does during these games from making out his lineups to deciding on which relief pitcher to use. LaRussa is like a Boy Scout ten-fold, virtually prepared for any situation and playing every angle he can to his advantage.We further hear LaRussa's insights on the major problem in baseball today...steroids, as well as the Manager's way of dealing with star athletes. A truly fascinating book for any true fan of baseball."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"This lifelong Cardinals fan managed to get through the book, but it's hard to imagine any non Cardinals fan who is not a speed reader doing the same.Though I am not an obsessive baseball fan (haven't seen a game even on TV for nearly 20 years), the in-game stategies Bissinger details are nothing surprising; in context, anyone, experienced or not, would seem likely to come up with them. Readers will learning virtually nothing here.To give Bissinger a break, it seems he agreed and perhaps signed a contract to write this book without realizing there would not be anything to say.Bissinger does not deserve a break for his criticisms of Lewis' \\"Moneyball,\\" however. (The hardback edition of \\"3 Nights,\\" perhaps, is not so strongly positioned against that far better book, but the paperback I read contains an afterword devoted entirely to trashing Lewis' book without (a) any understanding of it, (b) apparently, a rereading of it, and (c) any evidence whatsoever to butress Bissinger's \\"ya gotta have heart\\" position.Likewise, Bissinger deserves no break for the horribly bad, lazy prose here. Examples: Pujols is referred to in his first 20 or so mentions as \\"the great Pujols.\\" No variations (not even \\"the really great\\") of the phrase are used. Page 275: a player plays \\"each and every game at five hundred percent.\\" Page 254: a World Series victory is marked by a \\"Rubik's Cube of a hug.\\" Page 243 (and elsewhere): \\"sultry hot,\\" as if \\"sultry\\" does not imply \\"hot.\\" Page 224: \\"white hair as finely woven as pasta.\\" This is the kind of writing folks compose deliberately to win bad writing contests.Disappointingly, the paperback edition, at least, doesn't even have any pictures.Stay away from this one."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I picked this up because my beloved White Sox are playing great baseball and I'm becoming consumed by this wonderful season. I tore through the book and recommend it highly for anyone who loves the game and wants to swim in the lore and detail of it. It's a great job of reporting and a wonderful appreciation of how the game should be approached. I could nitpick about some of the moments that annoyed me, but they are miniscule, a pop fly in a 10-9 slugfest. I loved this book."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"For all of the hype and attention this book received, this has to be one of the most disappointing baseball books I have ever read. I read this book hoping to gain a deeper understanding of the inner workings of managerial strategy than a fan usually has; instead I was treated to excessive fawning over simplistic ideas and well as a lack of understanding of baseball and its' statistics. The author italicizes the phrase \\"hit and run\\" as if it were a copy writ invention of Tony LaRussa. He acts amazed at the idea that managers and pitching coaches actually plot out pitching matchups in advance [and refers to that plan as the Thing of Beauty (his caps, not mine) ad nauseum]. He describes a curveball that doesn't break as going from \\"a killer 12 to 6 morphing into a very mortal 12 to 3\\" when what he is trying to say is that it flattens out in the center of the plate. He quotes the statistical line of pitcher Garrett Stephenson from 2000 and 2001 to show how off of a year he is having when anyone can see that the only significant change is his won-loss record, which is more of an indication of run support from teammates. He tries to prove that Albert Pujols has the best start of a career of \\"any player in the history of the game\\" by comparing his early career stats to those of Barry Bonds and Alex Rodriguez, as if they are the two best players in the history of the game, and as if that would in turn mean that they had the best two year start of any players.. He refers to the video room operator as the Cardinals \\"secret weapon\\", as if they are the only team to do this. He calls Rich Ankiel a \\"once in a millennium\\" lefthander, which not only would make him the best lefthander in the history of baseball but also as likely to remain so for the next 900 years. He describes an early August game between the Cardinals and Cubs (who are about tied for first place) as one that \\"the Cards cannot lose if they want to remain in the division race\\". I could go on and on but the basic idea is that one gets the impression that Bissinger just DOES NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT BASEBALL. In addition, he has an atrocious writing style, with overstated metaphors and similes on almost every page. I would recommend this book for masochists who enjoy having their blood pressure shoot through the roof, as well as to any immediate family members of the author who would be so proud as to render them oblivious to the books' faults."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I was a bit disappointed because I read \\"Men at Work\\" 15 years ago and much of this reads the same as the LaRussa chapter did in that book. The chapters herein that divert from the finer details of Larussa's internal thought process with strategy are the most interesting parts of the book. The Kile, Robinson, Ainkiel chapters are where Bissinger does his best. However, Bissinger fails to deliver on communicating the passion of this rivalry the way he so masterfully delivered on attacking that angle of the passionate fans in \\"Friday Night Lights.\\" Cardinal fans will love it because they love everything Cardinals. Bissinger fans will like it. Regular baseball fans of other teams will see this book as average."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"If you are a baseball fan you will love this book.As baseball is said to be the great American pasttime, the St. Louis Cardinals are one of the great original teams.3 Nights in August is an inside look at the Cardinals' up and down season in 2003, disecting what would prove to be one of the pivotal matchups of the pennant race between the Cardinals and the Chicago Cubs.The dramatic story had me rivited to the book the futher I got into it. Like a fast car that starts out slow, the story slowly builds into an epilogue that is impossible to resist. Bissinger explained a whole side of the game of baseball that I had never considered even in my over one-hundred games of attendance. Hey, as long as the beer is cold and a team is playing right? His explanations of strategy were thrilling. The stories about stealing bases, signs, explanation of fielding techniques were priceless.Bissinger also delves into the mind of Tony Larussa. Although LaRussa is mediocre as far as post-season goes compared to other Cardinal coaches, he is one of the older breed who really use psychology in the game rather than relying primarily on statistics. LaRussa's coaching strategy is so thorougly disected that I cannot wait to attend another game and really pay attention to things that had escaped my notice in the past.Stories about the human side of baseball were also empowering. In this day and age of mind-numbing salaries and stories of juicing, reading about Darryl Kile and his family was heartbreaking. Reading into the emotional side of greats such as Albert Pujols, Scott Rolen, and Jim Edmunds brought a real dose of personality to an otherwise stoic game. Perhaps the best part of the book is the description of emotions and problems that pitchers have to face, be it mental or physical, dealing with the sore arm, bum ankle, or damaged ego, while describing their reactions to events during the game.This book has special meaning to me because I've been a lifelong Cardinals fan and attended game 3 that was described in the book, flying halfway across the country to catch one of the pre-eminent matchups in MLB. The image of the Kerry Robinson walkoff home run in the 9th inning will never be erased from my mind. I'll never forget the Cubs fans sitting in the row ahead who we had been hecking with the whole game jumping up to give us high-fives. I'll never forget the fans in old Busch Stadium jumping to their feet in a deafining roar that isn't adequately portrayed in the book. A squadron of F-15 fighter jets could have flown over and no one would have noticed at that special moment.Thank you Mr. Bissinger for a great read that brings back many good memories of the St. Louis Cardinals and the wonderful game of baseball."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"This book is fabulous. I am only about 2/3rds through it, but I like the book so much, I had to write about it. The book is so compelling, I have to constantly remind myself that this is a tale of true events and not a non-fiction thriller.Between the strategy, stats and gut instincts, La Russa shows his affectiveness from pitch to pitch as well as helplessness when dealing with human spirit and bitter ironic situations. I'm not really a Cards fan, but have always been a fan of La Russa and this book shows exactly why he is admired."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"This book is a great chance to see what goes on in the many hours between baseball games and the life of an athlete on the road. Stories of Rick Ankiel and J.D. Drew are great examples of the perils of the modern athlete, while the part about Daryl Kile will tear out your heart! Reading about the seeming indifference of a gifted athlete like Jose Canseco can make one question why they believe in baseball, but then there's the story of Albert Pujols to restore one's faith. By the way, Bissinger mentions about Canseco's apathy about playing during the 1990 season without following up with the Oakland A's getting swept by the mighty underdog Red in the Series that year. My big question after reading the book is, \\"How does Tony LaRussa continue to function while getting so little sleep?\\""},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"A well written book that provided some insight into the game, particularly the thought process of a manager. For that I give it three stars.But '3 Nights' was neither as enlightening nor thought provoking as a 5-star sports book - such as 'The Game' by Ken Dryden, 'Beyond the Sixth Game' by Gammons, or Lewis' 'Moneyball'. At times, Bissigner's work came across more as a hero worship of La Russa than a study of the game, which detracted from the author's credibility to accurately assess what he witnessed and learned from the dugout."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"If you have played or managed baseball at any level, this book is for you. This book offers a great view of the game from the manager's perspective. Even if the reader has never managed a baseball team the author goes into great detail explaining (through Tony La Russa's eyes) that this game is won not only by statistics, it is won by the desire, the hart, and by having a winning attitude. Is a great book, I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Buzz Bissinger is an absolutly fantastic writer. This book combines an indepth behind the scenes look at Larussa and others, but also gives a lot of inside info on players like JD Drew, Pujols, and others.

But it is so much more than just a series in August. Wonderful book about baseball. I learned many things."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I love the game of baseball and often wonder why someone does what he does in some situations. This book is a great insight into a great manager's thoughts and actions. It shows how the game has changed over the years, how the strategy has changed and how one split second can screw up an entire months worth of planning.I love hearing what he saw in players as they came into the game, and what he thinks of them now in comparrison. A very informative book. Too short in my opinion but packed full of knowledge."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I was able to get through this book because (a) I hate starting something and not finishing it and (b) I love baseball.Bissinger often trumpets his own book as a primary counterpoint to \\"Moneyball.\\" Moneyball, Michael Lewis' bestselling book, hailed the approach of A's General Manager Billy Beane and is synonymous with the recent trend of baseball \\"statheads\\" of emphasizing statistical analysis and de-emphasizing traditional methods, such as in-person scouting and stealing bases. While Moneyball was quite deferential to Beane, the book was very smartly written, and if one has read any of Lewis' books, Moneyball fits along the theme of Lewis' preference to profile individuals who have thought outside of the box to get results.In a way, Bissinger's book is the \\"anti-Moneyball\\" in the sense that it is anti-intelligent. The book is not particularly well written; Bissinger has an interesting yet distracting way of trying to come up with original similes and metaphors that usually come off as less than artful. Just off the top of my head, I remember one example, paraphrased: \\"Kenny Lofton watched the pitch go by like someone who had just seen a passing car the make and model of which he was not sure of.\\"In addition, Bissinger often uses statistics for his own ends, but uses them improperly. For example, early in the book, he compares the statistics of a struggling 2003 Garrett Stephenson to the \\"breakout\\" year that Garrett Stephenson had in 2000. If you look at the stats that Bissinger himself provides, the ERA, K rate, and WHIP are nearly identical for both years; the only difference is wins and losses. Even LaRussa knows himself that wins and losses by themselves don't evidence a pitcher's merit; they are based largely on luck and run support.Due to inaccuracies like this, uninspired writing and overly deferential treatment to LaRussa and the Cardinals, I found Bissinger to be less than credible in anything he said. So even when he spun what should have been a heart rending tale regarding the late Darryl Kile, I found it hard to take anything he said at face value.All that being said, I have always liked Tony LaRussa as a manager. He deserves credit for being able to win his second World Series this past year with the worst team in history ever to win a World Series."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Yes, I'm a Cards fan and thus a little biased. But, Bissinger nails the ballplayer atmosphere perfectly and this is just an outstanding read. As a former college & minor league player, I can say he's definitely captured things very well. The only way to improve this book would be to make it about 5x's longer. Ha!"},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I was fairly excitd about this new book from Buzz Bissenger being a baseball fan and loving Friday Night Lights as well, I was sure that this book was going to be a grand slam. full of all soorts of insights into the game I love. Although the book was good it wasn't great and maybe I was looking for something that isn't always possible a follow up book that was as good than the breakout ( Friday Night Lights)Bissenger is a good author and has a great ability to frame the content, but I thought this book bounced around to much from past Cardinal experiances to the present task of writing about the series against the Cubs. It was a bit choppy in the transitions and left a bit to be desired.However the part about Daryl Kile was brilliant and I did especially like the insight into Larussa's almost manic style of decision making.So I guess the question is would I have liked this book better had I not read Friday Night lights and had those expectations?....Probably Not"},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"This is a very good sports genre book, but it could have been a little bit better. I was very skeptical when I picked it up, but I was very pleased by the end. it covered Tony La Russa as he prepared and executed his game plan around a series in 2003 against their arch-rivial Chicago Cubs. It covers him handling the Kile situation in 2002, how him & his wife handle his job, and gives his opinion on several of his players. As I read it, I was waiting for the obvious question: How did he get into management and choose it over the legal profession?. It never came.The writer also starts off comparing the rivally of the Cubs and Cards - and how it is more intense than the Yanks and Red Soxs - No Way!It is a great book for the baseball fan, but especially a St. Louis fan.Above average for a sports-genre book."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I enjoy reading books about sports because of several reasons. First, I think it is a difficult genre to write effectively in without falling into play by play that is often difficult to translate into interesting narrative. Second, I'm often interested in the dynamic of team players and managers to see what breeds success. I picked up this book because I was interested to read about LaRussa and the success he's enjoyed.However, several paragraphs in the preface turned me off so much that I could not continue reading the book and wouldn't recommend it to any thirtysomething. This is the term used to downplay any success a thirtysomething could have. According to the author, there is no way the thirtysomething could have passion for the game, or know the history, or even care about it. Despite the author's obvious success with Friday Night Lights, he feels compelled to disparage Moneyball, a book I am familiar with, but have not read.If you think I've said thirtysomething enough times, I'm getting close to how many times he used it in the preface. Thirtysomethings have seen strike shortened seasons, watched the World Series canceled not because of a World War, but because grown men couldn't agree on what's best for baseball, seen arguably the best player ever bet on his sport, seen players pine tar, juice up, and rub baseballs with finger files so is it any wonder a thirtysomething may be a little skeptical of anyone's passion or commitment to the game?I may pick up the book again, omitting the preface, but as some reviews have mentioned, it seems the diatribe continues. What is the motivation? Who cares? Not this thritysomething."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"If you believe that Tony LaRussa invented baseball, this is the book for you. Otherwise you will find Buzz Bissinger's take on baseball's most overrated manager to be a trite piece of [...].A detailed description of Tony LaRussa and the Cardinals going through a 3 game series with the Cubs in 2003 is the focus of the book. The author attempts to show two things. First, how great Tony LaRussa is and secondly how complex managing a baseball game is. The author succeds on the first point as he fawns completly over his subject. On the second point, he fails greatly.Bissinger details each and every managerial decision that LaRussa makes as if he is building a space shuttle by himself. Baseball fans completely understand the decisions that LaRussa (and Dusty Baker) are making in real time and do not need them dumbed down for them as Bissinger does in this book.However, that is not the worst part of the book. Bissinger goes out of his way to knock anyone using statistical analysis (read the Moneyball crowd) to evaluate players while praising LaRussa for be able to utilize statistics. The reader is left to belive that Bissinger did not understand this paradox because he does not understand the game of baseball particulary well.The book also includes a significant amount of complaining about the money that the players of today are making for their efforts. This is amusing since LaRussa is among the top compensated managers in the game. Based on the fact that Super Manager LaRussa is 5-12 is World Series games and 1-3 in the World Series (In each series his team was a significant to prohibitive favorite.), Bissinger's arrows about being overpaid are shot at the wrong target.If you are a baseball fan who wants to learn something about the game, there are plenty of GOOD to GREAT books out there. Three Nights in August is not of them."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I love Tony LaRussa, as I'm an A's fan. However, Bissinger has an agenda with this book. He wants it to be the anti Moneyball. He doesn't believe in the philisophy of using statistics to judge performance and make decisions. He has said this, and attacked Michael Lewis' Moneyball without offering any kind of decent rebuttal. He goes on some rant that humans aren't machines and that the human element is important. Yes, every person is different \\"Buzz,\\" and statistics are just a way of quantifying those differences. 4 postseason appearances for the A's and a world series title for the Red Sox bear out the success of sabermetrics. It's here to say, despite the fact that stubborn baseball people hate it because it destroys so much of their outmoded and inefficient ideas and strategies."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Though the title suggests that this book will be a tedious breakdown of three St. Louis Cardinals games towards the end of Summer, \\"Three Nights in August\\" is far more than that.In actuality, \\"Three Nights in August\\" dissects a pivotal three-game series for the Cardinals against their rivals, the Chicago Cubs, in a way never before seen in print. A single key decision of whether or not to replace the starting pitcher becomes a chapter about the resurgence of a relief pitcher who has had more than his fair share of arm surgeries. A single phone call on the way to the stadium becomes several chapters about finding and developing talent and how it can all go awry with the quirkiest of injuries.Within each and every page of this book, there is depth that one will not find in other books about baseball. As a fan of LaRussa's all the way back to when he coached the Oakland A's, I never had a clue how much was going on between his ears until now.You can't read this book and not come away with a genuine respect for LaRussa and how much he has to deal with in order to be the manager of a Major League team.You also cannot read this book and not come away with a deep appreciation for the way author Buzz Bissinger turned the minutiae of baseball into an multi-layered, compelling, yet somehow still easy to follow story.It might be a bit much for fringe fans, but if you are a true baseball fan, this book is a must read."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I bought this book in an airport and read it over several days on airplanes. It held my interest pretty well. It compares well to some of the best baseball writers and is a mix of story-line and analysis. Basically it covers a 3 game series between the Cubs and Cards in August 2003. There are several excursions into timelines of various players and events, but mostly the book is an analysis of the players and the games in this series.One strength of this book is how it portrays the character of the teams involved. Teams and stadiums have very distinct characters. For example, when I lived in Chicago the Cubs games at Wrigley field were fairly laid back. They were almost always day games because the community restricts how often the lights can be on. This meant you had to take a day off work to see them. Tickets were easy to come by, and you parked on some guys lawn for 5 bucks. On the other hand, I never came home from a game at Old Comiskey Park without being drenched with beer. The gestalt of a game at Wrigley vs. a game at Comiskey was completely different.But the funny thing about this book is that I keep remembering parts of it as I watch games and the insights in it are incredibly useful. I live between a rookie league team (Ogden Raptors - Dodgers) and an AAA team (Salt Lake - Angels). Over and over some insight in this book will come to mind as I watch some future major-leaguer. Ex-manager Tommy Lasorda is at the Ogden games fairly frequently and after reading this book I can more often figure out just what it is in some minor-leaguers play that gets Lasorda swearing. And as I see the bonus babies from Ben Sheets to Prince Fielder come through the rookie league I can better evaluate the players and see what their managers are looking for. The net result: the game is more enjoyable.I'm not into fantasy leagues. I don't pay attention to the new esoteric stats. I just love to spend summer evenings watching baseball with my sons with the Rocky Mountains as a backdrop to some awesome minor league stadiums. In the book, the author uses a phrase - \\"Beautiful. Just beautful baseball.\\" And after reading this book, I find myself muttering this to myself as I watch a well-executed bunt or a heads-up base-running play that brings in a run.This book is not a statistical primer. It does almost have a little too much hero worship of Cardinals manager Tony LaRussa. But you don't have to be a fanatic to enjoy this book which has the pacing of a good ball game - sometimes up, sometimes down but just right in the end."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Friday Night Lights was a great book - this one is just ok. Bissinger uses unnecessarily flowery language to complicate a book that really doesn't need it. There's really no stunning revelations in here aside from LaRussa ripping some former players. The baseball strategy examined is beginner to moderate level, nothing too complicated.It's an easy read, but certainly not a must-have for baseball fans."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I strongly disagree with another persons review of this book. This book is not at all about a Moneyball vs. Old School Baseball Mentality. Yes the author does state that he does disagree with a statistics only mentality of the game. However I believe that the authors real purpose is to share the hidden gems of this wonderful game.Anyway, I just finished reading this book and I can honestly say that this is the best baseball book that I have read in a while. I am a huge baseball fan and I was consumed with the intimate details that Bissinger provides of some of the Cardinal players and their opponents (Cubs) during this crucial three-game series in late in August.I've always said that if you don't like the game of baseball, your not paying attention. This book is great at pointing out the strategies and the behind the scene moves that make up a baseball game.I highly recommend it for all baseball fans and those that want to know more about the game."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I'll confess to begin that I am a true St. Louis Cardinals fan! That being said, for any Cardinals fan this is a good book. Get yourself a copy! It's great to read. There a great insights and profiles of the team. For anyone with a desire to see a little further behind the scenes of MLB, this is also a good book. There is however nothing new here. Mr. Bissinger states at the begining that this book is sort of the answer to Michael Lewis' \\"Moneyball\\". I don't see that. I suggest reading them both. \\"3 Nights in August\\" and \\"Moneyball\\" both shed light on baseball and human nature and the fundamentals of success."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"It's hard to believe the Tony LaRussa in 3 Nights in August is the same expressionless man I see in the dugout every Cardinals game.I'm a huge baseball fan and a coach, and I recommend this book to every ball player before he begins playing in high school. The book was educational for me as a coach, and I wish I'd have read it when I was playing. As a fan, it's easy for me disagree with a manager's decisions when he puts in a .230 average utility infielder in a close game, but two of my favorite topics in the book are the importance of bench management and developing younger players.My only complaint about the book is Buzz Bissinger's vocabulary. I read because I enjoy it and it keeps my mind sharp. I have reasonable intelligence and a decent vocabulary. But I think Bissinger, like too many authors, sacrifices the flow of the story to boast his own vocabulary, and, in the process, he makes the reader feel intellectually-inferior. Any word that isn't used at least rarely in a conversation should be equally absent in a book. It's frustrating when I'm reading about baseball and I have to stop to figure out or look up the meaning of words like leitmotif.Aside from the abundance of unnecessary foreign words, I loved the book. Bissinger did a great job of showing the different personalities of the Cardinals players, coaches, and behind-the-scenes workers."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Buzz Bissinger is a talented journalist and writer, who knows how to tell good stories about the people who play and manage sports. He also has the ability to capture some of the beautiful complexity of baseball, as seen through the eyes of Tony LaRussa, and play it out in ways that make the book difficult to put down. He does not approach his subject with the sublime wit infused throughout Michael Lewis's Moneyball. Nor does he go so far as to deconstruct the whole game, like George Will did in Men at Work: The Craft of Baseball. While I rank those books above this one, you will find Three Nights in August a thoroughly satisfying read if you read and liked those books."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I've always thought that managing, in general, is a skill much overrated by many baseball fans. My personal bias aside, though, this is an interesting book both in terms of the game, and in terms of the look inside the mind of a man considered one of the great managers of our generation.This book will not impress the casual fan, or anyone reading it simply because they've like Bissinger's past work. There's a ton of detail about baseball that might cause many to tune out, but it's worth sticking with. Larussa is obviously an intelligent man, and that comes across in his discussions on several topics. He also possesses an obvious love for the game, which many fans will appreciate.There's a reason why Larussa has won several managerial awards, beyond the fact that he's managed a number of talent-laden teams. He understands the game, and he strikes a good balance between the science of baseball and managerial intuition. He wants to win at almost any cost, but he also cares about his players and organization.Love or hate him - and there are many in both camps - Larussa is a fascinating baseball character. This should prove of interest to any fan of Larussa, the Cards, or baseball in general."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I was really lookinig forward to reading this book. To me, Tony LaRussa is one of the best in-game managers in baseball and this book promised to give us an inside look at his mindset and strategies throughout a 3 game series with the Cubs. Overall? Not bad and, especially early on, I was enjoying the book and the intimacy of \\"seeing\\" LaRussa's thought process in various situations. It simply didn't last throughout, or it seemed to bog down or become repetitive. I enjoyed the book as a whole, but the latter third of it became slow, almost tedious at times."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"An incredible work of art!!I myself am a Cardinals fan, but that does not mean that this book isn't a great read for any fan of baseball. I have friends and co-workers who are fans of the dreaded Cubs, they have read this book and loved it as well!\\"Three Nights in August\\" finally gives the sports fan a look at all of the work and strategy that goes into managing a baseball team. If anyone out there thought that it would be an easy job, think again... Buzz goes into Tony's daily routines during the season, and it's hard to believe the man can stand up let alone manage the greatest team in baseball. I don't know how he does it getting a mere 5 hours of sleep a night!?!?This book does a great job showing the stress and incite of a manager and how they must deal with it everyday. A wonderful book that should be read by anyone who is a true fan of the game!"},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Bissinger does a fantastic job of paining mental pictures for the reader and really takes you inside LaRussa's mind. The book exceeded my expectations, and sheds some light on many managerial decisions that are made during the course of a game, series, or season."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"About this time of year, I begin counting the days until spring training. To fill the void until the baseball season begins, I read baseball books and dream...This is a great baseball book and I have never liked Tony LaRussa. But now, after reading this book, I can appreciate the intensity that he approaches baseball with and yes, I also have a respect for him that I didn't have before. He and Dave Duncan are baseball guys through and through.While the book is mostly about the three games between the Cardinals and Cubs at a crucial point in the 2003 season, Tony and Buzz Bizzinger do not get caught up in describing every pitch and play of the game but instead offer colorful stories about the Cardinal and Cub baseball players such as Rick Ankiel, Jason Isringhausen, Steve Kline and Mark Prior. These stories gave me glimpses of the players that even as a baseball fan, I didn't know. As a Red Sox and a Giants fan, it was also interesting to see some of the players that later played for the Sox and the Giants early in their baseball careers.It was also great fun to see games through the eyes of a manager - I will think twice before yelling at the TV set when I think I can manage better then Francona or Bochy!"},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Outstanding book. If you have ever wanted to get inside the head of a professional manager, this is your chance!"},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"If you've ever wondered what it takes to be a leader -- the commitment, the focus, the almost obsessive compulsion that drives excellence then this book is a great backdrop. La Russa demonstrates what it takes to lead a team at such an elite level, the impact winning and losing has on his players and himself and how he develops the talent and manages ego...sounds eerily similar to the business world."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I must admit I'm a Cardinal fan of more than 50 years, but I really felt this is one of the FIVE BEST BOOKS I've ever read about baseball. The description of the inner workings of today's clubhouse and management structure were fascinating and very well written. I can see where people get the impression that LaRussa is a self-absorbed egotist, as this book would seem to support that impression. I am a 59-yearold male."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I will never see Tony the same again.

I loved being able to get behind the scene's and into the mind of LaRussa. Exceptional, a great read for any baseball fan. A must read for all St. Louis Cardinals fan!!"},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I would rate it as one of the top 10 baseball books - but, undoubtedly, behind Men at Work. 3 Nights in August contained much useful information (both coaching ideas and personal). I felt like I was an eye witness to the on goings in the dugout. My only point of contention is that I feel the author was too hard on J D Drew. True, I have not interacted with him since the CWS, but I didn't get the feeling he was the selfish baby he was portrayed to be. I am a die hard Astros fan, but I caught myself cheering for the Redbirds. All in all a good read - I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I read this book in hopes of finding out I was justified in not liking Tony Larussa. Quite the opposite. I have an undying respect for the man now.I will always be a Cubs fan but I will now look even more forward to the rivalry they have with the Cardinals. This book was as fair to the enemy as it was as hard on the hero. Well written, great history but I don't know if it can carry to the big screen as is rumoured."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I enjoyed the book. A good and quick read for baseball fans to fill in The Void between the World Series and Spring Training. It is too long. The author needlessly falls in love with his descriptive abilities. It is sometimes repetitive. But the idea to focus on a single three-game series was brilliant. I think the picture that emerges of LaRussa helps to explain some of his failures in the postseason. The man is way too uptight for this game. His success is a product of his preparation, but in a short series (Post Season) the team that plays looser may be better off. It seems to me it would be hard to play loose with LaRussa at the helm. I think the Cardinals reflect his personality--a joyless club. A similar study of Ozzie Guillen would provide an interesting contrast."},{"Title":"My Life's History","review":"Edited by Otto Kallir, Grandma Moses' benefactor and promoter. Compiled from her own notes, and dictations given to Hildegard Bachert, Grandma Moses authored, reviewed and approved this autobiography prior to publication.I picked up this book as part of my research into what distinguishes \\"contentedly successful\\" people from \\"unsuccessful\\" or \\"greedily successful\\" ones.I'm glad I did.Without ruining her story for you I will say I thoroughly enjoyed hearing how this woman combined a natural talent, passion and a simple understanding of business necessity and opportunity into a life well-lived. It's well-written and provides clear insight into the kind of thinking that made the United States the place of opportunity it is today.Someone told me, and I believe it's safe to estimate that Grandma Moses made at least a hundred times more money between the ages of 86 and 101 than she and her husband made together during her first 86 years.Her stoic and down-to-earth approach to faith and life are remarkable.Hardcopy may be hard to find, but it's worth a little looking. If you catch yourself saying, I'm too old to change or I'm too old to do more with my life - you owe it to yourself to get and read this book, because you're wrong!Age doesn't keep you from pursuing your life's dreams - only your choice can do that."},{"Title":"The angry millionaire","review":"She was the chief computer programmer for Hammond and Morgan, the third largest merchant bank in the world. The name plaque on the corner of her desk said &quot;V. Norton&quot;. She was blond and beautiful and cold.Especially cold, at least at the beginning, to John Addis, who was in lowly research and who was short and didn't seem very glamorous.Of course, Miss Norton couldn't have known about John's devoted aunt, Mrs. Acantha Morgan, or that John's cousin Bertie was Herbert Hammond, chairman and managing director of Hammond and Morgan.In spite of what she didn't know, and perhaps because of what John did know, Miss Norton found herself asking him to go to work for her as a bodyguard and a chauffeur. She was involved in an interesting enterprise. It included having John driver her around in a Bentley while she moved ahead with her plans.John chauffeured her and eventually changed everyone's plans...even in the face of undercover, between the sheets, and across the continent activities, not all of them absolutely honest.This is a delicious, exciting, and charmingly sophisticated book which should enchant a host of readers."},{"Title":"Where Did the Tracks Go: Following Railroad Grades in the Adirondacks","review":"This is the second-best book on Railroads of the Adirondacks.

I'm usually very careful to read reviews before I purchase a book, as I always have a stack of reading material waiting for my attention.) Crazy to Kill by Ann Cardwell (pseud.) is a very short, fast read and so I finished it, eager to see why this book is labeled \\"a classic\\". The setting sounds excellent for a murder mystery: a private mental institution. There is supposed to be much humor along the way to a surprise ending: what little humor there was in this book was unconscious, and the ending was no surprise -- the author telegraphed it awkwardly in almost every chapter. Furthermore, the \\"surprise\\" device she used had been done so much better over a decade before this book was first published (1941), in a much talked about novel by a very famous author -- Cardwell must have read it, or at least read about it.In a period of less than a week two female nurses and a male nurse are killed and another nurse attacked and unable to name her attacker; (note: I may have forgotten a murder or two!) Someone in the male patients' wing howls from a padded cell in the basement of this upscale institution; it turns out to be a brilliant brain surgeon who has regular periods of insanity but is able to perform delicate surgery during his sane periods. (The science in this book is not only dated, but must have been ridiculous even in the '40s). Characters are added and described as if important to the story, but then fade to nonentity. One patient sleeps through most of the book and then suddenly becomes alert at the end of the book, sporting bizarre clothes and equally bizarre slang.The detective lieutenant in charge of investigating the murders is a cigar-chewing, derby-wearing example of the worst 1930s movie detective, the stereotypical dumb flatfoot. In fact, as implied above, most of the characters are stereotypes from the worst fiction/movies, situations are improbable and conversation reads as if it had been copied from a discarded script.If you think I missed the point, and this is really parody, I'd appreciate it if you'd find a copy of the book, read it carefully and then write a comment to this review. I am not unfamiliar with satire, parody, send-ups, put-ons and the like: my B.A. was in English lit., my M.A. in library science and my doctorate in reflective teaching. I enjoy humorous mystery stories, especially those with the dry wit of the English \\"Oxbridge\\" sort. If I missed a point, it was how this pathetic publication escaped the eyes of a decent editor."},{"Title":"Limnology: Lake and River Ecosystems","review":"This is an excellent general reference text.

This book contains a combination of his vast personal experience with the enormous amount of information that has been generated through the end of the 1990s. The book, perhaps more approprately referred to as a tome, addresses virtually every sub-discipline included in the field of limnology. And, the book is well cited, with well over 100 pp of citations.The book contains abundant examples, explanations, and descriptions of all things limnological. He has also beefed his treatment of rivers and streams, which was more or less missing in the 1st edition. Still, the strength of this book is clearly the information on ponds and lakes.This is an outstanding reference book - I'd probably award it 4 or 4.5 stars if a reference is all it were used for (it is a bit out of date now).2) Review of this product at a textbook:My first limnology course used Wetzel's first edition...a much smaller book, and much more easily digested than either the second or third editions. That was in my first year of graduate school. Since then Wetzel's book increased in size by format and number of pages in the 2nd editon, and even moreso in the 3rd edition.The third edition can be downright intimidating when you see it.The third edition's usefulness as a reference book has increased greatly, but at the cost of reducing its usefullness as a text. I am still weighing my options about a text for my limnology class in the fall (I wasn't pleased with Kalff's offering - the book I used last time), but I wonder whether Wetzel's 3rd edition is just too big, too long, and too focused on being a reference book rather than a textbook.I noticed that little has been updated in terms of figures...I still recognize many of the figures from the 1st edition that are still in the 3rd. The impression I get from this book is that this is more or less Wetzel's crowning achievement in terms of a complete treatment of the discipline, but that has been achieved mainly by adding to what he already had rather than by editing and updating. And, with a 2001 publication date, this edition is now in serious need of further updating and revision.I wish someone would take this project on, update it, revise it, and whittle it down to a lean and mean useful text of perhaps 600 pages.I'm still in a quandry about using it as a textbook.I'm afraid that I have to give it 3 or 3.5 stars as a textbook because of its massive bulk, the intimidation factor, and it's being somewhat out of date.All in all, I still like this book better than that of Kalff.4 stars..."},{"Title":"Limnology: Lake and River Ecosystems","review":"Well there is no doubt that this book contains a large amount of information, it CANNOT be used as an introductory text.

Genuinely confident women should use this book to recognize the type of man they should run like hell \\"away from\\". Author Sherry Argov makes it clear that dating and love that lead to marriage is all about playing games; first she gets you to understand the games that all men (according to her) play; then she attempts to teach you how to be the winner and pass their endless tests (to enter into a serious relationship with or even marry the LOSER of these games?--WHAT?). Its clear she chose the word \\"bitch\\" on purpose although she tries to redefine it: She tries to make the word bitch sound like a good thing but most people understand a bitch to be selfish, manipulative, \\"outwardly confident\\", and bossy woman so this book actually sums the word up correctly. The author repeatedly asks the reader, 'who would want to want to enter into a lasting relationship with a woman who is nice and who gives too much of herself too easily and too soon because she's not a mental challenge or worth the chase to a man'. I think the real question here is who wants to marry a cookie-cutter caveman who can be easily manipulated, is impressed by selfishness, mistreatment and false confidence, is easily predictable, and can be trained to be loyal (like a pet)? This book teaches a woman to catch the type of man who initially didn't respect her and who SHE won't respect later. This book describes ONE type of guy, not every man. It needs to be made clear that the man who is a selfish \\"player\\" of these games and who childishly tests women deserves the manipulative and equally selfish woman this book preps her to be. Getting a man to love you and want to marry you for MISTREATING him more than he mistreats you SOUNDS STUPID doesn't it? Isn't this the man you want to marry one day? Its exhausting and unnecessary to play so many games and to be so selfish in order to get a guy to take you seriously -- which I might add are the building blocks for divorce. The author fails to teach that it is extremely important for a woman to have a healthy confidence, self-esteem, and self-respect that model for her potential mate how she should be treated. By contrast, being emotionally detached, aloof, and self-centered are only false \\"appearances\\" of self-esteem and are NOT healthy. Being selfish and manipulative aren't desirable qualities in a person who wants to share her life with a \\"quality\\" man. What makes this book love-able is its hilariously funny word choices and humorous delivery--thats the extent of it. I propose a different title: \\"Why CERTAIN men love bitches\\". If you recognize your guy in this book, dump him immediately and remember that bitches only APPEAR to be confident. If playing relationship games, faking confidence, and passing tests isn't true to your nature, DON'T DO IT AND DON'T DATE MEN WHO DO."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I gave this book as a gift to a friend of mine who always seems to be getting hurt by men even though she is the sweetest person.

Women, read this & pass it on to your daughters, so we can build a generation of stronger & more confident women with the help of this book!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This book is just awesome. I bought one also for my friend who used its techniques with great results as well. It's about time we women had an idea of what motivates men, & I love having the inside edge. I'm now in a great relationship with an awesome guy and this book was my bible to get there. Not that I couldn't have done it before, but when you need help to counteract your natural tendencies to run after what you want, this book will help you be sexy, sit back, and get your guy to run after you. And actually, as the book says, he's really more happy doing that. I recommend this to any women of any age who just needs to feel great about herself and who also wants to get and keep a GREAT guy. In fact, I think I'll go read my dog-eared copy again today!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This is an awesome book. I read this book in two days, almost missed my stop on the train. A true page turner with its excellent insight and advice. Every woman should read this book before she goes on her next date."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This book is well written, however, what is its message? Be tough and he'll run to you with open arms? Never show him you love him, next he'll glue a ring on your finger and you'll be living happily ever after? The question is whether that is what today's women want? To be honest, I don't think so. Rather than guiding women to rely on men while having a zero character and independence, a woman must learn to trust herself first. Why at all chase a man, or fight to win his heart? I give three stars to this book whose underlying message is that women need to chase men, or use specific \\"rules\\" to make men want to marry them."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"First things first: Sherry Argov's book WILL work. In the short-term. If you're a woman who's been hurt before and you want to successfully manipulate the next man who comes along, whether he's right for you or not, follow this book's directions to the letter.Much like any of the \\"pick up artists\\" book that are flooding the marketplace these days, Why Men Love Bitches is simply about psychological warfare between genders. All 267 pages could be summed up easily in this one statement: \\"Continue to deny men what they want and they'll be so insecure that they're more likely to do anything for you.\\" However, is this really what good relationships are based on? Creating insecurity in your partner to better allow you to control them?The book strongly advises women to be more quiet, more aloof, colder, less showing of jealousy, less showing of passion, to not always answer the phone when you know it's \\"him\\". In short, it advocates AVOIDING all the behaviors that both sides will WANT to exhibit when they're excited and happy and loving in a terrific new relationship.I'm only here writing this at the end of wonderful romance that finally went sour over time due to lack of trust, communication, and my ex-girlfriend's inability to share or express her emotions to me until it was too late. Due to her happy adherence to the rules of this book, we weren't able to discover the source of any of these problems until it was already too late and the chance for real, interpersonal bonding had been lost.Use this book if you want to keep men around, ladies. But if you ever want a real, true, loving relationship based on actual love from a man, read at your own peril."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"As the author ofSEX, MURDER AND PARAPHILIA (Chronicles of Sodom)andA Woman of Middle Age- An erotic story of self-discovery and romanceI think this Well written, and entertaining But . . .Have you ever heard a good looking woman toot in public, a real stinky, sour smelling toot? This is similar. Enough to be noticed by the audience, yet with nothing real to offer but an offended grin on your face. If there were a zero star rating in terms of contribution to society besides being a conversation piece about the worst relationship advice, I'd give this one a Naught, zero, zilch, nix.I'll tell you what is wrong with this book. This is a manual to becoming a bitter and angry spinster. Take for instance, when she says;\\"What would happen if you let him know from day one that you are willing to bend over backward? He'd think you're desperate, and he'd want to see just how far you'd be willing to bend. It is human nature...He'd immediately start to test the waters. The more malleable you'd become, the more he'd expect you to bend. He'llInstantly perceive you as a Duracell battery,\\"This is her idea of a relationship . . . Hold . . . Hold . . . Not yet, he has not proven himself. Hold . . . Okay now give him half a cookie and then, Hold. . . Hold . . . Nope I have to yank that chain, not taut enough. Hold . . . Hold . . . half a cookie . . . Hold . . . .Guess what? Real relationships are based on people who come together swinging and hold nothing back. Show me who you are from the word go, honesty upfront gets you the man/woman. Show me that you are capable and willing to go all the way for me because I will show you right off the bat that I will take a bullet for you and bend backward, sideways and walk 500 miles for you and I will show you this the minute I lay eyes on you and want you to be my mate. If you hold that back from the word go, I will move on to the girl that will show me her devotion and dedication off the bat.Her advice is so sick that it sounds like it came from a sociopath, from someone with deep trust issues that has been hurt in so many awful untrustworthy ways, that she had to write a book about it. This could be fact only if you were dating a person with the mentality of an immature egoistical narcissistic teenager. Adults, responsible adults, do not push the limits. We compensate, we accommodate, and we sacrifice for our loved ones. When in a loving caring relationship, we are willing to take bullets for one another. If you can't demonstrate your ability to bend backward for your life-mate from day one, you WILL be alone for perpetuity--your perpetuity.Another one of my peeve fallacies in this book;\\"The nice girl sits in a chair after a week of knowing the guy, bored out of her mind as he does something that interests him. He may be watching sports on TV,Cleaning his fishing gear, strumming his guitar, or working on his car. She is miserable but doesn't say a peep. Instead, she tries to make the best of it and twiddles her thumbs politely, just so she can be in his company.\\"Does anyone else see something wrong with the above? It really sounds like what happened to her after a week. After a week in a relationship! Maybe he was staying away waiting for you to leave after finding out how much of a dependent, needing and miserable bitch you were.I know, life together is supposed to be an eternal honeymoon, but if what he does on a day to day basis is not her ... think about it. He is doing what entertains him and it's not her he is doing. There is a time for you and a time for me and if your idea of a relationship is you at all times, you need to be in a relationship with yourself. And if my me time seems to go on forever, then maybe we are not compatible. Get it? Or get a life!Maybe you want him to stop what brings him joy (outside of you) and become bored (out of his mind) and by your side. You are waiting around for him to entertain you. Why don't you be independent? Be a person of your own for a change. Seriously, if you think what your better half is doing for leisure and pass time is not good, then you are with the wrong better half. Go find someone compatible.Women, take this advice and you are guaranteed to be a BITCH and a single BITCH at that. If you need someone who will pull you off that chair and whisk you to an imaginary Venice, then feed you something on a bed of roses for life, then read a Harlequin Novel, don't read this junk.What she said in this table, tickled my bone, \\"I AM NOT ENOUGH.\\" VS. \\"I'M ENOUGH. TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.\\" If you have to ask yourself these questions, then you are not ready to be in a relationship, PERIOD! This is the simple MATHEMATICS OF A RELATIONSHIP It takes two to be in a relationship. 1 + 1 = 2. So, 1+ 0.5 &#8800; 2. Each partner should have come into a relationship with a full glass. Else, the relationship will not work. 100% of you must complete 100% of him. Thinking in terms of being enough means you need some work on yourself before you partner with someone. Each partner only has 1 glass, and not 1.5 glasses. What this woman wants is someone to walk into a relationship with 1.5 glasses. This is not biologically possible unless you are from Krypton.Wait a minute, she says in this manual from bitch land that, if your man calls you, you need to get back to him when you are free. Call him back When you are free! She must be dealing with some real jerks in life. Because in my world, when I call her or she calls me, you better trust me, I'm picking up that phone unless I am dead! And if you feel your better half is calling you for no good reason that you need to get back to them when you darn please, then you need to be with someone else. Take this advice and your relationship will be as cacophonous as a hen yard.There is a reason men do not like bitches and women do not like jerks. Do not change who you are. It will not work! Books like this will chase that one man (woman) who might have been the one. It will chase him /her to the hills screaming BLOODY MARY!If there is compatibility and communication in a relationship, you do not have to worry about this junk and unfounded psychology. A little knowledge is dangerous and the ability to share it with the public at large is like a fart in a crowded room that is what this book is.Besides all its fallacies, it is an engaging piece of literature but nothing else.Imagine if we all behaved this way in our relationship? It would be a tug of war!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I have never read a book so true and blunt. While I thought being a \\"bitch\\" was something bad, after reading this book I realized Being a bitch is a good thing. I stopped giving men everything they wanted while putting myself on the back burner. I am important too and there is nothing wrong with respecting myself. Do yourself a favor and get this book, you won't regret It!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I read this entire book in 2 hours. lolPros:-Empowers women-You do learn the truth about men and how they think-It worksCons:-She mentions you must \\"keep him chasing\\", but like the famous book \\"The Secret\\"-where you are to \\"attract everything to yourself by thinking positive 24/7\\"..how on earth can this book state you must keep \\"letting him chase you\\"..when she does slightly forget that you are still having to put effort INTO correcting yourself to \\"keep him hanging on a cliff\\"-sort of speak. Which is basically still \\"trying\\"..just in a \\"bitchier way.\\"Anyways...Like The Secret (which DOES work)..how easy it is really to try and think positive 24/7 while trying to \\"attract\\" all things you want and need? It's impossible. Real life throws many rocks as you, and you can try and be as positive as possible, yet things won't always come to you as you try to \\"attract\\" them.Same thing with this book. It is true that \\"men like to chase\\", so I do agree with almost everything she says, except what about if your man gets tired of having to chase, and then runs away? I've seen that happen with some women who I know. They acted just like this book suggested, only to be left with a man who got tired.Overall, a GREAT book. But we must not forget..if we have to sit and \\"program\\" ourselves to think 24/7 or to remind ourselves to \\"behave\\" as \\"hard to get\\" over and over, we are actually going against nature. By NO means do I mean a women shouldn't respect herself or be a slave to a man-NO. BUT...women are natural nurturers, therefore, it may be impossible to act like this (the advice) 24/7 because it really depends on a women's natural behavior. It really comes down to the way women were raised-which is something she also mentions in this book; that women are raised to be \\"nice girls\\" and to avoid conflict, obey, and \\"caretake\\". Where men are taught to control, go after, and provide for his family.I'm certainly not against Feminist (I consider myself to be one on certain subjects), but by all means having to rethink everything you do to keep a man \\"chasing you\\" is still putting your brain in overtime at times--sort of like the Secret..because when the natural worries of bills, children, work, and stress come -I found myself having to hammer into my head daily (which by the way--was EXUASTING) to \\"think positive\\"..so that I can \\"attract\\" what I want...it works--if you have the time and tolerance, and just when you keep \\"attracting that car you want to buy\\"--you find out your credit score wont let you no matter what--at least for a few years..lolI have worked with men for 11 years as an exotic dancer and I will say this: most of the stuff she says in this book IS true..because the girls who didn't try as hard--made the most money. The women (like me), who would spend hours getting ready to look \\"perfect\\", made much less at times. It's sad, but the truth is, if a man is into you, he is into you-nice or bitchy.Why do I say this? Because I'm proof that you can be both. I've put myself first, and he tried harder. And there were times when I put him first-and he tried less. This one-way of thinking can be good, but it can also be bad, because a real relationship has give and take. There can't always be a giver, and only one taker.I do give props for women who are now exceeding as well as men. .So this book IS good for empowering women--yes especially those who have been hurt in the past.Overall, I'm proof that being a \\"nice girl\\" and a \\"bitch\\" goes hand in hand..and I know this because my man has been with me for 9 years (not even married yet). Maybe that's why? I don't talk about marriage. I could care less-so this is proof. Yet I still see things through rose-colored glasses and he also loves me for being a cute \\"Paulinana\\" (as he calls me)..lolBottom line- a great book. But we must not forget- there are MANY \\"men\\" advice who says the EXACT same thing--I know because I've read those too.;)So although this does turn the tables a bit, it can also backfire. It's important to use this book as a reminder that NO one should step all over you--not just the men you are in love with. This book should also be advised for work-families, frienships, etc.Very true, and yes all her advice does work. I was hurt in many relationships in my past. However, I am in a happy solid relationship."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Supposedly, men love bitches. Even worse, they marry bitches. This is all according to Sherry Argov in her national bestseller books with the rather alarming titles of \\"Why Men Love Bitches\\" and of course, \\"Why Men Marry Bitches.\\" But after reading these books, I can't help but wonder, \\"do they really?\\"In these books, Argov advocates some of the most manipulative tactics and game-playing I have ever heard of...and I have watched Days of Our Lives! Check out these doozies:- When you cook for him the first time, serve chopped up hot dogs (speared with colorful toothpicks if you're feeling fancy) and Kool-Aid. The next time he suggests you cook, just start getting ready because you'll have dinner reservations soon after.- Throw something red in with his whites when you're doing his laundry, and he'll never ask you to do it again.Really? I don't know any man who would love a woman who did these things, much less marry her!Again girls, finding a guy and keeping his attention and affection has nothing to do with playing games...quite the opposite. Strive for the balance between the bitch and the doormat - you'll find her in your cool, confident self.For useful, realistic advice, go to www.guysmarryeasygirls.onsugar.com."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Exactly! He likes you the way you are - don't change, unless you've been constantly changing for him, then SLAP yourself and BE yourself and enjoy YOUR life, not the life you hope to bring to him to make him happy and not yourself. Life is SHORT. Why would you want to live any other way? You aren't his call girl and when's the last time YOU had an O? This is YOUR LIFE TOO. And, as Sherry says, he likes you better when he has to chase you. Even the most beautiful girl will lose a guy if she chases him (by doing everything for him). BORING!Of course maintain yourself. But be there for yourself first, and do stuff for yourself first so you don't have to keep expecting him to be everything to you. Let him show you who he is, and see if that's what you need.Sherry's book is awesome because it makes a woman feel GOOD about herself without actually harming a man. She explains things like when you complain on and on, he hears blah blha balsh... and YOU become the PROBLEM that he tries to avoid.This book is great for keeping things fresh in a marriage too. WE so often forget to keep dating our spouses. NOT GOOD! Keep the fire burning. This book is a great little update.And if you DON'T have a guy, quit trying so hard and go do things that you enjoy... and who knows... since you'll be enjoying yourself anyways, who cares if there is or isn't a cute eligible man at your next destination... you're having fun anyways!

But why do men have to be portrayed as dumb ignorant brutes.From the point of view of psychology it seems that the only message this book gives is one of deception, manipulation and trickery. Is this what women want from their relationship.A lot of women go for jerks because they're constantly caught up in this struggle to have wild ravishing sex with the bad boy, but then when they fall in love and he doesn't they become bitter and then write books like this. They want to change him to a good puppy who'll buy them flowers. If that is what you want realize that the bad boy with the reputation of having had sex with dozens if not hundreds of women is not your best bet to that bouquet of flowers and blissful love.Instead this book should have made women aware that they should be careful of who they date, who they choose to give their bodies to because yes, women are as involved in the sexual act as the man is. NOW BEFORE YOU ALL BLOW YOUR TOPS NO I AM NOT SAYING THIS APPLIES IN A RAPE SITUATION FOR WHICH MEN SHOULD BE SHAMED AND PUNISHED MOST SEVERLY... AGAIN, REREAD THIS, I AM SAYING RAPE IS NOT AT ALL JUSTIFIED AND THE PERPETRATORS SHOULD BE MOST SEVERELY PUNISHED.This book caters more to women who've been burned who don't want to acknowledge that they made a stupid mistake dating the sexy hunky jerk and failed in trying to change the very thing that attracted them to him... and on top of that felt betrayed because he didn't fall in love with them the way they did with him."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I'm a confident, well-rounded individual. An alpha-male, for sure. I respect and adore women for everything that makes them women. I've always said a man has two duties in life, to provide for his family and to know how to please his wife in the bedroom. I am a real man and the consummate gentleman. With that being said, if a woman tried to employ the tactics laid out in this book, I would drop her without a second thought. Real men are too smart for these games, and these tactics will either land a woman with an ahole who employs the same tactics or a man who would never stand up for her when it counted. This book is heavy on deceitful tactics and little else. The problem is self-esteem; and this book won't fix that.

Even if nothing in it had any value, I would've read it to the end anyway, because it has character and a fresh look at \\"take care of you, and the relationship will come on its own.\\"And that's the message she's trying to send. I was already married when I read this book, but I picked it up and enjoyed it because the title caught my eye.Some of what she says is good advice. Don't be clingy to anyone but yourself, yadda yadda. Have a life outside of him, yadda yadda. From an ethical standpoint, I found some of this stuff hard to swallow. Dumb like a fox? That's sneaky and, in my eyes, unethical. So read the book, but don't be afraid to throw out anything that seems stupid or wrong to you. It's good if you can wade through the . . . ah . . . bad stuff, and see what's good advice and what's plain wrong, but I don't think anyone should take everything in here to heart and try to apply it to every relationship.If there were half stars, I would've rated this a 3.5 instead of a 3."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"\\"A bitch isn't a cold-hearted, mean spirited woman, but rather someone who can put her own needs above anything else.

I don't think it's about being a \\"bitch\\" it's more about not changing yourself for a man or anyone and just staying true to yourself, it seems to me. I have actually used some of the advice in this book. Sometimes I find I'm too clingy and after reading this book, whenever I feel like I'm being like that I tell myself to hold back and I find that I'm much more appreciated when I'm appreciating myself and I'm much more respected when I respect and love myself. This has great advice that I will truly remember and use for probably my entire lifetime.HOWEVER, there were a lot of things in the book that weren't relavent to me such as raising kids and being in a family. I'm still in a relationship that's not even close to marriage so I kind of breezed over these sections as they aren't really useful to me now.One thing I didn't like about this book is that I found that it tended to give the same exact advice over and over again just worded differently. This somewhat annoyed me, which is why I'm not giving it 5 stars. It had great advice, but honestly the book could've been cut down DRAMATICALLY by not repeating itself over and over again.

Whether you agree with it all or not is irrelevant. The bottom line is that the book is hilarious. I am on page 100 only but had to write this review to tell ladies everywhere, married, dating, or alone with your cat, to read this book. If you have any sense of humor, Why Men Love Bitches will have you hollering with laughter soon enough. The author's take on men and their role and instinct within the animal kingdom is nothing new, per se, but certainly a comical and lighthearted twist on some older and well-known principles about the way men operate and what makes them tick. Whether you are the doormat, the bitch, or some combination of the two, you will be slapping your thigh and crying because you are laughing so hard at her tongue-in-cheek articulation of the differences between men and women. Don't fool yourselves. Men and women, at least when it comes to dating, are not on the same page. Read this book. You'll feel less confused about dating and find a lot of humor in the whole game to boot. Not too bad for the money.

A few years ago,it happened to catch my eye in the bookstore, right as I was heading to the checkout counter. The guy I was seeing at the time was very dysfunctional and borderline abusive, so I figured it wouldn't hurt to bring it home and do some self help work. I read this book from cover to cover that very night,and realized that I was guilty of everything she spoke of; letting people walk all over me,tolerating blatant disrespect,etc. Needless to say it was just the wake up call I desperately needed to pull my head out of my ass and end the relationship. While this is not by any means a substitute for counseling or therapy,Sherry Argov offers some great advice that is given in a very casual,humorous, and yet no-nonsense manner. Regardless of whatever your relationship is like, definitely make it a point to read this. It can help get you out of a less-than-ideal situation, or prevent unhappiness in the future."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This book was boring and did not hold my interest. I like a friend borrow it as well and she was disappointed with it too. We were hoping for more personal insight and guidance on how to \\"not care too much\\" and be more stand offish."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I've read a lot of relationship self help books including \\"The Rules\\". This books is excellent. This book is for those women who have, yes...been burned or who have a tendency to lose themselves in a relationship. If you've been with someone for years and everything is fine..then you don't need help. If you've a string of great relationships then you probably don't need this book either. Unfortunately for many women out there...they have been burned or have a tendency to bend over backwards for a man and lose their self respect for the sake of their relationship. This book is for these women. It can serve as a tool for internalizing positive messages and methods for not being conducive for trampling via feet.Argov emphasies the time tested idea that you come first before anyone else. I've noticed that it is men who have given low marks to this book moreso than women. Once your read this book for yourself, you might see why. However, There are specific \\"tactics\\" she explains. It is far from trickery. And as even men have responded...her tactics work. Call them what you will, but there is little interaction between people which doesn't involve at least a little pre-planning, special manuvering, or cunning. Is this to say that when we read books about business...that those books are terrible because they use \\"trickery\\", manuvering and cunning to achieve company goals? Come on.Someone else mentioned that they didn't agree with a chapter about \\"faking an orgasm\\". Don't listen to that. Obviously that person did not even read the book or is not very bright because in that chapter, Argov is cleary making fun of the concept. She writes \\"I don't recommend that a woman fake an orgasm. This little lesson is a satire on the pressures women feel to perform...It is much more of a turn-on to a man when a woman is able to be herself and she's honest about what she likes and dislikes.\\"(71)Finally, this book is not about playing games. Its about putting yourself first and taking responsibility for your own happiness, health, financial well-being, and rhythm. It is empowering and should be given to every woman who is having difficulty putting themself first and has a streak of nonfullfilling or short relationships (due to trying to be someone they are not or simply attracting feet)."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"As a man who read this book, I have a new understanding of how and why my last girlfriend acted the way she did. She must have read this book!I have to say, I chased after her, just like the book says a man will do if you follow the rules it describes. But, (and this is a big BUT), eventually, I got tired of chasing her. Eventually I came to the huge realization that I didn't want to live the rest of my life this way, under her thumb, with her making all the rules for our relationship.Women have put up with men that act this way, and it drives you crazy, doesn't it? Don't you hate it when a guy doesn't call and acts like other things are more important than you are? This book could just as well have been written for men, and been titled, \\"Why Women Love Jerks.\\"As I read this book, I thought that if everyone, men and women alike, followed the rules contained in it, this world would be full of a lot of single people. Mainly because it's all about one person in the relationship (in this case, women) acting aloof, not chasing men, and not showing men that they're afraid to lose them. If both sexes acted this way, no one would get in a relationship because both would never chase the other. (In the hopes that the other one will first. It's not going to happen!)All in all, this book seems to be written for women who have been hurt badly in the past and don't want to be hurt (or at least show that they're hurt) again. Anyone who has ever had the good fortune to have been in a GOOD relationship would never think of treating their mate like Sherry Argov suggests.I gave this book 2 stars, because what's in it WILL work. But if you have to use \\"trickery\\" like this to get a man to chase you, you'll get a relationship to match. It's better to be honest with one another. If it doesn't work out, then move on until you find that NICE person who will treat you right, \\"games\\" or not!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Firstly, in this book BITCH means Babe In Total Control Of Herself.She gives you priciples not 'rules' to transform from ignored or taken for granted doormat to relentlessly pursued dreamgirl, who is independent, strong, and not needy.Initially, I wondered if Sherry is a guy, because she is so onto us. To her credit she did interview many men, to get these deep insights. In fact she has compiled our secret playbook.I wonder if it is a good thing to have too many of our deep secrets in female hands, because it forces us to change our lazy relationship ways.There is a self improvement principle - you teach people how to treat you. So do what you have always done, and get what you always got, or teach them how to treat you right.So when Sherry suggests, acting a little aloof at first, this may seem counterintuitive, but it works. Staying out of relationship mode for a while, bypasses our natural defenses, and it works. Not giving away your personal power by being too much of a pleaser works. Communicating succinctly, I like that one.Probably the most important lesson from this book is the importance of communication. A woman who calls a guy on his behavior, is showing several powerful things, she demonstrates higher value by not accepting bad behavior, she is not afraid to convey her feelings even if this might offend the guy, she is not timid and unassertive, she keeps the lines of communication honest, and open.You will win some and lose some by following the advice in this book. Following this advice too rigidly will not work. It is a matter of finding a balance, and using what works for you. Think of this book as training wheels.This book, is very good, and I probably should not recommend it but I do.The bit about faking the orgasm, some reviewers don't like. As Sherry is a stand up comedian, this piece is just supposed to be humorous. In reality, you are teaching the guy that is he is already good enough, whereas some improvement might be required.Some of the anecdotal advice is funny but extreme. The booty call guy left standing in the rain outside his apartment got his just desserts, but the red panties in the laundry tactic was too much.My personal opinion, is we men are not that smart at non verbal communication, so things need to be spelled out more.We also have a limited capacity for processing verbal information, in fact we go into safety shut down after about 30 seconds of talking. After that point, we just nod and grunt as if we are following along. I hope you find this review helpful, and the book enjoyable."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"It turns out that the women in \\"Why Men Love Bitches\\" are not \\"Bitches\\" at all. Rather they are women who have rich, full lives, filled with passion. They follow their instincts, express themselves fully and have loving relationships with men without losing themselves in the process. There are also vivid descriptions of women who put their lives on hold when in romantic relationships with men; canceling plans with others to be with him, planning the future and putting pressure on the guy to commit. This naturally makes the guy want to run for the hills. Instead, she suggests that a woman can maintain her interests and passions at the same time she's in a relationship. Who wouldn't want to be with someone who loves her life? The \\"Bitch\\" in this book is a powerful and passionate woman who knows herself well and has love to share. It's a woman's authenticity and integrity that men love.Authenticity and integrity bring to mind a new favorite book of mine:How to Have A Match Made in HeavenAriel and Shya Kane are relationship experts and their brilliance shows in this powerful book (based on video interviews that can be instantly viewed online) as they interact with people from all walks of life in innovative and inspiring ways. I discovered compassion for myself and others as I read this lovely book. I highly recommend both of these books if you're looking for love...of yourself and others."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I have gone through some real Hell with all of my relationships, including my current marriage. I have come to realize, thanks to Sherry Argov, that I did not understand how to communicate with men. Sherry will tell you in this book that men DO NOT RESPOND TO WORDS. THEY RESPOND TO ACTION AND TO NO CONTACT. A lot of times when we women are speaking and try to get a point across to a man, we do not realize that they ARE NOT LISTENING OR ONLY LISTENING WITH HALF AN EAR. Men are quite accustomed to tuning a woman out and looking like they actually are listening! Sherry gives you alternatives to use to make your man really listen. I remember, in particular, a conversation I had with a male friend of mine when we were talking about relationships. He said that some of his relationships had ended because he simply did not understand how serious his girlfriend was about what she had asked him to do. I asked him, &quot;What could she have done to let you know that she really was serious about something?&quot; His response, &quot;She could have changed up the routine. If she didn't make dinner, I would have noticed.&quot; So, there it is, from the horse's mouth. ACTION, NOT WORDS, GETS THE POINT ACROSS.The second major point of the book is about valuing yourself and having your own life. You don't subjugate yourself and give your life up for a man. Be true to yourself and pursue your own interests; don't give up who you are to be with a man. A man respects a woman who is independent and follows her own interests. Whether you have a tennis match or a Tupperware party planned, stick to your plans and see your guy on a different night. A man likes a woman who has a life of her own - it makes her more interesting - more like an equal partner.Another part of the book deals with how to fix the relationship you're in, and how to quit being the doormat you've set yourself up to be. My marriage was failing and on the brink of divorce because I didn't know how to communicate with my partner and let him know and make him understand what I really needed from him. I had been talking about certain issues for years and he had heard me, but never listened. I learned from this book (and from my male friend) that I needed to &quot;change up the routine&quot; in order to get his serious attention. Another important lesson from this book is that a woman needs to value herself and BE READY TO WALK if a man does not give her what she needs in a relationship. I changed up the routine and let him know in no uncertain terms that I was indeed ready to walk, and lo and behold, things got better! After nearly 15 years of marriage, things are the best they have ever been. Thank you, Sherry Argov. If not for you, I would be in divorce court right now.By the way, my personal advice is not to let your significant other know that you have read this book. Men who say that you should are wrong. They already have the relationship advantage from the way society has taught us and set things up. This book merely levels the playing field and puts us on a more equal footing with the men in our lives. And think about this. If, after all of these years, you have finally learned to stand up for yourself, do you really want him to know that you got it from a book???!!!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This is a phenomenal book. I read it one weekend while my husband was away and now it stay's in my purse 100% of the time. Note: I have been a happily married woman for six years and initially read this book because another friend was reading it. I whole heartedly believed that I knew more than any book out there. How wrong can one person be?Sherry Argov tought me to take control of my actions. Instead of constantly trying to please my husband in an attempt to gain his attention, which usually resulted in my feelings getting hurt, I gain his attention by not accepting disrespect of any kind. This is truly empowering and requires commitment. It is much easier to get your feelings hurt than to commit to changing your behavior. Also, mastering the principles listed in the book is like riding a wave. One moment you'll find yourself on top of the world and then you fall off. What happens, is that you get over confident because your husband is paying attention to you and treating you in a manner that you didn't think possible (it'll leave you slack jawed, but don't let him see you that way). Next, you'll get comfortable and revert back to your old habits and so does your husband.My only complaint is that an alternate book cover was not provided. I've covered mine with a cover from a gardening book. I don't want to give my secret away :)I could go on and on, but you should really read this book. Good luck and Have fun."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This is such a great book that I've been recommending it to all of my female friends and family. It illustrates to you why your relationships current and past have failed miserably and lets you know what you're doing wrong as well as how to approach it from a better standpoint.Basically, the author explains that women have been taught to be nurturers; A woman finds a man worth loving, showers everything and anything on them and *surprise!* they're abandoned. Why does this happen? Because women expect men to give back what they're giving them and it just doesn't work that way -- at least not in the beginning of any relationship -- it has to be built to that point (my parents were like this after years of marriage.) This extreme generosity on womens' parts comes across as if they're strictly living for their man's happiness (sometimes that's true, too, unfortunately) and unfortunately that tells the man that they're doormats. Plain and simple.The book explains that men want an independent woman. They don't want a mother, a babysitter or a slave -- they lose interest in them way too fast and the mystery is gone. Sounds easy enough to understand but if you read the examples and follow a few tips you'll be very surprised with the results.For example, the old telephone bit. DON'T wait by the telephone for the guy you're seeing. Go out, have a life outside of him and call back when it fits YOUR schedule, not his. Don't rearrange your plans around him and most of all don't leave all decisions up to him. I've had friends I'm with that when the phone rings, they ignore all their guests to go suck up to the guy they're after on the phone. Wrong. You make time for your man when you have the time -- not stopping your life.The two things I was surprised to discover is: 1.) Women have been taught in the past that appearance is everything they need to find a man -- and nothing else matters. No wonder women have been treated like doormats! If personality and ambition are ignored there's nothing left but appearance and 2.) Women need to be taught to have a life outside of their boyfriends/mates/husbands. Women have been taught by society that they need a man to complete their lives SO MUCH that they end up desperate and it shows to the man they're dating. Plus, it's the reason you feel that emptiness in a relationship -- you've lived so much for him that you forgot about yourself. It's really sad when you realize how passive society has made women unconsciously or consciously and you need to take that back.I'll give you an example I used: A guy who asked me out called me up and said: \\"Well, you can drive over here since I'm closer to where we're going.\\" The passive/old me who was desperate would say: \\"Okay! Anything to make you happy because God forbid, I don't want to lose you -- that's how desperate I am.\\" What I said instead was: \\"No, you asked me out so come pick me up.\\" Lo and behold what did he do? He picked me up. Don't be afraid to put your foot down -- of course, be cool about it, not nasty and it ALWAYS works.Making plans? Don't drop them because he asked you out, plan around him. I have a friend who lives for her boyfriend and really could use this book but she's so far gone that I've given up hope. I can't tell you how many times she's cancelled on me at the last second because he decided he wanted to go out at that time. Wrong. You hate when your friends do that to you and you're disgusted with them for their attitudes -- so why on earth would you do it? Besides, he's more likely to call back when you don't offer everything on a platter at once -- including your heart; You lose mystery with him when you do that and he loses interest.Then we come to a very important chapter: If he knows you're not putting him in a cage -- he'll try and put you in one. This is where the mother/babysitter aspect comes in. He calls the shots -- with everything. What movies you watch, where you go, how you live your life and quite frankly this is where women get into relationships and suddenly realize they're unhappy -- but don't know why. It's because they've made themselves become little slaves to their men's happiness and they're not getting it back. In my opinion, if you're in this kind of a relationship it's hardly fixable but there are ways around that. Another example in the book was one woman let a man do his wash at her place and he ended up expecting her to do it all the time. He would just bring it over and not even ask. So, one time she dropped a pair of red panties in with his whites and when everything came out pink she said: \\"Oh, I'm just not good at this kind of thing.\\" What was the result? He said: \\"You are NEVER doing my wash again.\\" Problem solved.In fact, I gave this to my mother (who is a widow dating) and she was very surprised to realize how much advantage her boyfriend was taking over her. He would plan parties at HER HOUSE and she would do all the cooking and he never helped her pay for any of it. When she began to protest, he fought her on it. What ended up happening is she booted him out the door. In some instances, like I said, it's not fixable. But, was he worth keeping? She decided \\"No\\" and she has told me she is much happier.Have a guy tell you that he wants to see you and other people? Don't get on the floor and beg for him -- tell him: \\"Don't let the door hit you on the ***. I had one guy do that to me. We went out and he told me that he was going to see this girl he knew at work. So, when we were driving back to my place I said: \\"I understand about your needs to see other people,\\" and he nodded and got this smile on his face. Then I said: \\"So since you're going to see someone else on Saturday I just wanted you to know that I have a date, too.\\" That smile melted off his face so fast I could have died laughing. What ended up happening? He was so distracted by the fact that I was going out on a date that he didn't enjoy his at all. The VERY next morning he called immediately and asked if I wanted to go out. I hemmed and hawed and said: \\"Well, I'm pretty tired from last night, so no, but I can go out Monday evening.\\" I was showered with attention Monday. Trust me - it works.Now, in defense of some of the male postings here (which make me laugh of course) NOT ALL MEN ARE LIKE THIS. But unfortunately, there are guys out there who are. Think of this book as a great guideline to weed those out. If guys like this are playing games, the best thing to do is to play YOUR WAY. You may not end up with the right guy if you have to but your self esteem won't be shot in the end when it's over and that little player will have learned something. Real men DON'T play these games, but do love independence in women.The only chapter I don't agree with would be the one on faking an orgasm once you get to an intimate point in the relationship. If you can't be honest with your lover and are more worried about his ego then you're setting a trap for yourself. Healthy, sexual relationships are all about honesty -- each of you telling each other what you want. Neither one of you are going to figure it out eventually. That never happens. I got this info from \\"Mars and Venus in the Bedroom\\" which you can find on Amazon.com. Explain what works, what doesn't, don't be harsh about it and it will all fall into place. Trust me on this one.So get this book if you've had your heart broken too many times. Remember, not all guys are like this but you can figure out which ones are (and... have a little fun with them in the meantime *devil grin here*) Real men don't play games with women and you'll figure out the real men from the weasels with this book. A MUST READ for you women out there sick of the games -- play them your own way! And trust me, it works!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Some reviews suggest this book is about playing relationship &quot;games&quot;. I just have to let people know that this is not true at all. The book investigates the psychological facts behind what really happens in a relationship. Most women, once attached, start being too nice. They compromise when they should not and give more than what they might recieve. The problem is, guys are different. If a woman is too nice they assume they have already won her over and do not have to try any harder. That's when women become frustrated and complain because they need more, but this neediness automatically turns guys off. This book simply opens your eyes to how men view relationships and read into a woman's bahaviour. I can personally relate to the examples in the book. When I first started dating my boyfriend 3 years ago, I was busy with university and friends, and so I did not really care about where and how the relationship was going. He knew that I wasn't attached and did not have a problem breaking up if he mistreated me, so he made sure that didn't happen. But after a couple of years I started acting needy, as I complained if he didn't call or was too busy to see me all the time. As a result he started backing off. I could not understand how someone who always went out of his way to make me happy and used to insist on &quot;forever&quot; only, now avoids talkin about anything serious alltogether. This book helped me a lot in understanding what had went wrong, and how it could get better. It's not about playing games; it's about remembering that guys do not respond to neediness."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I've been married for 20 years and I TOTALLY AGREE with the advice in this book.This book tells women not to use men--for a woman to stand on her own two feet. That's a long overdue message. There are a lot of dependent women who suck the life out of the man they are with. I think it has integrity to tell a woman (especially coming from another woman) to get up--go to work--and don't lean on anyone else for your ship to come in--because then a man will be more respectful and more stimulated by the woman he is with.I recommend the book for men because it makes a man understand women better and what is going on in a woman's phsyche. I recommend it for women because it will give her some streetsmart advice about how men really think. Bravo, Ms. Argov. Tell it like it--no matter how much heat you take. You've made a believer out of me."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Wow! Good advice. I know from experience that its always the guy you aren't that crazy about who persues you the most. Men love a challenge, why not have a little fun with it? I am a divorced 40 year old woman, and the men my age who are single seem to think that every woman wants to marry them. They are probably right, but I know that I'm a great catch too. Any man would be lucky to have me. This book introduces women to that concept, we as women need to place more value on ourselves. Think about it.. Are you pretty? Are you a good cook? Do you have a career? Are you funny? Are you caring? Are you an all-around good honest person? Then why shouldn't a man show you the respect that you deserve? Why should you have to bend over backwards to try to convince him that you are worth his time? This book isn't about tricking a man, or being mean or bitchy, it's about not selling yourself short. It's about knowing your worth, and having some self respect. Most of all, it's about getting him to give you the love and respect that all of us women deserve.I loved this book, it's being passed around to all of my single girlfriends, most can read it in a day or two. It's funny, interesting and insightful. It's one of those books that you just cant put down."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"As being someone who was \\"previously\\" a \\"bitch\\"...I totally recommend this book. I grew up in a house full of boys (one sister), and they used to advise me greatly on how to deal with men, so basically I was a bitch but the only thing was I was overly bitchy, and not \\"bitchy nice\\" as this book recommends, so I ended up losing my fiancee.So I decided to become nice (after much advise from my mom, and sister...sister who is still single)...cooking, calling alot e.t.c and let me tell you got treated like a doormat!! I have just seen the fourth guy (since my ex-fiancee brokeup with me) go out the door!! and then I decided to buy this book. I now see the mistakes I made (which some I already knew, but was trying to follow what my family had suggested)..and are now following Sherry's steps, and can already see the difference.I was really attracted to the last guy, and feel like he has alot of potential, he came to me real strong, and because of me trying so hard he started backing off...cancelling dates, not calling etc...so I decided to keep quiet on him for awhile, and now he's back up calling and trying to plan dates..and asking why I don't call him anymore etc. He is really frustrated right now, and even mentioned he was sorry if he seemed like he was \\"taking me for granted\\" and wants to know if we can talk to find out where we are/what the future is for us. Its been a couple of weeks, and its already working...if he really is serious only shock he will have is \\"Ms. Nice is totally out the window....!\\" Sherry's book is great! and being bitchy/nice is the key. Whether this works out or not...her book is definitely my relationship bible...you've got to try it!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I read the entire book with an open mind, on the advice of a girlfriend. I just want to say that some of the analysis is right on.But ladies, I have to also warn you that this book is a codification of everything that men hate about women. If men hate women who are flaky, aloof, moody, use sex as a weapon, and act as if they don't need men, then they will hate the behavior of bitches who follow this book's advice.The book makes the tacit assumption that men and women are too immature to have totally honest relationships, and that the only way to deal with men is to play games with them on a continual basis.This book is a female version of another book \\"The Game\\", the secrets of the pickup artist, which also encourages treating the opposite sex as a sort of immature object to be manipulated in childish gamesmanship.Are the authors of these types of books just sad single people who may never find true happiness as long as they are reduced to playing games?I think it might be funny to put the authors of these books into a room together with a camera, and lock the door.Read the book, glean the good meat out of it, but don't play games with each other, please?"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This was a very good book, it reinforced what my jamaican mother and american paternal grandmother taught me when I was younger. Men respect women who not only respect themselves, but put themselves first. Sometimes when women enter a relationship they tend to put the man's needs ahead of their own and forget about what they need. When we overcompensate for men they take us for granted, and we're left feeling empty, unappreciated and used when they can't or won't do the same for us."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Ever since I got married 13 years ago, I've been trying to figure out what's wrong. Is it him? Is it me? Why does he pause before saying yes to something? Why does he always need another 5 minutes before he can do something for me? Why am I always jumping up immediately to help him when he needs something? It was all so baffling. Then I read this book, and it all became so clear. My husband has been playing a power game I didn't even know we were playing. And he was winning . . . all the time, but I wasn't much competition. Have you ever played a game like Scrabble or poker with someone who was so bad at it that even though you won all the time, it wasn't all that pleasurable? That's how it must have felt for my husband. Sure, he won every power trip. He asserted his superiority and manhood. But what did I do? Roll over. Fetch. Cook big meals. Clean house. I'm embarrassed to think about it. But all that has changed. I used up so much of my energy trying to please him and wondering why he wasn't doing the same for me. Now I know, that's not how the game is played. The game is this: Each partner takes care of themselves and their needs. And if there's anything left over, they share that with their partner. I've left myself emotionally exhausted and financially vulnerable by giving my all to the relationship instead of developing my career, talents and earning power. I'm now taking back my own god-given time and energy. Just yesterday, my husband asked if I knew where there was a certain item he needed. I almost jumped up and looked for it for him. Then I remembered what I've learned from this book and I said, no, I don't know, and kept doing my thing. He found it himself, and I found myself. And that's how we roll. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This book is okay, and is helpful to see when women give too much of themselves to please a man, on that I recommend it.Where the book needs improvement, IMHO, is that I really didn't learn what to do beyond the games like playing \\"dumb as a fox\\" I found this to be more disempowering than helpful.I don't want to play dumb anymore, or play games, and I really don't think a man deserves this from any woman."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This book makes the common mistake of lumping all men into one giant category. As fun as that might be for teenagers and kids, the reality of adult men is that they do not all think and act the same.Ladies, if you follow the advice in this book, you need to know something. Men usually try to date someone who is similar to their mother. Whatever role model they got from their mother, is the pattern they are looking for in their girlfriend or wife.So, if their mother was a bitch and cold and aloof, that is the type of woman they will go after.So, ask yourself: Do I want to \\"catch\\" a man who grew up with a bitchy, unloving mother? Then I should be a bitchy, aloof woman.On the other hand, do I want to \\"catch\\" a man who had a positive, loving, and honest relationship with his mother? Then I should just be my genuine, loving, and caring self.Here is another newsflash for women: as shocking as it may seem, men are \\"human beings\\" who have something known as \\"feelings\\" and who respond to love and hatred the same way you do.Ever hear the phrase, \\"to have a friend, be a friend?\\" Well, romantic love is the same way, with the only difference being the whole \\"mother-pattern\\" thing that I mentioned above.Also, humor and comedy are WAY more effective than bitchiness to grow some love between two people. I consider laughter to be the glue that makes people stick together. And as everybody knows, the best kind of humor is to poke a little fun at yourself.The strongest relationships are where the man and woman both have shared \\"inside jokes\\" to cut through the dull thudding of daily life. Like if you both watched a funny movie and were laughing through the whole movie, you can use the funny lines in that movie to help smooth out the rough spots in your relationship. Men don't love bitches... they love women who can laugh at themselves and at life in general... there is nothing like shared laughter to grow some lifetime love."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"When I first started reading this book I thought, \\"I dont want to be like those girls who don't take care of their husbands and don't act like sweet, traditionally good girls.\\" I had a fear that if I wasn't such a \\"sweetheart\\" and such a traditional \\"good wife\\" that he would have reason to leave or desire to have a \\"better\\" person as his wife. It was all MY insecurity and lack of confidence that created that thinking. However, after reading and thinking about it, I realized that HE would sound like an idiot if he wanted to leave because I stopped doing things for him that he would NEVER have even thought about doing for me, and even if he did WHO CARES I know how to go about finding someone else that I would want after reading this book. This book helped me to begin thinking about: \\"Could I see him doing the exact things for me that I bend over backwards to do for him?\\" Would he set his alarm (even on his day off) for 6:30 in the a.m. just to cook me breakfast before I went to work? No. Would he notice that the laundry basket (although only full of MY clothes)needed to be washed and do it and fold it as if he worked in a department store? No. Would he change his hair color if he knew I prefered dark hair? No. Would he notice that I was out of my Rasberry Nutrigrain bars (without me telling him that I was out)and remember to get them at the store when he went? No. Does he worry or feel insecure about being overweight and worry that I wont find him attractive? No. Would he drop all of his plans with his friends just because I said I wanted to spend time with him? No.I could go on and on. And if someone thought that I was a \\"bad wife\\" because I stopped doing things that he would never have done for me, then they can kiss my butt because they would just sound like a co-dependent insecure idiot like I was! So this book really opened my eyes to stop ignoring me and stop obsessing over him, and figure out what I want. I am not afraid to say that I was an extremely co-dependent,insecure person that was always trying to please everybody else, and I can honestly say that I needed that wake up call and this book really gave me the perspective and confidence to do it!**The important thing to remember though, in finding this new confidence and freedom is to NOT start acting like a pissy mad person when stopping those bad habits. Its important to still be sweet as pie when failing to wait on him hand and foot and still be your charming self without any hint of sarcasm or \\"see how it feels\\" type of attitude. It will make things from his point of view seem like you have no guilt or worry that you are being a \\"failure as a wife\\" in his eyes. The more non-chalantly you act about not doing those things anymore, the more he will start to see you as being an independent stronger woman who obviously doesn't need him or care if he doesn't need her! Wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This is one smart woman!

In fact, she encourages you to be nice. The main focus is on self-respect.I read the book twice, and took notes (which I call the \`Bitch Mantra'). Well, I read the notes every night for 30 days and viola! I had total reversal of self-esteem. No sooner did that happen, than did I meet an absolutely incredible man who is kind, gentle, generous, funny, smart, educated...sheesh, who knew this was available in one man? The topper: He loves and adores me! The fact is, I would have never attracted a quality man like this with my old self-esteem. The \`handful' guys are no longer appealing to me-who wants to deal with that exhausting [stuff]?If you find yourself dating the same kind of guy, get this book and commit it to memory. It worked for me."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"The absurdity contained within the title of this book grabbed me by the throat.It's no wonder there are so many clueless women these days. It seems as if they get most, if not all, of their information about what *men* want, what *men* like, what *men* need, from other (clueless) women.It didn't take very long for the Swiss cheese logic (that seems to permeate books like these) to kick in. From within the first ten pages of the book:\\".....If he's unwilling to lift a finger during the courtship, he is showing you right up front that he has nothing to offer you in the future. This behavior has nothing to do with your worth. It has everything to do with what he has to offer. And it also has to do with how you present yourself.....\\"This, immediately after recommending that what you should serve for dinner in those first weeks in a relationship is hot dogs, popcorn, jelly rolls, and instant coffee, and in doing so, you ensure that he will no longer ask you to cook. I can understand the satire in the dinner \\"recipe\\". What I can't understand is why so many women seem to believe that what's good for the goose isn't good for the gander. Employ such tactics if you must, just so long as you understand that typically, the criteria by which you select is usually the same criteria by which you will *be selected*. Now having said that, reread the sentence quoted above and everywhere that you see the the word 'he', put an 's' in front of it. Not quite as profound the second time around, huh?If you enjoy cooking, and you have no problem with cooking for that special (or even not-so-special) someone in your life, then you don't get into some junior high school-ish game of one-upmanship with a guy that is unwilling to lift a finger in the courtship. You cut a guy that's unwilling to lift a finger in the courtship loose, find someone that enjoys cooking just as you do (or at the very least can respond to your generous gesture in kind), and cook whenever you get the urge to cook.Understand something, ladies: sane, rational, balanced men have absolutely ZERO use for \\"bitches\\" in their lives, and the only ones that tend to deal with this type of foolishness at all are the ones whose mental capacity won't allow them to realize that this is not what healthy relationships are about. You don't need to be \\"bitchy\\" in order to be assertive, confident, and demand respect for yourself. The sane, rational, balanced men of this world usually end up marrying women that understand this.Therein lies the major philosophical flaw in this book (and others like it). While you may not like the man that is standing in front of you, if you employ these tactics, and they WORK, then you won't like the man that you turn him into, either (unless of course, you're admittedly an egotistical, mean-spirited, power-thirsty wench that gets goosebumps at the mere thought of having a man with sincere feelings for you wrapped around your pinky finger).By the same token, employing such tactics will without a doubt usher out a certain type of man, but you have to read the fine print, which contains the information the seller doesn't want you to know about.....the types of men that being a \\"bitch\\" will simultaneously usher IN, which will probably be something along the lines of...-The Playboy who sees your type as nothing more than his biggest challenge to date-The Desperado that doesn't believe he can do any better-The Scatterbrain that doesn't give a damn about you being a \\"bitch\\" for as long as he's getting what he wants out of you (you get the pleasure of figuring out exactly what that is)-The Personal Whipping Boy that actually sees abusive treatment as a sign of love (the male equivalent of the battered woman)-The Rent-A-Gangster that will eventually smack the tar out of you before ordering you into the kitchen to fix him a sandwichSo, if these are the types of meatheads that you wish to invite into your life, then by all means, get to bitchin'. If not, then you would be well-advised to seek out the knowledge of a sane, rational, balanced man in your life (preferably one that's married) that you can trust, to get the skinny on just what it is that men love. That's a far better bet than what you'll get out of these so-called \\"self-help\\" books."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I agree that negative comments here are probably from people who don't get what the book is actually trying to tell you. It's telling you to love and take care of yourself first, not be a doormat. It's only when you love yourself, others see the confidence in you and are drawn toward you. Everything Argov says in this book about a doormat is so true because I was that doormat. I did everything she said a doormat did and my ex did everything she said guys do when you become a doormat. I don't have to read her book to learn not to be a doormat because after being a doormat, I now put myself first before others but at the same time, I am not rude and I don't use people. This is what the book is trying to explain to you. It's not trying to tell you to be lazy or cruel or be unappreciative. It's telling you exactly how to take care of yourself at the same time, be respectful."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"There are a lot of women that would greatly benefit from this book, however...I have only one complaint about any male/female advice book...whatever the behavior, make it honest. Simply put, don't ACT like you don't care, when you do (all men are not ego maniacs in needly little boy clothing), some are honest and secure and expect honest secure behavior in return. This book is perfect for selfish, ego maniacs who do not appreciate being lavished with attention. I will lavish with attention if I feel like it, but only because that is what I choose to do....not to manipulate a man...if he doesn't appreciate me, I will dump him in a minute....honestly.... but ACTING like I don't care, when I really do....nope. The advice on laying yourself out like a doormat is right on target...that should never happen anyway. No man or woman should sacrifice his or her dignity to buy a crumb of attention.I read many of the posts and I think the reason for the disparity in opinions is that 'one size does not fit all'...for example, one very famous woman was dating a man (she is Still with him...name starts with an O) and she tried playing not interested when she really was....he told her 'look, I sent you roses and I asked you out twice, I won't do it again...do you want to go out with me or not'??....keep it honest."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I've read this book countless times.

I wholeheartedly agree with the parts where the author encourages women to be strong, be proud, have a job, not be a nag, respect herself and not let herself be stepped on. The parts I don't agree with are where Sherry seems to think that men don't read her book, men are totally clueless, stupid, emotional, sports playing, car loving beer guzzlers. The \\"Dumb like a Fox\\" chapter where Sherry suggests that a woman play dumb and suck up to a guy's ego to manipulate a guy is an insult to any intelligent woman. The more highly evolved man does read her book, and more than once too!So, if you ladies want to try to manipulate us, know that we too read these books and can counter your schemes. So, if you still want to try to manipulate us, come on down, AND BRING IT ON!!!!!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I picked up this book because my boyfriend's mom had it lying around, and as I was flipping through it, I saw something interesting that caught my eye: I believe it was the Textbook Guide for how to win a fight, as a man. It included such amusing and sarcastic remarks such as \\"She makes seven good points, and you have one semi-good little point. Hold on to that one semi-good little point and bring it up whenever possible.\\" I was laughing and reading it out loud, when my boyfriend agreed that in the heat of battle, that's pretty much what happens.So, I continued reading.I finished the book, though the first few chapters were a little difficult to get through because they were very contradictory and...just plain stupid. For example, the Dumb Fox theory says that women should pretend to be weak and docile creatures because they are still \\"running the show\\" while the man believes he's a hero. How the hell is that supposed to gain the respect she speaks of throughout the book? And how can you expect to be taken seriously when you put your foot down, as is suggested, when you've been playing the doormat by letting your man believe that you're incapabable, and yes...NEEDY?The final few chapters were where it was at for me, because they focused on bettering the reader without interacting with anybody else, i.e. taking control of your emotions, not letting a single individual consume your life, etc. The point that women are more appealing with their own interests and life aside from their significant other, which incidentally makes them more in control of themselves and THEIR OWN happiness, was duly noted.I also appreciated the sarcasm throughout, and I believe that women who have a more sassy attitude can appreciate it as well and identify with the book better. I believe that if you AREN'T a very sarcastic individual, then parts of this book seem to ask for a personality change.That leads me to my next point. I think that this book should only be read by intelligent women who can read something without picking it up for the purpose to solve their problems. The women who jump to this book, or any other for that matter, defeat the entire purpose of the book anyways before they can even start reading it, and won't get it by the end. Instead, the sarcasm seems to look a lot more like serious, helpful advice. Seriously, if you're an idiot who can't appreciate a meaning behind words in a BOOK, probably don't read this. I was the opposite and picked up the book for its humor, and gained a perspective of the point being made afterwards. I'm also capable of understanding that much of this book contradicted itself, was very demeaning towards men, sometimes demeaning towards women, and that if I were to read this book for advice, I'd be running in stupid little circles.I'll say it though...I did learn some things from this book that helped my relationship. I understand the pattern of logic a little better for why talking doesn't work as well with men as action, or a lack of, and I understand that I'm the only person responsible for my happiness, that if I'm happy with myself, all those little things that women nag over in their relationships suddenly don't seem like such a big deal.Case in point: moral of the book was good. Stand up for yourself, be responsible for your own happiness, let a man into your life as an added quality and not as a necessity, don't be afraid to be who you are. The advice between the moral was stupid. Act a certain way that may be out of character for you in order to accomplish a specific goal in a way that you wouldn't normally accomplish it, and trying to adopt it into a character trait will make you 'tha boss' of more than just yourself. OH yeah, and that being cold and callous somehow yields a different result than when men do it, which was discussed in the book as a THING TO AVOID. The sarcasm was neat and slightly demeaning/offensive at times to both genders. If you can't read satire, probably don't.Overall though, I enjoyed the read. That is all."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I've had your book sitting on my bookshelf for over a year. I never read it or needed it, because I thought I had men all figured out and have been in a happy relationship for 2 years. All of a sudden, our happy relationship hit a huge \\"bump\\" in the road and I was trying like crazy to fix it... every day wanting to \\"talk\\" about it, crying and doing all of the typical things that happen to a female when she feels vulnerable and like the relationship might come to an end.At first it seemed like the book was geared more toward people in a new relationship, but then I found strategies for bringing the spark back. I realized that I had become a \\"doormat\\" and totally taken for granted. I had been too nice and too accommodating. I read this book in half a day, cover to cover (it's an easy read). The next day I began doing many of the opposite things that I had been doing and became mysterious and non-chalant. Within only one day, I got results! My man began behaving differently when he realized I didn't \\"need\\" him anymore.I think someone reading this will find that the book is not about being a bitch. To the men out there, we know you don't truly want a bitch. You want a confident, self-assured girl that is independent and happy. Once we become happy with ourselves as women, then our partners will be happy to be with us.The best analogy I can think of to tell you is that I turned a wild stallion (aka - a player) into a man who is happy to be in a relationship with one woman (who is not such a bad catch, either)... me!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I've always thought men wanted to end up with the \\"nice girl\\", the one that cooks for him and makes him feel like a king....WRONG.

I ignored her advice thinking men don't want someone that plays games or hides their emotions...Wrong again. You have to read this book ladies.

But curiosity got the better of me and I bought it and read it. There seems to be a lot of misconception from the reviewers who didn't like this book. What Argov meant by 'being a bitch' was any woman who stands up for herself, speaks her mind regardless of the consequences and refuse to have anything to do with anyone who disrespects her, whether male or female. To me, that is a recipe for integrity, with a capital \\"I\\", packaged in a fun to read book. There is nothing wrong with having integrity and self-respect.If having backbone gets one labeled \\"a bitch\\", then I'd say, bring it on. Better that than be a spineless wimp. The only critique I have of this book is that it is a little redundant. A lot of the chapters pretty much say the same thing: stand up for yourself. Walk away from disrespectful behavior and find somebody who will appreciate you. But I get why she repeats so much though. A lot of women, including myself, have been raised to be people-pleasers all our lives. It takes a couple of repetitions for her message to sink in.While some men may panic at the messages in this book, (notice I didn't say all men. I suspect a lot of men are secure enough in their masculinity to *not* be threatened by this book and write those annoyingly vitriolic reviews) the irony is, as more women realize how to conduct ourselves with integrity and self-respect, life gets easier for the men dating us too. Instead of secretly feeling sorry for us, they can begin to adore the no-nonsense, mean what we say, fearless new breed of women."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This book helped me a lot since I was one of the so called \\"Too Nice\\" and of course I was taken advantage of, but things changed when I learned how to keep the ball in my court.

It's not an easy process but it's fun!I can never be so mean, however, as some of the examples in the book (ruining my partner's underwear if he wants me to do his laundry, for example).

The first time I read it I really enjoyed the humor and the sense of empowerment that this book gives women. However, after I read this book a second time (hoping to feel empowered after a relationship didn't work) I gained a new perspective. The author suggests that a woman not show her emotions or how she really feels. If you are looking for a long-term/serious relationship how is this supposed to help? I wouldn't want to be with a person who shows no emotions or feelings towards me. If you don't know that a person has feelings or cares for you then where will this relationship eventually end up? The answer is simple, nowhere. Also, the book also suggests \\"playing games\\" such as the dumb as a fox chapter. I am not interested in spending my time thinking of what \\"move\\" I need to make next in order to keep a man. I want something that's natural and feels right to me and the gentleman. I suggest reading this book if you want a humorous read but, take it with a grain of salt and remember that if a man isn't into game playing or \\"chasing\\" you - the advice in this book most likely will not work."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I loved this book! When I first glanced at the title I rolled my eyes thinking, another lame self help book for girls with boy drama. I was wrong! After reading a few pages I discovered that this book was not cheesy at all. It's loaded with great dating advice and addresses some of the common mistakes woman (including myself) make in relationships.This book helped me to realize that there are men out there that can and will treat you with love and respect. It taught me that I am worthy of this type of man and to quit wasting my valuable time and energy on losers!Thanks Sherry!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I was going to start off saying I wish I had read this book sooner, before committing the nice girl mistakes in my past two relationships. But, if I hadn't gone through what I had gone through, I would have said the book's advice was crap - of course nice girls win. Which guy has not said he likes the girl-next-door type?But now I know why the relationships went downhill the moment I went from independent woman to needy girlfriend. I gave up my needs and let my happiness and schedule revolve around the man. I now solemnly swear to be happy and confident regardless of whether I am alone or with a man. Only I can be responsible for my own happiness.That said, one area that the book could be improved on is to give some advice on when a girl can give, albeit a little. Like when the guy waits too long to make his move, a little signal of interest could whet his appetite. Otherwise he may conclude the girl is not interested at all and give up."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I recommend that every single women or dating woman on the face of this earth read this book. It has changed me forever! All mothers who have teenage daughters should give this book to their daughters it will make them think twice b4 they go chasing after some boy."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"The alternate titles of this book could be \\"What men really want,\\" or \\"Appreciate yourself and he will appreciate you too,\\" But it wouldn't sell.This is NOT a book about games or manipulation. It's about creating and maintaining chemistry in relationships as new as 10 minutes and as old as 90 years.This is a very honest book that women need to read. This isn't a bag of tricks. This is old fashioned advice that simply takes into account what men really want and what women need to remember. This is the sage advice your great grandmother gave to your grandmother. Men want a woman to remain interesting and women need to remember to value themselves for who they are. That's the real message in this book. Argov words it in a way that is marketable, and using the word 'bitch' gets your attention. She explains what men find interesting in women and how that goes hand in hand with a woman valuing herself for exactly who she is and not comparing herself to media generated ideals and unrealistic standards.A man really wants a woman with a spine, according to this book. He wants a woman who is comfortable in her own skin and values herself. This book covers, without explaining, how women are socially conditioned to try to please men in ways that only please them for a few minutes.The first 8 pages of this book were very off-putting to me. I found them insulting because they describe a kind of profoundly insecure woman I have never been. (I'm the fiercely independent type) I was flipping through the pages of the book at a friends house, wondering if I should read it. But I slammed the book down by page 8, disgusted. After many months and more encouragement from her to read the book, I gave in and bought it. I nearly slammed the book down by page 8 again because I was so insulted. But because I PAID for this book, I read on. By page 10 I was interested. By chapter 2, I was hooked. Argov got my attention because she started to explain how even strong ,secure women who do things right up front, make mistakes and lose men after the relationship gets going because she doesn't understand what the man really needs and the woman becomes too nice and self sacrificing.[...]The book states and restates that a woman's value is simply in what she believes is valuable about herself and that is what men really want."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This was the first of two books that I read regarding this subject. The other was \\"Why Men Marry Bitches\\". I was recently dumped for pretty much being the \\"nice girl\\" mentioned in this book. This book is awesome. It changed my thinking on how I interact with the opposite sex. I'm really not big on self-help books but I've already read it twice and have sections highlighted."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"The reason I gave this book 4 stars is that it is extremely funny. In the first few pages you read a recipe for making popcorn, even down to using a spatula and potholders to get it out of the microwave because its so hot. After making this delicious dish, your man will not expect you to cook again. It was hillarious. There was also a lot of helpful tips from experience in the reading material. The thing that I didnt like is it made women seem superior. I am a woman myself, and we would like to think we are the most splendid creatures, but I never want to think of myself as better than him because we are equal creatures. I guess I am what she refers to as \\"nice\\" and some points of that will change and perhaps my relationship will continue to grow. But there are also points of ignoring him, if you lose him, someone else will come along, remain strong, all that stuff. I wont exactly beg him and plead with him to stay, but at the same time I wont paint my nails as he packs either. It was a great book, I just wouldnt recommend all of the tips it has to offer."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"During a conversation, a friend of mine told me about how her long time best-friend was having \\"dating\\" disasters! We both came to the conclusion that perhaps a dating book may help out! So we purchased this book and I decided to read it first to ensure we would not \\"insult or hurt\\" her feelings... and... This book made me laugh (to the point of tears at times), kept my attention (I could not put it down) and offered sound advice (confirmed by male friends)! It was obvious the research was well documented because I selected numerous males (both friends and co-workers) and suggested a topic of: how they would respond OR what they expected, to a scenario this book gave advice about and received a 100% correct response. One guy even made the comment that HE likes to be the LION and go after the woman he is interested in...IF she is too nice, too available and esp too needy OR if she chases him, HUGE turn-off! Basically he is looking for a B*@&#!!! So there you have it! We are keeping our fingers crossed that she enjoys this book as much as we did and honestly, I would read it again just for the humor!!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I purchased this book in paperback about 5 years ago. I hesitated to buy it because of the title until I understood what it was about. I believe the words in this book changed my life completely for the better as I no longer let people run over me since then.I loaned it to a neighbor and she never returned the book, so I now have my Kindle and felt like I needed a refresh reading of the book.I highly recommend this book to any one who has lived their lives like a door mat in the past. It does work and you are not a &#34;bitch&#34; just looking out for yourself."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This book had 685 reviews when I downloaded it and I feel the 4-star ranking does not to justice to it's contents. This is a classic in self-help.There are self-help books put together with rehashed material or not enough material(lots of fluff), this is one book where some repetition is only aimed to drive home the point, when needed. Otherwise the anecdotes shared and the insights given are phenomenal. It confirmed my long held beliefs and instinctive reactions, which many women found objectionable.In my opinion, this book is applicable not just to romantic relationships but to all human interaction. It teaches a woman to hold herself in high regard under all circumstances, while being fun and spontaneous. There are 100 Attraction tips for holding your own in a relationship and winning the respect of your significant other, and they are all valid not just for singles but for wives as well.This book speaks to all those women who lead insecure lives, bending over backwards for men (and generally being bitchy to fellow women). It tells them how to create and maintain self worth, which is endearing and attractive to men. I can personally see a lot of women I know, benefiting from this sagacious writing.I also found the closing paragraph to be very powerful."}]`),A={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:R,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},L={class:"card-container"},j=["disabled"],M={key:0},S={key:1};function x(n,a,r,u,s,i){const b=y("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[a[1]||(a[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",L,[(e(!0),t(c,null,m(i.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(e(),f(b,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:s.isLoading,onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[s.isLoading?(e(),t("span",S,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",M,"See more"))],8,j)):w("",!0)])}const q=d(A,[["render",x],["__scopeId","data-v-44e9052a"]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/57.md","filePath":"guide/57.md"}'),O={name:"guide/57.md"},G=Object.assign(O,{setup(n){return(a,r)=>(e(),t("div",null,[v(q)]))}});export{E as __pageData,G as default};
