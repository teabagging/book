Buy the hardback copy if possible becuase you will want to read this treasure again and again."},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"If Ronald Reagan was the \\"great communicator,\\" then Fulton Sheen was the \\"master communicator\\" both in speech and in written word. This book is not only for CATHOLICS, but is a marvelous recapitulation of the life of Jesus, weaving together all four Gospels into a rich tapestry of the life and love of Jesus Christ. I remember when I was seven or eight that I would sit enraptured by the Bishop's talks on radio and TV. I have recently rediscovered him, and he is no less captivating today. If you want to know the essence of Christianity or want to strengthen your faith, READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"This is a thoroughly concise writing on the life of our Savior. It is smooth reading, inspirational, and even deep enough to bring a lump to my throat and an occasional tear (at the risk of coming off too emotionally).

Thank you for having it available."},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"This book is an amazing reflection on the Gospels from one of the greatest Catholic minds of the 20th century.

I would recommend this book to anyone, especially if they are unfamiliar or have doubts concerning Christianity."},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"This is a great book to use as a bible study, to understand Christianity in general and Catholic theology.

As I read this book, it answered a lot of questions that I didn't know before.

Confucious last name is Yau and his other names are Chung Lei.Yau Chung Lei is his full name. During his lifetime, he never proclaims that he is God messenger or prophet or any kind.He is just a phylosopher and a teacher.The worshipiing of confucious came about when the chinese people went a step beyond honoring and respecting him into vunerating him as God like figure."},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"I'd say get this book as well as get a good Bible.If you haven't received Jesus Christ into your life, you should then. Many people have not been saved, and many are going to hell. Reading this book will tell you alot about the life of Our Lord, but still you need to be saved in order to be granted eternal salvation (to live with Jesus Christ forever). Say this prayer, \\"Jesus, I repent of my sins, i ask you for forgiveness. Come into my life Lord, and take me to Heaven once i die. In your Holy name. Amen.\\" Pray this prayer, and get a good Bible, and follow the Lord. I recommend this book. I saw Fulton Sheen on TBN.

Sheen meshes the narrative synoptic gospels with the theological Gospel of St. John. With his superb use of analogies/language he gives the reader an inspiring and practical view of each event/phase in the life of Jesus Christ. I have purchased over 50 copies at various times to use as gifts and for use in 2 book clubs and 2 Bible Studies. I usually insert a recommendation to the ladies:\\"Dear ladies,In Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen's LIFE OF CHRIST, there are 62 chapters, most averaging 10 pages or less with just a few over 10 and almost every chapter can be read in about half an hour. Each chapter is an entity unto itself, but all connect.Starting when you receive your book, try to read a chapter a day..................UNDERLINE what strikes you as important or unusual..................WRITE personal comments or questions in the margins..................ADD question marks next to \\"problems\\" so we can discuss them.My role will be to keep the ball rolling; keep us on course, and rescues us from rabbit trails as well as to deal with any Scriptural or theological problem that might arise.\\"I highly recommend book to anyone who wants to deepen her spiritual life.Barbara Reagan"},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"The author has done an amazing historical review of the life of Jesus.

Bishop Sheen (born 1895) brings reason to the Roman Catholic perspective from Jesus' physical body to the Mystical Body of Christ - from incarnation through transfiguration to ascension.The first publication of this book was 1958, and it has been enduring critical acclaim. Paperback edition has 476 pages. Includes: Foreword by John Muggeridge March 1990, Preface, Contents of 30 chapters, relevant references to Scripture, alphabetical Index."},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"Arch-Bishop Sheen does an amazing job of describing the Life of Christ while preaching truth. A must read."},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"In 2005 I was given the inner knowing that Christ is who He said He is.It was in a split second of an experience I cannot put into words.My hunger was born at that moment.As many books as I have read in the last four years, nothing, nothing, compares to this. Not even C.S. Lewis and Mere Christianity, although his comment to those who state that Christ was only a \\"good teacher\\" was one of the best comments I have ever read...of course, that is what I once said...I can't say anymore than all the reviews here. I am ever grateful for however this book made it to my hands. It is even more amazing that I was given the ability to understand it."},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"As a Protestant who went to Catholic grade school in the early '60's, I had head of Bishop Sheen. He was a star of early TV, popular with both Catholica and Protestants. And now I see that this was well deserved. While not strictly chronological, he does do an amazing job on the Gospels. Especially on the Agony in the Garden, which I have never seen handled better. Like his boss Pope John 23rd, he did accept that Protestants were also Christian, and not heretics. One warning though, since he wrote when all Catholic Bibles were translated from the Latin Vulgate, some verses may look strange, and some names stranger. Isaias, Jeremias, etc."},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"Maybe you are of an age that you remember when the Venerable Bishop Sheen was on the television? I am not one of those people. Maybe you know about Bishop Sheen being an \\"old\\" preacher, and maybe that concerns you? It concerned me. But under the guidance of someone I trust I purchased this book 3 years ago and read it.It is a string of perfect pearls!Each chapter deals with one section of the life of Jesus Christ and is filled with not just biblical references but with insights from Sheen that could only come from a deep, DEEP love for Christ. A deep understanding of history, and deep understanding of scripture.When you look for a good book to read on the life of Christ, don't let your reservation (or prejudice) about the authors location in history bother you. My prejudice was, Bishop Sheen was a man of the 50's and couldn't speak to me on a level I could be engaged. I was wrong. I am a woman of the 90's and I do not have a college degree, but I have a solid high school education. Sheen is a man of \\"letters\\" and that also frightened me. I promise you, don't let it frighten you.His method of dealing with his subject is so clear and enlightening, it feels like having the cobwebs and dust removed from an abandoned building. Sheen turns on the light!One of my favourite parts of this book is when he deals with the \\"Woman at the well.\\" There is just so much there that after you read this chapter, you'll be as excited as the woman was when she ran back into town shouting to anyone who would listen \\"Come and see a man who told me everything about myself..\\"Bishop Sheen loves Christ, if you are looking for help in meditating on scripture. You will find that help here. I challenge you to learn about the \\"Life of Christ\\""},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"If you want to really understand Jesus, this is the place to find the answers. Don't let the Catholicity of the book put you off, this book ties a perfect bow between the old and new testaments and is better than 90% &quot;generic&quot; Christian. You'll understand how not even the slightest sigh He made was unintentional. It's an insight into the mind of Jesus, and when done with this, you'll understand both Jesus the Man and Jesus the Deity better. When I finished this, I began from page one again. Bishop Sheen also has a writing style that draws you in and keeps you looking for more, mixed with a simplcity that won't lose you either in word or concept. I am now looking for more by Bishop Sheen."},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"I own a few of Fulton Sheen's books, and the man is simply excellent when it comes to writing about spirituality. While some of his books are a little short on substance and are written in a way that touches on brief ideas of spirituality (like the wonderful but short \\"Way to Happiness: An Inspiring Guide to Peace, Hope and Contentment\\"), this book is truly his masterpiece. Coming in at over 650 pages (Doublday edition) it is not only full of material, but what is in here is distilled brilliance. Sheen takes the reader on a guided lecture of the life of Jesus Christ, and his style (common in all of his books) is as if he were sitting with you, relaxing with a cup of tea, and having a one-on-one conversation about his topic- only this topic is the entire life of Jesus Christ (no wonder it is such a big book!).\\"Life of Christ\\" is broken up into 62 Chapters (yes, you read that right) detailing different parts of Christ's life according to the Gospels. He presents it chronologically, and uses LOTS of Scripture, inserting the actual verses intermittently with his lecture/narrative telling of Christ's life. What is so special about Sheen's work is that he not only retells the actions and events pertaining to Jesus Christ, but he offers his own (and extremely useful) analogies, observations, and insights. He also includes statements that are deeply paradoxical or meant for further pondering. Consider this: \\"Every other person who ever came into this world came into it to live. [Jesus] came into it to die.\\" Speaking about the Nativity story Sheen posits, \\"Could it be that the Creator would not find a home in creation?\\" These little nuggets of thought allow the reader to enter more deeply into the mysteries of Jesus' story itself, and Fulton Sheen definitely has the knack for telling a good story. Of course, this is a story that most people are quite familiar with, and yet he writes in a way that is highly accessible to anyone regardless of how strong their faith is. It does seem, though, that Sheen assumes a minimal belief for those readers going into this work: this might not be the best apologetic regarding people who are critical of Biblical scholarship or who are antagonistic to Christianity in general. His other books might be better, and I'd personally give the nod to Chesterton'sThe Everlasting Manor Lewis'Mere Christianityif one is looking to defend the faith in that regard.Still, for the Christian who wants a companion with him or her while delving deeper into the Gospels and seeking the historical and personal Jesus, Sheen's \\"Life of Christ\\" is a phenomenal read that blows away 99% of the \\"modern\\" Christian books on the market. It focuses on the narrative, and doesn't get bogged down in scholarly or critical details that other books trumpet. While that might sound like a negative, it is clear from his writing that Sheen is a Scripture scholar and one of the top Christian thinkers of the 20th century. \\"Life of Christ\\" would make for a wonderful personal devotion for any Christian, whether Catholic or Protestant.***************************************Notes: Because the book was written in 1958, Sheen uses anachronistic references to the Soviet Union through Communism. Some might find it odd or even jarring, but I found it wonderfully insightful (just use a little imagination- history repeats, after all). Also, Chapter Two is almost 60 pages long (the rest of the Chapters are more evenly spaced and digestible)... I would politely exhort the reader not to get stuck here in the beginning, but press on as it only gets better and more well suited to a one-sitting reading!"},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"I just finished this book recently, and I have to admit; I was totally blown away. It's a fantastic book about Jesus; true, blue Catholic from start to finish.Any good Catholic looking for solid teaching, presented in a dramatic, entertaining and captivating manner needs to look up the name of Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen. He was an extremely faithful Catholic, a wonderful teacher, and incredible intellectual, and an amazingly charismatic speaker. Little wonder, then, that for years and years, he not only wrote numerous books and sermons, but had his own show on the radio, and on television. He even won an award for best television personality; back before the anti-catholic prejudice in the secular media became the epidemic it is today.The Life of Christ is some of Bishop Sheen's best work; a point-by-point retelling of the life of Jesus, with bible quotes and reflections for each major event contained in the gospels, as well as additional tidbits of information about the majority of the events described. Bishop Sheen's writing is enthusiastic and insightful, and at more than one point, he applies the gospel message nicely to the problems of his own times.Of course, the times that Bishop Sheen addressed were a generation ago, when Russia was a threat, but his words about communism, China, and the problems facing the United States are just as true now as they were then. If anything, I think that the last thirty years have only served to prove Bishop Sheen's points even more than ever.The church that my parents attend no longer has a crucifix above the altar. Now, we just have a sculpture of the risen Christ, and in this book, Bishop Sheen makes a point of saying, many times, that we can't afford to accept just one (Christ) or the other (the cross.) We have to take them both.I honestly think that this desire to avoid preaching the hard truths of Christianity that we see so often in \\"modern\\" churches in the west is responsible for the declining mass attendance. How are we going to see Jesus as sympathetic to our suffering if we don't dwell on what he suffered? This is the sort of thing that this book got me thinking about.If I had to find any fault with this book, it's that Bishop Sheen does repeat himself once or twice; making the same point two or even three times over the course of the book. Still, this is not neccesarily a fault, since many of us need things repeated in order to remember them. This is why I give the Life of Christ a perfect score. It's a truly magnificent book, which really helped me to understand more about the faith, and I highly reccomend it."},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"If you've read a lot of Archibshop Fulton Sheen's work, you're familiar with his brilliant insights, powerful intellect, fantastic sense of humor, and almost miraculous ability to express very complex topics in straightforward ways.Tell you what, though--he really outdoes himself in this work. Clearly a labor of love--intense love--for the subject matter, Archbishop Sheen pulls out all the stops in this book. He presents the life of Jesus Christ in chronological order, weaving together the details from the Gospels and other scripture. I would think that all readers will come away with a deeper understanding of--and appreciation for--the most remarkable life ever lived.This book isn't so much read as studied; every page has a depth of meaning that can't be absorbed instantly. Nearly every phrase calls out for reflection. There's no kidding around in this book, this is serious business; the \\"cuddly\\" Fulton Sheen is largely missing, replaced by the intensely scholarly man who started his career with such distinction at Louvain.I've heard that many great Catholics, including Mother Teresa, kept a copy of this book close at hand, and after reading it, I can see why. I'm sure that I'll refer to my copy again and again.Now, if you are not familiar with the books of the Archbishop, starting with this book may seem like a bit of a challenge, but it is well worth the effort.Overall, this is a true masterpiece of Christian writing."},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"Quite simply, the best and most important book I have ever read. It will provide the reader with the understanding of Christ's life, death, and resurrection. It will provide the reader with the light of knowledge and wisdom. It will provide solace to the reader seeking the Truth in the world today. Fulton Sheen must be heralded as one of the world's great modern theologians."},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"I wasn't sure what I was going to get when I opened this book, as my experience with Fulton Sheen had been based entirely on replays of his \\"Life is Worth Living\\" tv shows from the '50s and '60s. I wasn't expecting this much depth based on that criteria. Well, I seriously underestimated Bishop Sheen. This is a complete and full life of Christ for the believer or for one who wants to know why he or she might want to believe. It isn't a scholarly work, there aren't a whole lot of citations. However, one book that is cited extensively is the Bible. Sheen walks us through the life of Christ event by event and gives deep insight into each of the incidents that made up his life. I found myself not only more informed about Jesus, but moved by a new feeling of closeness to my Savior. I will admit that on several (or even many) occasions while reading this book I was moved to tears, and I'm not one who cries too easily.I'm a lifelong Christian and thought I had pretty much heard everything at one time or the other, but the Bishop presented many aspects of Christ's life in ways I had never thought of before. I found myself almost spellbound at times wanting to find out what happened next, even though I knew very well what was coming up. That's the quality of Sheen's writing--he can take a story you've heard many times before and make it fresh and new.If you're looking for a scholarly work based on historical criticism this isn't for you. If you're looking for a complete history of Jesus, including major emphasis on the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy, you'll like this. And if you just want to feel closer to the Lord, this is the book you want."},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"This is the best Life of Christ that I have ever read, and I have read several. Not only does Bishop Sheen provide insightful commentary on the Gospels, he relates them in a very understandable and practical way to life. This would be my top recommendation to anyone."},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"I found it hard to read this book for long stretches at a time. Not because it was boring, far from it, rather because the chapters were so chock full of wisdom and insight that I could only handle small portions. This is truly a rich and nourishing read.Fulton Sheen doesn't add anything to the story of the Life of Christ, rather he unpacks what is already there. He sheds light on the symbolism of actions, words, and objects found throughout the Gospels. This coupled with Sheen's writing style really connect the reader with the events of the gospels and bring them to life.I don't recommend this as a book for a plane ride, rather as a book which you have the time to slowly digest and ponder over. It's a wonderful read!"},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"I apologize if I seem to use hyperbole in the review title but this thought seemed to recur in my mind while reading this glorious book by the late Bishop Sheen. I am a voracious annotator and will usually put \\"wow\\" or \\"!\\" in the margins when coming across passages that startle me. You know what? I just gave up there were too many instances. Sometimes I said to myself, \\"did this book come from a seraph from the Throne Room of God\\" (sorry again, lol)? You can tell the bishop had a close, intimate loving union with the Lord Himself to pen the words he did.I must firmly disagree with Karl Keating in putting this Life of Christ after Frank Sheed's \\"To Know Christ Jesus\\", while in itself a good read, Sheen's stands alone in profundity, lucidity and eloquence. I urge you, whether catholic or protestant, and are a lover of the Lord Jesus Christ, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE get this awesome, wonderful book and be blessed. You know what? I'm going to go read it again!!Jesus bless you all!!!"},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"This is a timeless book which is current to our world today just as it was when it was written! We wre using this book in a Catholic bible study group and it is great for this purpose but it could be used by any Christian group, as Bishop Sheen has written this so that it woill appeal to any group seeking a deeper understanding of Christ's life, as well as the reason why he came in the first place.I think this book is a must read for any Catholic or for any Christian, as well as someone on a journey seeking a deeper meaning to life.Bishop Sheen wrote some 90 to 100 books and many feel that this is his best.Please, take the time to read this book. It is both readable and will also be useful to the serious student."},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"I grew up listening to Fulton Sheen. This is his epitaph a true work of art.

I would recommend this book to anyone. in fact I bought two more as gifts!"},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"In \\"Life of Christ\\", Bishop Fulton Sheen takes the reader on a journey through Jesus' life. Beginning with Jesus' birth, climaxing at the Crucifixion and ending at the Ascension, Sheen explores and explains the ministry of the Messiah when He walked the Earth some 2000 years ago.I found Sheen's careful, clear and piercing insight very helpful and enriching as he explains the parables, miracles and healings of Jesus. The way Sheen breaks down passages and makes remarks bit by bit focuses the reader's attention on the verses in question. Although a Catholic, Sheen writes about Jesus in a way that all Christians can appreciate, even if he devotes a bit too much attention to Mary than I think is necessary. Sheen was also fixated on certain troubles in his day, such as communism and psychology and this comes out in his writings as he contrasts these worldly systems with the divine wisdom of Christ.This book is long but rewarding and I would recommend it to both Catholics and Protestants."},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"I highly recommend this book for anyone desiring to learn more about the person of Jesus Christ. Because of Sheen's immense understanding of Sacred Scripture and the history of when Christ lived, this book will serve as a type of scriptural commentary that will greatly benefit your study of the Gospels. It is a long book, and needs to be read slowly so that you can internalize everything you read - as you can imagine with Fulton Sheen, it is very academic. But it is also excellent for prayerful depth as Sheen gives spiritual and pastoral insights to scripture that will edify any reader. It took me some months to read this book in its entirety simply because I had to go back and re-read parts in an attempt to digest the richness of the text. Everyone I have met who has read this book considers it essential to the Christian life."},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"one of our better buys, we'd do it again if the opportunity presented itself; we're very satisfied with the product"},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"An awesome and inspiring read. I highly recommend this book to any and all that want a greater understanding of the life and purpose of our savior"},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"'Life of Christ' is an exposition of the Gospel stories of Christ. Somewhat akin to Pope Benedicts XVI 'Jesus of Nazareth', but more theresult of meditation with scholarly tone. Lets you go deep in the gospels from the birth of Jesus to his Crucifixion, Resurrectionand Ascension in 650 pages.Concerning the Preface & Author Alone----------------------------As an aside in the preface and stated in 1958 when published, Cardinal Sheen presciently describes his time 1958, which was basically the peakof Catholicism, its best time and the glory years in the U.S., and his description is ever more precise when it comes to its fulfillmentin our time:\\"The Western post-Christian civilization has picked up the Christ without His Cross. But a Christ without a sacrifice thatreconciles the world to God is a cheap, feminized, colorless, itinerant preacher who deserves to be popular for His greatSermon on the Mount, but also merits unpopularity for what He said about His Divinity on the one hand, and divorce, judgement, and hell on the other. This sentimental Christ is patched together with a thousand commonplaces, sustained sometimes byacademic etymologists who cannot see the Word for the letters, or distorted beyond personal recognition by a dogmatic principlethat anything Divine must necessarily be a myth. Without His Cross, He becomes nothing more than a sultry precursor of democracyor a humanitarian who taught brotherhood without tears.\\"Sheen also predicts correctly in 1958, once again in the preface:\\"The problem now is: Will the Cross, which Communism holds in its hands(in a sense through its discipline, self-abnegation, surrender,hard work, study and dedication to supra-individual goals) find Christ before the sentimental Christ of the Western world finds theCross? It is our belief that Russia will find the Christ before the Western world unites Christ with His Redemptive Cross.\\"..."},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"Fulton Sheen just sees things clearly!! Fill your kindle with words of wisdom and download as many of these gems as you can find!"},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"&quot;Life of Christ&quot; is an extraordinary achievement on the part of one of the Church's truly great (and, I have no doubt, inspired) theologians. Outside of a mere handful (including the Holy Father himself and Father George Rutler), no one today can be even remotely compared to Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen. This is hardly surprising, given the number of politicians, managers, and blatant dissidents within the Church's current hierarchy.I can't laud this orthodox book highly enough. It's beautifully written, remarkably incisive, and provokes thought, while engendering spiritual fervor. To be sure, the book is a bit long and occasionally redundant. There are only two significant negatives, however, neither of which is Archbishop Sheen's fault or responsibility. First, the cover art. Of all the magnificent and inspiring artistic depictions of Christ Crucified, why the editors selected a flat and ugly painting by the empty Salvador Dali is quite a mystery. Second, and more importantly, the biblical quotations are from &quot;The New English Bible&quot; (an awful and mundane translation). I have no doubt that the original edition of this book contained quotes from THE Bible -- the Douay-Rheims.The bottom line? This is an outstanding book, which needs to be read today even more than when it first appeared."},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"A great read for those who would like to understand deeper the Life of christ as written in the Bible. Wonderful insights by this saintly Man of God,Bishop Sheen."},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"I read this book every Lent, especially on Good Friday. It has also come in handy for Bible studies, due to the many scriptural cross-references.More importantly, the way Sheen wrote was the way he spoke - eloquently, direct, and witty. He will have you grinning one moment, followed up by smacking yourself in the head for not seeing what he just made seem blatantly obvious. You'll understand, but you'll also wonder more. Excellent for meditation and study."},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"Fabulous reading for everyone, from the most devout Christians to those questioning God's existence. Well developed concepts that are deep,yet explained clearly by way of analogies and similies as only Fulton Sheen can. Every provocative sentence begs deep consideration and contemplation. This is absolutely essential reading for anyone with even the slightest interest in spiritual truth.It impacts me differently each time I read it, based on my current life situation and relationships. The third time I read it, I decided to highlight the most important points for reference later. Upon finishing, I realized that I had highlighted most of the entire book!Buy it and read it as soon as you can. Read it slowly with great contemplation and meditation, and then read it again! Share it with those you care about. For many, this book can be absolutely life changing. I can't possibly recommend this book more strongly."},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"It's become fashionable in certain Catholic circles to deemphasize or even argue against \\"the atonement theory\\" by which Christ's sacrifice on the cross purchased our salvation. Bishop Sheen, always one to have the good sense to rebuke nonsense, would have none of it. Read these pearls of wisdom from the introduction to \\"Life of Christ\\":\\"Plunging into the Life of Christ what seemed to stare at me from pages of the Gospel was that Christ, the Son of God, did not come into this world to live. He came into it to die. Death was the goal of His life, the gold that He was seeking. ... Unless there is Good Friday in our lives there will never be an Easter Sunday. The Cross is the condition of the empty tomb, and the crown of thorns is the preface to the halo of light.When all is said and done, there are only two philosophies of life. One is the first the feast, then the hangover; the other, first the fast and then the feast. Deferred joys purchased by sacrifices are always sweetest and most enduring. Christianity begins not with sunshine but with defeat. Sunshine religions that begin with psychic elation, end often in disillusionment and despair....If we leave the Cross out of the Life of Christ, we have nothing left, and certainly not Christianity. For the Cross is related to our sins. Christ was our 'stand-in' on the stage of life. He took our guilt as if He were guilty and thus paid the debt that sin deserved, namely, death. This made possible our resurrection to a 'new life' in Him. Christ, therefore, is not just a teacher or a peasant revolutionist, but our Savior.\\""},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"This is by far the best commentary on the Gospels I have read so far.

Sheen seamlessly weaves together the events from the four Gospels, always emphasizing Christ's mission to suffer and die for our sins, and showing how the cross casts a shadow backwards over all the events of Christ's life.

All joking aside, this gorgeously illustrated children's book is a perfect, snuggly fit for the socialist/communist propaganda tag. Here's what it teaches: Kick the bad, lazy, land-owning farmer out the door and take over his farm for the benefit of the workers (a la workers of the world unite!). Unbelievably, this stuff is out there, people, and here is your perfect example. Tangentially, has anyone out there ever met a lazy farmer? I guess there's got to be one out there, but I know a lot of farmers and I've never met him.

The human farmer is lazy and makes the duck do all the work while he lays in bed and eats sweets. The other farm animals are shown as typcial animals (the duck must husband them) until they decide to overthrow the lazy farmer who is living off of the ducks hard work. The other animals run the farmer off of his farm. The duck finds out the next morning and then the other animals suddenly join in the work. Ends with them all working co operatively togetherly. Perfect story for Russian children circa 1940 or Vietnam, circa 1976! Better to have the duck decide to start his own farm and thereby reap the benefits of his labor. Or, show that by the duck deciding to leave for other conditions, the farmer must now be nice to the next duck. Or show the duck asking for better working conditions and the farmer at least demonstrating active management style. Or show the animals deciding to help in the first place and maybe the farmer get the idea too. let the farmer learn a lesson. Let the animals help. Let the animals leave for a different farm that has better rules/management is more successful while the lazy farmer reaps just rewards of failure in a free market/economy. Etc. But to simply run the property owner off his own property because he was lazy? And then the workers take over? Very, Very, odd in America! Not American values, not American methods, not American way of business.We read this at bed time once.

Would someone PLEASE take the time and effort to tell me exactly why it is that I had never heard of this book until the good people of the New York Public Library placed it on their, \\"100 Picture Books Every Child Should Know\\"??? Why isn't this book being handed out to every kindergartner that walks into school on their first day? Why isn't there a \\"Farmer Duck\\" Day where we all get to take off work and revel in the sublime pleasures of this text? And why, oh why oh why, was this book never recommended to me in any way, shape, or form? Ladies and gentlemen, I place the blame fully on a nation in which Madonna can create best-selling children's books because, according to her, there are NO good books for her kids (I'm having a hard time typing as I gag), while my beloved, \\"Farmer Duck\\" remains a small perfect gem in a sea of terrible literature. But I digress.\\"Farmer Duck\\" follows the unlikely premise of a duck that runs a farm all by his lonesome. The actual farmer in charge of the place is a lazy no good so-and-so who would rather eat bon bons in bed than take the time to do any work. While the man relaxes in his shirtless luxury (occasionally shouting out a helpful, \\"How goes the work?\\") the duck cuts the wood, weeds the gardens, washes the dishes, irons the clothing, and pretty much does everything that needs doing. When at long last the duck grows, \\"sleepy and weepy and tired\\" (what a great way to describe any child that has gone too long without a nap, by the way), the other farm animals decide that enough is enough. Joining forces they run that rotten farmer out of town and set about all doing the chores equally with the duck in charge.The plot is good. The illustrations are brilliant. Illustrator Helen Oxenbury (thank you, oh England, for sending us such a talented artist) has taken watercolor to a whole new level. In a scene as rife with melodrama as any film noir, we see the sheep, the chickens, and the cow walking into the farm house just before dawn. Those moments before the sun has risen have never been so expertly rendered on paper until now. Oxenbury has created subtle gradations of grey and white, steeping the scene in a fuzzy day-for-night that is absolutely stunning. And the details! If you examine the scene closely you can see three watching sheep (one with head relaxing on its front hoofs) as the intrepid heroes creep away together. I'm sorry, but my written abilities are inadequate in describing this scene. Suffice to say, it's gorgeous.What a relief to finally read a farm story in which the animals really like one another (though, technically, the farmer is the most animal-like of them all). In the canon of ducks-as-heroes picture books, place this story squarely on the shoulders of the funny \\"Duck on a Bike\\" and \\"Make Way For Ducklings\\". Any child that wants to know anything about farming will do well to read this book. I'm gushing, and I don't care. It's the best farm story ever drawn. You will enjoy every second of reading it.

The lesson in this short and simple tale is that lazy and unproductive people will eventually get their come-uppance. Personally, I find it has more of a \`French Revolution' flavor but without the guillotine and the violence.As I read their comments, I find some reviewers are reading a different book than I.The farmer is portrayed as a lazy and unproductive human because he IS a lazy and unproductive human. He calls from his bed and chair \\"How goes the work?\\" rather than put his pants on and go outside like a proper supervisor to view the work in progress.The animals chase the lazy farmer out of the farmhouse. They don't lay a feather on him. He doesn't resist to defend his 'rightful ownership'. He just runs away, coward that he is..On the literary analysis level, let's keep things in context. The microcosm presented here is 'Farmer Duck', not *Animal Farm*. Plagiarism? Come on. Comparing the *Farmer Duck* 'philosophy' to *Animal Farm*'s is like comparing a pair of garden shears to a corn harvesting combine.What makes *Farmer Duck* such a good tool is it's the kind of story that you as a parent can talk with your kids about. Ask them what they felt about the relationships between the farmer, duck, and the animals. Ask them how each character's behavior affected them. Having a dialogue with your children about a not-so-black-and-white subject might open doors of opportunity for you as a parent and allow you to share with them what YOU think about it.Or you can just read it to/with your kids, have fun, and enjoy this excellent story by Martin Waddell and imaginative pictures by Helen Oxenbury."},{"Title":"Farmer Duck (Bangali - English Bilingual Edition) (English and Bengali Edition)","review":"A brilliant story of a hard working duck and the animal friends who free him from the tyranny of a lazy farmer.

We witness his tragic decline into evil, a man egged on to wicked deeds by Lady Macbeth, much as King Ahab was encouraged by Jezebel to persecute the prophet Elijah.Hamlet, his &quot;native hue of resolution / Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,&quot; is distressingly indecisive and profoundly contradictory. As the British novelist Anthony Trollope put it, &quot;When men think much, they can rarely decide.&quot; Nevertheless, Hamlet is finally moved to action when confronted with the task of killing his stepfather. Hamlet, says Fallon, is &quot;Shakespeare's most exasperating tragic character. . . . Hamlet defeats us.&quot;Romeo is impulsive and hotheaded, but he is young and we tend to wink and forgive him his youthful excesses.Although Brutus is &quot;the noblest Roman of them all,&quot; he joins a conspiracy to assassinate Caesar.Othello shows how Shakespeare unmasks the tragic dual nature of mankind, portraying the human spirit as at once noble and brutish: &quot;We, like the Moor, are gifted with the capacity to conceive a soaring vision of joy and fulfillment, but, again like him, we can be reduced to primal rage when those riches are snatched from us. Both a lesser angel and a greater ape, we swing precariously between the two natures, unwilling to surrender the one and unable to subdue the other.&quot;Unconcerned with taking a position on ideological issues, Shakespeare's purpose in these plays is to &quot;hold as 'twere a mirror up to nature,&quot; to record the &quot;abstracts and brief chronicles of the time.&quot; Declining to pass moralistic judgments on his characters, he presents them instead in all their nobility and baseness, virtues and vices.Shakespeare takes few pains to explain why his villains are evil. He simply sets them before us in all their multicolored wickedness. His villains are moved by passion, lust, greed, envy, guilt, fear, anger, revenge, hubris, and blind ambition: &quot;They act in a manner appropriate to their twisted nature. We watch them plot their crimes, relish the outcome, manipulate others to provide the occasion, and then destroy their victims with stony unconcern for the suffering they inflict.&quot;&quot;The range of Shakespeare's characters,&quot; writes Fallon, &quot;is extraordinary. [They] are often complex; they are torn by divided loyalties, inflamed with sudden passion, immobilized by melancholy, brightened with joy. [They] excite interest because they reflect our own dilemmas, which themselves have no easy answers.&quot;Various critics have called this book eloquent and lucid, highly informative and wonderfully reader-friendly, entertaining and accessible, free of academic jargon, distilled without being dunderheaded, accessible without dumbing down Shakespeare. I agree. The sketches Fallon offers help us make the experience of a performance more enjoyable, and increase our appreciation for the breathtaking scale of Shakespeare's achievement:rperry1778@aol.com"},{"Title":"A Theatergoer's Guide to Shakespeare's Characters","review":"This book was a gift to my 17 year old granddaughter, a high school senior.

They will read some parts, skim others and even skip some entirely. This is natural. And it definitely applies to me. However, I read every word of Van Rheenen's \\"Missions.\\" I was captivated from beginning to end with both the clear writing and the powerful stories. And all this from a text I was required to read!\\"Missions\\" served as the main text for an introductory missions course I just completed. Just recently sensing that God was calling me to the mission field, I needed a comprehensive overview of this new terrain I was exploring. This book provided that and more. In 11 chapters, it addresses the mission of God, motives of missionaries, cross-cultural communication, the role of strategy, the church maturation process, site selection, and other important issues. Not only did reading this book stimulate my head, it also pulled at my heart. \\"Missions\\" taught me so much, yet also gave me a glimpse of how much more I still need to learn."},{"Title":"Missions","review":"From the beginning of this book it is obvious that Van Rheenen's task is to align mission work with the writings of the gospels for the purpose of glorifying God. For this reason I find that few missiologists have the ability to write honestly about their missionary experiences in the way that Van Rheenen does. As you read through his countless stories of hope and hardship there is no doubt that this man gives all of his energy toward self-sacrifice for Christ's mission work. Through the stories and biblical principles presented in this book you will be encouraged about the state of current global mission work and strategies.In Van Rheenen's words, reading a significant introductory missions text \\"should be the first task of the future missionary.\\" For this reason his book spends significant time underlining theological foundations of missions that are prevalent throughout the Bible. As the reader contemplates Moses' role in God's missionary task the call to do this work becomes clearer. Not only is the call to serve the poor and destitute outlined in the Bible, but it is clear that God is the source of our mission to serve. He desires that through the work of the church missiologists can be led by the Holy Spirit to the target of His mission: the world.More than likely, Van Rheenen writes his book with the undergraduate student in mind. For this reason, he points to the importance of possessing the correct motives for doing mission work. Yes, everyone should feel called to God's mission, but not everyone is equipped for the difficult task. There are many students who possess a desire to travel to a foreign land, but under the surface their motives are less than perfect. Van Rheenen states the need for the student to study and understand the task of the missionary's work. Impure motives will lead to a malignancy in the missionaries ministry and may even affect the indigenous people for many years. It is vital that the student of missiology completes thorough training and studying if they are to understand God's mission for their ministry.After Van Rheenen's chapters on foundational information on mission work he writes about the most important aspect of missiology. According to Van Rheenen, a philosophy of strategy must be derived for a successful ministry to sustain itself once the missionary has left. Not only does the missionary need to plant churches, but he/she must effectively train people and nurture them toward a sense of independence. In the long run, this strategy will produce reproductive churches that continue to grow without the aid of outside help.While this book may be an introductory text for students interested in missions, Van Rheenen's ability to integrate primary biblical foundations with his personal experience provides a worthy text for anyone interested in successful overseas mission work. This is the type of book that should be given to anyone in your church that is interested in going overseas, but lacks the maturity needed to be successful. Through Van Rheenen's book the reader will gain a solid comprehension of the task of the missionary along with important case studies to examine and file away for future work."},{"Title":"Missions","review":"This book should be required reading for anyone who SUPPORTS a missionary or plays even the smallest part in being involved with mission work. (Especially elders of sponsoring congregations) Van Rheenen is not only a missionary in action, but one who THINKS and critiques how to do mission.Van Rheenen gives a solid theological foundation for mission that helps ground and guide all further discussion on \\"how to do missions.\\" This is his most valuable contribution to the discussion of missions.He says that God is the source of Mission. The message is that of the Kingdom of God and Christ as the embodiment of Mission. He points out that the Gospel without the foundation of the Kingdom does not make much sense. (Which is something that can be seen quite a bit these days.) I wish he had spent a bit more time on the two topics of the kingdom of God and the Gospel. Van Rheenen says the church is now to be the embodiment of Mission. \\"Few Christians are able to describe vividly in biblical terms what God desires the church to be. Without biblical undergirdings, the church is swept along by the ebb and flow of culture and in various forms degenerates into a social fraternity. When this happens, the church more nearly reflects the world than the nature of God and has little that is distinctive to offer the world.\\" (28) He calls for the church to reinterpret her very nature. This is valuable for the current discussion going on in many congregations of \\"what does it mean for a church to be missional.\\"He roots the driving force of God's mission in compassion. (Motive) He exposes a number of secondary motives and defective motives for engaging in Mission. He calls for the primary motive to be Compassion.Van Rheenen does a thorough job in discussing the difference between Identificationalism and Extractionism. Indentificationalism is a method of mission where a person immerses oneself in the new culture, learning the language and identifying with the nationals. Extractionism is a method of mission where a person establishes a compound or center that stands in contrast to the surrounding culture that forces nationals to learn to identify with that of the compound/center.Van Rheenen says that people are \\"influenced and shaped by their culture both before and after they come into a relationship with God.\\" (77) He spends time discussing \\"what is culture?\\" and what kinds of cross-cultural evangelism exist. (E1, E2, and E3) He discusses the stages a missionary goes through when adapting to a new culture (the glamour stage, rejection stage, and the identification stage.) Having worked with numerous new missionaries, his insights are grounded in reality.A major strength of Van Rheenen's is his emphasis on strategy and planning. Of course the strategy always begins with the theological foundation. His chapter on Church Maturation takes a walk through a history of missions and looks at several ineffective strategies in the past that did not lead to mature churches. During this part he looks at both the positive and negative aspects of several possible strategies."},{"Title":"Missions","review":"If you have any questions regarding the modern mission field and the difficulties found therein, this is a good book to read. It is easy to understand and presents the most important topics in a way that can apply to all readers. Worth the investment!"},{"Title":"Missions","review":"In reading Van Rheenen's textbook several things jumped out at me. First, a primary strength of the book is its thoughtful and critical approach to missiology. Van Rheenen applies his critical eye to encompass all areas ranging from the biblical and theological basis for mission, to the psychological and philosophical forces the missionary must consider, to practical areas for mission work and lessons learned from his previous experiences. Van Rheenen covers these areas and many more, and often leads the reader to critical conclusions through case studies that serve to elucidate major points while also giving the book a high user-friendly rating. Van Rheenen draws deeply on his own experiences in the mission field to fuel the subjects of his book, and the lessons that he has learned from his past are valuable to missionary and lay person alike. This book also speaks to both the missionary heading abroad, and the church home that is sending them there. Both persons should read this book together if they are to truly form a solid base for entering into God's work on the mission field.The book itself is divided into eleven chapters, beginning with biblical foundations and ending with strategies for church planting, nurturing, and maturation. The critical eye and the range of topics covered are certainly the primary strengths of the book, but it offers others as well. Most importantly, Van Rheenen gives simple praxis to the ideas and theories he bases his missiology upon. This extends the book beyond the classroom and makes it a valuable resource in the hands of teachers, students, missionaries, and churches. The practical strategies apply to questions of language learning to fundraising to church preparation to choosing a mission field. Van Rheenen also equips the reader with the working vocabulary of the missiologist, and this allows the an avid reader to pursue more in-depth or specialized books in the field. All in all, Van Rheenen offers a stunning introduction to missiology. In my opinion the book suffers only in smaller areas. Van Rheenen's experiences stem from his work among African tribal societies, and while these serve to elucidate several points, in an age that is focusing more and more on the Asian continent some experiences from these places may prove useful. This weakness also spreads into questions dealing with urban missions. Again, much of Van Rheenen's previous work was among rural African tribes. These weaknesses can be overcome through studious application of the material by the reader, but at times it is nice to see how past efforts succeeded or failed."},{"Title":"Missions","review":"This will provide an adequate base for further thought and search of the Scriptures on the topic of missions.The author is experienced not only in teaching and writing about the topic, but was himself a missionary for fourteen years.He covers the topic well, spicing the discussion with examples which will help the newcomer to the field relate much quicker with his points.It suffers from a poor view of the means of grace, not clearly sensing and expressing that the Gospel purely preached and the Sacraments administered according to the Lord's mandate are the power of God to spread His kingdom. Thus, he at times relies more on communication models and cross-cultural contextualism than he should.With making these necessary and vital theological corrections as one reads (i.e. reading with discernment) this text serves a valuable introductory aid."},{"Title":"Missions","review":"I was forced to read this book by a professor at a seminary college I am attending. At first glance the ook reads like a doctoral thesis using words that neccessitate access to the internet or a very good encyclopedia set to understand the concepts being presented. A lot of what Van Rheenen cites is not new but regurgitated from pre-existing sociological and cultural relativism studies.As it relates to Christianity there are no new theological arguments simply the incorporation of social skills into the theological mandate to go and preach to all nations.Similar conceptual ideas have been used for years by non Christian entities seeking to infringe upon the civilizatioons they now occupy. Men and women for years have negated their own pre-existing cultural idiosynchrosies and adapted to the native environments of their subjects in order to accomplish their own agendas. Van Rheenen does nothing different it is just a new package he has placed the model into.Yet and still it is a good refresher about the differences which exist in the world between all nations. It is an excellent look at the expansion of the individual mind to include other notions other that it's own. It remnds us that despite the fact that we think America is always right in our approach to ethics and morals, we lack sorely in the demographics of the extended family unit."},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"The best thing about this book and the subsequent books is that the thoughts and atittudes of the Lewrie character are probably more accurate (ranging from panic to misery to disbelief most of the time) than most of the others in the genre. The pornographic elements telegraph themselves and can be ignored since they have nearly nothing to do with either the story or the character. Great history, though. Roman a Clef like the others, but well rendered."},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"The book is in the shape it was promised, it was delivered quickly and on time. The only reason for four stars is that while I understand the cost bait and switch. I will never quite approve of a 11 cent book costing 4.00 to deliver but hey they have to make a profit."},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"This is the tale of an 18th century youth born on the wrong side of the blanket, the son of an morally and financially impoverished minor English nobleman. Even though our hero's father has recognized him and saved him from the gutter, he is used as means to get our hero's dead mother's family fortune by being blackmailed into joining the Royal Navy as a midshipman at the late age of seventeen. The upshot is that our hero becomes a very reluctant but able sailorman. He begrudgingly finds that in spite of himself there is a core of decency and honour that makes him into something of a man. Albeit a man who ruts with after every woman he sets sight on. There is in this rutting a underlying doubt of his own sense of manliness. His rabid hate of homosexuals indicates a character riddled with secret self doubts of own sexuality. He seems to be to disturbed by close and warm feelings that any of his many very handsome friends may cause by to forward demonstrations of effections. He turns his back on one of the mentors on his first ship who had taken the trouble to teach him the skills of a sea officer, when that worthy is seen kissing another man in a carriage at a party where he been rutted like a boar with a married woman. He leapt to the conclusion that this officer was a 'Molly'. The hero/author will present further diatribes against homosexuals in the following stories of our hero's saga. The author's portrayal of the life of the British tar of 18th century is not entirely accurate when it comes to the idea that they were long sufferingly chaste in their sex lives except for when when in port and the ship was out of discipline. Our author is imposing the mind set of the mid 20th century on a time much different where men developed strong male to male ties that were kept separate from their duty to hearth and home. This was the case regardless of class, whether they were of the upper classes or lower. As witnessed by Admiral Nelson, infamous for his laision with Lady Hamilton, still whilst at sea was close to Captian Hardy from whom he asked a kiss before he died of his wounds at Trafalgar. In spite of the author's rabid homophobia, and overlooking poorly written sex scenes, this book and the following tales are good reads. However they will never match up to the stories about Hornblower or Bolitho."},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"Having fallen in love with Patrick O'Brian's work, I started branching out into other naval fiction set in the same era. C. S. Forester and Frederick Marryat are very enjoyable. Lambdin is abysmal. The King's Coat is very poorly written and edited - subjects and verbs don't agree, there are endless misspellings, and any time he's at a loss, Lambdin throws in sex. The sex is fairly explicit, which is OK, but serves no other purpose than titillation of the reader, which is not. It advances the story in no way at all. Lewrie is apparently intended to be a nautical Flashman, but Lambdin doesn't have anything approaching the skill of George Macdonald Fraser. When Lambdin runs out of inspiration, Lewrie tumbles a wench at length and in great detail. The dialogue tends to sound either suspiciously American and modern, or archly dated. Nothing to recommend this book or the series except the fairly well done descriptions of the handling of the ships."},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"I read this novel with the expectation of something similar for the C.S. Forester Novels of Hornblower. Boy, was I disappointed. It really is just an opera set to the background of the mid 1700's British Naval Era. It contains very little in the way of excitement that is worth anything. The writing is not moving and the explicit sexual scenes were over the top. I also take exception to the anti-gay sentiments revealed throughout the book. The writer reveals his true chauvinistic and homo-phobic tendencies with ungentleman like descriptions of women and gays. Reading pornography when I am looking for classic writing about a bygone era is like going to a boxing match and a hockey game breaks out, completely unnecessary. Sorry Dewey, but this one fell far short. I could not even complete the novel it was so bad."},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"This book is a great read! The battle scenes are comparable to Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe series. This book is fastpaced and action packed. Alan Lewrie is the opposite of Hornblower and Jack Aubrey which is completely refreshing, even if he is a lecherous rascal. The dialogue is fresh, quick witted, salty and to the point. I love this character and can't wait for the next book in the series. The fact that the author is a sailor makes the sailing lingo understandable and he includes information about ships and sailing points that helps the reader (sailor and non-sailor alike) understand the business of sailing that takes place in this book completely. Mr. Lambdin has given us in The King's Coat an excellent beginning to a wonderful series and a very rememberable rogue in Alan Lewrie."},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"This is nowhere in the literary league of Patrick O'Brian, but seem pretty well researched. The characters are likable and fun, full of weaknesses as well as strengths. The bawdiness of the book is a real pleasure--this were real people having a wild time. The swearing is incredibly creative as well, a nice change from similar books which may say &quot;he cursed like a sailor&quot;. The sounds like the way people might really have talked. Great fun."},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"This is the first book in a 12 plus book series, about the tales of Alan Lewrie, who goes from midshipman in the British Royal Navy to Captain during the 1780's to the Napoleanic Wars. The adventure is very good, the character development is excellent, we really get to know the midshipman and his thought process. Our hero is not the eagar young person wanting to join the navy, but a privledged (...)son of a Lord, who is 'pressed' into naval service by the trickery of his father. The nautical settings are accurately presented, however, the old english, and the foreign tongues that are part of the story are sometimes a little hard to understand. No need for a dictionary, but prepare to comprehend some passages that are not easy reading.Lastly, while many of our nautical heros do not seem to have a sex life, our hero has a good and vividly portrayed one. He seems to have almost as much fun in bed as he does on the decks of a fighting ship. Overall a great start to a series, I am currently reading book 7 and look forward to the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"If you like nautical fiction of the great age of sail (e.g. Forester, O'Brian, Woodman, Marryat), you will enjoy this opening volume of the action-packed, fast moving and realistic adventures of our tarnished hero, Alan Lewrie. While on water, this book is as good as any of the above writers, excepting of course the incomparable O'Brian. However, our author founders on land with trashy sex scenes more appropriate to a Harld Robbins potboiler. The author trying to model his protagonist on Fraser's Flashman, or Fielding's Tom Jones comes badly ascupper. These humorless sex scenes are perhaps why this nautical series is not as popular as many others. However, once back on the high seas, this book recaptures its pace and becomes highly exciting and enjoyable. One day, however, I hope to open a book with a handsome, brave, cunning and feisty hero in possession of a small penis. It will, however, not be written by the otherwise entertaining Mr. Lambdin."},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"It's takes nerve to invent a new Napoleonic War-era fictional naval hero when you're competing with Horatio Hornblower and Jack Aubrey, not to mention a half-dozen lesser lights. Except Alan Lewrie isn't really \\"heroic,\\" though he has nerve when needed. He's the bastard offspring of a scheming member of the minor London aristocracy, well educated enough and skilled with weapons, but profligate with money and definitely a \\"user\\" when it comes to women. After being set up (we don't know why -- yet) and caught in bed with his half-sister, he has the choice of being hauled before a magistrate or being packed off to sea as a midshipman. After a rough few months, he learns his trade well enough to be of some use on a deck and discovers a love of artillery. He makes some friends, loses some, commits some dreadful blunders, and has some unexpected successes. He's not a villain but neither is he entirely honest. In other words, he's a very human being and probably better than most of his class by our standards. Lambdin writes with humor and verve, inventing believable characters and painting excellent word pictures of the engagements in which Lewrie takes part -- but I wish he hadn't so casually elided what appear to be substantial portions of his protagonist's first year at sea."},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"This entire series is incredibly addictive. Having just finished reading the series for the third time (lacking the oft lamented &quot;The French Admiral&quot;), I eagerly await Lambdin's next yarn. Alan Lewrie, just cast out of his comfortable life in London, thrives after getting his sea legs. Although this book and the entire series has more adult scenes than you will find with Horatio Hornblower, Lewrie's personal flaws make this a much more believable and enjoyable tale. Lambdin uses nautical and social terms of the day and paints a thorough description of life onboard a warship in the late 18th century. If you are fascinated by life during the Age of Sail, or just enjoy historical fiction, this entire series is a must read."},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"The first of a growing series of books about a reluctant Royal Navy hero. I had previously read all of the later books in the series, with the exception of this book and the 2nd in the series, &quot;the French Adirmal&quot; (which is due for reprinting in '99), when I found this one. Thankfully it's being reprinted. It is quite humerous, and bawdy at times, but with plenty of naval action which takes place at the beginning of the American Revolution. Alan Lewry, the hero, is forced to join the Royal Navy at 17, due to some falsely accused improprieties (he was actually framed) which occured at home. Alan is whisked away into the rude and very different routines of shipboard life in the late 1700's, learning a new trade, while trying to live long enough to get back at the people who forced him into the navy. Every time he gets a leg up, so he thinks, his other leg is kicked out from beneath him. At times, it's better than the O'Brian series, only because it seems more real - with an added dose of humor. Although not written in the English spoken in the 18th century, it's far easier to follow. The action is brisk and brutal, as it must have been at the time. A great series, and if you don't mind the bawdyness, one well worth reading. There's plenty to laugh at and more adventure than you can wish for. Once started, it's really hard to put down. The series will grow on you. And you'll be buying them all and wishing Mr. Lambdin would come out with the next book.Greg Toth"},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"I don't believe Dewey Lambdin went out to try to match the depth of style and prose of Patrick O'Brian. O'Brian will be very, very difficult to even match for quite a while. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the romp and action of this novel. I have not yet read the next one, but will soon. If you're looking for lighter reading than O'Brian or C. S. Forrester, this is certainly a choice. Lambdin's Alan Lewrie character is much more of a hero/anti-hero than is Hornblower, and a little more so than is Aubrey."},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"I read this book, the first in the series, and didn't find it greatly attractive. But it was good enough to make me read the *second* book in the series, and, from there on in, they just keep getting better. This is, in my opinion, the weakest book in the entire series. So...bear up, give it a chance, and keep going. You may find your persistence rewarded.The research is excellent. The nautical details are first rate.The sex scenes are unnecessarily lurid. I could really do without all the sex and cussing.But...these are sailors!"},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"I've read all the Hornblower, Aubrey-Maturin, and Bolitho novels and find this series by Dewey Lamdin to be a fine complement to the others. Alan Lewrie is more of a rascal in the first few books than the heroes of the other series but it's also fun to watch him develop into a seasoned British Naval Officer.What sets this series apart is the history. The first couple of books are set during the American Rebellion as told from the British side. I have read very few novels about our War for Independence that are as compelling and fast paced.Later on, the series deals with the French Revolution and then the Napoleonic Wars. Lewrie's duties takes him all over the world and the descriptions of the places and events are very well researched by author Lambdin. The reader gets a much better understanding of the times and events than in the other series by Forester, O'Brian, and Kent.I rate \\"The King's Coat\\" at only 4 stars since it has to spend a lot of time introducing the character and getting him out to sea and there's a little less action than in most of the subsequent installments. For example, I rate the second book, \\"The French Admiral\\", 5 stars since most of it is a riveting account of the battle of Yorktown as told from the viewpoint of a British sailor."},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"I had high hopes for this book, but it didn't live up to my expectations. I have nothing against smut (my wife loves it) but I picked up this book expecting just a good naval adventure series. For me, the author gets a little too descriptive when writing about the promiscuity of the main character. I understand that he's a young naval officer who would have been doing a lot of what the author portrays, but personally I could have done without the vivid details. I've read other series by other authors (Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe series for example) that are more my speed. Portions of this book read like what I'd imagine a good smut book must read like. Maybe I'll let my wife read it and see what she thinks. Other than not liking the smut I think the book is fairly well written, so if you like smut and adventure this could be a good book for you."},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"I have to agree with the comments of the other reviewers of this book but would also like to forewarn first readers that Lambdin has a fascination with ultra explicit sex scenes, and he embeds them liberally throughout his books. This no doubt makes the books more attractive to those who love modern literature but it is likely to be a bit disturbing to those, such as myself, who are more interested in nautical adventures than dime novel discriptions of sexual conquest. This hasn't stopped me from reading and enjoying his books but, as I now start on the fourth book in the series, I'm finding myself skimming through the sex scenes to get onto the real nautical stuff."},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"I must congratulate mr dewey on these series of books,After reading all of C.S. Lewis's Hornblower I must say how much ive enjoyed reading this book.Its such a refreshing change to read about a character that has some of the normal flaws that every one of us has,Rather than the same ole officer and gentleman that we generaly read in the Rammage,,Aubry,,Hornblower sagas.It reads a lot like A Cornwell novel more than a lewis i found it very funny and also packed full of action which kept me turning the pages.Alan Lewrie is no Hornblower hes a cad and a bit of a ladies man but hes more of an intreasting character because of it.I will be collecting this series of novels and following mr Lewries career through the Royal navy.I hope my dewey will eventualy get around to writing about a character in the USN of the same period i would love to see that.I was born in Oxford England and now live in the USA and served in the British Army with the Royal Green Jackets the same regiment as Bernard Cornwells Sharpe."},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"The King's Coat is a good story, maybe better than the 3 stars I rated it, of course I am a fan of nautical fiction with a soft spot for a leading character with a tarnished reputation. It's easy for Hornblower &amp; Bolitho to come out on top in almost every situation because they have no chinks in their armour. Not true with Alan Lewrie. He has some gaps in his character you could sail a ship of the line through! I guess that's what makes this unlikely hero so loveable. The naval detail is good and the characterization is better. The plot was a little thin, more like part I in a larger volume. Sure hope the publishers can find a way to reprint the next book in the series."},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"This guy is not even close to being in a league with O'Brian. His characters are inconsistent and obvious, thin cliches. He makes his hero smart about whatever he has to be smart about at the time, with no relation to his education or background. The writing is sloppy. Every time a leadsman calls the depth, he &quot;mournfully intones.&quot; The sex is overdone and over written. The author's basic attitude is adolescent. The ship handling and battle scenes are good enough to make the books worth a casual read. I'd call him 3rd rate, but that would mean he had 50 guns."},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"For me, any of the Alan Lewrie books are a matter of extremes. I extremely like the fast paced action at sea and the matters of our hero's budding naval career, but I absolutely LOATH the detail author Dewey Lambdin goes into regarding the main character's sex life. This problem faces the reader immediately in the beginning of the book, which opens with Alan Lewrie having sex with his half-sister. Now, I'm not some kind of puritan, but the type of sex scenes in this book are far too numerous and just unpleasant to think about by half. Lewrie's conquests take us into the bedrooms of some very relatively elderly women. Alan Lewrie often seems to cross the boundary between an anti-hero and a just plain immoral person (though he does \\"redeem\\" himself on occasion).So, you might ask, why do I rate the book so highly? The part of the book you're probably considering buying it for, the naval action, is superb. There has got to be three books worth of awesome battle scenes in this one volume alone and they are easily the best I've read in a very very long time. Alan Lewrie, despite being annoyingly perverted is a likable fellow to read about. Lamdin provides an inner dialogue for his protagonist that makes the action at sea feel personal (though on land it merely gives us a window to a part of everyone's mind nobody wants to see).All in all, its a good read. The parts I hate represent a smaller part of the whole book and I usually just skip them as they rarely add any crucial developments to the story. I will warn though, as one who has continued reading the series, if you find the excessive sex scenes (and I do not call them excessive lightly) annoying, the will only grow more annoying as the series goes on."},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"Lewrie is forced to join the navy to avoid the hangman's noose for raping his sister. This book details his sexual adventures as a midshipman with a few sides of naval derring do. Lewrie is a conniving, thieving, toadying, sexual predator that will do anything to get ahead or get in bed. More time is spent on Lewrie's sexual escapades, he aspires to being a pimp, than his naval escapades. His naval accomplishments are due to a marine being stationed to keep people like Lewrie from running away and Lewrie's willingness to break his captain's orders and given word - both actions unbecoming an officer. Towards the tail end of the book he seems to have some of the makings of an officer, more for advancement than patriotism. I dislike anti-heroes and that is what Lewrie is, at least in this first book."},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"Comparisons to Forester's Horatio Hornblower and Patrick O'Brian are understandable because of the subject matter. Dewey Lambdin's Alan Lewrie has more in common with George MacDonald Fraser's Flashman than the earnest Hornblower. Flashman, an officer in the army, shirks dangerous duty at every turn. Lewrie is a cad and forced into the the king's navy. Like Flashman, he craves a life of comfort and sport. Although Flashman is an unwilling participant in the historical events of his day, his observations are always astute and on target. Similarly, Lewrie is a quick study and a natural seaman who often sees strategic moves that his captains miss.Interesting to read a historical novel from the British point of view as this book takes place during the American Revolution. Lewrie's ship is focused on taking prizes that are supplying the American war effort and his ship engages in a fierce battle against the new colonial navy at one point.This was fun. I want to read more."},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"Forget Patrick O'Brian. If you like Alexander Kent and C.S. Forestor, this series is for you! In fact, the hero, Alan Lewrie, is a bit more human than either Hornblower or Bolitho. And Mr. Lambdin certainly provides more humor, while staying true to the history and technical aspects of telling a good sea story in the tradition of Forester and Kent. If you like a GOOD sea story, or if you just like a good story, read this one."},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"For historical fiction, this series is absolutely unbeatable!

Fortunately, he's not stupid and has enough pride to try and not look a total idiot. He also discovers that he not only has an aptitude for life in the Navy, he also begins to like it.Alan is a flawed, but overall sympathetic character. One can chock up a lot of his more ignoble aspects to his upbringing as an unrestrained, unloved bastard son in a thoroughly disreputable household. His father, Sir Hugo Willoughby, is nasty enough to make Alan's larks look like what they mostly are--the japes a wild young man might get up to, given his situation. At sea, Alan is more than competent, once he gets up to speed as a midshipman. In personal relations, he makes friends among the worthy and enemies of types who tend to make enemies easily. On land, he naturally is interested in women...I thought the action and adventure, off the Americas and in the Caribbean, was fast-paced and exciting. And I was intrigued by Alan's character and his ability (or inability) to negotiate his way to having a career in the British Navy. I'll certainly look forward to reading the next in the series."},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"I'm a history teacher and an avid reader. I'm always looking for series for if I like the first, I've got a lot more to read. Dewey Lambdin's Alan Lewrie series is a delight!. I mean no disrespect to C.S. Forester, but Lambdin's books are throughly enjoyable and throughly readable. Yes they are much lighter than Horatio Hornblower, but they are just as good in their own way. And for those who complain about the sex - grow up. Yes it is quite detailed but so are the battles and the depiction of life at sea during this time. The latter is very well researched as is the historical backdrop of the times.Bravo Mr. Lambdin!"},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"If an author sets out to pen a new swashbuckling, age of sail novel, he finds himself in the unenviable position of having to measure up to the works of C.S. Foreseter and Patrick O'Brian. To make these stories engaging to a reader that has already consumed perhaps dozens of swashbuckling naval adventure novels, the main character has to have a hook that makes him stand out as unique. The hook for Lambdin's Alan Lewrie is so simple, I'm surprised that it is new: Lewrie is teen-aged rake and libertine, and \\"The King's Coat\\" blend the staples of the naval adventure with the borderline pornographic style of a cheap romance novel.The results are lurid and earthy, perhaps more \\"Moll Flanders\\" on the gun deck of a man of war than God, King and Country. Lewrie's sexual adventures put a new twist on the role of being the King's man in the 18th Century, especially when compared against the chilly and self-conscious Hornblower. Indeed, Lewrie makes me think of what the lusty Mr. Midshipman Aubrey who got himself turned out among the common hands for keeping a whore in the focsle must have been like. Those in love with the details of nautical life in the age of sail should look elsewhere; Lambin's prose shares a disdain for such matters similar to Forester's; he is no O'Brian. The novel's feel for action borrows a great deal from Alexander Kent's Richard Bolitho novels. Lambdin's main innovation is in his ribaldry.The result is an earthy novel detailing the adventures of a promising young swashbuckling officer entering HM's Navy in 1780. The story is enjoyably precisely because the characters are so human. If you are a fan of this kind of fiction, give \\"The King's Coat\\" a try."},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"This first installment Alan lewrie gets pressed into service. The story is interesting and deals mostly with Lewries difficulties adjusting to his new life as a midshipman in His Majesty's Navy. There are only a couple of battles in this book but it is still an exciting read. The one thing that I don't like is the VERY graphic descriptions of Lewries sexual exploits. It would be good enough to just let you know he bedded certain women. Those parts of the book are unneccessary. I am reading a naval adventure, not looking for pornography."},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"This is the first in a series of 20 books on the adventures of Alan Lewrie in the Royal Navy in the day of sail. I have read ten of the books and am looking forward to the rest. My brother and I cooperate in our reading habits. I get the books first, read them and then send them on to him.. After reading, he donates them to the local small Texas town library where he lives. We have done this for several years and all benefit. He did tell me however that all the books in this series are &#34;keepers&#34; to be reread in a couple of years. The main character (Alan Lewrie) and his adventures and progression in rank over time is similar to Bernard Cornwell's Richard Sharpe 21 book series except that Lewrie's adventrues all take place in a Royal Navy environment whereas Sharpes are in the British Army. The time period is similar an both series are outstanding &#34;keepers&#34;. Read &#34;The Kings Coat&#34; and you will have to read them all (if you can find them)."},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"This is the first book in the series and is well enough written to entice you to read the others"},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"I am not very knowledgeable about naval terminology, but this is sort of educational for me because I am writing a short story with some sea battles. I love the book and the descriptions of the Revolution at sea; you never see much from a British perspective. I really do love the book, but it has some MAJOR issues. I think I really lost my patience with Dewey when Alan is being embraced by a lady to comfort him over his friend's death, and all he can think about is her breasts. I don't care if sex shows up here and there in novels, but this ready like a 1700s porno. And I wouldn't call the author homophobic at all like some of you guys, but I agree the gay scenes weren't the most respectful."},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"I have now read about 15 or 16 books of this series. I rate it as high as W.E.B. Griffin's \\"Brotherhood of War.\\" for pure escapism. A little history, presumably accurate, adds a little flavor to the broth. The series is reminiscent of the Hornblower series of yore, but a mite spicier. If you have read the Patrick O'Brian series and liked it, you'll love this one."},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"I bought this book because it looked interesting, and the Kindle edition was being offered for a very good price. Now I am hooked!! I have read the first 6 books in just a couple of weeks. Alan Lewrie is a very intersting character: part Horatio Hornblower, part James Bond, part Forrest Gump, and part Hugh Hefner. The series has all of the usual historical fiction staples from this era: the nautical terms and speech, the battles, the storms, the hardships, the famous people (Nelson, Hood, Rodney, Napolean, etc). UNLIKE the usual Hornblower or Bolitho main character, we have the good-for-nothing, womanizing, bastard son Lewrie. Well, not good for NOTHING. He discovers, to his own amazement, that he IS good at being a naval officer. He's also good at getting himself in trouble by thinking below his belt. If you like historical fiction from the grand age of sail, and don't mind some torrid sex scenes mixed in, then you will enjoy the Alan Lewrie series. Start with the King's Coat and dive right in!!"},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"I read a lot of military fiction, and this is by far the best British naval series I've ever read. I would call this &quot;Flashman Goes to Sea,&quot; since it has the same sort of ribald approach and a scoundrel hero who succeeds in spite of himself. Written by an American, the series, especially in the first few novels, has a distinctly American point of view. I read with interest the review from the writer who was critical of the &quot;homophobic&quot; bias of the author. While I'll admit that the protagonist, Lewrie, is a homophobe, this is not out of character for him, as he has suffered from the perfidies of his half-sibling, who is gay, and at the time he seems shocked and disgusted by his apparently homosexual superior officer, he is still shy of his 20th birthday. I, on the other hand, liked the descriptions of life aboard ship; the strong battle scenes; the fact that Lewrie is not the perfect little hero; and the glimpses of British Colonial life in both America and the West Indies. For anyone who likes naval fiction, I heartily recommend this series. I have just started the series by Patrick O'Brian, and the Lewrie books are far more &quot;modern&quot; and exciting, at least to me."},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"I really did enjoy this book. more than the amount of stars that i gave it. the character is alan lewrie. a rogue and unlikly hero, he is thrown into his majesty's service by circumstance and tries to make the best of it. the action is fast paced and exciting. it does get graphic at times with the effects of splinters and cannon balls. i enjoy how the hero is not all prim and proper made a good refreshing change from hornblower. my only real complaint is the sex. it is heavy and very un-necessary to the overall story. just thrown in to fill some pages. but apart from that the story is interesting and worth a read. but keep in mind that this book is not for everyone and if you are thinking of buying it for your kids then i strongly recommend looking at the hornblower series. otherwise pick it up and give it a read."},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"Consider this to be a review of the entire Lewrie series to date (Oct 2012). Some of the novels are better than average, some are not as good. If you need me to tell you exactly which ones to read, I suggest you wait for the comic book version.I've read most of the other 18th/19th Century naval series too, and while C.S. Forester is still head and shoulders above all the others, Dewey Lambdin's Alan Lewrie is quite entertaining and always worth a look-see. I have to admit I've never found O'Brian's Jack Aubrey series at all readable - it reminds me of Fenimore Cooper's ability to spew out page after page without actually saying anything. Lewrie is well written and unlike some naval fiction it is obvious that Lambdin knows how sailing ships function and the sailor's language of the era. Some of the current crop of 18th century naval fiction falls just shy of the \\"Shiver Me Timbers\\" school of nautical speak.I have to admit that several of the Lewrie books do get bogged down in stupefyingly dull spy stories, but this is a problem common to a lot of military adventure novels. For the record I think James Bond is dead boring and Le Carre's Smiley is a masterpiece of the spy genre.Much is made of Lewrie's explicit sexual escapades, but the fact is the series is about a contemporary of Tom Jones (and not the Welsh singer look you). Sex was, in fact, quite popular back in those days.Unfortunately most writers of 18th Century Naval Fiction are unwilling to give up on the Young Adult market and consequently the British Navy comes off looking like a bunch of prepubescent boys off on a cub scout jamboree. If you have a problem with sex scenes, read something else. Lewrie's adventures are not written to gain approval by all the various blue nose councils that prefer banning books to reading them."},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"I must admit, this is the first book of this kind that I've read and I found it to be a great book. Although getting through all the sailors slang was a little confusing, this was still a quick and enjoyable read.Lambdin did a fine job in his freshman attempt at authoring a naval novel. He's created a likeable lead man and has a well developed supporting cast. The battle scenes are great and the sex was just raw enough to be entertaining.I highly recommend this novel!"},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"I liked this book, very good on naval tactics and facts. Would recommend it to anyone interested the British Navy of the time."},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"Good light reading. The antithesis to the Hornblower character.

Tell the publisher we want them all! Starting from our hero's &quot;impressment&quot; as a rather old Middie, you are easily captivated by the humanity of this aspiring British Naval officer. Not afraid to admit to himself his fear of cannon balls, or his strong desire to &quot;put the leg over,&quot; Alan Lewrie is a fun-loving, yet suprisingly competent rogue! This is a fun read that you won't put down! You should also read: Horatio Hornblower, Captain Frank Marryatt, and Patrick O'Brian."},{"Title":"The King's Coat","review":"It's probably not fair that when an author decides to write about the English navy during the Napoleonic wars he will be compared to Hornblower, but as the Hornblower novels were one of the first and still the best about this subject, it is to be expected. How does Mr. Lambdin compare? Well, for storytelling, historical accuracy and character development, he's pretty good. However, as a writer--a practitioner of the English language if you will--he leaves a lot to be desired. The prose is pedestrian at best and displays little wit or panache.The story has to do with a young Englishman in 1780, Alan Lewrie, who after an unfortunate carnal romp with his stepsister is hustled off into the navy as a midshipman. Over the course of the novel he serves on the crew of three different ships, is involved in three terrific battles, and survives a bout with yellow jack fever. He also gets into a duel, falls in love, and has several sexual escapades with various beautiful women. Quite an eventful year, one would think, so much so that it teeters very close to the straining edge of credibility. But if you accept the adventures on their own terms and don't consider them too carefully you'll find that they're not too grossly improbable.The detail is pretty good. Although there is--by necessity, one supposes--a lot of nautical jargon, the author takes the time to explain a lot it, and it comes across as very informative and interesting. Here is an excellent example, having to the with the ship's cannons: \\". . . the guns had been loaded with quarter-weight powder cartridges, eight pounds of powder to propel a thirty-two pound iron ball. An increase in powder charge would not impel the shot any further or faster, since all the powder did not take flame at once.\\" This type of careful explanation, along with the maps and diagrams in the front of the novel, help to make the technical jargon more understandable. If there is a fault with the Hornblower novels, and with the Patrick O'Brian novels as well, it is that the authors perhaps assumed a little too much from their readers.The characters and descriptions of sea-life are pretty good too. There is a lot of below-decks, working-class banter that one doesn't get in Hornblower and O'Brian, and also much discussion of the day-to-day, hour-to-hour duties of the average sailor. Again, it's interesting and informative and a presents a different view of the sailor's life from that of the officer class.The problem here is the language which . . . well, it's not awful, but there's nothing elegant or charming about it either. It's a bit coarse on occasion and the f-word is used a little too liberally as well. Worse, it isn't used to convey verisimilitude, or a sense of the times. Lewrie is introduced to his girlfriend's father. His clothing and the, \\"wig he wore fairly screamed \\"Country\\"--of the worst huntin', shootin', ridin', drinkin', tenant-tramplin', dog lovin', View-Halloo variety.\\" Reading language like this, in a novel about English people in 1780, is like listening to the proverbial fingernail on the proverbial chalkboard.It's quite off-putting, but still probably not enough to prevent me from reading the second novel of this series.

In the beginning I couldn't help but to resent Serena and I felt that she was a bit immature for Malcolm personally and I sort of understand why Malcolm was the way he was. To me the reason that there marriage had failed could have been corrected or avoided if they would of take the time to correct it most marriages that start out that young usually go through these types of hurdles.Other than that, \\"Let's do it again\\" is a passionate, emotional, fast-paced, and a sexy read. I thought it was rather cute that the author placed the interludes between the chapters about their past life. It's apparent that Ms. Bryant has a gift in delivering memorable characters that are real as it gets in the romance genre.

If I could rate this a 3.5 stars, I would.I really enjoyed this book because the love between Malcolm and Serena is clearly the real thing and Ms. Bryant does a great job of showing that.However, Serena was very over the top in her attitude and holding such a severe grudge against her ex-husband about how their marriage ended. You read this book and think he must have really done her wrong, so when they reveal what he did actually do, and it is perfectly understandable, it is a let down.Ms. Bryant is a very good writer, she develops the love between the characters in her books and shows why they should be together very well, but this is not the first of her books where the woman has an attitude that makes her unappealing and also has held a grudge for much more time than is acceptable. I will continue to read Ms. Bryant, but I would love for one of these heroines to be truly likable and have a real problem that by the time I get to the end of the book, I am not completely discounting or disliking her character."},{"Title":"Let's Do It Again (Arabesque)","review":"Ms. Bryant have NEVER disappointed me as an author, I already read this book three times, it's got some drama, some humor,sex scenes were HOT,...

The author doesn't pretend to call it a new methodology of hermeneutics, but modestly calls it a \\"process\\"- a \\"mindset that embraces both rhetorical awareness and alertness to the social, cultural, and personal history\\"According to Countryman the text does not exist in isolation. It is not enough to know ancient history and languages. It is not enough to be a scholar. If the final goal of a text interpretation is to create a new triangular relationship, then without a reconstruction of a large, complex social, intellectual, and relational framework this relationship will be only partial. Communities deserve an equal role in this triangle \\"because they were places where human life might be transformed by the surprise of encounter with grace\\".The only issue I still want to find an answer to is what Countryman thinks about ordinary members' confidence that they know it all that stumbles the flow of the conversation. It is sort of scholarly arrogance in reverse. Is this problem purely Protestant?Though Countryman does not pretend to be an author of a new methodology, he offers a Synthetic Method for interpretation. Synthetic Method is Heuristic, not ideological. According to Countryman, his Synthetic Approach views the text as relationships and emotional appeal, and an array of sounds, innovations, and textual and contextual tensions.Countryman found a genius simplistic way to explain his Basic Synthetic method as \\"reading other people's mail\\" that requires respect and careful handling.To achieve a high level of competency in interpretation of a text, the process of interpretation should produce \\"a reading of the text that is both comprehensive, specific, and economical\\". It is easy to lose the audience, if the interpretation is not connected to listeners' context, and if it is either too complex or too lengthy.Synthetic Approach allows the text to blossom in different contexts and includes human factor to lead the development of interpretation. The goal of the Synthetic Approach is to produce interpretative conclusions that are open to discussion.The book tamed my ambitions and encouraged me to engage my congregation in ongoing discernment instead of trying to give them what they habitually expect. As much as I waited for clear solutions, I had to agree with the author that truth is not a possession, neither it is a weapon, but a discovery.The book is calling for a change."},{"Title":"Interpreting the Truth: Changing the Paradigm of Biblical Studies","review":"Interpreting the Truth gives us an overview of many of the issues of modern biblical interpretation. In this sense it may be a necessary read for a believer who wants to be aware of the contemporary quasi-Christian mindset/s.The New Testament is given a fuller treatment than the Old, with Jude, James and Romans given full (sample) chapters.However...Let's start with the \\"Abbreviations\\" page at the start of the book. The RSV and NRSV will be used, we can see, as their names and abbreviations are provided for our convenience and recognition. Wait... can it be? The NIV doesn't get a mention in the abbreviations page at all! So, a book about \\"interpretation\\" isn't even going to mention or make use of the NIV once? It is one of the most popular translations of the Scriptures of our time. It was translated by a huge team from just about every denomination. Surely this is a lack! Or a bias of some kind?Check out the index. There are 23 references to homosexuality and only 3 to Protestantism. Alarm bells are ringing.Take a look at the bibliography. None of the great evangelical names are given even a cursory mention, like D.A. Carson, Blomberg or Bock. Instead we have the standard Yale and Harvard fare.Do we approach the Bible with reverence and awe towards a holy God? Or are we in the business of interpretation? I'd rather keep my naivety and choose the former.It's a shame that so much material by theologians and academics today is neither edifying nor God-glorifying.

It starts with the establishment of a planning structure, then assessing the market and aircraft product against corporate goals, analyse aircraft performance and economics and finally carry out an investment appraisal.As an informed reader from Africa, I have a lot of positive comments for the book.

Too often, we never really get a full explanation of why things are the way they are (plus many people are incapable of articulating it), so one never gets to the heart of the matter.

In the original French, there are only three (3) books - 1. The Three Musketeers 2. Twenty Years After and 3. Ten Years Later. That's it - no more. But when translated, most English editions split the behemoth Ten Years Later into a Trilogy (and some four - which make it all the more confusing!).So the reading list should be 1. The Three Musketeers 2. Twenty Years After and 3a. The Vicomte de Bragelonne 3b. Louise de la Valliere and 3c. The Man in the Iron Mask.

Apparently, most publishers break the Vicomte de Bragelonne into 3 parts - the Vicomte, Louise de la Valliere and the Man in the Iron Mask. (The Oxford World's Classics version does and I too recommend it.) However, some break it into four parts. This volume, 10 Years Later, consists of the last 18 chapters of Oxford's Vicomte and the first 47 chapters of Oxford's Louise de la Valierre. You are unlikely to encounter the Musketeer saga in this form in a printed book but this is an e-book version and probably copyright free! If you are downloading the entire saga to your e-reader, you will need 10 Years Later to avoid a great gap between the e-version of the Vicomte and the e-version of Louise.All of the Kindle versions of Dumas' work that I have read to date have been scanned well and appear error-free."},{"Title":"Ten years later","review":"A fairly good book.

For those who have not read Michael Jecks, but like historical novels, particularly about medieval England, you are in for all real treat.The two main characters in the books are Sir Baldwin de Furnshill and Bailiff Simon Puttock. Sir Baldwin is an ex Crusader knight, who has managed to escape the wrath of the French King who ordered the destruction of the Order and all of its members.Sir Baldwin is now the head of the family manor after the death of his brother and is also Keeper of the King's Peace in Devon.Word reaches Simon that a gang of men have broken into the house of his servant Hugh and attacked the family. When Simon reaches the cottage he find it burnt to the ground and the bodies already buried. It would seem that Hugh must have perished in a dreadful accident, but Simon and Sir Baldwin begin to suspect that there is much more to it than that"},{"Title":"A Friar's Bloodfeud (SIGNED)","review":"Murder most foul raises its ugly head once again in Michael Jecks' ongoing 'Knights Templar' series but this time the loss is a personal one for the team of Furnshill and Puttock. Puttock's former servant, Hugh, his wife and son have been slaughtered and other Iddesleigh residents terrorized by unknown villains. As the Keeper of the King's Peace and his old friend and their wives journey to the scene of the crime to investigate, the reader is plunged into yet another entertaining medieval murder mystery.As events turn out, Hugh's death is apparently wrapped up in the ongoing duel of wits between two competing manors. Discovering just who the murderers are and how the whole puzzle falls together takes up the book's 500 pages, a task not made easier as bodies pile up.A FRIAR'S BLOODFEUD is vintage Jecks. His ability to construct intricate storylines that have the reader frantically turning page after page, his wide-ranging knowledge of medieval England and, most importantly, his ability to construct multi-dimensional characters are all in evidence.As much as I have enjoyed the 'Knights Templar' series, I also find myself coming away from the stories with new insights about humanity circa 1300. Reading A FRIAR'S BLOODFEUD left me appalled at the casual brutality with which the 'haves' of medieval England treated the 'have nots.' Though they were knights, the conduct of the two opposing masters of Fishleigh and Monkleigh was reprehensible but probably typical of those times.In any case, Furnshill and Puttock triumph in the end but you'll have to read A FRIAR'S BLOODFEUD to find out who did it and why. Along the way, you'll be treated to another marvelous, insightful and wonderfully entertaining journey through medieval England.

Most troubling of all, the clash of these two men and their machinations engulf Hugh, Simon's servant. It is up to Baldwin and Simon, along with Baldwin's servant Edgar, to work to salvage a vestige of justice from the harsh events spinning out of control. But even as our heroes become the most clear-eyed center of a storm whirling about them, they uncover shocking realities that rest behind the Odo-Geoffrey feud, and are faced with the reality that in war, justice that they rightly cherish so dearly can be messy and come from unexpected quarters."},{"Title":"A Friar's Bloodfeud (SIGNED)","review":"Jenks knows how to write and tell a good story that is historically accurate.

Daniel Goleman wrote a wonderful book developing that theme. He argues that emotional intelligence can be learned. In Emotional Value, Janelle Barlow and Dianna Maul take that one step further and identify what needs to be learned and how it should be learned.Their point is simple and profound. &quot;Both staff and customers tend to stay with organizations that enable them to experience positive, meaningful, and personally important feelings, even if the organizations cannot always provide everything they want or solve all their problems.&quot; Few will disagree. The conclusion builds on the work of Jeffrey Pfeffer in The Human Equation.There are many important consequences to that observation. First, it costs a lot of money to get customers. It's much more profitable to keep the ones you have than to get new ones (see The Loyalty Effect). Second, if you can deal with the same customers and employees, the results usually are better. Third, with lower staff turnover, costs of hiring and training are lower . . . and operating costs are lower, too. Fourth, bonding can be created among customers and employees that will allow them to derive more value from being involved with the company. Fifth, these improvements are critical in many industries. Most people shift from one supplier to another because dissatisfaction with service, not price or produce offerings. (See The Customer-Driven Company). Sixth, in this stock-market-driven economy, the economic advantages will translate into a higher stock price which can be used to add more and lower-cost resources for the company.Basically, improving emotional value can be the start of creating a virtuous cycle of self-reinforcing improvement for an enterprise.I would be remiss if I did not point out that those who emphasize the importance of values and corporate culture are dealing with some facets of emotional value. What is brilliant about this work is that it transcends this earlier excellent work to take it to a higher plane. You can have great values and a wonderful corporate culture, and still have an emotionally damaging work environment for many of your people and customers.The authors identify five key elements for making this virtuous cycle a reality:(1) Build an Emotion-Friendly Service Culture(2) Choose to Develop Emotional Competence(3) Maximize Customer Experience (see The Experience Economy -- &quot;positive, emotional, and memorable impact&quot;) and Empathy(4) View Complaints as Emotional Opportunities(5) Use Emotional Communications to Increase Customer LoyaltyAs you can tell from my references to many other works, this book builds on excellent studies done by others. Yet, the synthesis here is new and improved. Essentially the book is &quot;a call for civility, empathy, and authenticity in dealing with customers.&quot; That goes well beyond the familiar concept of &quot;The customer is always right.&quot; That concept usually is applied to mean that the employee who works with the customer must be downtrodden and suffer. Burnout is a major problem among frontline service employees, as a result.Ms. Barlow and Ms. Maul see beyond that current stalemate. They realize that the interaction between company and customer can be uplifting for both. Mother Teresa drew great pleasure from helping poor people die with dignity. Doing our work with civility, empathy, and authenticity can add a similar sense of worth to our labors, as well as providing a wonderful, emotionally-rewarding experience for customers.I especially liked the call to action: &quot;It is the service providers' responsibility to manage the emotions in service exhanges.&quot; How many CEOs, executives, and managers are thinking about that? Wow! Before you leave that point, consider that 80 percent of all U.S. jobs are expected to soon be service jobs.The appendices and notes are unusually good in this book. Be sure to take time to review them.The primary weakness of the book is that the sections that allow you to assess where your company or organization is today could be more detailed and specific.When you have finished the book, take some time to imagine the ideal emotional exchanges that could be occurring in your business and organization every day. Then start to design them and teach others how to make them easy, authentic, memorable, and enjoyable to provide. Have a ball!"},{"Title":"Emotional Value: Creating Strong Bonds with Your Customers","review":"It is amazing to me to think about how much business gets lost, simply because front line staff are insensitive to the emotional states of their customers. This is one of the most fundamental facts about business today. Yet, it is one that has rarely, if ever, been addressed. Why? Apparently, because the emotional realm has just been too elusive for most managers and managemnt theorists. In fact, the leading theorist in this area, Professor Arlie Russell Hochschild, has approached the issue from a quasi-Marxist perspective -- suggesting that the acquisition of emotional competency is actually a form of &quot;labor&quot; that alienates workers and forces them to be inauthentic.Barlow and Maul go to great lengths to challenge this mainstream attitude, suggesting that emotional competency is a valuable skill that need not be regarded as a betrayal of one's inner being. The ability to engender sensitivity to the inner state of the customer can be viewed, instead, as the cultivation of our fundamental human potential.Janelle Barlow and Dianna Maul bring a refreshing perspective to this topic. Barlow is already known as the co-author of A Complaint is a Gift. Dianna Maul, her colleague, was one of the founding directors of Horizon Airlines. They base their book on a thorough and up-to-date review of the academic literature regarding emotions in the workplace.One of the most intriguing findings they develop is based upon the work of the Australian scholar, Michael Edwardson (who, incidentally, wrote the forward to this book). Edwardson documents in great detail the fact that customers in different industries have widely differing sets of emotional expectations. A &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach to customer satisfaction, therefore, can never work. But, with the research documenting so clearly the emotional nuances of customers in a wide variety of different situations, the possibility exists for more appropriately informed responsiveness from front line staff.In fact, Barlow and Maul, disabuse us entirely of the very notion that we should be pleased that our customers are &quot;satisfied.&quot; The truth is that satisfied customers are not necessarily loyal customers. The implication here is that new forms of psychological and emotional mastery are required as we enter into the age of the &quot;experience economy.&quot; Some businesses may even discover that they need to acquire skills in cultivating states of joy, perhaps even ecstasy, in their customers. Others will have to uncover new depths of meaning in the words &quot;trust&quot; and &quot;gratitude.&quot;Furthermore, it is not enough simply to pay lip service to such concepts. Businesses are already getting into trouble because their advertising campaigns create emotional expectations that are not fulfilled in actual practice. In effect, with this book, Barlow and Maul reveal that the human potential movement of the past three or four decades has solidified to such an extent that the very survival of businesses today depends upon the ability of managers to master the skills of authenticity and self-realization to a degree approaching what we might think of as spiritual enlightenment.This is no simple matter, nor is it merely another management theory fad. It is bedrock reality in today's marketplace. Barlow and Maul lead us into this new terrain in a manner that is practical, grounded in day-to-day business experience, and informed by the best empirical research available.This is an important book and one that deserves both thoughtful reading and implementation. Because Barlow and Maul are trainers and consultants, as well as theorists, the book is full of practical steps that can be taken to cultivate greater emotional competency within any business."},{"Title":"Emotional Value: Creating Strong Bonds with Your Customers","review":"Janelle Barlow and her co-authors always write well: the message is generally clear and the language is simple. As with her earlier book, The Complaint is a Gift, I got a great deal out of this book, Emotional Value. Very early on I was convinced that, indeed, American businesses do not adequately embrace the Emotional Value concept, at least not sufficiently to use it as a critical operational underpinning. I was also convinced that the narrower notion of Emotional Value very effectively requires the reader to look more closely at the broader notion of the experience economy. (Which I did, to my great satisfaction.) Like The Complaint is a Gift, Emotional Value is a starting place that simply makes sense. To have these ideas so clearly spelled out is a boon for all who are ready to buy into it. But it is of great interest to me that neither of these books - or their central ideas - are being adopted or even considered on any large scale by the one industry that needs them the most: the American Health Care Delivery System. These books, on their own, are simply not compelling to those who would resist. Part of the problem has to do with oversimplification, for example, seeing &quot;unconscious reactions&quot; only as having a negative impact: on page 34, the authors want to &quot;reduce the impact of unconscious reactions ... let us live consciously.&quot; In reality, the appeal is to establish an alternative set of unconscious (as well as conscious) reactions that add to rather than detract from the sales or service situation. In reality, we want to shape, not abrogate our unconscious motivations. Further, the relationship of emotional value as a strategy to the experience economy as a concept is not always clear. Part of the message seems to be that since the emotional value approach focuses on the experiences of the customer, that emotional value, inter alia, is a manifestation of the experience economy concept. Emotional value is rather simply a nicely crafted and smart approach to the service economy. And the book does this task well: It convinced me that there is something beyond simply commodities, products and services that current and future business enterprises will be able to offer consumers. I am ready to make the experience economy part of the health care industry.

Instead, they offer a wealth of scholarly research and sources in their in-depth, colorfully written book, which successfully tackles the enormous role that emotions play in business and customer behavior. They explain and document it, and provide practical applications. We at getAbstract recommend this important book to all business people, whether they offer a product or a service, from CEOs through every level of staff."},{"Title":"Emotional Value: Creating Strong Bonds with Your Customers","review":"Reading \\"Emotional value\\" has been an excellent experience and an eye opener in many ways. The book pinpoints and explores one of the key criteria of working competitively in the \\"experience economy\\" - having a workforce that is skilled in emotional competencies.I particularly enjoyed the debate &quot;emotional labour&quot; vs. &quot;emotional competence&quot;. It is a real live debate in many service organizations with management trying to control the customer experience by stipulating that service-providers should be able to smile pleasantly (i.e. grin and bear) through all customer encounters. And yet grin &amp; bear by the rulebook is often not what the customer wants, but rather genuine empathy and emotional competence on behalf of the service provider. It takes much more than \\"grin and bear\\" and \\"the customer is always right\\" rhetoric to satisfy today's eclectic customer.\\"Emotional Value\\" has reminded me of personal examples where service providers have competently turned my dissatisfaction, anger or frustration into a positive feeling of gratitude. And in doing so they have won me over as a loyal customer. However creating loyal customers by adding emotional value cannot be left to chance. Here the book proves to be a gold mine of practical applications and exercises that can be used to develop emotional awareness and competencies throughout the organization.Thus the book is a valuable blend of inspiring concepts and very practical techniques. I have recommended the book to several friends and colleagues."},{"Title":"Alsos (History of Modern Physics and Astronomy, Vol 1)","review":"I am in no way disappointed with Dr. Goudsmit's account of the Alsos project, especially after reading the truly tedious account written by Boris Pash. For those who do not know the story, Dr. Goudsmit was the foremost nuclear physicist that was not attached to one of the three Manhattan Project labs. He was sent into Nazi Germany with what amounted to a small special forces team to seek out the German atomic bomb project and to achieve three goals - report on the progress of the German scientists, bring as many of their physicists and their materials into Allied hands as possible, and discourage the remainder from going over to the Soviets. There is a mix of humor (radioactive wine!) and deep tragedy (Dr. Goudsmit's parent's house) that make for enthralling reading. This book, along with \\"Assault in Norway\\" and \\"The Farm Hall Reports\\" give a first hand account of the threat of atomic energy had it been achieved by the Nazis. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Alsos (History of Modern Physics and Astronomy, Vol 1)","review":"I purchased this book as a supplemental reference to other reading (The Farmhall Transcripts, Stan Ulam's Memoir, Larry Badash's reading list) and had already read Goudsmit's before this purchase.Basically, the current value of this book is how intelligence officers not schooled in nuclear weapons learn about why some of this technology is not easily found in a garage (unlike portions of the computer industry). The writing style is 1st person and fun, and not intended to be any sort of historic analysis. Some people might find running around France looking for radioactive wine a waste, but some people can't take a joke. The book humanizes Boris Pash more than other books.The book is only intended as a account, not the final word. The latter editions of this book may include photographs, diagrams, and other media not found in earlier editions and can resolve some of the thinking about German atomic piles which the text alone can't convey. It's not a book for every one, it's very context sensitive and other historic reading could put some of this into context (usually Richard Rhoades Atomic Bomb history or equivalent {R. Jungk would work}).Enjoy yourself."},{"Title":"Alsos (History of Modern Physics and Astronomy, Vol 1)","review":"I heard Goudsmit speak on this (and read the book - library copy) when I was at Brookhaven in the 1950's. I found it an interesting tale. ALSOS was the code name of the scientific mission that Goudsmit led to see how far the Nazi scientists had gotten on the atom bomb (without tipping our hand on how far the Americans had gotten!) Goudsmit was able to sift through German scientists because he knew personally every physicist in Germany capable of making an atom bomb.By the way, the subtitle (History of Modern Physics and Astronomy, Vol 1) is erronious, the book is the same ALSOS I read in the 50's and has no such subtitle."},{"Title":"Alsos (History of Modern Physics and Astronomy, Vol 1)","review":"Supposedly about the scientific intelligence teams that wandered through post-war (just) Germany trying to locate the Reich's scientific secrets...When I first ordered this book, I assumed that it would be an exciting blend of adventure and science. Ah, no. Rather, the writer spends an inordinate amount of time telling us about himself, Atomic Theory, pre-war Germany, his role in winning the war and so on. As it turns out, he's had a fairly interesting life, so the book isn't a total bust, but I would have liked to have learned more about the grunts in the field and the risks they took."},{"Title":"Hagia Sophia, 1850-1950: Holy Wisdom Modern Monument","review":"My one criticism of this book - reprinters take note! - is that it does not have a separate bibliography, only endnotes. This, in a book of 250-odd pages of scholarly writing, is completely irritating. But overall it has a wide appeal, in my opinion - I am interested in the history of photography, and his chapter 4 \\"Making a Picturesque Monument\\" has one of the most perceptive analyses I've read on the role of photographs in shaping views of a building and a place into a canonical view."},{"Title":"Green Dolphin Street","review":"I first read this book when I was in high school. Loved it then and loved re-reading it almost 60 years later.In the days when sailing ships still ruled the oceans, two young well-to-do sisters are both enamored with the same man, who is a bit of a ne'er-do-well and is, himself, in love with one of the sisters. He gets into a bit of trouble and must leave England for the untamed colony of New Zealand. The man never forgets his true love and after a few years in New Zealand, he writes back to England, asking the woman-he-never-forgot to join him in New Zealand as his wife. The only problem is--he gets the names mixed up and addresses the letter to the wrong sister! The sister mistakenly chosen defies her parents and makes the trip half way around the world to join the man she loves. He is horrified to see the \\"wrong woman\\" on board ship but realizes he cannot reject her and send her back to England. So he makes the best of the situation.Through earthquakes and uprisings of the aboriginal people of New Zealand, this is a sweeping story of love, hardship, redemption. It is a most enjoyable historical novel and today still reads as well as it did when first published."},{"Title":"Green Dolphin Street","review":"Having read this book in 1955, I wanted to hold it in my hands again.

I'm not sure that Goudge is right about the kinds of love, but the novel is good reading for those who enjoy her memorable characters, descriptions of beauty, and sense of underlying providence.Some of her shorter novels are better. Among them areThe Dean's WatchandPilgrim's Inn (Eliots of Damerosehay, Book 2), also known asHerb of Grace. Both have plenty to say about love.C. S. Lewis is the author of two fine books about love:The Four Lovesis a small, readable volume about the different kinds of love.Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold--one of his finest-- is a very beautiful retelling of the ancient myth of Cupid and Psyche, in simple language, with great depth of meaning."},{"Title":"The Other Parent: The Inside Story of the Media's Effect on Our Children","review":"Steyer presents some interesting ideas and potential solutions in The Other Parent but his blatant ideological leanings and constant fawnings over the Clintons ('I will forever appreciate his [Bill Clinton's] personal kindness' - see the acknowledgements) will trouble all but the most ardent admirers of the former president. Steyer gives no indication if he would allow his own daughter to serve 'under' the former president as an a young intern some day.As to Steyer's take on television and media programming in general, I still lean towards turning it off all together. Steyer believes that with improved programing, more regulation, more taxes (on media and on the rest of us) educational and meaningful television can be revived. This all sounds feasible although I have no more interest in paying increased taxes or creating a larger public television empire any more than being forced to watch Madonna, Britteny or anyone else gyrate, dance, etc in order to sell me more Coke, records, football games etc.I encourage anyone interested in controlling the tube and computers to read The Plug In Drug by Marie Winn, a much more balanced and ideologically-free look at the issue. Bottom line, turn off the TV and spend more time with your kids reading, talking, or playing. And start early; once media habits begin they are difficult to break."},{"Title":"The Other Parent: The Inside Story of the Media's Effect on Our Children","review":"It's a free country.

Welcome to America, ahem... version 2002 it seems. If you don't mind being a consumer then this book is not for you but if you have a feeling like not all is well in the world and howcome your own kids don't respect you any more than you should read the book to find out. In the meantime please don't worry, just turn on TV. You had a hard day at work and you certainly deserve a little soul feeding from the Mother Tube. Mamma Tv is gonna make everything all right. Don't you worry about it Baby."},{"Title":"The Other Parent: The Inside Story of the Media's Effect on Our Children","review":"The book The Other Parent by James P. Steyer is about a man named Jim who works in the media. He is Jealous of his competitors simply because they make more money than him. His competitors went to the same college as him and work just as hard as him. He soon realizes that he loves working and making children happy. On the other hand his competitors only work for money and this is the reason why they make more money than Jim.One thing I enjoyed about the book is I was able to relate to it. The book was really helpful for ma at school. As a senior in high school taking a government class made it lee difficult because there are a lot of sections in my government book that talks about the media and its influence. However, what I did not like about the book was it was advertising too much. This made it harder to read which made it slightly boring.In conclusion, I recommend this book for any high school senior heading to college. This book is tough to understand if you are not taking a government class. The book is fun to read with background information. It would not be enjoyable for anyone who just admires the cover. It would be like hopping in a car without knowing how to drive it, one is just in it because of the color."},{"Title":"The Other Parent: The Inside Story of the Media's Effect on Our Children","review":"\\"If another adult spent five or six hours a day with your kids, regularly exposing them to sex, violence, and rampantly commercial values, you would probably forbid that person to have any further contact with them. Yet most of us passively allow the media to expose our kids routinely to these values...and do virtually nothing about it.\\" - James P. Steyer in \\"The Other Parent\\"James Steyer does a fabulous job examining how sex, violence, and commercialism in the media affect children; why the media is full of these things; and what can be done about it. Steyer, a parent, child advocate, and Stanford professor of constitutional law and civil liberties/head of a children's media company, is well qualified to address these issues. His data comes from studies, personal interviews with key media figures and politicians, personal experience in the media industry, and parenting 3 children.Many of Steyer's points really made me think. Here are just a few:* Over the past 30 years, more than 1,000 studies by reputable sources which Steyer names, have concluded that media violence impacts children in four ways, specified on p. 72.* PG-13 rated movies have a lot of sexual content, foul language and violence, that would have been restricted to R rated movies prior to 1984. p. 57* Children who play with media action figures \\"are bypassing their own imaginations, substituting prepackaged commercial characters and story lines for their own creative efforts.\\" p. 105.Steyer's solution to protecting children from harmful effects of media, begins at home with his 10 steps for parents, whom he calls the \\"first line of defense.\\" Children I know, who are brought up in homes where parents follow most of these steps, are more engaged in activities other than TV and video games, and pester their parents less frequently for toys and junk food advertised to kids. An earlier review complains that one of these steps, \\"teach media literacy in school and at home\\" fails to provide specifics on how to do this. This is true, but Steyer explains that these techniques are well documented in other books which he names. He also provides 10 steps each for the media industry and citizen activists.After reading this book, I feel a lot more knowledgeable about what goes on the other side of the TV and other media. I learned more about how to protect children from harmful media effects, and felt supported in what I do know. I highly recommend this book to all adults who have an influence in a child's life."},{"Title":"The Other Parent: The Inside Story of the Media's Effect on Our Children","review":"The book discusses the damaging influences of the the media of the market economy. Television, radio, advertisements, video games etc., they all about making money fast in the most irresponsible way. This can only happen, because we let it happen. Us, parents trust the media, maybe because we watched TVback then, and turned out to be OK adults (at least so many of us think).The author though warns us: the generation we are raising is being exposed to the media a whole lot more agressively and heavily than we were 15-20 years ago. Many families have poor interaction because each member has its own TV set. This fact might contribute to isolation, loneliness even within the family.This book should be read by every parent or future parent, so we can raise children who are not the victims of the greed the media is all about."},{"Title":"The Other Parent: The Inside Story of the Media's Effect on Our Children","review":"James P.

We have seen this sort of thing before, but this is the first time from an insider's point of view and from a law professor whose expertise is first ammendment and civil rights. James P. Steyer is a well-known liberal and a champion of children's rights.This is a clarion call for all families to take a stand against big media's influence; and with James P. Steyer leading the charge, it is surely winable."},{"Title":"The Other Parent: The Inside Story of the Media's Effect on Our Children","review":"Steyer not only outlines the negative impact of the media on all of us and children in particular; he offers a workable solution, one that concerned individuals can and should begin to impliment and fast!"},{"Title":"The Other Parent: The Inside Story of the Media's Effect on Our Children","review":"This is a must read for anyone who plainly sees that \\"market values are not necessarily family values\\" and that the media has abused its priveledge to use our public airwaves for their short term market value.

Mr. Steyer reveals what's really behind the methodology of the media industry -money of course - however they just don't know when to stop and our kids are their biggest and easiest target for their big purse strings through their constant manipulation and exploitation of airwaves with commercialism, sex and violence. As a parent you need to take responsibility to ensure that your children are not over-exposed to the media and to really evaluate family priorities. Well worth the read and advice that Mr. Steyer gives."},{"Title":"The Other Parent: The Inside Story of the Media's Effect on Our Children","review":"I read this book after reading Gerard Jones' _Killing Monsters_ and was disappointed. Much of the book is spent describing the intertwined homogeneous nature of mass media. However, this shouldn't be news to many people. We are supposed to be shocked and outraged that the people who are programming television \\"entertainment\\" are doing it to make money at the expense of our children. We are supposed to be surprised that shows like the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers are parts of extensive, pervasive campaigns to extend brands across television, movies, toys, cereals, etc. We are supposed to be outraged that the mass media has close ties to government. Does he think we've been living in a cave?However, Steyer distorts a grim picture to make it appear even worse than it is. Yes, Colin Powell may be friends with the chairman of AOL Time Warner, and maybe that had something to do with his son being appointed to the head of the FCC, but Steyer neglects to point out that Michael Powell served as an FCC commissioner for years beforehand, and that his father was a board member of AOL/TW until he resigned to join the Bush administration.Furthermore, Steyer's suggestions of what parents can do lacks the specifics that would lead to action. He advocates increasing \\"media awareness\\" in our children, but doesn't suggest many sample activities that might help our children control their media intake themselves. Our children will grow in an environment where they will not be isolated from the mass media no matter what we do in our own homes. They will see and hear about terrible things, like it our not. We need to provide them with the tools to cope which they will use the rest of their lives."},{"Title":"The Other Parent: The Inside Story of the Media's Effect on Our Children","review":"This is a must read for anyone who plainly sees that \\"market values are not necessarily family values\\" and that the media has abused its priveledge to use our public airwaves for their short term market value.

This is an excellent book for a parent, or someone exploring this topic for the first time who is looking for an easy read that presents them with straight facts about childrens media without a lot of analytical or psychological babble.The book lacks in-depth analysis of child development and media effects which could be seen as a negative of this book. But if you're a parent you probably know your kids. This book will give you the insight into the media companies that are effecting your kids. It's not a complete analysis but this book is written clearly enough that any parent interested in reading this book to begin with will be able to connect the dots from their childs actions to the info in this book.I think this book is very important because it deals with \\"what\\" the government and media companies are doing to children through the media, instead of \\"how\\" what they're doing is effecting our children. After reading this book you will realize that \\"how\\" stuff effects our kids is not nearly as important as \\"what\\" is being shown to them. Because without the \\"what\\" the \\"how\\" isn't a problem. Reading this book calls to your own conscience to do something about this instead of just understanding it's consequences.&lt;A great follow up to this book is Minnows \\"Abondoned in the Wasteland\\" which is entirely about FAA and Government regulations on Childrens TV and advertising.>"},{"Title":"The Other Parent: The Inside Story of the Media's Effect on Our Children","review":"In the 1960's, one of the things requested by the leaders of the Black Movement was the more frequent appearance on television of Black performers. Specifically, these performers were to be in programs where they portrayed competent, contributing people. Such programs as Amos n' Andy, under pressure from Black leaders and Civil Rights advocates, were removed from television. Their demands were guided by the belief that the way in which Black people were portrayed on television would have a marked effect upon society's evaluation of the Black race.In the Sep 2003 U.S. News and World Report magazine article regarding the 100 documents which affected our country's history, it is stated that the words we use to communicate our ideas to one another have the power to provoke images and emotions which can revolutionize our society.The ability of literature, whether written or performed, to transform people's values and thus society is not a radical or new notion. It is the principle upon which our American education system is based. We do not believe that human beings are locked into a set of values which they either inherited or which were formed strictly from association with close relatives. We believe that education and environment can alter our principles.I agree with all the previously stated ideas, so it always amazes me how so many of the people who are proponents of the power of education, proponents of the power of literature to shape our values, are often the most vehement in denying that television, music and movies have had a profound effect upon our society's values. The only way that I can reconcile these blatantly contradictory notions is that perhaps what these people are meaning to say is that, books, television, movies, and music do have the power to modify our ethics, to modify our stereotypical perceptions of a race or a gender, and do have the power to affect our notions of equity, but with regards to the sex and violence that saturate these mediums, these are just things that temporarily excite us and have little affect upon our values.This belief is not supported by either logic or experience. The reason that our entertainment is saturated with sex and violence is because there are few things which have a greater capacity to affect us, to arouse us, to absorb our attention. For better, for worse we are chained to one another for our most intense emotions. The egocentric sweetness of self-fulfillment pales in comparison to the emotions generated by the adulation or domination of our fellow human being. Logically, you do not repeatedly arouse human beings' most intense emotions without creating an even greater appetite for more stimulation. However, although we might have a longing for this stimulation, most people will subordinate these desires to society's expectations of socially acceptable behavior. Thus few of us become sexual addicts or sadists or serial killers. Hence, the assertion by the media and others that this steady dose of sex and violence has little affect upon us. But it has. We have allowed ourselves to enjoy the reduction of a human being to a sexual object. We have allowed ourselves to enjoy seeing another human being physically harmed. This enjoyment reduces our aversion to these emotions and when a significant percentage of society finds pleasure in these emotions, its eventuates in the altering of socially acceptable behavior. And we are seeing the results of these changes, children killing children, a drug-infested youths, schools patrolled like prisons, babies having babies, a plethora of families without fathers.Unfortunately, many people feel that even if this type of entertainment does have deleterious effects, our freedom is more endangered by censorship than it is by these aforementioned negative consequences. First, let me state that we already have censorship. We do not allow nudity or acts of fornication in public or on commercial broadcast stations. We do not allow cigarette or alcohol advertisements in elementary or high schools. We do not allow teachers in these schools to teach hatred of a religion or race or gender. We do not allow the advertisement or sale or consumption of narcotics. In most states, prostitution is illegal. Censorship already exists. Second, the notion that censorship of literature or entertainment is a threat to the freedom of being able to criticize the policies of our government is a relatively new concept in the United States. Up until the 1960's censorship of entertainment was considered a given in the United States. The fact that this country, the most free society that the world has ever known, was able to not only survive but thrive for over 150 years while at the same time having a censorship of entertainment policy negates the notion that freedom is threatened by such a situation. England is another example where freedom to criticize the government was considered to be very different from the freedom to make one's living by appealing to the prurient interests of the public. Victorian England allowed Karl Marx to promote his ideas whereas libidinous France banished him from their country. There are a multitude of other examples where the government was a dictatorship but there existed no censorship of entertainment. It is to a dictator's advantage for the populace to be a slave to their passions, rather than a people working together to determine what literature and entertainment will promote within their children respect for the dignity of people.I am very thankful for such books as \\"The Other Parent\\". Mr. Steyer recognizes and is trying to combat the crisis which this steady dose of sex and violence and consumerism is breeding in our youth."},{"Title":"The oneness of things ;: The reality of spirit","review":"This pamphlet speaks from a Swedenborgian perspective of the spiritual / natural universe as a unified creation of God.

Like any small company, we need to focus to be successful. The Partnering Imperative is helping me decide what large companies our small company should partner with and also helping us predict the success that our partnering efforts will have. For our small software company, our partnerships will make the difference between our being a success that people will read about or another software company that had a great product but just could not break the $50 million in sales mark.For the large equipment vendors who have to partner to \\"avoid the negative\\" of not working with small nibble companies who can fill in gaps in functionality, there is tremendous value in this book as a guide for avoiding the pitfalls of partnership between large and small entities. These are the situations where the larger partner often tries to manage away the risks presented by the differences between it, the larger partner, and its chaotic but essential smaller partner. In these partnerships, the larger organization is busy managing formal communications processes and preparing to walk away at the slightest hint of failure. If big and small companies can be aware of these tendencies from the start, they are more likely to stick it out and reach partnering pay-off.For smaller companies who need to partner to gain access to distribution channels and installed bases of customers, The Partnering Imperative provides a pragmatic guide to dancing with the \\"elephants\\" that small companies must work with. Smaller companies who expect their larger partners to revisit agendas to address emerging needs, will be be more successful if they are address \\"big partner\\" concerns like avoiding surprises and differences through formal communications process with lots of checks and balances."},{"Title":"The oil conquest of the world (Conquests of science)","review":"To be honest, I haven't read this book.

There are a lot of interesting historical photos and the contents are interesting especially since it's such an early account of what has become such a major influence on current world affairs. The title is obviously pretty ironic.I like the book just for the historical black and white photos. there are a lot of them. the first one is captioned \\"the first oil well\\".This is one of those books I'd think should be collectible but doesn't seem to be.I would say, look for the 1914 edition.

Actually the one star given in the rating is more than it deserves. I definitely DO NOT recommend this book. Do not waste your money on it..that is my definitive advice~"},{"Title":"Your Birthday Sign Through Time: A Chronicle of the Forces That Shape Your Destiny","review":"Il s'agit du second exemplaire de ce livre: j'ai pr&eacute;f&eacute;r&eacute; l'offrir &agrave; ma petite-ni&egrave;ce plutt que de me s&eacute;parer du mien qu'elle voulait emprunter.L'acc&egrave;s chronologique &agrave; l'&eacute;tude des personnalit&eacute;s a l'avantage de les replacer dans leur cadre historique et dans le conflit entre g&eacute;n&eacute;rations.

Sadly this book does not rise above the level of right wing Sinhalese propaganda. There are few regional security implications from LTTE activities. Whilst the LTTE is undoubtedly an international organisation, all its military activities are carried out in Sri Lanka. Neither the LTTE or the Sri Lankan Government is blameless or heroic, but a more balanced book would have focussed on how ethnic conflicts can spiral out of control and the need for a sensible, conciliatory approach to such conflicts. This partisan book falls far short of that standard."},{"Title":"The book of woodcraft and Indian lore (The library of pioneering and woodcraft)","review":"This is apparently a photo copy of the original that is bound as a book. The copy is not enhanced so it looks like someone used a library copier and bound the results. It appears the original was in a 5 by 7 format and thus the copy has 2 to 3 inch margins. A good book produced in an inappropriate format."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"For those unfamiliar with the DIRK PITT series, yep, this may very will be as corny a novel as you will ever read. However, one cannot escape the fact that Clive can spin a GREAT yarn, interweaving past and present issues/stories, some interesting historical and factual data, and action at a breakneck pace. This novel has more depth and texture that a lot of 'turn the page thrillers' out there today, as Clive does his homework to present us with some neat historical gems to tie a modern-day action thriller (end of the world, of course) with the past (a 'Fourth Reich' bunch of wackos from South America who are from the Nazi bloodline, and are hell-bent on running the world in their way, and will do anything to do it).I have read nearly all of Cussler's novels, and yes, I do expect a certain level of action, unreality, and over-the-top plots - but, heck, that is why I still read the books! This is not literary genius here (it would be like Star Wars getting an Oscar for Best Film!). In a world like the one most of us live in though, one can find a great escape in entering into Dirk's world. For those who dismiss these kind of books, I do feel sorry for - however, all of us need a good romp into adventureland once in awhile with Dirk and Co. - and CC is the man to take us there!!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Why o' why do so-called literary experts take such delight in trashing Clive Cussler and his Dirk Pitt series? For those of us who are devoted fans, we're getting a little tired of all the bashing. Thousands of fans can't be wrong! &quot;Atlantis Found&quot;, while widely panned by the &quot;experts&quot;, will be a great addition to the &quot;Pitt collection&quot; for Cussler fans. Well, let me get off my soapbox long enough to give my impressions of another exciting, escapist trip with Dirk Pitt, Al, Admiral Sandecker and every one of the great characters that we've come to know and love! &quot;Atlantis Found&quot; is a throw-back, in a way, to some of Cussler's earlier works. The plot, albeit somewhat ultra-fantastic, is founded enough in factual data to be at least somewhat believable. And, as usual, great action, terrific villians and plenty of gadgets abound. Suspend your world of reality for a few hours and plan on a taking part in a fantastic journey to locations spanning the globe! If you haven't had the opportunity to read one of the novels from the Dirk Pitt series, this is probably a good place to start as any because, as mentioned earlier, almost every major &quot;player&quot; is part of this book. Perhaps not as strong an entry as &quot;Raise the Titanic&quot;, &quot;Deep Six&quot;, &quot;Pacific Vortex&quot; and &quot;Treasure&quot;, &quot;Atlantis Found&quot; will not disappoint Cussler fans (Back on my soapbox, let me say...) To Cussler critics everywhere - back off! For true fans of a great series, as long as Clive keeps writing &quot;them&quot; we'll keep buying them!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"what the heck, even if I give it only two stars for poor writing, lame charectors, and contrived situations, it is fun in the same way those old Captain America and Bucky cartoons were. I mean, this book has it all...Evil Nazi clones! Jackbooted goons all in black riding SnoCats (as seen on TV in the Man from Uncle)! Loneghrin's Spear (aka the Holy Lance, per Cussler \\"the holiest relic in Christianity!?!)! .... Butwait, there's more! You can have a bundle of fun laughing at Cussler's grasp of science and history. I always thought Star Trek was the low point of pop science, but no longer, Clive has taken the nadir for himself. .... And the history is even sillier. Cussler has a historian say \\"it's a fact that the more advanced a civilization, the less they leave behind them\\". Huh? That makes no sense whatsoever. ...."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is the first Clive Clusser book I've read; I selected it because people told me that anthropologists/archaeologists are main characters and I'm an archaeologist. Oh lord, I got my first huge chuckle from mammoths freezing solid where they stood (in preface or intro) and continued laughing from there. Not sure what is funnier: Atlantians colonized Antartica, the Forth Richt (as in Nazi's were the Third Richt, not sure how to spell 'richt&quot;), the so-called archaeologist acting like a hired killer/adventurer, or the author writing himself into the novel-on Antarctica of all places. Read this book only if you want a good laugh and have much freetime, its long with tiny print."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"My fist time to read C.Cussler, and likely last one; although the story could have been appealing, it lacks scientific accuracy of Michael Crichton, or thrilling military storry telling of Tom Clancy; the all story is set up to make D.Pitt a super hero if not a living legend; that goes too far, too fast, and looks non plausible; at the end of the book, one don't take anymore the story; too bad."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"The aim of any fiction writer is to get the reader to suspend belief. My ability to do this was greatly impaired by Cussler's writing. His characters are hardly even one-dimesional, his grammar is no better than a schoolchild, and his dialog is, frankly, dreadful.In the book's favor, the storyline is strong and well thought out. That didn't, however, outweigh the many, many faults."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Let's all admit it -- Cussler does not write great literature, but he sure is a lot of fun. I just so happened to read a (nonfiction) book regarding yet another Atlantis theory at about the same time as I read this book and I was favorably impressed with some of the research he included about crust displacement theory. I was also glad to see Cussler wrote hiimself into the story again -- I had missed &quot;seeing&quot; him in the last couple of novels. And I'm very glad he's gone bakc to writing his novels himself without any poetic help. The thesis of this book, which includes Atlantean mythology combined with genetic engineering, is quite interesting and once again Cussler's imagination brings us to imagine the &quot;what if?&quot; in a story. Of course Dirk and Al survive every trap, setback,injury and diabolical plot and manage to save the day, but one expects no less from them or Cussler. The closing pages of the book disturbed me a bit -- I'd prefer not to see any changes in the Dynamic Duo. All in all a great, fun, &quot;till 2:00 a.m.&quot; read."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I agree with the Kirkus Review cited above: a good story, driven by a fascinating hypothesis, crippled by just amazingly bad dialogue. How a writer as adept storytelling as Mr. Cussler obviously is and has been throughout the entire series of Dirk Pitt adventures can continue to be so chronically tone-deaf when it comes to dialogue is one of the great mysteries of popular fiction."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"The book might have been alright, but the narrator of the unabridged audio tape left a great deal to be desired. It sounded like he was reading to an audience without a microphone and was trying to be heard by the person sitting in the last row. There was no feeling in his voice. I listen to all of my books by audio tape on my commute. I had to quit listening to this one because it was so awful. A weak story and a very bad narrator. I will make sure that if the narrator Michaiel Prichard I will NOT BUY the audio tape."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have read most of Clive Cussler's books and this should be rated among the best. Dirk Pitt and the Numa Agency boys are at their best. The Fourth Reich is one the best villians yet. The action is almost non stop. It was hard to put the book down once I started reading it. If you like fast paced action this book is for you."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I get tired of reading reviews of people who pick apart the 'science' in a fiction novel. Duh. Go read so-called non-fiction books that are totally bogus. Fiction is written to entertain and this book does that job quite well. Cussler has always pushed beyond the edges of science-- consider Raise The Titanic-- not likely now that we see the ship but, heck, it was a fun story. Another guy who does this same thing with fiction is Greg Donegan with his ATLANTIS book which goes into some very intriguing area, particularly the workings of the human mind."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have always avoided the Clive Cussler section of the bookstore because, quite honestly, I didn't trust someone with that kind of a name to entertain me for endless hours. I was under the misconception that he was just more Tom Clancy ala undersee. I WAS WRONG! Atlantis Found is one of the best books I've ever read of its genre. It's fast, furious and exhausting. It even has Nazi's and they always make the best bad guys. I am now committed to reading every Cussler out there. Read it."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"It is absolutely criminal that we wait 2-3 years between Dirk Pitt adventures. Clive Cussler weaves a tale like no other author I have ever encountered. You always begin his novels and say to yourself: &quot;how can he possibly tie these events together?&quot; The Lost Continent of Atlantis, professional hitmen, Colorado mines, comets, ancient caves, Nazis, etc. Cussler binds it all together like a pretty Birthday package. While I want to read on, I force myself to ration the book, for I know that the long wait begins as soon as I finish. Each and every chapter has you rooting for hero Dirk Pitt and constantly marvelling at his quick wit, skill and bravery. Of course Cussler has added a new twist to one of the baddest groups of all time...Nazis. To author Cussler, I say &quot;Bravo&quot; and sincerely ask...Couldn't you be a little more prolific?"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have read all of the Dirk Pit novels and enjoy them. Sure they are fanciful and follow a standard formula. Like Dean Koontz novels do. However, when it comes to an entertaining read, I will always look forward to the next Clive Cussler novel about NUMA."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I'm about 2/3rds into this my first Clive Cussler novel. I've picked them up and put them down for years and now I wonder why I did that everything I really enjoy is in this book archeology, aliens, suspense,Atlantis. So far I am amazed at all the different plots and angles and twists and turns this book is taking and I intend not to let a Clive Cussler book sit unread again. Thanks for the adventure.."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Clive does it again! Excellent, tightly-woven plot, cool possible historical info, kickin' adventure. This has it all, along with humor and, dare I say it, romance! Cussler's books are always excellent, but this one is one of the best. Nobody does it better than Dirk!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Having read all Cussler works, I was a bit disappointed with Atlantis. Good settings and good action, for sure, but there was something missing. Perhaps Flood Tide was so good that this book, eagerly awaited, was a bit of a let down. I missed the prologue of history that ultimately gets rolled into the plot -- a streaming comet didn't do it for me. Cussler deserves great credit, however, for keeping Pitt as charming and heroic as ever but the &quot;aw shucks&quot; didn't seem to work this time. Still a fan and fervently hoping for the next Dirk Pitt Adventure"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I felt it certainly wasn't in the leage with some of his other novels, but as a huge fan of Mr. Cussler's work I read everything he puts out. Found this book tedious in places, especially the dialogue between him and Al Giordino, people don't really talk that &quot;stiff&quot; to each other. Also found the book in spots to be an advertisement for scuba gear, dive watches, etc...constantly telling us the brand names, apparently for each mention Mr. Cussler gets monetary reward. Again an enjoyable book, but though it lacked a lot of intensity. But as a loyal fan, I eagerly await the next Dirk Pitt adventure."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I am a big Dirk Pitt fan, having read all of the books (mostmore than once). Atlantis Found, though, is a stinker. The plot istrite (Hitler's children; sappy romance with the Congresswoman) andfilled with flaws. Did Clive Cussler really write this one (on automatic pilot), or did one of his proteges just follow the formula?"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"One of Mr. Cussler's best efforts. Dirk continues to be a cross between &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; and James Bond&quot;. Once you begin to read this book, you won't want to stop until you finish it. Having read all his books, it is nice to have the &quot;old familiar Dirk and Al&quot; back again. I am not looking forward to waiting another year or more for the next Dirk Pitt. Keep them coming! Why hasn't Spielberg and Lucas made some his books into movies. This book surely could be a Oscar winner?"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I've read numerous Clive Cussler books - including Raise the Titanic, all the way up to blue gold, but I consider Atlantis Found to be Cusslers Classic. Dirk Pitt has never been better than he is in this entertaining novel. With willpower, grit, and smarts, Dirk gets the girl, saves the world, and rides of into the sunset again. If you are a Clive Cussler fan you'll love it, if your not you'll be racing out to grab another Cussler after reading this impossible to put down book. Do yourself a favor and purchase it today. Pure entertainment!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have read all of Cussler's books. This one is a Dirk Pitt adventure. I would have to say that this tale is a little over the edge as far as believability goes. There are a good cast of characters and there is certainly a degree of suspense but it makes Raise the Titanic seem almost possible by comparason. That's not to say it is totally unbelievable - there is a good deal of truth to the story; and a great deal of creative thinking as far as technology goes. All in all, I did enjoy the read .. but I have read better Cussler books.How lucky can one guy actually be?"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This has been one of the best books I've read this year. I can not recommend it enough. Cussler pulled together a tremendous amount of ideas that continued to surprise me and enticed me as I read. Atlantis Found is a wonderful combination of lost civilizations, new nazis, Graham Hancock, Charles Hapgood, the Spear of Destiny and a few others. Alot of fringe ideas that are only now beginning to cause massive changes in ideas in the archaeological and prehistoric fields. What I liked so much was that I actually knew what he was talking about. Finished this book in just over two days. An immense joy to read."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"So far, this is my favorite Dirk Pitt book. Cussler pulls out all the stops in a story that wastes no time. In Pitt's tightest schedule yet he has ten days to avert Armeggeddon, and he doesn't even know it! The suspense builds with each page, and you'll definitely be chilled by the nonstop thrills and action."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This Dirk Pitt novel involves a missing ship that reappears 56-years after it was considered dead. Pitt is lead to an ancient mystery with a diabolical enemy--but he is up to the task. Good, light read."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"If you love adventure, this is a great read. This is my first Clive Cussler novel. I must admit that I picked this book up because I remember as a little boy watching my dad with his flashlight reading &quot;Raise the Titanic&quot; until the wee hours of the morning on a family camping trip. I figured if dad couldn't put the book down (since he never read) then Mr. Cussler must be a pretty good author. I was not disappointed...if anything, Clive gives you more than you bargained for in terms of stories, thrills and excitement. While I agree with others assesments about the book being over the top, isn't that what a perfect adventure is supposed to be all about? The Wolf family, the beautiful but evil family spawned from the very seed of Hitler himself, makes for a great threat to world peace. The means of world destruction laid out in the book was quite fascinating and Mr. Cussler has no doubt done his homework on the subject. I was also intrigued by Cusslers &quot;Snow Cruiser&quot; which plays an integral part of the story and found that it is a real vehicle that truely exists. Dirk Pitt, the hero of the story definately deserves his status alongside the likes of James Bond &amp; Jack Ryan."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"What a book! This is the first one by Cussler that I have read and enjoyed all but the last few chapters. The ending was a little outlandish but overall Very good."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I just recently started reading the Dirk Pitt series, and I am thouroughly hooked. Mixing historical background, meticulous detail, and action has made Atlantis Found an enjoyable read. I could not put the book down!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I read Cussler a lot. THis is the same old formula used for the 15th time. The formula goes like this: an ancient event that will have consequences in the future, undetroyable Pitt appearing by page forty or fifty ( in mass market paperback ). Then the rest of his pals ( GIordino, Rudi Gunn 0 appearing subsequently, an enemy as bad as Satan himself, the old romance with congresswomen Loren Smith, admiral James SAndecker, etc, etc. COnclusion: it's good."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"this novel caught my eye due to the inspiring title including the word 'Atlantis' and hence i thought that the book might be of some good thing substance. yet it was not, although the underlying theory was interesting and provide some mild contenment for somebody interested in the subject. it was in a way very similar to previous factual books by the likes of George Hancock and Charles Hapgood discussing the possibilty of Atlantis being discovered under Antartica. the incredulous character of Dirk Pitt does nothing more for the book than the manner in which it was written. an involving plot seemed to be the only bonus from the novel that was ultimately a James Bond story told in a slightly more interlectual way."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Boooring! The hero is of course taller, stronger, and smarter than anyone, and all of the women are sexy, sensuous and in love with him at a single look. Moreover, it was a re-hash of the old Nazis-rising-again theme, with a generous dose of German-bashing. Tries for a Crichton archaelogical depth, but never achieves credibility."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I first became a fan of Clive Cussler's novels at twenty years ago when my interest in the Titanic led to my reading his classic &quot;Raise The Titanic&quot;, which was a magnificent novel and led to a fascination with the author's books ever since.However, since Cussler's golden age of Pitt novels, which to me encompasses &quot;Raise The Titanic&quot; through &quot;Cyclops&quot; I really think the novels have lost a bit of their magic since then because ever since &quot;Dragon&quot;, Cussler has fallen into an annoying habit of basically writing the same story with variations on the setting, stakes etc. &quot;Atlantis Found&quot; is no exception to this because once again, the villain(s) is some major businessman and his/her family who have been plotting their treachery for so long. Strike one because this is once again very unmemorable for me. Then, strike two in that the opening prologue set-up once again has very little to do with the actual storyline in the final analysis and serves more as window dressing. This is a far cry from &quot;Raise The Titanic&quot;, &quot;Vixen 03&quot; and &quot;Night Probe&quot; when the set-up tied into the story and the payoff in a major way. Instead, the story of the neo-Nazis trying to build their &quot;Fourth Empire&quot; is something served up to us out of the blue, along with a subplot about Nazi &quot;sacred relics&quot; that is given to us by a convenient duex ex machina character (a retired Nazi admiral) who is there to dispense his info and then disappears completely.I also regret to see that Cussler no longer acknowledges his previous Pitt stories in a new novel simply because real history caught up with the events of the Golden Age of Pitt. As late as &quot;Cyclops&quot; it was still not uncommon to see a reference to Pitt having raised the Titanic, or to the aftereffects of the North Atlantic Treaty of &quot;Night Probe.&quot; Today, we're lucky if we see one oblique reference to the last Pitt novel and only when Cussler describes the train in Pitt's collection of cars is there a faint echo of &quot;Night Probe.&quot; (Yet oddly enough Cussler still refers to Pitt and Giordino as having served in Vietnam, yet he doesn't seem to realize that would have to make them in their mid to late 50s at least by this point!) The end result is that Pitt has become much too formulaic for my tastes. The Cussler style of describing interesting locales and making the storyline interesting is still there, but I fear the Golden Age of Pitt has passed us by now (and Clive, will you please stop with those annoying cameos of yours! Enough!)"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I was intrigued by this book because of its title, rather than the author. I had never read any of Clive Cussler's books before and found this one to be very intriguing and well written. I read it in one day and enjoyed it. It was a long book but it kept you into it by not being repetitive and boring. I appreciate that even though it was much like James Bond, it did not have sex scenes and trashy language throughout, in fact I don't recall any language or scenes. Well done."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Mr Cussler is starting to believe his own hype and has moved away from fast moving stories into self indulgence with tired and predictable characters.By the end of this, I am afraid I was with the bad guys and was hoping for Pitt's early death.Avoid."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is my first Cussler novel and although the dialogue was a bit flat and stilted the fast paced action kept me turning the pages. I must admit I am hooked on Dirk Pitt and plan to read his other Bond-like adventures."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I love Cussler's books, and was ecstatic to see an unabridged tape. I have to say, however, that this was the first tape (of dozens) I have listened to where the reader was so awful I could hardly stand to listen. Mr. Cussler, PLEASE find someone else. Listen to how this guy massacred your story. Did you have a computer scan it and sound out the words? It sure sounded like it. I have come to enjoy tapes more than books, but not in this case. BE WARNED, this particular tape is not worth the money. Read the book instead."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Clive Cussler does a masterful job of writing outrageous stories that sound real. I have read nearly all of his Dirk Pitt novels, and I have enjoyed each of them. This one sounded like it might be a stretch (finding Atlantis), but it had a story just as ingenious as many of his other books. Yet again he weaves a story that has just enough in it to render it possible. His only real weakness is for his main character--Dirk Pitt. Those of us who have stuck with the hero through all of his other adventures feel like we know him, but I can't say I've ever heard of someone who can stand up &quot;without moving a muscle.&quot; So our hero is still pretty unbelievably good, but if that's what it takes for an incredible read, I'm game."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I'm a big fan of Cussler, ever since I picked up one of his early books many years ago. Unfortunately, the last couple of books have ended up with James Bond syndrome: A large group of bloodthirsty sociopaths all working cheerfully together to destroy (the world, a country, whatever).The problem is that this yields very shallow characters, and limits the believability. During one passage which has the heroes riding a train around inside a ship, it takes on a Disney-esque quality - you can almost picture The Goons singing &quot;whistle while you work&quot; as they machinegun Dirk Pitt and his companions.Cussler has a talent for bringing historical events into a very personal perspective - and then tying those elements into a wild story. Hopefully he will pull back from the cookie-cutter mode that he seems to have slipped into."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Any fan of Cussler and his Dirk Pitt Character will once again find themselves caught up in the adventure and intrigue of the characters. You will wonder, again and again, how they will save themselves and their charges; and be amazed at the ingenious efforts. Superman Pitt comes through with flying colors with the help of Rudy, Hiram, Giordino, and Admiral Sandecker not to mention a few other newcomers. The ending will be a BIG surprise! Am looking forward to the next book."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Dirk is back, in his usual indomitable way. Everything that you've come to expect from Cussler is there, in spades. Who else can take such a grandiose plot and make you not only enjoy it, but believe it? As usual the villians are as enjoyable as the good guys, and there's plenty of them. Cussler speeds you along on a non-stop roller coaster ride of excitement and intrigue, culminating in no holds barred battle royale at the finish."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"While the plot of &quot;Atlantis Found&quot; while farfetched, it's what I come to expect when I do a marathon escape into the imangination of Clive Cullser. Ancient civilizations, modern supervillians, cataclysmic destruction and history bending climaxes are basic foundations of the world of Dirk Pitt. Sadly, though, I have grown extremely tired of the stilted dialogue and charecters. Cussler's descriptions of Pitt's determination and spirit don't need over-embelishment EVERY TIME he does something heroic. Between security guards shaking their fists at Pitt, Special Forces soldiers calling big trucks &quot;macabre,&quot; and listening to the bad guys describe in how they &quot;contemplated and trained&quot; for a battle makes me begin to wonder if Mr. Cussler needs a new thesaurus on his computer. It's a great story, cool concept and would make a fantastic mini-series. I just had a hard time reading the book without laughing out loud at the language and actions more in line with a 1930's science fiction movie serial."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"By far the best of his books - with an interesting twist for the major characters that I hadn't expected. I'll read it again and again."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Love Cusslers books they are a great escape from every day job stress. the only problem is the story ends too soon and you have to wait too long for his next adventure"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Clive Cusslers latest Dirk Pitt adventure is a definite hit..The story unfolds at an astonishing rate and grabs the reader from the start. The evolution of the plot holds you from the beginning and goes to places you wouldnt even imagine.If you are an avid Dirk Pitt fan read this book.. If you are looking for a book that will take you in and give you a thrill ride.. read this book. The development of the characters and the story line are great. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good time and a break away from the doldrums of reality."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Where to start with this lamentable effort. Well, don't buy it would be a good place. It's dreadful and I'm going to give away quite a bit of the plot in this opinion to show you just how stupid it is. If you don't want it spoilt for you, then stop now, but I did warn you.Cussler has sunk to a real low by writing this book, and his biggest mistake as far as I can see is attempting to leave the confines of the narrow world he usually inhabits, to write about things in the real world, which he knows nothing about. If you've never read anything by Cussler, buy one of his early novels, as they are much better. They all revolve around a fellow called Dirk Pitt, an underwater secret agent, who makes Superman seem a bit like Mickey Mouse - get the picture.The plot has more holes in it than a very holey thing (Metaphors fail me). The story goes something like this - Some bloke discovers an extraordinary artefact 9100 years old. Lots of people try to kill him and all he tells of his find, but Dirk Pitt pops up and saves them all. These artefacts have been left by the Atlanteans to warn of impending doom, but things are not so simple. Oh no, Mr Cussler has a race of super nazis living under the South Pole and plotting to take over the world. Ludicrously, he would have the poor dumb reader believe that although 275,000 people are involved in the plot, none of the world's intelligence agencies have been able to penetrate the organisation during its 50 years of existence. Puhleease Clive, the National Enquirer would seem to be more your speed. Fortunately for us, Pitt uncovers the plot, convinces the entire US version of the MOD of it's genuineness in about 20 minutes, then saves our bacon pretty much single handedly.On the back of the book, some wag has penned \\"From the Grand Master of adventure fiction comes heart-pounding action and intrigue - And the answer to one of the great mysteries in human history\\". What a laugh. The \\"Answer\\" is that Atlantis was destroyed 9,000 years ago by, get this, a comet greater than the one that wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. Sheesh, and nobody realised until now.Pitt sees more combat in this book than you average Vietnam Vet, receiving in separate incidents, err, well, cuts to his hands, feet and head actually. Two of his unarmed mates successfully take on a helicopter gunship and six heavily armed mercenaries, who we are led to believe are all ex SAS or similar. This is just stupid and I was getting very bored by that point. However, this was one of my holiday books, bought for easy reading by the pool, so it had be finished, but at 7 pounds I wished I'd bought a bottle of Raki (Greek alcohol) and half poisoned myself instead.Cussler likes to show off his technical diving knowledge, and as he has led a number of successful exploration expeditions you'd expect this to be done well. Unfortunately, the opposite is true. I suspect he is just so patronising that he assumes the reader won't realise when BS is being waved under their nose. He has Pitt diving in mine shafts using totally ludicrous equipment just to make it sound exciting. I can genuinely say anyone who dived using the gear he suggests would be laughed at if they left the confines of a swimming pool (A solo dive in an overhead environment, using a single regulator on a twinset, for anyone that understands). In the technical diving world he would firmly be described as a \\"Stroke\\" (Origin unknown, either about to look like a stroke victim due to bad diving practice, or a total W**ker are the favourite guesses)Name dropping and gross egotism are a couple of other of Cussler's little faults. He has himself making two cameo appearances to aid Pitt's bid to save the world. How arrogant can he possibly get I ask myself? Well, we all know he actually fantasises that he's Pitt, so I suppose there's room for him to get worse yet. He also drops in the names of expensive wines, at 60 ukpounds a throw, just to rub the readers nose in the fact that he's loaded and we aren't. Martin Ray Cabernet Sauvignon - \\"An excellent choice Sir, not many of our Patrons know it exists\\" says the waiter. Ho ho, Clive did though, didn't he, and just had to share his expertise. Well if its anything like his diving expertise it'll probably taste like urine, 60 pounds or not. He then goes on to denigrate Gallo, the stuff most of us in the UK would consider a decent wine at 3 to 4 pounds a bottle. Snob.So what else was good about the book. His characters are all nearly identical, apart from the token women who wet their knickers every time Dirk enters the room. Wooden, soulless, boring, with stunted dialogue and not a swear word amongst them. It's almost impossible to tell the difference between the Nazis and the Americans as they behave pretty much in the same fashion. They all lead a bourgeois existence that died with F Scott Fitzgerald, but at least he had the wit and feeling to mock the world he inhabited.Cussler's literary skills are very limited too. Quote - \\"A long lost race who discovered the world\\" said Giordino, philosophically - On that evidence Cussler wouldn't know philosophy if it swallowed him whole. This sums up his absence of talent and lack of ability to convey emotion or thought for me, and I won't be reading another of his books unless I wind up in jail with no other option. This dreadful offering is Mills and Boon (Trashy Romantic Ladies novels in the UK) for the boys, at its worst."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"What I liked: 1. Cussler, as usual puts together a fast-paced adventure novel (action, some suspense) 2. I wouldn't mind one of my kids finding it(no &quot;f&quot; words, no gratuitous tacky sex scenes) 3. It's a totally unbelievable plot, yes--but picture any James Bond film since Dr. No and compare.Didn't like: 1. The villian characters were really predictable and acted like they came off of Scooby Doo (&quot;It was a perfect crime and it would have worked if it wasn't for those meddling NUMA guys&quot;!) The same villian characters didn't act like real people--they talked too much and revealed way too much of their evil plotting to Pitt instead of being protective. 2. Pitt and his friend Al should face the consequences of their bad negotiating tactics.In spite of its faults, it is an enjoyable read that doesn't take all of your attention."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is the first book I've read by Clive Cussler and I doubt I will read another. The writing is amateurish at best, the dialog is poorly written, and many of the situations in the plot are ludicrous. Much of the plot reads like a teenage boy's daydream during a boring algebra class, an issue that is exacerbated by Cussler's tendency to write himself into the story in a variety of ways.The science background that is supplied to support the storyline is full of serious errors and inconsistencies. This I could forgive if the book provided a 'rippling good yarn', but the overall story is pretty lame and highly derivative. By the end I was surprised that the Nazi bad guys weren't also zombies.One of the biggest problems with this book is that it is just PACKED with inconsistencies and ludicrous statements/situations. Examples of this can be found on almost any randomly selected page of the book, but here are a few samples: (1) At one point in the book a group of special forces soldiers find themselves helpless to deal with an armored snowcat that they don't have enough firepower to damage. The author's solution is to have the hero take out the snowcat by throwing a perforated gas can into the snowcat through its open windows! Apparently the special forces people too dense to shoot through the windows of a snowcat, the nazis are too dense to roll up their windows, and the author is too dense to recognize how ludicrous the whole thing is. (2) Shortly after the snowcat episode, these same special forces are exposed to a suspicious light mist that begins to envelope them. The leader of the soldiers takes a big sniff of the mist and announces it is not poisonous; part of his training is to recognize toxic gas. Yes, I am sure that soldiers are routinely exposed to toxic gases so they can recognize them and that their training tells that to take a big snort of any suspicious gas to identify it! (By the way, there are plenty of toxic gases that have no odor whatsoever, so not only is this approach an incredibly dangerous one, but this is also a approach that can't be counted on to work!)All-in-all, I'd have been far happier to have left Atlantis Lost."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I devour books. I usually finish a book within a few days (I finished the 6th Harry Potter in one day and it was a massive book!). I bought this book in an airport bookstore - I had two 3 hour flights ahead of me, and I figured that I could get through at least half by the time my last flight ended. (I had read Sahara earlier this year, and seemed to remember enjoying it, or maybe that was just a shirtless Matthew McConaghey in the movie!).Anyways, this book is utterly inane. The first few chapters are interesting, as Cussler sets up for a quite interesting storyline... but then the whole novel spiralled downhill, and I could not read more than one chapter a day.I agree with everyone who said that the dialogue was utterly ridiculous. It is true that noone talks that way. I also got very irritated by the fact the characters explained everything they did to each other. The characters also have this irritating way of coming up with wise-ass things to say in life-threatening situations (of which there about 20 in this novel). Just shut up and fight for your life!However, the thing that irritated me most was the narrative. I found this to be most child-like, and just simply BAD writing. The last two paragraphs on page 472 (continuing onto page 473) are the MOST ridiculous things I've ever read. One is a full run-on sentence that is about 6 lines and is a whole paragraph! The other actually begins a sentence, \\"Bedlam!\\"Furthermore, there is a whole scene at the end where one of the guards is killed right in front of Hugo Wolf. It came completely out of left field. I had no clue who this \\"sargeant\\" they mentioned was, even when I went back and searched the previous 25 pages for any mention of his name and he was never mentioned again. It was just bizarre. Cussler writes like he has no editor!I honestly didn't know writing could be so trite. Cussler may want to invest in a copy of Stephen Kings \\"On Writing\\" because he certainly could use a few lessons on how to handle dialogue, narrative and characterization.The characters in this book are not sexy or attractive. They are over the top, especially the villains. The Wolfs did not seem evil or crazy to me (and they were often described as crazy)... they just seemed compltely unrealistic.The only reason I didn't put down this book after I hadn't finished it in a week was because I was interested to see what ridiculous, over-the-top, implausible ending Cussler had given us. And he certainly delivered that.I gave this book two stars, because although it sucked enough for one star, I did finish it, which I suppose says something."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is my second Cussler novel. I don't know if I would have read a second one, but I already had this one. In fact, I have yet another waiting on my shelf -- a gift from someone. The first one didn't impress me that much and this one, ATLANTIS FOUND, is just more of the same. On the positive side, there's lots of action. The story never slows down, which is probably all most Cussler fans are looking for. Character and plausibility take a back seat to fast-paced action, and if that's all you want, then ATLANTIS FOUND is great stuff.Beyond the action, however, the characters here ARE wooden. Dirk Pitt, the hero, is always flawless and never experiences a moment of doubt or uncertainty. Someone has described him as a combination of James Bond and Indiana Jones, and he's every bit of that and more. He's the ultimate hero. The nasties are of the cookie-cutter variety. Further, the plot verges on the ridiculous. This is typical of the genre and many are okay with it, but it can get difficult to swallow, even for a reader like me, who is comfortable with fantasy and science fiction. It's my opinion that if a writer sets a story in the real world, then there are limits to how far the bounds of reality can comfortably be stretched. Cussler skirts my limit very closely.The worst thing about this, and the other Cussler novel I've read, is that the writing simply isn't very good. Other reviewers have made the same point. Cussler's metaphors often clanged in my mind. For example, he writes \\"The waning stars in the early-morning sky blazed like a theater marquee when seen from 9,000 feet above sea level.\\" Huh? Not only does it read clumsily, but the idea of comparing stars to a theater marquee must have Shakespeare turning over in his grave. Also, words are often simply misused. Cussler writes \\"The day was typical for the nation's capital, the climate hot and sultry.\\" The \\"day\\" may have been \\"hot and sultry\\", but the term \\"weather\\" would be more appropriate in this statement than \\"climate\\".If lightweight, fast-paced action is all you want, Cussler's books will work fine for you, and ATLANTIS FOUND is no exception to that. This book will NOT put you to sleep. But, if you seek a small degree of plausibility, character development, or simply competent writing, my advice is to look elsewhere. I zipped through this book quickly and was entertained, but was mildly disappointed by the time it was over. Things got further and further over the top as I got nearer to the end. Overall, ATLANTIS FOUND was entertaining enough to rate four stars, but flawed enough to hold back to three."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is my first Clive Cussler read, and it is my last. A suspenseful prologue aside, this book is awash in shallow main characters, silly plot twists, and inane dialogue. Add a doomsday plot so implausible that it would make Ian Flemming blush. The dialogue between Dirk and friends seems to have been copied from some bad cop show, with tasteless, cliched, campy similes by the dozen. I happened to read this book in the audio form, which also had an awful narrator. Save your time and sense of self-worth, and read something by Clancy, Ludlum, or perhaps as one other reviewer suggested, the excellent novels of Patrick Obrien."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I was looking for a good action book. i wanted to read ludlum,clancy etc. but my parents said that they wouldn't let me read anything that was not rated \\"pg\\". i was asking around and someone sugested clive cussler. i called my library and found atlantis found. it was amazing. my parents like it because it is between pg and pg13 and still has tons of action and mystery. this book consists of mystery, action, and most importantly, suspence. read it!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Oh dear oh dear. What do you say about an author whose plots would make a James Bond flick look plausible, whose villians and heroes are straight out of Saturday morning cartoons, whose writing skills are at seventh grade level, whose main character is named Dirk Pitt, and who insists on giving himself a \\"cameo\\" in every book? If somebody had told me this, my immediate response would have been to never go near the books. But, thankfully, I picked up this book without any advanced warning, and, despite myself, was hooked. The thing is, if plot (and fun) is the most important thing to you in a book, then read these. If you are such a literary snob that you refuse to have a little bit of escapist fun now and then, then stay away from these. Hey, more for the rest of us.Atlantis Found is my favorite of his Dirk Pitt novels. The plot reaches new levels of implausibility (evil cloned neo-Nazis attempting to cause global armageddon with ancient inscriptions found in Atlantis) and, oddly enough, the amount of fun one has as they read this seems to increase as well. You're not meant to walk away from this with any sort of insight into the human condition (except, perhaps, that evil cloned neo-Nazis who are trying to destroy the world are, well, evil). You're supposed to walk away happy and invigorated, and maybe go out and rent yourself \\"Moonraker\\" to bring yourself back to reality."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"One comet, ten miles wide and four billion tons in weight caused the end of all life on Earth in the year 7120 B.C. 99% of all species were wiped out.

The first one wasn't even 200 pages (Iceberg), and although I was impressed with Cusslers ability to narate, the storyline didn't impress me. The seccond one was about an archeologist and a mad scientist-like artifact collecter in Peru, and ended up with finding an underground river near the California Peninsula (Inca Gold). The plot didn't impress me there, either. When I bought this one, I (intrestingly) did so not because of an interest in Greek mythology, but because of the Authors reputation. I finally found a story where Pitt is trying to stop a plot to literally concourr the world. I didn't belive the part about the Nazis using captured siberian prisoners during world war 2 to build a base in antartica, but the U-boat did provide an interesting twist. As a student of the German language, I was interested to hear the caracters discuss the name 'fourth empire' and also was interested with the introduction of SEALs...But the end is good in that it shows that not even Pitt--the scuba-diving Indiana Jones,James Bond, or Jack Ryan--can take on the reich without special ops. help...but that's for me to know, and you to read about!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Atlantis Found by Clive Cussler is by far one of the best books I have ever read. I couldn't put it down for three weeks straight. Atlantis Found is action packed from beginning to end. There was so many unexpected events and twists to the story that I am still baffled about what happened. This book keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way through till the last page. Everything about this book is exciting, especially the characters, the plot, and the crazy changes of events. Clive Cussler always seems to deliver in his novels that star Dirk Pitt. Pitt has to be one of the coolest heroes that I have ever encountered in a novel. He is incredible because he is so realistic but unrealistic all at the same time. Pitt's timing is impeccable; he always manages to show up just at the nick of time and save the day. For anyone who is an action junkie I would definitely recommend this book. It is a guaranteed good time thrill ride. So get to the library or the bookstore and pick up a copy today. Also look for Cussler's new novel Valhalla Rising."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"anything having to do with the end of the world prophecies or ancient, lost civilizations is cool....atlantis found was suggested by a teacher who was a huge cussler fan and said &quot;start with this&quot;...i did, and i am GLADthe subplots early on that tie together are a lot of fun, and the Antarctica setting is neat as well...i loved the big action scene at the end beyond belief, and when all was said and done, cussler threw in a monkey wrench...and himself.....the premise is great, obviously Pitt and Giordino are the best real world Batman and Robin ever, and the action is very coolA GREAT BOOK"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Clive Cussler has done it again.

Though far-fetched (fiction, remember) it was an enjoyable book to listen to.My dislike about this book was simple. To long and extremely far-fetched. Mr. Cussler killed to many tress with this one. In addition to taking what seemed like forever to set the plot and the scenes, Mr. Pitt went way out there. Ships larger then aircraft carriers being built in secret locations, snow tractors still working after being buried in the ice for years, not to mention a WWII German U-Boat sailing around and never being seen or reported.Mr. Cussler, I like your books, I especially liked Sea Hunters but I can only give this one 3 stars.

Yeah yeah yeah - the dialog could have used some help, but if you wanted good dialog *why* are you reading a book like this? This is adventure, the unknown, lost secrets uncovered, etc. I really wish the book would have gone a different direction at some points, but I was never left to feel empty. If you want to research Atlantis, this book is not for you. If you want science and technology that exists in the real world, read non-fiction. If you want to be entertained for a few weekends, this is it.For me, this book was an exciting non-stop read. I don't think I've ever been so rushed to get home from work to read a stinking book before, until now. The lady from the local library recommended it to me, and said I was lucky to get it because as soon as it hits the shelves it's gone again.Dirk Pitt is a Bond type, but not as cultured - which is good. The characters are not entirely fleshed out, but it didn't affect the story for me. The plot moves you around the world in a whirlwind manner, searching for clues and help to uncover the mystery. Just read the first chapter and you'll be hooked. Some of the ideas he proposed in the book were burned in my head for a month after reading it.

One should not be a literary snob, when it comes to good adventure novels. They are not meant to elevate you to the next levels in academia and erudition, but to entertain with a good story (and who does not like a good story? I'll bet even the critics secretly enjoy curling up on the couch with a fun adventure book sometimes) and along the way, drop enough tantalizing technological, historical, oceanographical and geological facts to make a demanding reader like myself, notorious for trashing books he does not like, impatient to get to the next page. Sure, read the critically acclaimed books. But once in a while, a smart adventure novel will not hurt. It's like eating a healthy diet, and enjoying that slice of chocolate cake sometimes. What the heck?That said, the novel does not live up to the promise of a great read, because Mr. Cussler bites off more than he can chew in the further development of the events, which are really not believable at all. I find that the scale is just too grand, the escapades just too impossible, the odds just too high, the technology just too perfect. There is a quip about James Bond in the novel, but the irony is that it is even less believable the old Fleming novels.Sorry, cannot give more than 2.5."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Great book have to keep turning the pages until the last page..seller is top notched and had the book in no time"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Rapid fire action, and has the reader unable to put the book down!

Frankly as I heard the cassette, as well-read as it was, my interest began to wane into the second of the four tapes; and I began to wonder why this should be.None of the characters are particularly interesting or even believable. Now for a work of action-adventure fiction, credibility can go by the board. Does anyone really believe that James Bond can do all the things Flemming has him do? But Bond is interesting, he is funny, he is semi-mythical in a way that this hero simply is not.Secondly the plot seems put together of shreds and patches from other works. Being trapped by water in a supposedly sealed room and being rescued at the last instant is strictly Indiana Jones, while the Fourth Empire is nothing but the evil organization that first showed up in &quot;Thunderball,&quot; and the ancient runes in the ruins find their origin in &quot;She.&quot; And so on.The story told on this tape is well-wrought--the author knows what he is about as a craftsman--but it offers nothing at all new to the genre; and what is old is not all that well done. Perhaps reading the book would produce a totally different estimation. But nothing I heard makes me feel the urge to do so."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"The plot was OK enough to keep me reading, although a bit far-fetched at times. But the worst part was the dialogue! Good grief! It was some of the most inane reading I've ever seen!! Instead of using the narrative to describe what has happened, all of the characters describe it to each other. For example, in one portion of the book, two characters are in a plane, one wakes up and asked how long they had been flying. Since at this point we didn't know exactly why they were flying or where they had come from, Cussler has to explain it. But instead of using a narrative to explain it (\\"They left the airbase that morning....\\"), he has the characters explain to each other. One character said to the other \\"It's been four hours since we took off from suchandsuch ship near suchandsuch bay off the coast of Argentina\\". Give me a break! They both took off and knew where they were, did he really need to tell his friend where they took off from when all he wanted to know was how long he'd been asleep?? And this went on throughout the entire book.To make a short story long, Cussler just writes like a Scooby Doo cartoon. He has all the characters explain EVERYTHING that's happening instead of using the narrative to tell the background info. It's the tired classic of the bad guy explaining his evil plot to the good guys right before he kills them.

The only highlight I can find is that it isn't (thank god) tedious.

I call this genre \\"airplane books\\", nothing too heavy, just an interesting plot that keeps my attention during the flight.From the beginning, I was amazed how utterly ridiculous this story was. I realize this is fiction; but I felt like I was reading a \\"comic book\\" staring a very flimsy superhero called Dirk Pitt. The story is populated with Nazi clones and ancient sophisticated civilizations that had traveled all over the globe leaving etchings predicting Armaqgeddon.Although, I was ready to put this book down soon after starting, I gave all those individuals who highly rated this book a chance-I was also on a long flight- and trudged on. It only became more implausible and painful. The incredibly successful and sophisticated Nazis that are introduced half way through the story had \\"secretly\\" built a number of giant ships to serve as \\"arks\\" for a select few thousand to populate the earth after the soon to be created \\"man-made\\" flood inundated the planet-those diabolical devils. Despite the Nazi clones-from Hitler's DNA no less- sophisticated weapons, security, and man-power our boy Dirk and his wise cracking side-kick Giordino save the day.By the way ,what is the deal with naming and describing all the vehicles and apparatus that Dirk uses? Like descibing the Bell-Boeing 609, or the 36' Ford Cabriolet or the U.S Diver's Aquarius air regulator and Mark II face mask. Is this some type of product placement or is it supposed to make the story more plausible. I hope that it is product placement because it only makes the story seem more ridiculous.There are many great fiction writers available in this genre. Save your self the time and money and pass on this book by Clive Cussler. If you want a comic to read pick up something from Marvel."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I am about half way through this book and I just can't finish it. Its not usual I do that but it is just sucking my will to live.The dialogue is a joke. I can't stand the main character. I'm mostly just hoping that between dodging 'killers' and bombs, he gets wacked in the process.It seems every paragraph is just filled with the make and model of every piece of gear he has on. Do I care that he looked down at his x3-500 Supermega watch with intel microprogramming digitalizers? No. And no one else does either.Sorry but I just dont think I can finish it."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Maybe I didn't enjoy this book because I have not read any of Cussler's other works, but I must say that I was severely dissappointed in this book. I finally gave up trying to be interested about half way through, and that is extremely rare for me. Considering the rave reviews I read, I tried hard to let this book win me over, but all I can tell you is I wont be reading any more from this author."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"OK, can someone tell me why the average rating of this book is 4 stars! @$ I have been totally misled. It's so childishly predicatble, like a bad Hollywood action movie. Alright, the story line could be a PASS. But, my goodness, a flat lacking of narritive skills. It's my first time reading Clive Cussler and LAST. It's for kids age 8-10 only."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot. I love the Dirk and Al characters and am looking forward to reading the next Cussler book."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"After looking for a new book to download on my Kindle Fire, I remembered my husband telling me how much he liked reading the \\"Dirk Pitt\\" series. After only a page or so I was hooked! I am now on my second book and loving it!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Clive Cussler delivers a rollocking ride in this Dirk Pitt tale. Also, there is an epiphany for Al and Dirk- time to pass the mantle to other heroes.

Cussler engineered another captivating can't lay down novel."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"In typical form Clive Cussler takes the reader on a gut wrenching roller coaster of adventure, and suspense. Really enjoyable, even if it's a little hard to suspend your disbelief."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Have read a lot of Cussler's books and enjoyed them all, but this one kept you on the edge of your chair all the way.

One of my favorite authors. I recommend this book for anyone who loves mind twists."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Cussler does it again! The intricate story seems alarmingly real and gives the reader a history lesson without even knowing it. KEEP THEM COMING MR CUSSLER."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I love Clive Cussler. His style of writing makes reading the fast paced adventures fun and exillerating. Atlantis Found is one of his best."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I was actually shocked at how well this book was when I first got it, like a previous reviewer said, alot of twists and turns. And the fact that the third Reich, had made it into this century. And is waiting to take over the world, by bringing an ancient prediction to fruition. Was very plausible, we now know, that after WWII, many of the Nazi's were in fact recruited by our Govt to work for us, and many of them dissappeared. Or becoming powerful business people, as shown here in this book. And Cussler brings that vividley to life, particularly with 4 noah's ark type ships. And then the fight for all mankind, up on the north pole. With Pitt and Giordino crashing the party in the original snow cruiser, stopping the count down. They find ruins linked to a possible Atlantis, which is the race of people who predicted the end of the world in the begining of the book. I couldn't put this book down, an excellent read. No it's not poorly written, it's another high octane Dirk Pitt adventure."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"dirk rules! i don't care if my hubby gives me a hard time about loving dirk pitt--and this new story is great. i didn't think i would find another pitt novel as exciting as my favorite (inca gold), but this one was it. i think you have to suspend reality and just sit back and enjoy the ride that dirk, numa and the gang take--this isn't rocket science, its a novel. mr cussler, if you read these reviews, your books are wonderful and i hope you are working on a new pitt novel!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Clive Cussler does a great job in this book. All my freinds love it too. Clive Cussler really keeps the reader focused in the high action parts of the book!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"As an avid Cussler fan, I eagerly awaited the next Cussler adventure. When it arrived under the tree Christmas morning, I quickly lost myself in the story. Typical of Cussler, the book was full of adventure and believable historical fiction. Only Clive could pull together a pre-historical civilization and the Fourth Reich into one plausible adventure.The Only problem was Atlantis did not seem as tight as previous offerings. Small inconsistencies kept me looking back, rather than simply moving forward in the plot. For example, in the early mine rescue, Dirk is wearing a drysuit. When he returns to the mine later, Cussler states Dirk is wearing a drysuit instead of the wetsuit he had on earlier. I felt like this book received no serious proof-reading.Small quirks aside, any Cussler fan will enjoy this book. And for all of Al's fans out there, he finally gets the woman! I look forward to the next Pitt novel, and hope for another Autin adventure."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Forget the negative reviews on this page...this story was absolutely captivating! If you like adventure, getting lost in the past and the future then this is the book for you. I have never read any of authors previous works but I will definitely hunt them down now. People who left reviews and said the story was just too way out there to make it believeable...WAKE UP! A story is supposed to be just that. This book made me want to be there in the story. It took past history and embellished to make it all the more interesting. I highly recommend this book for all the adventurists out there who want to go on the roller coaster ride this book takes you on!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I am an avid reader of Clive Cussler ever since I sumbled upon Raise the Titanic while doing reasearch on the Titanic. Ever since then I have read all of his book and I am always excited when A new one comes out. They all keep getting better and better. Once I start reading one of his books I can't stop till i reach the end. His latest book is no exception to this. He mixed facts with theory and it really makes you think. I really don't know how to prise this book without runing it for anyojne else. Anyone who likes James Bond will love this book. I have to say it passes up Bond on my list and I can't wait till his next book."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels are always fun. The rapport between Pitt and Al Giordano is magic. And when they're front and center, this novel crackles. A Fourth Reich is being planned. The earth will be destroyed. The action is set in the South Pole. All the ingredients for a wonderful novel. Most of Mr. Cussler's novel is exciting. Unfortunately, he brings in a slew of Special Forces guys near the end of the book. They interrupted the flow. I skipped over these characters and raced to the pages with Dirk and Al, or Admiral Sandecker, their stalwart, harried boss. Tom Clancy often brings in new characters in the fighting scenes; perhaps that style works for him, but Mr. Cussler lost me at that point. ATLANTIS FOUND is good, but if you want wonderful Cussler, read SAHARA and INCA GOLD."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I've been a Clive Cussler fan for as long as he has been writing. I have each of his books in both hardback and paperback and reread each of them at least once per year.The latest book was a bit of a disappointment. It starts out well but then fades. It's almost as if Clive didn't write it. I was anxiously awaiting this book and read it in two sittings. However, it's not going to be a favorite of mine. It may get reread on occasion.There's not enough of Dirk and Al working together for me. They're often separate which means their witty reparte is missing. All of the main characters are in it, but it seems to not fire on all cylinders. The last two Dirk novels have not entertained me nearly as much as his earlier works. It's hard to put my finger on it but it's just not as riveting as others. A lack of the sense of urgency and danger is part of it.Better luck next time Mr. Cussler. I'll continue to read your books as long as you continue to write them."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"It isn't great literature, but it's a lot of fun! I'm a big Cussler fan and enjoyed this very much. Not his best, but Dirk &amp; Al still manage to save the world and have a blast doing so."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Cussler just can't be reviewed like most writers. He's a storyteller who has created some outrageous characters, a hero who shrugs off pain, friends that are undyingly loyal, and villains of pure evil. This adventure is typically outlandish and incredible. It is also fantastic fun! Cussler and Dirk and Al and the Admiral are old friends and I'm always thrilled by the ride they take me on. No pretense, no sophisticated act, just an amazingly good time. It's easy to make fun of these stories and criticize the writing, but I can't help myself - I love it!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"After forcing myself to finish this book I was intrigued to see what others had made of it. How can it be that 5 star reviews are the majority? Good grief I need to help rectify this. I can only assume anyone who gave it 5 stars has never read any well-written books, or is employed by the publishing house.Firstly, the dialogue is AWFUL. Amateurish, inane, corny and totally insulting to the intelligence. Example: Character 1 to Character 2, in plane: \\"So - it must be about 45 minutes since we took off from so-and-so airfield, just outside of Santa Cruz\\" - who would say that?Characters: Ridiculous and cliche'd. A super race of blonde, blue-eyed Nazis plotting to take over the earth? Please. And Clive do you really think it funny or acceptable for a smirking Dirk Pitt to flush Adolf Hitler's ashes down the toilet in the White House, rather than handing them over to the president waiting in the next room? Jeez.Plot holes: if even I can spot the gaping inconsistencies in the plot, god knows what others have found. So hundreds of thousands of people are in on this world domination plot are they Clive - without ANY intelligence agency having a clue? So the Nazi's have an insider working at NUMA do they Clive? You seem to have forgotten about that because the person was never identified or even mentioned again! There are so many others but it would take up too much space.Clive Cussler writing himself into the story is just painful.And given all the unnecessary and annoying mentions of specific brands and models of equipment, I cannot believe there is not some kind of product placement deal going on here as well. Way to insult and alienate your fans Clive!Readers: try Alistair Maclean or Lee Child, both of whom can do this sort of thing properly. This was my first Cussler book (thank god it was only borrowed and not bought) - it will almost certainly be my last."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This was my first foray into the Clive Cussler series and at first the book was kind of interesting. I do like the occasional Atlantis/ Da Vinci Code kind of books but I was very disappointed towards the end. For anyone not wanting any Spoilers please DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW!!!!!So the thing that ticked me off the most about the second half of the book was that its written as if the readers are kindergartners who will not see the gigantic holes in the story. Here are the things that ticked me off the most -1- The Clive Cussler comes to the rescue part. Apparently this is a theme in all his books but I found it too self indulgent.2 - So they decipher the writings on the walls of the caves that state that the comet is coming back to hit earth. They also seem to believe the Wolfs 'experts' who predict the same. Why oh why then does it take the gream NUMA days and days to verify said fact from an expert? For a few chapters there they all seem to take it like the word of god! Its only when their expert ....Mr Friend tells them that there is no chance of any asteroid / comet hitting earth in the near future that they begin to consider other possibilites!!!!!3 - There is also no explaination given for why the great Amenes thought the comet was coming back to hit earth. They just left that hanging.4- Dirk Pitt and Al in the Snow Criuser.....why the heck didnt he bring a GPS? You are in freakin Antarctica...why would you not have a GPS handy?5- The great Dirk Pitt has no qualms about getting onto a supposed NUMA plane that has apparently just been painted.....and the the pilots refuse to open the cockpit door????? Are you kidding me ? He is supposedly travelling with some very precious cargo and it doesn't occur to him to call up NUMA and see why there was a sudden change in plans? That whole part about the 'hijacked' plane and the arrest was such a waste of time. It was soo not needed in the storyline.I am giving this book 2 stars only because the first half was kind of entertaining. The second half sucked big time however!!!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"THE LOWDOWN: Dirk Pitt, the invincible hero of numerous other adventure novels, returns to do battle with an evil legacy left behind by the Nazis. With plenty of action and a family of diabolical siblings to deal with, the stage is set for Pitt's greatest adventure, yet this book falls a little flat at the end of the day. Not the best, not the worst.THE PLOT: Dirk Pitt narrowly saves a group of archaeologists from a flooding Colorado mine, then from subsequent attempts on their lives by unidentified assassins. Along with archaeologist Patricia O'Connor, Dirk and Al find themselves on the trail of a wealthy family in Argentina descended from the Nazis, the Wolfs, who are planning to activate a \\"polar shift\\"(the same cataclysm that destroyed the prehistoric Atlantean society). Eliminating all artifacts from Atlantis to keep the polar shift plot a secret, Dirk and Al find themselves on the brink of stopping a plot to exterminate the Earth as well as find the world's most infamous lost city.THE PROS: Like Flood Tide, this book is probably one of the longest, with a large-scale world-threatening plot and a bevy of hard-hitting action scenes. One of my favorite scenes involves a vehicle known as the Moller Skycar, which is used to ditch the pursuing Wolfs' battle helicopters. Other action scenes include a U-Boat attack in the Antarctic, Al's use of three machine guns in tandem to take down an enemy helicopter, a wild airplane ride through the streets of Washington DC, a boat chase through the Wolf's harbor, numerous assassination attempts, and an enduring journey across the Ross Ice shelf in a snow vehicle. On a side note, it is refreshing to see Al get the girl for once instead of Dirk.THE CONS: As cool as this story was, it somehow felt a little more hollow than the previous entries, which were admittedly Cussler's best. The Wolfs were a surprisingly boring bunch, considering they were the progeny of the Third Reich. The plot seems a bit disjointed, as if the elements of the story were chosen first (Atlantis, Polar Shift, Neo-Nazis, the Holy Lance, Obsidian Skulls) then had a story crafted to bind the elements together, even if they don't quite fit. For much of the novel we are led to believe that the threat centers on a meteorite, which is such ominous-yet-realistic idea that the villains' \\"real\\" plot seems a bit lame in comparison (if not completely impossible). The idea of Atlantis being a pre-historic civilization that was destroyed in a polar shift stretches both science and history to the very limits of believability."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Once more, I'm left puzzled - why is Clive Cussler a best-selling author? This book has an interesting and inventive plot that weaves together ancient civilizations, modern civilizations, conspiracy theories, Nazis, cataclysms, astronomy, astrophysics, geology, geophysics, geography, linguistics, old technology, new technology, superheroes, superheroines, special operations forces, luxury lifestyles, unbelievability, and staggering inattention to detail - all hallmarks of a Cussler/Pitt product. Unfortunately, that product is just plain dumb. Why does an electric golf cart have an ignition switch? Why does Dirk refer to the Chief of Naval Operations as the \\"naval chief of staff\\" (Clive, I expect better of you)? Then there are the silly mistakes of the good guys that require the usual unrealistic heroics to recover from, the inexplicable actions of the bad guys that let the good guys triumph, and the constant drumbeat of brand names. Where does Cussler make his money - book sales, or product placements? However, even with all that, there are probably worse ways to while away a bit of time. The plot kept me wondering what was going to happen next, and how all the drama and danger would be resolved. If this is one of Clive's best novels, as so many people here believe, I can't even imagine what his worst one might be like."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Uggg.I'll keep this short - Cussler writes as if his primary goal is not to write a book so much as it's to write a movie script. Cussler has great ideas, does a bit of research to add a bit of \\"meat\\" to his plot, but almost all of his books need even more research, an editor's touch, and much less testosterone to make anything plausible.Cussler's books are fine if that's what you like, and it's OK if that's what you're looking for - just be warned that this and most of his books are just an excuse for another screenplay."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Im a new fan of Cusslers. Ive read a few of his books now in a row and this has to be the best. There were some long chapters but overall it kept my interest up until the end."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is the first Cussler book I read, and I was entertained. I almost want to give it a 5 star, but it was just a bit lacking to put it up there. Dont get me wrong, a good book and fun to read. I enjoy the twisting of fact, science and technology, with popular myths, such as Atlantis. The characters are wonderful and easy to picture, and the action is pretty good. If there were a strong plot twist, this would be a 5 star, but it was a little straight forward, especially for a controvisial subject."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Another great Atlantean book I read, which happened to be Dirk Pitt's adventure. As one of my favorite fiction writer of all time, Cussler, managed to put up some muscle into this novel. More like the latter-day version of Indy. Nanotechnology, U-boats, Hitler, Atlantis, Antarctica, Al Giordino, Delta Force, The Third Reich... you name it. It's all in here.Atlantis is the final main battleground for these folks, where these heroes as usual, Pitt and his henchman, Giordion, saved the day again, thwarting their nemesis plan of doomsday prematurely. Though situated in Atlantis, it is only briefly depicted. Thus, this is not a \\"real\\" Atlantis novel.Though the eventual survival of all Cussler's main characters are preditable, I still enjoy being \\"duped\\" by this master story teller. This is fictional stuff, anyway.If you like reading fictions by Clive Cussler and James Rollins, then try reading this novel. A great book, a 5 star novel from a five star writer.Other recommended great Atlantis fictions:1. Raising Atlantis by Thomas Greanias2. Decipher by Stel PavlouConcerning Atlantis, best and most \\"non-fictionally written\\" is by Stel Pavlou: Decipher."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Cussler again delivers a weird, over-the-top, action-adventure novel featuring the perpetually hunky Dirk Pitt. This time, a shady group of people are killing archaeologists who find out about the existence of an advanced ancient civilization. Throw in death comets, neo-Nazis, cloning, and impossible shipbuilding for good measure. A fun read if taken with a pinch of salt."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Atlantis Found is thoroughly enjoyable and completely ridiculous! At the final show down I laughed myself silly for a good five minutes (which my husband can attest to). There are Nazis, a lost civilization, missing relics, and a pending world destruction that will either be from the heavens or man made."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I liked this a lot. This was my first Cussler and I love the fact that he is a real explorer. Enjoyable."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Cussler's story about a new generation of Nazis based in Argentina is largely built upon Graham Hancock's book Fingerprints of the Gods (a lost maritime civilization, earth-crust displacement, ancient maps, etc.). Cussler tries to create an action/suspense novel using this as a backdrop, and even if his writing weren't so poor - AWFUL dialog, weak characters, unrealistic action sequences - it would still have been challenging to weave a credible storyline out of these elements. Thus, it is hardly surprising that the author fails so miserably in his attempt to do so. At times he came across as an extremely lowbudget version of Tom Clancy, without the depth of knowledge and feel for dialog that Mr. Clancy has, thereby making a bad situation even worse. Atlantis Found is by far one of the worst books I have ever read, and I would highly recommend NOT buying it, and picking up Fingerprints of the Gods instead (and a couple of Elmore Leonard books as well!)."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"All around it was a good book, but to be honest I skipped the ending and decided to put it down. It started out real good but towards the end I just gave up. Dirk Pitt seems to be a superman Indiana Jones. I understand he is supposed to be in league with NUMA, which deals with oceanography. When I moved from NC to OK, I missed the ocean so much that I flirted with the idea of giving up anthropology for Oceanography. From what I learned about Oceanography is that often not much worth any excitment happens. The Dirk Pitt novels seem a little far-fetched for me. Plus, they have Pitt to be out to be this super human character which I don't like at all. They also have his girlfriend out to be this similar super human, in fact, most of the characters all have the same persona. Of course Dirk, being the hero, is far more superior than the rest. As far as the archeology emphasis on the theories of Atlanitis I could say that is believable. However, adding the whole Hilter theme just caused me to loose interest. I understand there are rumors of Hilter resorting to genetics at the time of his reign and that adds an interesting twist, despite the fact that it all still revolves around the Nazi aspect of things. After finding out the plan, knowing Pitts character I decided to stop reading it knowing that Dirk of course would save the day. A reader needs a surprise ending, something to capture our interests, and let us looking forward to the next of a writer's books. With this book of course it would end with Dirk saving the day"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"It's unfathomable to me how after writing this book Clive Cussler expects anyone to continue buying his books. I used to be a Dirk Pitt fan, but Cussler clearly couldn't care less about his fans any longer, either that or he has a very low opinion of their intelligence. A few of his earlier Dirk Pitt novels were amusing reads but this one just plain stinks. The writing is terrible, the characters are beyond shallow, the plot is full of holes and the dialogue is worse than an old Gilligan's Island rerun. To say I was disappointed is a huge understatement. Clive's lost me as a customer... Try Patrick O'Brian's novels about the sea instead."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"You would be hard-pressed to find a bigger Cussler fan than me, and I've been there since I first picked up 'Raise The Titanic' in the late 70's and since then Dirk has become somewhat of a personal friend to me (or so I would like to think) and I have really got to know him well over the years--and the same goes for Al, Rudy and Admiral Sandecker...I ALWAYS look forward to something written by Cussler, whether it be his new series with Kurt Austin (which I feel are actually pretty good books so far) or his non-fiction stories behind Dirk or Clive's own heroic adventures, if it has Clive Cussler on the cover, I am GOING to BUY it.Cussler simply does not write a bad story. Some are better and more thrilling than others, but 'Atlantis Found' is easily one of the better Dirk Pitt adventures. I find it funny how people attack Clive's research into his novels, as if they could believe certain parts of his stories, but other parts were just impossible to fathom...it reminds me of a friend of mine who complained about certain portions of Star Wars saying, 'That could never happen!' As if the rest was entirely 100% accurate! C'mon! Clive is THE KING of ALL Action in print, and 'Atlantis Found' is a perfect example of exactly why. This is a complex story that spans 10 Millennia--LITERALLY. Could it be that the lost continent of Atlantis actually existed? What does the Nazi's have to do with Antarctica? Is it possible that a comet will actually decimate the earth as predicted by an ancient civilization more advanced than any in modern history...? All of these questions are raised in 'Atlantis Found' and all are answered with an amazing dose of thrilling edge-of-your-seat adventure piled on top of conspiracy on top of more action. Simply put, if you read Cussler for sheer thrill, pace and excitement, you know just why us die-hard readers lap up his books like an addictive drug, we crave something FUN and Clive serves it up hot and fresh each and every time. I have NEVER been disappointed in one of his novels yet, mostly because I don't look for something that isn't there. I KNOW what to expect when I begin one of these novels, and that is exactly what I get. It's like seeing a James Bond movie--you KNOW pretty much what to expect--and THAT is the reason why you keep coming back for more. I have said it before, and I'll say it again: 'Long Live Clive'. 'Atlantis Found' is by NO MEANS a literary masterpiece, but it IS a fun ride. Climb aboard and enjoy the cruise."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I've read every book of Cussler's and have enjoyed them immensely! They are farfetched and Al and Dirk have just too many lives (more than cats!), but the stories are always entertaining.What I can't abide is the number of typos that are showing up with increasing frequency in all the books I read! Granted, only two that I found showed up in Atlantis Found, but with the price of books these days, you would expect a better job of editing and proofreading.There is nothing worse than being &quot;in&quot; a story, and getting thrown out by typos! What's happening to the editors and proofreaders at the publishing houses? Trying to cut back on costs?The two in this book contained the word &quot;form&quot; instead of &quot;from&quot; and passengers possessive without the apostrophe. I know, I know, what's the big deal? But as a proofreader, I make my money ensuring quality and can't stand when things aren't &quot;perfect.&quot;"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have found the last two Cussler &quot;Dirk Pitt&quot; novels lacking in their usual excitement and knowledegable entertainment. There seems to be more violence and sexual innuendos than precious books. I feel as if Cussler gave his characters to someone else to write with. Having read every Pitt novel its easy to sense the subtle changes in his tales. The best novels are &quot;Sahara&quot; and &quot;Raise the Titanic&quot;."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I've been ordering these books for my son, who is in a correctional institution - he really enjoys Dirk Pitt, and I've ordered them in the order they were written by Clive Cussler. Great reading for him."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I think for me, one of the allures of the Dirk Pitt series is the nomadic nature of the characters. We start in this book in Colorado and end up someplace quite cold. In between we visit a board room or two and an airplane hangar except there are no planes here. There is a core group that does um research for NUMA. Inevitably Dirk is right in the middle of whatever is going down. Sharp, experience-honed instincts has kept him alive on countless occasions. The group may split up and have two story lines followed until they collide again. The mystery is intriguing and trying to figure it out is half the fun. There is no graphic sex for the sake of it...although Dirk is one lucky son-of-a-gun. The various locales make this another great read from Cussler. One of the most anxious moments is a boat race including small and not-so-small arms fire. Dirk distracts you with one scene only to bring in an element long forgotten from another scene that saves the day...I hope that didn't ruin the ending, but let's face it, if you've looked around, DDD(Dirk Doesn't Die)."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!

It's got a bit of everything: Comet strikes, armageddon, nazis, ancient civilizations, cool doodads, etc. etc.What I can't stand is bad writing. The book would go from Holding my interest and being a genuine page-turner to making me gag at the appalling grammar and writing style that I had to put it down for a few days.I won't be reading any more Cussler books, but I enjoyed this fluff anyway.

I am not ashamed to let people know that I was reading Thomas Pynchon and Cormac McCarthy before anyone else knew about them, or more recently, Craig Holden and Mo Hayder. But fair is fair. There are authors who get by me all the time, and when I find one that I wish I had started reading 10 years ago or more, it's time to 'fess up. So gather round, children, here comes my confession.Clive Cussler has been at it for quite a while, now. I was peripherally aware of his books, such a CYCLOPS and INCA GOLD, but had never read one. I have no excuse. I just never got as far as picking one up and cracking the binding. Well, I celebrated the new year by reading his latest, ATLANTIS FOUND and now I've got some catching up to do --- like about 14 books worth.ATLANTIS FOUND begins in 7120 BC, when a comet smacks into our planet with aftereffects that we are still feeling. This, by the way, is where you're going to get hooked on Clive Cussler, if you are not already. He only dwells on ancient history for a little over six pages, but after reading his description of the comet and its aftermath, you will be lying awake at night listening for the cosmic whistle of one of these bad boys as it approaches...and wondering if we haven't been told about it so that we will all go quietly, instead of in a state of mass panic.Cussler, after scaring your dinner out of you with that description, jumps forward to 1858, where an icebound ship is discovered with mysterious artifacts of an ancient, heretofore unknown civilization on board. However, the ship and its cargo are soon lost again to the Antarctic elements.Cussler then brings us to the very near future --- 2001 --- when a cavern full of strange inscriptions is discovered in a Colorado mine. As a team of anthropologists examines the inscriptions, an explosion seals them deep beneath the earth.It is then, rising like a deus ex machina from the dust, that Dirk Pitt arrives. Part James Bond, part Tom Swift and part Clive Cussler, Pitt is the notable --- and possibly the only --- exception to the rule that one of the three biggest lies in the world is &quot;I'm from the government and I'm here to help you.&quot; Pitt is an &quot;employee&quot; of NUMA --- the National Underwater and Marine Agency --- though at times he appears to function more as a free agent. Only the most blockheaded, shortsighted bureaucrat would ever try to reign him in, for Pitt is the quintessential soldier, friend, lover, scientist, explorer and adventurer rolled into one, with the advantage of being smarter and faster than anyone else.Pitt finds himself on a research ship being attacked by a Nazi U-boat that has not been seen in 56 years, attempts a daring rescue off of the coast of Argentina, and is part of a two-man attack upon a facility that is attempting to launch a cataclysm the likes of which have not been seen in almost 9000 years. And all of it is linked to that comet. But Pitt does not have long to dwell on such matters. He has only ten minutes to save the world.Is Pitt lucky? Sure. Is he too good to be true? Maybe. But who cares? Cussler is extremely sure-footed, keeping just the right balance of class, romance and action to keep his readers enthralled. Whoever said that picture is worth a thousand words has never read Cussler. ATLANTIS FOUND makes any special-effects laden film seem stodgy by comparison. Besides, if a film as good and as exciting as this book were made, the viewers would never see the final scene --- they would be down at the local hospital, lying on a gurney, sipping oxygen in a drafty hallway. As far as I'm concerned, I won't have time for any movies. I have a Clive Cussler backlist to catch up on. And if the other Dirk Pitt books are even half as good as ATLANTIS FOUND, it will be time well-spent.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub for Bookreporter.com"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"The second worst book I have ever read. Dialogue is utterly atrocious and the plot just gets more ludicrous as you go.The first few pages seemed promising and having never read a Cussler novel before I was optimistic. After the first few eye rolling sections of dialogue I was starting to worry a bit, but we then progressed to Dirk Pitt's ridiculous stuntman abilities and I abandoned all hope.It reads like an Austin Powers movie plot line with a 80's Schwarzenegger movie dialogue.I like escapism as much as the next person but I just could not get past the awful writing. I had my wife laughing out loud when I would read out a paragraph. If you can read the \\"Hitler's Sperm\\" references without groaning then you might enjoy this action packed mess, otherwise try something else."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Easily the worst the of the seven Pitt novels I have read. I mean, all of the negative reviews pretty much sum up my thoughts. I read books hand over fist but this one took me weeks to plod through. A jumbled mess in dire need of editing. Still, of the many fans I know of these books, this is one of their favourites, so whatever man. This is one of the least likely Pitt adventures, having virutally nothing to do with his career and almost everything to do with being a secret agent / commando. As crappy as a book it makes, it would be an outstanding movie. Cool villans and villanous plot, but in the end, not much comes of it but a gun fight. A little hollywood tweaking here and there and you've have a very fun and forgetable film for all your kids to waste your money on."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This was a major dissapointment to me. I have read every Cussler / Dirk Pitt adventure and relish the release of a new one.For lack of a better word, this book was &quot;tired.&quot; Every book as a lot of the same things and this just seemed like a retread of a retread. I think due to a comment one of the characters makes later in the story that Cussler realizes this himself and may put the series to rest.If this is the best he can do, than I think that's a good idea.If you are a first timer or have only read one or two other books - skip this one. If you are a die hard fan and must read, than do so -I hope you enjoy it more than I did."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Hey, if you don't like thrillers, hit the road. Go read Toni Morrison. Duh. I read for escape and fun and this book fit the bill. I recommend others like it where the author doesn't pretend to be the next coming of Shaksespeare-- Greg Donegan's ATLANTIS is cool-- found it through looking this book up"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"The ultimate guilty pleasure. With 10 clich&eacute;s per page he would have failed my freshman English class. We all know Cussler can't write his way out of a rice paper bag, but who cares? He writes a great story and you just gotta love Dirk Pitt."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"...is just great again! As a longtime reader of Cussler-books, I rank that one among the best. Dirk and Al and the whole NUMA-gang are tough as always, the bad guys (and ladies) are mean and cruel as always and the settings of the story is good choosen as in the previous books."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is my first Clive Cussler book. However, I have read other similar adventure-type books in the past. Even though this book is action-packed, it does not leave me wanting to read other CC books. Dirk Pitt is nothing compared to Jack Ryan , whom Dirk mentions in the book. He is just another James Bond."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I've read several of Clive Cussler's books, and they've all been great! This one is no different. Keep em' comin!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Pick it up and you won't put it down until you're finished. If it's not the best of Clive Cussler, (and I've read them all) it's way up there."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have just finished reading this book--my first Cussler book--and I must say that I enjoyed every minute! I have always been hesitant to read the Dirk Pit series because I figured that they would be filled with profanity and sex, but I am delighted to report that these are clean enough for the most sensitive reader. Thank you Mr. Cussler, plese keep it clean!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have to both agree and disagree with most of the reviews here. If you religiously read all of Cussler's novels, then nothing anybody says will stop you from reading this one, and you'll most likely be satisfied. I have been read all his novels from Raise the Titanic! onward, but in my opinion they have been getting consistently worse over the last decade. Of course you expect a fantastic James-Bondish plot; that's a given when you buy a Cussler novel. But it seems to me his actual writing, the prose itself, has been deteriorating rapidly. After reading Serpent I really hoped all his future works would be collaborations. I don't consider myself an english language expert, but I still wince while reading Cussler's recent books. Everyone talks like Data on Star Trek, with precise elaborate grammar and no contractions! I also had trouble getting past some of the total scientific improbablility in this work; one thing I loved about his earlier books was the though-provoking &quot;hey...that could've happened&quot; historical basis to the plots. One more comment: Let's place a moratorium on books with a hidden Fourth Reich of Nazis as the world domineering bad guys! Man, that plot device is tired out!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Next to &quot;Sahara&quot; this is by far Cussler's best. Riveting, non-stop action once again comes to the forefront where the hero, Dirk Pitt and companions are involved. The historical lessons were fascinating. I was totally glued to this book. The familiar banter between the lovable and admirable characters never ceases to amaze me. This book screamed &quot;MOVIE&quot; to me, as did some of his others. I highly recommend this roller coaster ride of a book!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"A James Bond in a book-keeps you in suspens"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"As usual, I read the book straight through. Just when you think the story is climaxing, it just picks up and tears off again at mach 2! Don't make any plans for the day you decide to read this book."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Atlantis Found is a great action/adventure book. Like all the Dirk Pitt novels there is action, romance, bad odds, unforgettable entrances, and dry wit that make it classic Pitt. I did say classic because I believe that these books are. Sure thay aren't literary giants and your kids probably won't have them on their summer reading lists but no where else can you find a book that is filled with more adventure and fun than in a Dirk Pitt novel. Atlantis Found does not disappoint either. It never gets repetitive or boring and while sometimes the odds get high and the escapes narrower, you never say &quot;hey, that can't happen!&quot; because with Dirk Pitt you know it can. Thank you Mr. Cussler for giving us great adventures that we can go on in the safety of our own home."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"When you pick up a Clive Cussler novel, you already know pretty much how it's going to end. It's almost a foregone conclusion. I went into this book with a small amount of trepidation. I didn't really care for Flood Tide because I felt it went on too long. When I saw the page count on Atlantis Found, I was afraid yet again. But, happily, I was wrong. It turned out to be a very enjoyable book. I finished it after only a few days.The trick to Cussler novels isn't the fact that the heroes save the world at the end. Or that the villains are dastardly. It's the way Cussler takes a small piece from history (or a myth) and weaves it into a credible tale that makes you want to read. I have always read and enjoyed Cussler's work and will continue to do so."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Clive Cussler has once again written a novel based on his successful formula that has worked again and again. With the starting grand entrance of Pitt to the predictable ending of Pitt saving the human race. (Yes, Again.)What makes this book highly interesting is Cussler's theory on the people of 'Atlantis', what happened to them, and the legacy that was left behind. Cussler was able to tie in the crash of a comet, the disappearance of Atlantis, a vehicle built by Adm. Byrd, and the rise of the Fourth Empire (Reich).The ending by Cussler leaves the book open for sequels, with the start of a new NUMA book, (serpent) and the hints given in the book, one wonders if this might be the last of the Pitt novels. Overall, the book is predictable as a James Bond movie. The bad dudes gets what they deserves, hero gets a few scraps and bruises, but saves the world and gets the girl. But the theories and knowledge of the ocean and historical tie-ins are worth the time invested in this book."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This was my first Cussler book. It was recommended by a friend. From what I've read, I have to conclude that Cussler heard a great story and then turned it into a miserable book.1. Dialogue - horrible. Unreadible. Its stiff, it tries to be funny, and it tries to be James Bond type wit. It fails in the worst way.2. Characters - Dirk Pitt, say it aloud: Dirk Pitt. Bad name. It doesnt't work. Also, let's review the character: an ex-marine, works as a diver for a government agency called NUMA, collects classic cars, and dates a beautiful congresswomen who adores him. That can only be a string of Cussler's fantasies fused into one person. Doesn't happen.3. Humour - whoever told Cussler he was funny should be shot.If you read this Cussler I'm sorry I don't think you're a good author. Take heart - you're obviously good at something, because the book seems to be selling well."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"OK let's face it -- no one reads a Cussler book for the highbrow prose. He has GREAT plots. And this one is original for the way it combines two old plotlines (Atlantis and the Nazis) into an original story. It's well-researched, I might add. And personally I'm THRILLED that he ditched the co-author from the last book and wrote this one himself. Something about Cussler's writing grabs you from the first minute -- who wants poetic writing in an action adventure for Pete's sake? From the discovery of the skull in Colorado to the ultimate discovery in Antartica, this book is a thrill a minute. Who cares that Dirk and Al have been blown up more times than any of us can count? We all secretly want to be Dirk Pitt (and I'm a woman saying this!) surviving with aplomb and humor and worst anyone can hurl at us. Well worth your reading time."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"As all my previous Cussler reviews have said, I read this series in order and they just seem to get better as I go through them.This series is simply the most fun you'll have taking a little trip through your imagination with Dirk and Al.It's over the top, full of more than a few cliches, and often has bad dialogue. (Most from the vile bad guys)It's also daring, action packed, and even a little informative at times.Everyone picks on Cussler for his dialogue but, they seem to forget these books are just for fun and take place in a pseudo-fantasy world.If you want \\"real\\" people living a \\"real\\" life, read Jane Austen or something.Enjoy Atlantis Found for what it is then read Valhalla Rising."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Cussler has done his research. After reading and thoroughly enjoying the further adventures of Dirk Pitt in Atlantis Found, I discovered that the Holy Lance is a real object and that the Nazis had indeed surveyed the Antarctic for a base. Whether or not they ever built one is pure conjecture but it goes to show that Cussler tends to weave his fiction around solid facts. Additionally, his portrayal of the Ameenes (those who were later called the Atlanteans) is brilliant. Indeed there is much evidence pointing to just such a pre-historical civilization."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This was my favorite Clive Cussler novel. Atlantis Found offers a peak into what could have been for the human civilization before catastrophic events like asteroids wiped the Earth clean and started us over again. If you like treasure maps and scavenger hunts, this is a great read. Mr. Cussler does it again with his descriptive writing style. It paints a picture in my mind and allows me to watch the story rather than just read it."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have read every Cussler book. I enjoy the ones with Dirk Pitt immensly. He is the type of individual one can relate to, but most of us will never experience the adventure and thrills that Pitt survives and usually downplays the dangers that would kill most mortal."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Have read some of the negative reviews. I have read just about all the Cussler Dirk Pitt books. I find them fasinating and fun. I want to know when the next Dirk Pitt book is going to be out. Some of the reviews actually made me laugh. I read for entertainment. I like Pitt's style, his smoothness, and humor. Sure he is bigger than life, I live life every day and when I read a novel like this it lifts me out of every day, day after day. I don't think these books are written to teach us something. They are full of magic, adventure and romance. I don't want to read a story where the bad guy wins. Clive Cussler is the only author I collect in hard cover. I AM READY AND WAITING FOR THE NEXT DIRK PITT BOOK."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"To begin with, Cussler's novel (the first one of his I read) is actually rather good. It is pretty fun to read, and the plot is actually pretty good. It involves corny action-hero type Dirk Pitt (great name) who along with his pal Al Giordino from NUMA (National Underwater and Marine Agency) must stop Neo-Nazis from taking over the world with super-sized Noah's arkish ships. That being said, the reason this book gets three stars as opposed to four or five is because of the writing. Clive Cussler needs to re-enroll in English 101, as he is one of the hokiest and, well, worst writers I have ever seen. First of all, he persists in using rediculous similies such as \\"[His eyes] reminded her of the color of a coral reef beneath smooth water\\" (actually from another book, Serpent) and is absolutely horrible at describing the mechanical objects he so often uses. Don't get me wrong, I love his books and buy them whenever I have the chance, but I still shudder whenever I hear his horrible, horrible writing. Keep the plots, but learn to write!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Clive Cussler has done very well again. Atlantis Found is a great novel planned out perfectly by Clive Cussler. It is one of those books that once you start reading you can not stop until it is done. It is very well written. The book does not bore you with facts; it is all an adventure. It may be a long book but before you know it you are way into the book and almost done. It is a very fast moving book. One second a character is in a lot of trouble and the next second he or she finds a way out or gets in more trouble. The book never stops for a second. It all starts when Mr. Marquez, a miner in Telluride, Colorado stumbles across a chamber which is built in a perfect cube. The chamber has inscriptions not known to the current world. What do the inscriptions mean? As soon as Mr. Marquez stumbles across the chamber he is wanted dead. But who wants him dead? And why? A skull is found in the chamber; one that is identical to the one found in an extremely old ship with a crew of dead people. What is the connection? This book should be read by anybody who is able to read. A wonderfully planned book written by Clive Cussler. No one should miss it."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"...but who cares. This book is 544 of solid rocking fun. The action does not let up for a page, Dirk is always Dirk and Al is in rare form. It's all there, fun, action, larger than life heroism, an evil madman out to literally destroy the world. What more can you ask for in a holiday read? I loved it. I have read every Pitt novel, this may not be my favorite, but I loved the ancient Amenes, Pat, Loren, Sandecker, even the Wolfs, you just want to jump into the pages and kill them yourself.This book will never be required in LIT/341, future generations will not study it for inner meanings and deep philosophical messages. So what? Enjoy yourself, get lost in adventure, quit being so damn stuffy, have a great time, have a fantasy or two, and read Dirk Pitt again and again. This is a great book."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Cussler delivers again. Dirk Pitt involved with the lost city of Atlantis is a natural undersea adventure, and I'm glad Cussler is utilizing this bit of history. It's a real page-turner, the best thriller since Craig Furnas' THE SHAPE. Incidentally, I saw Clive Cussler himself just last night at a book signing, and the line for him was very long. Cussler looked great, all dressed in black."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Dirk and the boys and girls are back again. No matter what anyone says Clive puts together a great read. I feel like Dirk, Al and everyone at NUMA is part of the family and with any family they have flaws, but we love them all the same. Clive Cussler is one of the few authors my wife and I both enjoy. Atlantis Found will make a long plane ride short."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Why did I finish this book? It took sheer willpower and a niggling hope that a great plot twist would make it all worthwhile. Tedious and unnecessary descriptions were thrown into the mix. For example, Dirk would be scrambling over a mountainside with vast hordes in pursuit and Cussler would pause to describe, in excruciating detail, the shirt and pants being worn by our hero. Well, it wasn't as strange as all that, but it seemed that many paragraphs were throwaways and did little to move the story along. What was the deal with the gourmet meal of rabbit and sweetbreads situated in the midst of all the mayhem? It sure brought everything to a screaching halt. I think &quot;Dad&quot; should learn to write more better."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Dear Teacher, A while ago I read Atlantis Found, by Clive Cussler. I started reading it because I thought it would be about the lost contenent Atlantis, but after a few chapters I realized it was mostly a murder mystery, with Atlantis tied in. I really enjoyed the book. The author gives you some hints as to whose fault it is, but you can never be quite sure. I liked the way Cussler wrote Atlantis. There were many adventures, and just when you think somethings over, something else comes up. That way, it keeps your attention. Books that you can't out down are the best kind of books. One interesting thing I noticed was how Clive Cussler put himself into the book. He is always a subtle character, like a bartenter. This book kept my attention until the very end, never letting on how it's going to end. It was exciting and full of suspence. I could read it over and over again and get something new out of it every time."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have read every Clive Cussler book published and think this is one of his best. I enjoy how he brings background information into his story and shares this with the reader.The theory of Atlantis is fascinating and I'm glad he finally chose to write about it.As always, Dirk Pitt and Al Giordano are great partners! It seems a little twist is added as Al is finally getting married...could Dirk be next?All in all, I couldn't put it down until the last page was read. Can't wait for the next book!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I bought this book the day it was released. What a guilty pleasure, these techo/adventure/thrillers that Cussler puts out. Before opening the book I know what will happen and have a pretty good idea how, but I still cannot resist. For those of you who have read Cussler in the past, 'Atlantis Found' gives you a lot of what you expect. Thankfully, Cussler has made the plot a bit more plausible than what has been found in his recent efforts, but it remains a fantastic story nonetheless. It's a classic Dirk Pitt novel: he and his friends thwart the best laid plains of previously unstoppable villianry. A bit of a twist at the end was a (pleasant) surprise for me, but for the most part the action was gloriously predictable, as is wont to happen if you've read all of Cussler's work. For those who haven't read Cussler before, this is a first-rate adventure novel, just like 'Raise the Titanic' and the rest of the Dirk Pitt adventures. The technological details make the stories more believable, while Cussler's knowledge of seafaring yore and appreciation for fine autos makes the reading that much more enjoyable. The action moves at a break-neck pace, and it was with great reluctance that I sat the book down for matters such as sleep and work. A couple inconsistencies in the storytelling and some surprisingly elementary grammatical errors took away some of the pleasure of the book, but for the most part it was as good as anything I've read in the past year. Classic Cussler."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Atlantis Found is typical Dirk Pitt. For complete Cussler readers like myself, is was too long a wait. My ONLY complaint has to do with a few editing issues, but they did not detract at all from the pure enjoyment of a typical Dirk Pitt adventure. The reviews here reflect the fact that true fans of Cussler actually like the same formula over and over, as I do. It's something you just count on. Dirk and Al are like no others I read. Yes, you have to stretch you imagination to buy into some of the plot lines, but if you couldn't do that, you wouldn't have read all of the other adventures, either.If you have never read a Dirk Pitt novel, this is as good as any to start with. After reading this book, however, you may find yourself back to order the whole set.For long-time fans, if you want another thoroughly enjoyable adventure with an old friend, read Atlantis Found. It did not let me down, and after 15 books (true Dirk Pitt novels), Clive still has what it takes to keep me wanting more. It's the kind of book you hate to finish because you know it will be two more years before you get another."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I'm not a picky reader, nor do I routinely bash far-fetched pulp fiction. However, it seems that after 20 years of Dirk Pitt, Clive Cussler wrote this book solely for money. The characters are cliched card-board cutouts with ZERO character development. And it seemed that nearly every character had cold blue eyes with bodies that Mr. and Ms. Universe would envy.But the biggest complaint I have, is the book read like the author was just punching out the words as fast as he could, and then running off to play golf. I like to read through books in one session, but this took me five or six.On the posotive side, the ending action sequence was neat. Lets just hope he ends the series mercifully, and not have it end up like the comic series Penuts..."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I'm a new Dirk Pitt fan and so far I love it!!I've read Inca Gold and Cyclops. In Atlantis Found Dirk takes us to the South Pole and the reign of the New Dynasty. The book starts us of in the discovery of an old ship carrying artifacts from an ancient civilization that existed nine thousand years ago. From there Atlantis Found takes you on a rollercoaster ride from the depths of a mine in Colorado to the cold depths of the South Pole. Clive Cussler even has a cameo in his own book. Not to give anything away, but readers look for a character referred to as \\"Dad\\"!! With Dirk and Al Giordino's quick wit the book is fabulous. The best yet!!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I was introduced to Dirk Pitt by reading Inca Gold and have enjoyed that one more than his earlier work. Atlantis Found has a great prologue and a plot that is rapid during the first half of the book and still quite stimulating during the second half. But even with a long book, Cussler has kept the &quot;fun&quot; in Pitt. At a time in life that many adventure authors slow down, I feel (i.e. Clancy's The Bear and The Dragon), Cussler has written his best novel yet!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"As a mystery writer with my first novel in its initial release, I am a great admirer of Clive Cussler's success. When critics comment that my protagonist is almost too good to be true, I think of Cussler's Dirk Pitt. Pitt is a globe-trotting, brilliant, daring, courageous adventurer who annually manages to save the world. In this most recent Dirk Pitt--the sixteenth, I believe--he is taking on an amoral outfit that calls itself The Fourth Empire. Pitt enlists a beautiful expert in ancient languages to assist him in his battle with evil, and the action never stops to catch its breath. ATLANTIS FOUND is exactly what Cussler's fans have grown to expect from his books. Cussler does what he does better than anyone else, and I recommend ATLANTIS FOUND highly."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This book starts off slow. It soon escalates into a super thriller. Dirk Pitt is an adventurous fellow."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Since 1979, I have eagerly awaited every new Clive Cussler book... I give credit to Cussler and to Pitt for instilling in me the desire to be a researcher and academic, to search out the answers to everyday mysteries....I read Atlantis Found over a 24-hour period last summer after I finished my Master's thesis.... Dirk Pitt. Okay, so he's getting up there in age. The character is in his late 40's (I checked some sources, birthdate is 1952) but Cussler never fails to give us the one-two-three punch. I read the excerpt of Atlantis in Dirk Pitt Revealed and couldn't wait. Cussler masterful prose at creating the scene of the birth and death of the mythical island is spellbinding. Putting scenes and action aside, I feel that this is the best character development novel for Cussler and Pitt to-date. He has set the stage for his next novel. I cried at the end of this novel because I could see it coming. I lanquish at reading the next for fear of what it might contain and yet, I'm itching to tell my parents to bring me a copy of it with them when they visit in September. For me Dirk Pitt is ageless and thank heavens he is a character on a piece of paper I can go back to time and time again.If anything, if this is your first visit to Clive Cussler's world, read this to tempt you back to his other books. And set you up for Vahalla Rising."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is a entertaining book. However, it is disappointing in a sense that there is really nothing about the &quot;Atlantis&quot;."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This was the best of Cussler's later books in the series. Pitt and Al are long time friends and this book showed yet another dimension to their history. I will miss them. My mom, 2 sons and I all enjoyed this adventure and read through it too fast. A second reading brought about a time to reflect back on a truly terrific team that has brought us many adventures and given my family lots of lively discussions! Good reading for any adventure or history buff!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This was the first book I have read by Mr. Cussler, and it won't be my last. I enjoyed the twists and turns and the far-fetched surprises. This book ends up in a totally different place then it starts and as the reader I was along for a great ride. There were a few times when I thought there was a little too much detail when it wasn't necessary. This was a real page turner."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have read almost all of Clive Cusslers' other books, and I must say that this is probably the best, most action-packed one yet. If you really like Clive Cusslers works, this is a fantastic read. From South America, to the Fjords, to caves in Colorado, this book has action everywhere. Along with Inca Gold, this is the best Clive Cussler book I have read to date, and would highly reccomend it."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Having read all of Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels, I expected nothing but the best. I was a little disappointed. Although the storyline was good, I found parts of the tale a little too far-fetched, especially the huge ships, &amp; the method of destroying the earth. It still kept me interested, but is not up to par with his other Dirk Pitt novels."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I will have to admit that I loved Dirk Pitt and Al Gordino in the first Dirk Pitt novel; however, there can only be so many items sunken in the water which could enable evil characters to take over the world. Once you have read one Dirk Pitt novel, you have read them all."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I had eagerly been waiting for this book for quite some time, but after I read it, I was really disappointed. I've read all of Clive Cussler's books, and this is the worst one I've read so far. There wasn't any of the magic or fun that I've come to expect in the books, nor the passion. It's almost like Cussler couldn't quite make up his mind in what direction he wanted to go, and in the end, he went in too many different directions."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I am a Clive Cussler fan and love to escape into a good adventure with Dirk Pitt, Al Giordino, Admiral Sandecker, and other NUMA characters. I have enjoyed all of his books including this one. However, I like my science fiction to be based in sound science and almost all of the science fiction in this book is absurd. Good science fiction should deal with phenomena that we don't know about. For example: existence of extraterrestrial life, faster than light travel by means yet undiscovered, thinking computers, etc. Unfortunately, this offering by Cussler serves up numerous science tales that are known to be not so. Beginning with a comet impact in Hudson Bay a mere 7500 years ago, which didn't happen, and a tale of global plate movement that did occur but slowly and during the past 200 million years rather than in a few years, Cussler causes groans and cringing in the geoscience community. Simple things such as cold water in a warm mine should have been edited out. Alas, the worst flaw is the premise that moving the Ross Ice shelf would cause an imbalance in the distribution of mass on the surface of the Earth. On this little gem, Archimedes would groan loudest of all if he were still around. Of course, the notion of Atlantis is fanciful and fun, but there isn't a scrap of physical evidence that would support its existence. So my recommendation is this. If you perceived the &quot;science fiction&quot; in this book to be plausible, please go buy and read Carl Sagan's &quot;The Demon-Haunted World.&quot; On the other hand, if you don't really care, the unfortunate fact is that you have lots of company."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Having read all the previous Cussler (Pitt) novels I was looking forward to this one. I can only say I was disappointed from page one.Cussler continues to paint Pitt into corners but, instead of using his wits to escape, Pitt is too often saved by the serendipity of another character's actions.Nothing is gained with difficulty. Need an explanation of what the heck the plot is about halfway through? No problem. Bring in an ex-Nazi to explain, in detail, about the Antartic base.The impossible comes too easily. The good guys and bad just blab, blab, blab about things one would not normally speak of. Documents and historical records are found with no real effort.Either Cussler is getting too old or Pitt is. I found the book incredibly boring.Every woman who meets Pitt automatically falls in lust with him, and the on-going thing with his classic cars is getting old.Physical descriptions primarily run to hair and eye color, and are just thrown in instead of being incorporated into the writing.Mr. Cussler needs to take a refresher course in creative writing and remember &quot;SHOW--Don't TELL!&quot;"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have read only half of the book, but can't seem to get interested in it. It isn't what I thought it would be. I'm halfway through and nothing has really happened in it to make me want to read more. This is my first book by Clive Cussler. I thought maybe it was just a 'guy' book, but I have read several reviews by women who liked it. According to some of the reviews I have read, this is Clive's worst book, wouldn't you know it. I plan on finishing the book, but will probably not buy another from the author. There was also a misspelled word in the book, can't remember the page number, but it has &quot;craved&quot; instead of &quot;carved.&quot;"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I had never heard of Clive Cussler or Dirk Pitt when I borrowed this book on the recommendation of a relative. They shall both be quickly forgotten. This was one of the worst-written, ill-conceived books I have read in a long time. The plot was sophmoric and the dialogue inept. This books is best described as a cartoon, a comic book, that somehow made it into hardcover form."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I had never read Cussler, so didn't know what to expect. Eventually, after reading half the book, and seeing a bookstore display touting Dirk as the hero, I came to realize that Atlantis Found was one in a series of quasi-techno-thrillers akin to my favorite Tom Clancy/Jack Ryan novels. Clive even has the chutzpa to associate Dirk with Jack Ryan by name in the story. Name dropping only served only to make poor, lame Dirk all the more pale and second-rate.I was heartened in the beginning by the Atlantis theme, being a fan of Atlantis lore. This promising start quickly disintegrated into mere study of the improbable. Dirk's arrival on the scene and rescue of some of the characters trapped in a mine for starters. I was confused as well as to how the goons of the Forth Empire could discover, infiltrate and destroy a hitherto unknown underground room from a single phone call, yet are unaware of a little old lady who had the same artifact on her mantle for 80 years -- when apparently their predecessors had a hand in trying to killer her grandmother some decades before in the Antarctic. Huh? Exactly.The hero and his buddies seem to have a psychic ability to know exactly what is going on at all times. For example after a parked helicopter explodes marooning two characters on a remote island one announces that it was a bomb put on the chopper before they left and set to go off while they were over the water on the return trip -- a kill averted by their unexpected lingering on the island. At every turn Dirk knew that whatever happened was no accident, they, or &quot;the killers&quot; had elaborately planned it, and he knew exactly how with only the evidence of the clearing smoke.Tying the improbable and implausible together throughout is the inane dialogue. I thought I was reading the work of a 7th grader. I started getting a tic when, after watching a group of characters have their first experience deep in a mine (unnerving in itself), be trapped inside by an avalanche -- which knocked the lights out -- then followed by an explosion which creates a cave in and somehow causes the water level to rise (I'm not sure this is geologically possible), the sudden appearance of Dirk to the rescue and a trial by water buddy breathing on scuba to &quot;safety&quot; for people who had never been on Scuba (one who couldn't swim), in freezing water, a long tromp through the mines, then being confronted by gun toting guys on motorcycles (refereed to exhaustively as &quot;the killers&quot;) who announce that they are going to kill the haggard trio (actually a quartet but they don't know about Dirk... until he springs into action and kills the killers right in front of the shocked on lookers). Sounds like a bad day. All that and they still aren't home safe. Are they freaked out? Upset? Let's see, in the next conversation...Then Pitt paused and asked, &quot;Have any of you ridden motorcycles?&quot;I rode a Harley for ten years,&quot; answered Marquez.&quot;And I have an old Honda CBX Super Sport that belonged to my dad,&quot; Pat volunteered.&quot;Do you ride it?&quot;Rode it through college. I still hit the roads with it on weekends.&quot;Pitt looked at Pat with newfound respect. &quot;So you're an old leather-crotch, hard-in-the-saddle woman.&quot;You got that,&quot; she said proudly.Where is the fear? Where is the shock at the ordeal? Where is any hint of reality in this entire book? I couldn't find it. I could only take so much of this bad writing, and quit halfway through. Take my advise and bypass this one entirely and go straight for Without Remorse by Clancy."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I thought the book was totally gay"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is not the sort of book I usually read, but I decided to give it a try for something different. I surprised myself when I liked it. Great read!If you want to another read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"The only honest way to sum up this novel is to come right out and say the sad truth: thus book is god-awful trash. The plot is so outlandish ( yes, I realize it is a VERY fictious action novel, however, when your characters make 007 seem plausible in comparison then you have crossed the fiction barrier and entered the comic book zone.) that it is almost stunning in its servile inanity. I have enjoyed many of the authors other novels, but his creativity, not to mention his prose stylings, reached their zenith with &quot; Inca Gold&quot;. The plot revolves around a family of Nazi indoctrinated, ego-manical, genetically engineered family of would-be world destroyers. In an attempt to create a society that is flawless, these beautiful ( Though, being as Cusslers yardstick for measurement of emotional intelligence is a womans swooning at Dirk Pitts very image, these females are portrayed as a collective of fridged women )ladys and their brainy, brawny and buff brothers attempt to purge the globe of the lesser beings who account for 99.99% of the worlds population. The hackneyed, contrived manner in which this plot unravels is so laughable it is almost a study in stupidity. The authors protagonists, Dirk Pitt and his trusty sidekick Al, have survived more disasters than the entire U.S armed forces combined. The only thing these two indestructable Uber-heros lack are blue body stockings, capes and iron on S's. I can not express enough how bad this novel actually is. I would have given it negitive 5 stars had I the option. If this pap infested tripe had been sent to a publisher from an unpublished writer, the manuscript would have been set on fire. Save your money and spend it on something more entertaining and enjoyable, like watching your clothes tumble about in a laundermat dryer."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This was my first Clive Cussler book. I didn't realize that I was jumping into the 15th or 16th book in the series. I can't wait to go back and read the previous ones. This book combines ancient history and adventure, as well as politics and the military, in an effort to provide a first-rate novel. The character development that went into this book and the series is phenomenal and is second only to the creative storyline that keeps you guessing until the end. If you like me are a fan of paperback novels packed with action and adventure this series is for you."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is my first Dirk Pitt novel and I must say that I was rather disappointed. The idea of the story was interesting, but the writing made it very hard to enjoy. From the horrible dialogue-some of the worst I've ever read in an actually-published book, to the action scenes that just became frankly ridiculous, the author really got in his own way while telling this story. Though I like action and adventure and wild, far flung ideas do not bother me in the least, it was that I never had any sense of danger for Pitt or his friends. I knew nothing would/could happen to Dirk, he is just too good, and that drained the suspense and excitement out of the action sequences. I can understand how some people would enjoy this though, as it reads just like a movie. In fact, I can't believe this or other Dirk Pitt novels have not been adapted to the screen, I can't imagine it would be that hard. But I think this will be my only Cussler novel, and I do not recommend it. Now, if I can only get that dialogue out of my head...."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I will continue to read cussler and dirk pitt. I just wish the way the story unwinds would differ a little.....This is another good one."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"...Then you'll find Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt adventures a bit silly, too. I actually had to begin reading a second book in the series to make sure he really intended to write the way he does. Atlantis Found is a little Indiana Jones, a little James Bond (Roger Moore days) and a bit of a spoof on both of them. Let's see, greedy rich people don't care if what they do to further their own dreams causes chaos on a global level, so government employed adventurer Dirk Pitt shows up in the nick of time to save the day with wit and uncanny reflexes and endless knowledge of how to survive almost anything. How many other titles are this same story line? Who cares? Despite putting himself in each story like Hitchcock popping up in his own films, I'm starting to find Cussler almost annoyingly likeable and his fast-reading tales wryly enjoyable. You may roll your eyes and say, \\"Nuh-uh!\\" a lot, but once you've read Clive's opaline green-eyed alter ego and his exploits, I'd be surprised if you didn't find yourself hooked, too. Atlantis Found is well crafted, intriguing, and just plain fun...."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is the first Clive Cussler book I've read and from the very first page I was hooked. This book has a wonderfully eerie and ingenious introduction. But the more I read, the more irritated at his writing style, or lack of it, I became. I can't recall reading more wooden dialogue in my life. It is painful. His sentence structure and phrasing would have been red penciled by my sophomore English teacher. I found myself wanting to rewrite almost every paragraph, and groaning out loud, but I couldn't put it down. If only he could combine his clever ideas, action, impressive technical knowledge and eye for detail with a writing style that was not cringe-inducing, I would read another."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I've read a number of Cussler's Dirk Pitt adventures and my general reaction is that his earlier ones tend to be better than the later ones.The plots of ALL of his books are pretty fantastic (i.e. unbelievable) but the earlier ones are more attentively written. By the time you get to ATLANTIS FOUND, you pretty much know Cussler's tried and tested format: 1. Something weird happens somewhere; 2. Dirk and Al get involved in it; 3. On the way, Dirk meets and beds a smart, pretty woman who is somehow involved with the weirdness Dirk and Al are solving (poor old Al never seems to get the girl); 4. Many cool gadgets and cars later, problem solved, Dirk gets to save the world and celebrate over a glass of vintage tequila.ATLANTIS FOUND contains some really shoddy writing and some creaky and predictable dialogue, but for pure macho escapism, it's good fun."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I would love to give this book a full five stars just for the unbounded creativity of the story; this ain't literature, folks, this is pure fun. And, this is pure SF. I've read all of Clive Cussler's books, but this one is really over the top. He's thrown caution to the winds, given his characters the most utterly humanly impossible odds, and of course they always win. Not realistic by a long shot, but who cares? This is good stuff, truly enjoyable to those who like SF, adventure, hi-tech, or thrillers. Oh, yeah, why only three stars if I like it so much? Well, the similes and metaphors can be pretty bad, the dialogue is silly and unreal, and the prose just adequate. But then again, this ain't literature, is it? Just a terrifc story. Go for it."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I don't understand the negative reviews! This is Dirk Pitt! This is Clive Cussler! If you don't like the characters, the plots, the style, why are you reading this book?

Whether he goes by Dirk Pitt or &quot;Dad&quot; Cussler, you have to love this guy! Thank you for another wonderous adventure, Mr. Cussler. I understand how long research takes, but please hurry with your next one!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Again Clive Cussler has Dirk Pitt in all his glory and a story line to go with it that could be close to actual events and history. We all know that sometimes the action gets carried away but that is what we read fiction for.

World wide devastation, Nazis, comets, treasure, caved in mines, shootouts, crashing vehicles, flying aircars, sunken submarines, beautiful women, handsome brave heroes....what else is there?While I think of Mr. Cussler's novels as &quot;guy books&quot; the fact that I'm a thirty something mom of two didn't stop me from totally enjoying this book. The plot moves fast, there's alot of action. At times you are thinking &quot;come on&quot; when Dirk and his pals take on unimaginable odds and win. But it's sort of like an action movie with James Bond or Arnold, fun if a bit unbelievable.The plot twists and turns and when I thought &quot;it's over&quot; it wasn't. Even Mr. Cussler shows up as a character in this book. One thing though &quot;WHO was the leak at Numa&quot;? That never got answered. AND the advertising?...Dirk and his girlfriend drink Ray Martin Cabernet.

There were several instances of contradictions and inconsistencies in the subject matter. A good editor should have caught these."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Fascinating story, BUT, good Lord--the dialogue! Clusser is in desperate need of a partner to handle the dialogue; people do not talk like that, and I cringe/am disappointed anew every time his characters open their mouths."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"There are two kinds of people: the ones who love Clive Cussler and his books and the ones who despise him and his books. After reading &#65533;The mediterranean caper&#65533;, &#65533;Inca gold&#65533; and &#65533;Raise the Titanic&#65533;, I was struggling not to be part of the second group. After reading &#65533;Atlantis found&#65533;, I&#65533;m more convinced to be part of the second.These four books made me understand the following: A) Clive Cussler&#65533;s characters have enormous potential to be unforgettable. B) His plots, though mainly implausible, can be cool. C) Cussler doesn&#65533;t know how to write. D) Cussler is becoming megalomaniac, like, say, Tom Clancy.&#65533;The mediterranean caper&#65533; is one of Cussler&#65533;s first books. In it, the set is confined, the plot is OK, Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino are amusing and even interesting characters, sort of (clich&eacute; coming) a blend of James Bond with Indiana Jones. That&#65533;s OK. People like their heros to be undestructible, women falling all over them, etc. I supposed Cussler, along the years, would improve his writing style, develop more his characters and plots. &#65533;Inca gold&#65533; was clearly an improvement compared to &#65533;The mediterranean caper&#65533; and &#65533;Raise the Titanic&#65533;. But &#65533;Atlantis found&#65533; is something else.Dirk Pitt and Giordino are still immortal, superior human beings. All other characters, no exception, in &#65533;Atlantis found&#65533;, are sadly poor. The plot and its premises are laughable. Neo-nazis responsible for a great world-wide catastrophe in order to rule the world is nothing new. The beginning of the book is good and gets the reader hooked, but after a hundred pages everything falls apart. In fact, some passages of the book were interesting, but this only made the worst parts of the book more visible. In the end, I just wanted the book to finish fast.Still, I would give &#65533;Atlantis found&#65533; three stars, but two things made it drop to two:1) Cussler&#65533;s mania in giving every object its complete specifications, characteristics, etc. Example:&#65533;This is the new german Glock Super .358 Caliber Two Chambers Silver Reloadable Master I just got.&#65533;Or &#65533;I&#65533;d like a bottle of Chateau Perriere Sauvignon Dandini Zidane Alain Prost Cabernet 76 please. If you have one of them, of course&#65533;.2) Cussler in fact is a character in his own book! This is ridiculous!To sum it up, in my opinion, Dirk Pitt is a great character in the hands of a bad writer.Grade 4.5/10"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"To say I was disappointed in this novel is an understatement. The promise of an interesting premise is quickly destroyed by illogical action, verbose exposition, unrealistic dialogue and non-existent characterization. The hero--Dirk Pitt--is so superficial it is impossible to care about him, as are the other characters. I realize characterization is not always a priority in plot-based novels, but, as a reader, I expect at least some sort of sympathetic bond to the people about which I'm reading, especially if I'm asked to commit my time to more than 500 pages. So many flaws abounded in this novel that I found myself amused by its incompetence. For example, in one scene an underground location is described as nearly completely dark, yet one of the characters notes the color of another one's eyes. And that is only one of the minor problems with this novel. Much larger gaps of logic and probability occur throughout the work. I finished the book only because I chose it as a part of my reading regimen. I don't plan on reading any more Clive Cussler novels."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"&quot;Atlantis Found&quot; is without question the most poorly written book I have ever read. I finished it out of curiosity as I wondered, how bad could it actually get? I am embarrassed for Mr. Cussler, his editor (did he have one?) and the publisher. This book could help a middle school english class learn about bad writing.What stands out? Now that's a challenge. I'll pick the first few things that come to mind. Large portions of the the text reminded me of the old &quot;Tom Swift&quot; books, not only because of the outrageous technology (&quot;nano&quot; technogy was fun - microscopic machines that spontaneouly manufacture other little machines that can somehow carve off a 1,500 mile long ice shelf), but also because of Mr Cussler's often hilarious invention of new adverbs, created by appending &quot;-ly&quot; onto the ends of unsuspecting adjectives and nouns. (Remember the old joke that goes; &quot;What we need is another man who can hit sixty home runs a year, said the manager, RUTHlessly.&quot;) Or how about the plotlines which go nowhere, or the unending grammatical mistakes. Or how about the time one of the heroes notices &quot;..a bulge in the pants...&quot; of the other hero. (Don't worry, the bulge turns out to be his Bushmaster (!) handgun.) Or how about... Well, you get the point.Anyway, it occured to me that there might be other explainations. Perhaps the publisher was performing a test market to see if huge quantities money could be made by getting an orangutan or a chimp to do the writing, thereby eliminating those pesky fees often demanded by homo sapien authors. Or, perhaps Mr. Cussler lost a bet in a bar. Or perhaps tired of the limelight, Mr. Cussler wrote a book intended to destroy his reputation, only to be thwarted when thousands of mass market readers bought it and actually liked it! Are good authors measured by skill, or getting distribution on those little racks you find in supermarkets, drug stores, etc.?Well, Mr. Cussler is no doubt laughing all the way to the bank. I have to admit, &quot;Atlantis Found&quot; made me laugh as well, so it wasn't a total loss from that perspective."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is the first and last Clive Cussler book I will read. Interesting premise...poorly written. He's a master of the extended metaphor and run on sentence. I prefer better written stories. Try some Crichton instead...this is a typical guy book in the same way there are typical gothic romances."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"The only thing wrong with this book is that we will have to wait another two years for Mr. Cussler to do another Dirk Pitt."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Congratulations Clive Cussler. You read \\"Fingerprints of the Gods\\" by Graham Hancock. You thought to yourself it would make a great piece of fiction. And you managed to comletely screw it up!I had never read Clive Cussler before, and I never will again. First of all, the dialogue was utter nonsense. No one speaks like these characters. Also, why in the world does the author insist on describing in detail every piece of machinery, or gadget that Dirk Pitt (and what a stupid name!) or his enemies are using? This is inane. Is Clive Cussler getting kick backs from all of the brand names that he mentions in his books? Everything about this book can be summed up in one little 5 letter word.Silly.If you respect your intelligence, stay away from this one! I would have given no stars if it was possible."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Many years ago Cussler invented a sea going James Bond named Dirk Pitt who works for a mythical National Underwater and Marine Agency (NUMA naturally). Pitt has all the sophisticated tests, physical abilities, raw courage and looks and charm, which is required for a heroic figure. What keeps him from becoming a caricature is the fascinating vision of life at sea and the complexities of the ocean gives to any activity.Cussler clearly can spin a good story and in this case he unveils a Nazi project to launch the fourth Reich (It is fascinating that there are far more novels about totally improbable Nazi revenge than there are about tragically real Islamic medieval terrorism and there are far more novels about bad Germans 56 years after the Second World War than there are about all too real current acts of terror against Israel and the West or for that matter the terrorists who seek to destabilize India, the Philippines, Indonesia, etc.).Cussler brings to life the threat to the modern world and in an adventure, which is in many ways closer to science fiction than to traditional adventure fiction. He creates a threat to humans everywhere and a Nazi plan to inundate the world with massive oceanic and climate changes and then provide very large Noah's arks which they will control so they will be the only effective survivors (anyone else who manages to survive they plan to wipe out during the aftermath).While the story is wildly implausible Cussler builds it step by step so that you find yourself both fascinated by how it will turn out and totally rooting for the good guys led by Pitt to win."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I generally enjoy Dirk Pitt. I have read almost all of them, even if I only hazily remember the earlier ones, but never remember being as disappointed as I with this one. First, the good points. It was an incredible concept.... Atlantis has been a favorite (with good reason) for many authors over the years, and the possible explanations and themes they explore are endless. Cussler's interpretation is a bit less exotic than, say, Greg Donegan's, but still viable and has the added benefit of being at least somewhat plausible. The Characters are classic Cussler villians and hero(ine)s, and the action scenes...nice. However there are flaws here as well. The framework of the book didn't seem to hang together well. My primary complaint is that the villians were entirely too stupid. There was absolutely no reason for them to be doing what they were doing when Pitt and company stumbled upon them. Even if the artifacts were discovered, everyone was going to be dead in, what, three weeks anyway, so what would be the big deal? Antarctica is a big place; it would have been unlikely that it would have been revealed. Even if it had been discovered, there was no indication that the bad guys were up to anything especially nefarious - aside from building a complex in a prohibited location, of course. Still, pay a fine and move out, and your ok. Everyone's gonna die in a month, and the court case will take longer than that. Sigh. As a geologist, I find the disaster theory somewhat dubious, but it's been ten years since college and I don't keep up on the breaking developements as much as I might. The concept was floating around back then, but none of my profs gave it much credence, and I haven't heard anything in the public media to convince me otherwise. Once things get moving it's a good read. Cussler's writing style is clear and easy to follow, without any needless ramblings. However, I just felt that the whole scenario was somewhat forced...I couldn't get past the fact that the antagonists should never have been doing what they were doing when they ran into Pitt. Oh well. Maybe the next one will be better. 2 stars from me."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I can't believe I keep reading this dribble. The stories are fair, but the characters seem to keep getting more moronic. I can't figure out who is older - the cliches or the characters (who seem to be going through a neverending mid life crisis). This is the last Clive Cussler book I buy. My suggestion is to get this one at the library and spend your money on good books."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Atlantis found is superb! So good to see Dirk Pitt back in full form, running all over the world with Al... it seems that in each chapter they somehow escape death and danger.

It is similar to the others in that Dirk once again saves the world, unbeleivable but isn't that why it is called fiction!

But...the author seems to have taken it for granted that most readers aren't first time readers to his books. As such he left out considerable character development. All the action in the world gets stale fast if the entire cast of characters are two demensional. By merely providing simple observations into who the characters really are makes all the difference. You see this at the end when the writing becomes much more enjoyable to follow (love involvment, change of relationships, etc.)"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"A promising plot becomes mired down by Mr.Cussler's portrayal of Dirk Pitt as the James Bond wannabe. The storyline is well thought out and the twist at the half way point will catch many readers {like myself, for example} off gaurd. The explanation of an Atlantis culture's existence is presented in a plausable manner. The supporting characters are not very well developed and show little depth. The bad guys are transparent with very little to make a reader like or dislike them, they are just single minded. Dirk Pitt's obsession with proving that the old is always better than the new in weapons, cars, and just about anything else is wearing thin. It seems that Mr.Cussler has Dirk suffering more and more injuries in his adventures and this is perhaps to cover up his character flaws to make him seem more human. All in all I enjoyed the book but it is well below the standards of his previous books such as &quot;Raise the Titantic&quot;, &quot;Inca Gold&quot;, and &quot;Sahara&quot; to name a few. I look forward to his next book."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"The main question here is are Dirk and All too old to save the world one more time? Does Mr. Cussler need to resurrect the Nazis or could he come up with a more creative enemy threatening world destruction and domination? I was hoping for some bad guys who were really worth hating, you know, a real challenge for our heroes. These neo-Nazis are a little wimpy, created from the seed of Hitler to become tall, blue-eyed blondes. I'm not sure I like the idea that Mr. Cussler believes a superior race could be genetically engineered from Hitler. On the bright side, the author does come up with an interesting plot but the enemy is too easily thwarted and Dirk and Al seem to win more by happenstance and rugged determination than by out-thinking the bad guys. If you're a Cussler fan you won't miss this one but I believe you'll hope the next in this series is a bit better. However, I do wonder if this is a swan song for our heroes? They both comment on feeling their age (Vietnam vets pushing 50), and Al makes an unheard of commitment. Can retirement be far behind?"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is the first time to have read any of Clive Cussler's work. I was skeptical at first but soon found it difficult to put down. I was expecting another Indiana Jones; but it was better!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have my grandson reading all of hios books. It is so much fun reviewing them together. He can go through them much faster than I can."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"A great book, if you haven't read it you should. Dirk Pitt is an adventurous hero who does every thing right. The best book since the last Clive Cussler book. Clive Cussler is the greatest author I have ever known. I just can't say enough about the book."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I would go to 4 1/2 stars if I had the choice. This is a definite page turner. There are unlikely coincidences, improbable plot devices, occasional syntax errors, and a few erroneous details. But reading books like this is about suspending reality, at least to a certain extent. It is the indominable hero vs the overwhelming odds of the evil corporate/family empire (that has never before tasted defeat) in a battle to the death at the bottom of the world with civilization literally riding on the outcome. And for extras, there is a 9000 year old archeological find which will forever change the way of thinking in the world if it survives. What else could you ask for? If you want reality, watch 60 Minutes."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I'm giving this 3 stars only because I respect Clive Cussler's other works which I've read and enjoyed more than Atlantis Found. The title and premise are captivating enough, sadly, it did not go further than that. I feel like he didn't quite live up to his potential on this one. I found the characters boring and predictable, the evil genius too stereotypical (and don't even get me started on the women)! I'm also getting tired of having &quot;Clive Cussler&quot; in the storyline. I don't normally part with my books but I don't mind letting this one go. Maybe next time we'll see the Dirk Pitt of old. I really miss him!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Well, not even pretty. It starts off with an interesting angle, but thereafter goes rapidly downhill and the ability to suspend disbelief disappears completely after about the half-way mark. However, I bravely stuck it out to the end, and it just became steadily more ludicrous, the characters more and more cardboard cutouts, the successful adventures against hopeless odds ever more absurd. The paperback cost me SFr10 (about $US6) where it was being sold off presumably in an attempt to move it. I paid too much."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Sure it required a huge amount of suspension of disbelief and there was lots of coincidence and luck, but this book was fun. It read quickly and kept me entertained the entire time I was reading. No great moral issues or any issues for that matter. Every Cussler book I've read was fun--this one was the most fun so far."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"But if this one was good enough, you'll search for more. THat's the case with Cussler and his &quot;Bond&quot;, Dirk Pitt. They are all there again: Giordino, Sandecker and Loren. But the story ? IT's good enough to read in three days. &Oacute;f course the plot is so grandious.. Fourth Reich Nazid are not exactly new in novels ..."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I am a big fan of Clive Cussler, and have read all his books. I read Atlantis Found and really enjoyed it. Just recently I bought the book on tape (read by Michael Prichard), for my husband to listen to. He is not a fiction reader, but we listened to Harry Potter with our kids and became addicted to listening to the tapes while driving. Well, the narrator of Atlantis Found was just terrible. He read in monotones, and brought little excitement to the story. Each character sounded the same, except the females and he read them sounding really silly! My husband did enjoy the plot, but we will not listen to Michael Prichard reading a Clive Cussler book again. Mr Prichard should take notes from the Harry Potter narrator (Jim Dale), who was outstanding."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I am only 13 years old (I started reading Cussler's works when I was 12 )and I am a die-hard fan of Clive Cussler. I am in the process of making a homepage right now about him. I have read Inca Gold, Dragon, and Atlantis Found. I will soon start to read either The Mediterranean Caper, Treasure, Cyclops, or Blue Gold (I dont really know much about the Numa Files series). I think this is by far the best book I have ever read. The technology is fascinating. Once you pick it up you can't put it down. I once read this non-stop for 3 hours on a plane and until we got to our condo. You just always want to read one more chapter. If you are into Cussler this is a must buy!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Since Shock Wave, Adapted for young fans, appeared, I read it out of some interest. After that, I was hooked. I picked Inca Gold, and then this one, Atlantis Found. I had not seen any Cussler books for sometime, and I found this one through a research project on Atlantis. I loved it. Now I know that I read beyond my years. But if you like Harry Potter, but want more action, here's the book for you!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I am a first timer of his series, and If what i read in this book is present in all of his I look forward to reading more! His startling degree of accuaracy and predicitions of the future and current technology is very much on the spot. He combines the best elements of action and adventure while still making it not seem improbable or impossible. This is one of the best books I have read in a while and finished it quickly. 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I've read all of Clive Cussler books, and am amazed at one aspect of his writing. That is, he always seems to be able to write engaging, fast-paced novels even with some unbelievable and/or &quot;corny&quot; elements that always seem to wreck other authors. With &quot;Atlantis Found&quot;, he has pulled that off yet again.I always find myself having to &quot;disengage&quot; a portion of my brain when reading a Cussler novel, because of the unbelievable and corny aspects of his writing. Dirk Pitt is a kind of &quot;super Bond&quot;, who gets put through more abuse, injury, and utterly impossible situations than any other fictional leading man in the literary world. No way he can continue to singlehandedly save the world and survive, but that's fiction!The other thing I have to ignore is Cussler's quirky sort of writing, especially when it comes to conversation. He writes dialogue for his characters that you never hear from anyone in the real world. It is a style that is almost overly cliched, but in an elitist, Ivy League sort of way. This is amusingly highlighted in &quot;Atlantis Found&quot; in the dialogue between the Special Forces troops. I know of no troops in my experiences, including a stint in the Navy, who spoke as Cussler's characters did. He made them out to sound like they went through high society etiquette training rather than boot camp or SEAL training.Like I said, though, despite these corny and unbelievable elements, Cussler enthralls the reader with his historically and archaeologically-based plots. He manages to wrap the reader's focus around thes believable elements and lets the reader enter an Indiana Jones-esque tale.&quot;Atlantis Found&quot; has a great plot centering on the Amenes culture and its tie with the myth of Atlantis. Pitt's nemesis in the novel, the evil Fourth Empire, is a worthy foe that also adds a great historical element to the storyline. I too enjoyed the plot twist that came about midway through the book, as did a previous reviewer. It was one I did not see coming until you hit it. And, I enjoyed the fact that for once, Pitt had to have SOME help in saving the world, courtesy of Special Forces. Of course, Cussler has Pitt saving the troops' bacon once and making all the crucial decisions, but at least he had some help in thwarting the bad guys.If there was one element in this novel I did not like, it was Cussler's self-serving insertion of himself into the story to meet/help Pitt. However, this is a pet peeve I've had of his novels for awhile now. It was neat the first time he did it, and maybe the second time too. But now it's old and is a weak point that seems to do nothing more but to soothe Cussler's ego. I would hope he halts this aspect of his writing the next time around.All in all, though, &quot;Atlantis Found&quot; is an enjoyable story. It is a nice cap to the 1990's for Cussler, who has put together a string of solid novels this decade after being sort of &quot;hit-and-miss&quot; early in his career. While this novel did not quite rank with my favorite Cussler novel, &quot;Treasure&quot;, it is still one I highly recommend to Cussler fans and also to those reading him for the first time."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I bought this book as soon as it came out even though I had been disappointed with both Flood Tide and Shock Wave. Being a huge fan of Mr. Cussler's I had to give Dirk, Al and the NUMA crew another chance, and I am really glad that I did. Mr. Cussler weaves a great story which makes the reader keep reading page after page, not wanting the book to end. Buy it and if you haven't read his other books, buy them too."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Cussler fans will find his latest very like his previous novels. I'm more of a reader of historical fiction like &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; or &quot;The Triumph and the Glory&quot;, but I always make it a point to read Cussler's books when they are published. They always entertain, they are never too deep, in brief, they are like a roller coaster ride, packed with thrills and adrenaline but not exactly profundly moving."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Who edited this story? Dialogue was out of place, events contradicted themselves. Are we in too big a hurry to make a dollar? I want the job of editing the next attempt but it seems Dirk and Al are about to be turned out to pasture with their love interests. Does this mean we have to endure those two characters that surfaced two years ago in Cussler's collaboration with what's-his-name?"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have been a Dirk Pitt fan for over 20 years and the only thing I found disappointing about this book is Mr. Cussler's threat to retire Dirk and Al. These two can do anything and find anything, anywhere, anytime (have they gone after the fabled 7 cities of gold, yet, or the Oak Island treasure?) and foil any scheme. They NEVER fail, they never age and they recover in superhuman time. Yes, it's impossible. So is Superman. Yes, the plot goes in all directions before coming together at the end. That's part of Clive Cussler's ironic humor, along with his James Bond type characters and the insertion of his own character and cars into the story a la Hitchcock and King. His ancient history prologues are attention-getters that keep you turning pages wondering how he's going to tie up all these loose ends, but Warning! If you have no sense of humor or if you're looking for logical, prosaic, real-world drama, read the newspaper. If you're looking for toungue-in-cheek, larger-than-life excitement with a couple of true superheroes, you've come to the right place. A hero should be a hero and Dirk Pitt is it, as he once again foils a world shaking plot and at the same time solves an ancient mystery. Keep him coming, Clive!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Like the classic cars that Cussler and Pitt collect, I thought Atlantis Found was vintage. If you were expecting Tolstoy then why would you pick up a Dirk Pitt Novel? If you want a full blast roller coaster ride then Cussler is what you want. Several times I thought&quot; Well they're about to wrap this up and there are alot of pages left...He must have a big preview of his next book in the back. Then Dirk and Al would take off again through another Loop-the-loop. WHEEE!What fun."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is my first try at a Clive Cussler book, and absolutely my last. Unfortunately for me, Mr. Cussler has written fiction here about a range of subjects that I have great deal of knowledge about (why I bought the book), so some of the inconsistencies with his facts & logic instantly flew into my face. Others took a few extra seconds.What annoyed me (and caused me to privately give this book a subjective 0-star rating) is that all the jarring lapses in facts & logic that I came across easily could have been avoided with a just a little imagination and research. If you're bothered by things like characters being concerned that their sailing ship (that's trapped in ice that will thaw when spring arrives) will be crushed by the ice one winter, while another sailing ship, only a short distance away, has been perpetually trapped in ice (that, I guess, never melts)for 70 years with no ill effects, AND it contains frozen and never-defrosted occupants*, then this will be a really damned unhappy read. I was stunned by his magic decoder ring ancient civilization alphabet, where a circle with one line through it corresponded with our letter 'A', and one with two lines through it with 'B' and so forth. That's not how written languages of this type work, and all the author had to do was NOT generate a somewhat predictable series of geometric characters that conveniently nearly perfectly matched our alphabet. If you don't get what the problem is here, no matter, but I will tell you that what the author has done is about what I'd expect from an old Nancy Drew mystery written for the 10-12 age bracket, if even.This goes on throughout the entire book--well at least to about a third in, where I finally threw in the towel and jumped to the last chapter, which was, without reservations, damned awful. He does mention a lot of subjects, but he doesn't seem to know much about any of them, which makes one review here claiming his books can be \\"educational\\" kind of sad. Mr. Cussler probably counts on his readership not doing any fact-checking, and as long as the books keep selling, the publisher won't care if he puts Antarctica in the middle of Lake Tahoe.If readers like his books, well, they like his books, but I sure don't sense that the author has much respect for his readers. A responsible writer of even the most fantastic fiction usually provides some substance to his or her story by using facts & logic. People can even learn things about ships, weather, the Antarctic, you name it, in the course of the storytelling, and people who actually know a few things can also enjoy the story without wincing too often. If I were writing for a certain market I'd flat out use my writing to help educate people (and prevent myself from feeling I was writing useless fluff).The quality of the writing is, after a drink, passable, and not as bad as some reviewers make it out to be. By our low modern standards it may even be almost barely adequate. Illogical and fact-empty storytelling like this, though, puts this book in the same league as an episode of Scooby-Doo.PS The back of my copy of the book has a pic of Mr. Cussler with his 1936 Ford Hot Rod that his loyal readers financed. Given the writing, this strange display of its rewards to the author kind of bothered me. Its a nice car--far better crafted than the book.*not just frozen and never defrosted during any ship-freeing polar spring, but garbed in 18th century costumes, but NOT wrapped in blankets, or even sail cloth. The author's explanation for why they were dressed for a promenade in London rather than the Antarctic and why there was no attempt to use wood from the ship to make fires are just ludicrous. He needed an intact ship and a frozen crew and logic be damned."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Once again Clive Cussler has created another thrilling story that is realistic and to boot he has given me a wonderful tour down history lane. The plot moved along briskly and soon I found myself reading page after page. I thought there was less suspense in this story especially when I think of \\"Sahara\\" which I thought was just a terrific book. In summary, I would gladly recommend this book to all my friends. For me, Mr. Cussler is the type of writer that with all his novels, he has never disappointed me."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Cussler usually weaves together a couple of themes in his books, in this case, the secret plot of the Neo-Nazi Wolff family to \\"purify\\" the world and the coming doomsday prediction of the ancient Amenes civilization.The premise of the ancient Amenes civilization, much older than the Sumerians and completely lost to the world in a massive disaster, was fascinating and spellbinding. And the Wolff family were worthy opponants for Pitt, if a little unrealistic to have a whole family of clones of Adolph Hitler (enhanced, of course). One always discovers something absolutely fascinating in Pitt novels, and archaeology was always one of my favorite topics.All in all, it was another great Pitt novel, one in which Pitt wins against all odds and has a beautiful woman in the process, not unlike James Bond. But it's more of a combination of Indiana Jones and James Bond, and still manages not to be too corny or stereotyped in the process. Pitt is still relatively unique, so he's not intended to be an exact clone of either Bond or Jones, which is a good thing."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I came to the world of Dirk Pitt and Clive Cussler later than most. I had seen the movie based on his RAISE THE TITANIC novel and enjoyed it and even remembered seeing a copy of that novel in my local newsagents when I was but a young boy.But, it wasn't for another two decades that I finally picked up a Cussler novel and began reading - it was an experience that had me jetting off to the local bookstore and scouring the pages of amazon.com for more Pitt adventures to dive into. The book that had that impact on me was ATLANTIS FOUND, a book that single handedly changed my reading habits and entertained me through a number of business trips.Though the plot may be a little convoluted and improbable and the whole re-emergemce of a Nazi power somewhat cliched - its been done before and more convincingly in novels like THE HOLCROFT COVENENT and ICEBREAKER to name but a few. But, what Cussler does possess in ample quantities here is a knack for writing an action scene. In fact the book ATLANTIS FOUND can be seen as a series of action setpieces strung together over the span of 500-plus pages. No matter though, I liked the way the pot was developed, the idea of the giant ships and the way that Cussler was able to tie together an ancient meteor strike and the nineteenth-century discovery of an ice tundra bound ghost ship to present day events.All of the Cussler elements that have become trademarks for the writer over the years are here in abundance and although he still has some appalling dialogue and convoluted plotting, I personally found the novel to be a real page turner."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I thought this was one of Clive Cussler's best books, along with Sahara and Night Probe. I have always been intrigued with Atlantis and I love Dirk Pitt, so the book grabbed me from the start. It never ceases to amaze me what a fantastic imagination Clive Cussler has; every book seems believable the way he mixes history with fiction. I really wish they would make a Dirk Pitt movie of ANY book; he is such a great mix of Indiana Jones and James Bond! I always thought Tom Cruise, Harrison Ford, or Pierce Brosnan would make a great Dirk Pitt..."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is my first Dirk Pitt book and after Atlantis, I went on an adventure of my own--seeking Cussler's books in the library.The book has a formula but it works--good guys are really good and noble; they fight well and bad guys are dastardly and fight nasty.

The action starts quickly and doesn't let up even though this a very long book. Maybe Mr. Cussler doesn't have the best grammar or literary skills, but he writes some of the best action novels in the business. Are we out to critique his work or escape into a world of action and suspense? I love Cussler books because of the history mixed in with the action. The different story lines are weaved together well and the characters are second to none. There were some surprises at the end of the book and I was glad to see Dirk get knocked off his pedastal just a little bit( you will have to read the book to see what I mean).All in all, this is a good book to get away with for a while."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have read every Clive Cussler NUMA, Dirk Pitt book that has come out. The last one, &quot;Inca Gold&quot; was maybe one of the best. When I got my copy of Atlantis Found, which was bought by my daughter, I was in Pitt heaven. It was a signed copy by Clive himself. The first and major problem is that it has become NUMA goes Star Wars. Flying cars???? Whats wrong with the old Dirk? I still love reading about guys from NUMA and I get so involved I forget all about Clive Cussler and just call it the Dirk Pitt author. I haven't finished the book yet and I am enjoying it. Maybe Clive can invent a time machine and Dirk can go back to the 20th century, or how about back to a time like the revolution. Old Dirk is OK with me."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"It could have been so much better. There are plenty of Antediluvian &quot;resources&quot; available that could have been taken made use of to flesh out more life into the book. The plot is so darn straight forward that nothing surprises the reader anymore. Cussler's world has so many secret organisations that are so high-powered super-financed with links to every government that they cannot be prosecuted (add the baddies from all his earlier novels) that it is a great wonder that they don't run into each other or conflict each other's interests. It seems that only the mainstream government is completely infiltrated. What is so terrible about the Fourth Empire (so unimaginative) is that they are supposed to comprise of so many people (hundreds of thousands) and yet remain undetected even though they have hit teams everywhere in the world. That the Wolf sisters were genetically engineered served absolutely no purpose in the story other than to indicate advances in biotech which the Wolfs couldn't find better use. Neither was the nanotech which if they really had it, could be better used than what they had to achieve their purpose. It's like having an aircraft carrier to fight a war and using it only to fire grapeshot cannons. And how many times must Hitler be revived in novels ? His inclusion again served no purpose at all other than to irritate readers."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Clive Cussler is at it again, with his duo of Pitt and Giordino romping through another save-the-world tale of derring-do. Cussler's stories are so thoroughly researched, that half the time the novels read as though they were fact! I'm sure that in most instances, his novels are indeed factual, with a mysterious quality of fiction woven so tightly around it that one cannot help but accept as 100% truth. It is extremely easy to enter into a state of suspended belief in all of Cussler's books, as his writing stems from his own personal experience and the experiences of those with whom he consults for research.Atlantis Found was an exhilarating ride, from one corner of the globe to the other. I found myself feeling chilled and frozen, along with Pitt and Giordino, as they crossed the Ross Ice Shelf on the Antarctic...and had to step outside into the hot summer sun of Arizona to warm up. Their exploits seem to know no boundaries, as they overcome endless situations that have the odds severely stacked against them. One wonders if these guys (Pitt &amp; Giordino) are human! They have bottomless sources of energy and determination; they always come out on top, regardless of how many opponents they face; they have a knack for always making the right choice when faced with the unknown.I love how Cussler always works himself into his books; this time, he shows up as &quot;Dad Cussler&quot;; Pitt &amp; Giordino, I think, by now should recognize Cussler whenever they meet him. With all their travels and wild adventures - they always seem to run into Cussler. Pitt &amp; Giordino are no slouches when it comes to remembering names &amp; faces - so why then, is it, that they vaguely recognize him, but can't figure out who the heck he is?Petty observations aside, Atlantis Found is a thrilling story, from start to finish. I love the way Cussler begins this novel, with a historical perspective that lays the foundation thread that weaves its way through the fabric of the book. I was fascinated by the idea that a culture like the Amenes might possibly have existed, and the treasures and knowledge that their society could reveal about our world today.I could not put this book down for three days (aside from the usual disturbances of life, that is). Definitely one of Cussler's best works to date!Peace Out."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"At first, I was thinking: &quot;A book about a diver? Yeah right!&quot; But I was wrong. Dead wrong! This is one of the best books I've EVER read! The plot keeps changing, and there is so much suspence! You can't put it down! If your a Cussler fan, you'll love it. And if your not, you'll get right into his books. The main star, Dirk Pitt, is witty and dangerous, but keeps you on the edge of your seat. You need to find &quot;Atlantis Found.&quot; (I know that's pretty lame.)"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Cussler really researched his ideas and then had a lot fun with this novel. I found it very entertaining all the way through. Written with action and implants of nervous humor, the villian and the plot almost seem possible even though it is very James Bondish in a &quot;world domination&quot; theme. The book is very readable, and entertaining. Well planned hero stuff. A very good read."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Sure, Atlantis Found is wordy, macho, 8th grade level reading, etc, but hey, it wasn't designed to be a literary masterpiece. All I know is that after a stressful workday nothing beats a tall cold one and a little mindless trip into a Cussler novel, and this one worked for me."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is another solid work but Cussler describing the adventures of Pitt and Giordino. In this book, Cussler does a pretty good job of fooling the reader with the grand scheme of the antagonist. The reader is led to believe a comet or asteroid is headed towards earth (like in the movie Armageddon) when in reality it is something different. It kept me wondering how the heroes were going to pull it off until the truth was revealed."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Strange artifacts and writings are found in a cave in Colorado that turn out to have a connection to more artifacts found on an eighteenth century ship trapped in the ice in Antarctica. Everyone who tries to explore these finds is killed or an attempt is made on their life. It all leads back to a German family living in South America who are descendant of the Nazis and have a grand scheme to build the 4th Empire.The pros for Atlantis Found are that it is a fast-paced action adventure that will hold your attention and keep your interest as the plot grows more and more absurd. There are also a lot of interesting historical facts and theories to help propel the story. The cons would be that its too long and sometimes gets bogged down by too much technical data about what kind of plane they are flying or weapon they are using. The biggest drawback is the awful dialogue. Mr. Cussler apparently leads an adventurous life and has a deep imagination for storytelling but he's not a great writer. None of the characters speak the way a normal person does and it just gets worse as the book progresses. Cussler also has a propensity for over-the-top metaphors.I enjoyed the book to a degree and wanted to keep reading to find out the full story, but it was a chore at times because of the poor writing."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Atlantis Found was a greatbook. It was full of twists and turns that keep you reading. In the story some billionaires are trying to continue another third riech! They have a dominant plan to flood the entire world.

Prepare for a great page turner in: Atlantis Found."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"great plot, action and characters weaved in with historical detail.This is no doubt the best cussler novel, alongside Iceberg, and he will never top it.

Wake up guys, its ain't meant to be serious lit, it's escapist fun and i had rather read cussler than some boring, pretentious, depressing lit book.lighten up guys, it's fiction. Just sit back and enjoy and stop looking too deep into things."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Atlantis Found ranks not only as one of the most enthralling adventures undertaken by the wisecracking Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino but as one of the greatest books I have read recently. The ingredients are formulaic, as with most of the Dirk Pitt novels, but in Atlantis Found the plot is constructed with trademark Cussler flair and punctuated by thrilling Pitt action/adventure.Yes, one could argue that similar plots have been used in his previous books, but Atlantis Found possesses a panache greatly lacking in today's action offerings.A classic Dirk Pitt novel and definitely one of the best."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"then you're just plain crazy...or snobbish? Look, if you're looking for well written deep character driven plots that reveal something about the human condition, you're in the wrong place.

Cussler has his faults (I, too, had to physically resist rolling my eyes when he turns out to be the minor character &quot;Dad&quot;), but he's certainly far better than his peers of the same genre like the once decent but now insufferable Tom Clancy, Michael &quot;Master of Banality&quot; Crichton or the absolutely horrid Grisham."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Atlantis Found is definatley one of my favorite Dirk Pitt Novels. I couldn't put it down after the first few chapters. Cussler is great at writing suspenseful and intriging novels. I have read all of his books and there is a new plot in each of them and all of the plots are very ingenius."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Usual Clive Clusser, plenty of action. The book was good, action-packed."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Atlantis Found written by Clive Cussler is a Dirk Pitt novel. This is the fifteenth in a series of action-adventure books that involve our hero Dirk Pitt against the bad guys.What Cussler does is weave in some truth with his fiction to make the fabric of the novel believable and this is no exception. Engaging from the start, this adventure is dramatic and involves some exotic locations. The concept of this book is that we are to find, or rather Dirk Pitt is to find Atlantis.Cussler follows his adventure formula to a &quot;T&quot; as he starts out in the past with a adventure that lead in to something that Pitt will find later in the book. As the clues and the excitement mount the bad guys try to get rid of Pitt, but Pitt has more bounce than a super ball. Pitt seems to find a way to foil the criminal element and use their weapons against them.Cussler has some intricate plotting and builds the suspense to a fever pitch as Pitt connects the clues and all of the incidences Cussler has put in the way. Of course there has to be some time limit till the whole world reaches Armageddon. And by the narrowist of margins you wonder if our hero can accomplish the task.Of course, Pitt has his best friend Al Giordino and the whole NUMA team for support making the odds more even. This is a very engaging story and will grab you as you are engrossed in the story till the end. The prose moves well as there aren't many dry spots, but the narrative is true Cussler till the end.As Pitt is a more mature in the book, we can feel his limitations in the writing making for a more believable good guy. As Pitt takes on the bad guys, wins the battle, the spoils go to Pitt and so does the girl.You'll find this book has dazziling suspense with an adventure/ mystery quality to it. The is a good read, intricately diabolical, sprinkled with mystery and spiced with just enough suspense."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I happened to accidently find this book while waiting at the airport. After a few pages, I was hooked! Since reading Atlantis Found, I've read 5 others of Cussler's books. So far Cyclops and Atlantis Found are my favorites."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"A new novel by Clive Cussler? Well then, I knew right where to look - the fiction section! Did I find it there? You bet! Was I disappointed by some less-than-perfect grammar and techno-isms? No way! You see, I read Cussler (along with Clancy, King, and others) for the sheer joy of escape. Yes, the characters and plot are all too familiar but this is precisely the reason I am drawn back to them, novel after novel (much like slipping into a pair of old favorite jeans). I have become used to the Cussler conventions (such as starting a story in the pre-historic, continuing another thread in the historic, and drawing them altogether in the present) and, quite simply, I like it - it works!Atlantis Found pulls together such diverse story lines (a comet, world-wide devastation, an old sailing vessel, Nazis, ice-caps, etc.) and weaves them into a wonderful escapist tapestry. To the vast majority of other readers out there I say, grab a copy of any Cussler material, sit back, and let the real world spin without you for a few fun-filled hours!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Well I've read every Clive Cussler book there is....and this one is pretty good. I was expecting something A LOT DIFFERENT but it was still very interesting. I thought the intro wasn't quite as good as some Pitt novels....and the overall story wasn't as gripping as some....but it was still good. Too bad Dirk is getting old......"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is my first time I read something to Clive Cussler. And I was amazed how he grabed my attention and kept my nose in his book, which I liked very much.The novel is very nice, full of adventure and mistry and once you finish a chapter, the writer makes sure that you will flip to the next one eagirly. I like this kind of books. Which reminds me of Michael Chrichton.I am looking forward to read his previous work, so enjoy the book!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"My hats off to Mr. Cussler, I have read all of his books and again he has led us through another exciting adventure with Dirk Pitt and all the other NUMA characters. I eagerly await another book with their further exploits."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This book marks a welcome return to stories like Sahara and Raise the Titanic which made us Clive Cussler readers in the first place. Yes, the story is over the top with Pitt winning at the end even more convincingly than James Bond ever did, but it is a heck of a lot of fun getting there. This is about as good a story as Cussler has written, it's just that readers are already familiar with NUMA's exploits - familiarity breeds raised expectations. Good villains built around the Wolf family which is presented like a goose stepping, pre-war version of the Osmonds. The main seismic disaster-about-to-happen was interesting as well. Has Mr. Cussler read the HAB Theory (a good read in itself) which has similar perils? Finally, I enjoyed reading about the high tech gear that Pitt and Co. employ, particularly the GPS and GIS mapping systems (someone's got to tell Pitt where the enemy is). There were some problems here and there but once the action got turned up the story was riveting. If you are buying this book to be entertained you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have read all Clive Cussler's books. The one true theme through all of his adventures in his Dirk Pitt novels and his true life stories, Is America needs a hero that is true to his country, his friends, and his belief in the American way. The books all have entertaining plots, and well defined characters. Even if you just picked up Atlantis Found for the first time, you would get a good read on all the other books. Dirk Pitt is an American hero, and we need more like him!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I picked this book up and could not put it down! What a blend of myth and adventure. Pairing our beloved Dirk and Atlantis was a stroke of pure genius. In the opening adventure sequence I found myself holding my breath just like the unfortunate three in the chamber. Only Dirk could make an entrance like that.Our favorite characters are all back and we realise how much we missed them. Al gets a girl of his own and Loren realises she might be missing something.The great classic car is a dream. Wouldn't we all love the chance to be behind the wheel?The bad guys are guys and girls that we really can hate with a vengence. The incredible odds just keep coming at our heroes and they never give up!All in all just what a Cussler book should be!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Mr. Clive Cussler does it once again! In Atlantis Found he continues his literary success in developing a very strong plot with many very interesting sub plots. The reader experinces the techno / political excitement of a great story written by a great story writer. With Dirk Pit, the main character, running the show, Clive Cussler make the reader feels that he or she is another partner just like Al Giordino to Dirk. In this book Clive does an excellent job of joining present day with the mythical past - Atlantis or Amenes, as it is called in the book, while taking the reader on a fantastic ride. This is a must adventure book to read. I can't wait for his next one. When will Hollywood take notice of this writer and screenplay this latest work and produce a movie. This book has all the makings of a very good, exciting movie. Maybe Steven Spielberg should do it! Read this book, you will enjoy it very much. Have a great day y'all!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This was my first Cussler novel. I had heard such great things about his books but I was sorely disappointed. Sure, the action was great. I love good action. However, the characters were so waaaaay over the top it became truly annoying. Dirk Pitt does everything so perfectly. He never makes mistakes. He is super-human and super-macho. The character is completely unbelievable. The book could have been great had the characters been more \\"down to earth\\"."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Where o where to begin with this horrid waste of ink and paper. God, and I am a Dirk Pitt fan, having read all the novels! If this is your first experience with a Dirk Pitt novel, I ask that you give him another chance and go read &quot;Raise the Titanic&quot; or &quot;Treasure&quot;, neither one has the mind numbing amount of inane dialogue and seemingly endless product placement (I thought they just did that in the movies). This book is the literary equivalent of The Mummy Returns, fast paced with no idea of how you got from point A, the beginning to point B, the end. Here is a list of flaws:1. Character Development-NONE2. Overly ridiculous plot3. Dialogue-dear god, there is no excuse for dialogue this bad, if Cussler was an unknown author, this would have been rejected by even a high school paper.There are probably more, but I think my IQ has dropped several points reading this book and I can't quite remember any more.For all you people who gave this book anything over 2 stars, apparently you have never read a good book and have no basis of reference in differentiating between a 'good' book and a 'bad' one."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Every time I read a Dirk Pitt adventure novel, I wonder to myself, &quot;How in the world is Clive Cussler going to top that in his next book? Read on. ATLANTIS FOUND is one of the best adventure novels I've ever read! Dirk and Al fans will be pleased!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I like all Clive Cussler books but this was one of the better books. It had a great plot and great summary. But, the best part of the book was the end when Giordino gets... I won't tell you. My opinion is Clive is retiring as a solo writer. You should read read it."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I became a fan of Clive Cussler and his hero Dirk Pitt after reading Raise the Titanic as a sophomore in high school. Through all the great adventures and near death experiences of the fictional Pitt, I have always had one question when I finished each new novel --- what will he do next. In Atlantis Found, Pitt and company tackle one of the great mysteries --- the lost continent of Atlantis. Along the way, Pitt travels to the Antartic while battling the next generation of Nazis determined to rule the world. As in past novels, Pitt uses his mind, a horde of gadgets and friends in his fight to save humanity. Where Cussler shines here is that he doesn't bring Pitt so close to Death's door that the suspension of disbelieve is shattered. Pitt is not getting old, he's just getting better --- like his collection of antiques."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I believe Dirk and Al could whip James Bond. Nobody tells a more plausible thriller than Cussler and this book is no exception. So well researched it is a pleasure to read. Although Dirk and Al have 99 lives - we revel in their adventures against the evil in the world. Read this book and keep 'em coming."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I believe Dirk and Al could whip James Bond.

Read this book and keep 'em coming."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Was elated to find my favorite author had written another book! And Dirk Pitt's back! Cussler's main character is getting older, like the rest of us, yet Cussler is keeping him fit and still ready to tackle the adventures we've grown to expect. It's another book I hate to put down and can't wait to pick up again. In writing my first book I've come to respect the quality of Cussler's work, the rivitting story line, and the word flow. Way to go, CC!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This latest entry in the Dirk Pitt franchise moves with the breakneck pace Cussler fans have come to know and appreciate. If you like your stories filled with action, battle scenes, gentle history, geography archeological theories, and rife with intrigue, this book is for you (though at times I thought I had strayed into a techie Rogue Warrior novel by mistake).Cussler likes action and keeps the plot simple; it's good versus evil. As in past titles in the series, Dirk again is pitted against a worldwide association of evil with tentacles stretching even into his beloved NUMA. This cartel, however, has roots in old Nazi Germany.The books takes you to many venues, among them a claustrophic cave sequence, a chilling south pole battle and the usual Washington haunts.The only reason I don't give this five stars, however, is the Hitchcockian habit Cussler has of injecting himself in the novel.The question that comes to me now is: What's next? How do you top finding Atlantis?"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is the best Cussler novel since &quot;Treasure&quot;! Dirk Pitt and the gang are back and clicking! Dirk and Al have their heroics but they don't come off as Supermen as they have in past adventures. My only negative is that Clive is continuing to insert himself in the novel which I have never liked. But I got over it. Clive's ability to connect the present with the past is once again ingenious!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"True, the readers who are used to Crichton's over-the-head scientific &quot;facts&quot;, and Grisham's law babble might find a lot of flaws with Cussler's writing, but for a Dirk Pitt fan, or anyone who has an imagination and wants to just forget his/herself for a while, this book is a lot of fun. If you still have problems with the book, my suggestion is to read a couple of the older ones (Deep Six, Treasure) till you find within yourself a devotion to Dirk Pitt and the crew. Then you might see the light. To Mr. Cussler: Don't let this one set you back! Keep writing them, and I'll keep buying them!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Pure enjoyment, just a fun book to read. Dirk Pitt fans are sure to love it, I can't wait for the next book."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is a great airplane book. Excellent diversion that keeps you hooked. The mental imagery is vivid and exact. Can't wait to see the movie."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I never grow weary of Dirk Pitt, or the cameos by Clive. It was my most anticipated Christmas present. Yes, I also caught the one typo (craved) but worse yet was the blatant contridictions on page 55 and 95. Having just become a certified diver this really stood out to me, unless there is something I am not understanding about dive suits. But no matter! Pure escape and entertainment which is why I read. However, I always thought Tom Selleck would have made a perfect Dirk Pitt and too bad none have been made into movies. However, James does corner the market on the silver screen and Clive Cussler would no doubt face considerable criticism trying to put Dirk on the big screen."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"It was wonderful watching the plot unfold, everything pieced together perfectly. This was my first Clive Cussler book and it has sure encouraged me to buy another one. Non - stop action combined with classic Hitchcock style writing will leave you hooked to every word."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Clive, you keep writing them, I will keep buying them. This ones not to shabby, information is too easily obtained and that 'Nano-Technology stuff' is too far advanced for a truly believable plot. Just please don't retire Dirk and Al! I read that Serpent novel and i just kept substituting Dirk and Al's names for those other 2 guys in my mind. I won't do that again though. This one just came out for Christmas and luckily i got it, I had just re-read Cyclops and Treasure (my 2 favorites) thinking that your next book would be too far off since Serpent. This book isn't your best, but it's much better than Shockwave (your absolute WORST!). Keep em coming Clive, Keep em coming.P.S. STOP! writing yourself into these things, I CANNOT stand that! If i wanna read about you I will pick up a copy of the SEA HUNTERS."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I just finished Atlantis Found and thoroughly enjoyed it. At times I found it difficult to get through, only because I wanted to find out what happened! I have read several Clive Cussler books and always enjoy the detail and history written in to the story line-Atlantis Found was no exception. A true candidate for a great movie."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I've read every CC novel and was excited to see a new one. I read it quickly, though it was long! It was highly suspenseful, well based on scientific fact and probability. It's a thinking person's adventure, full of stops to look on the maps included in the book, comparisions to larger maps to see the area as it really is - and allowing you to feel fully part of the adventure. I wonder if Admiral Byrd's Snow Cat is real? This is a definate high adventure keeper... Very enjoyable to escapism as well as broadening knowledge and a feeling that this could really happen!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I enjoyed this book better than some of the recent Dirk Pitt adventures. This was because I had gotten the impression that Clive Cussler was trying to up the body count and extravagant exploits of Dirk Pitt with each passing novel. In doing so, they were becoming unbelievable even for an action/adventure series. Although I enjoyed Dirk Pitt as a larger-than-life hero, I felt the increasing violence was getting old. However, with Atlantis Found, I felt the story to be more believable and tamer than, say, Sahara. Some felt the dispatch of the Wolf leadership to be too tame, but I felt it to be more like Dirk's old style: no more violence than necessary to protect life and limb, but justice properly served. THAT is what a hero does. As usual, the science involved was within the realm of believablity, and I learned something both historic and scientific I did not know. As a 20+ year Dirk Pitt fan, I felt this to be worthy of the series. I am glad I received this book for Christmas, and look forward to the next."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have read all of the Clive Cussler novels and unfortunately Atlantis Found brings nothing new to the series. The story starts very well but soon it falls into the well known formula of Dirk and Al beating all odds and most annoyingly, Dirk fighting off the blackness that is closing in on his vision. Still I am found enough of this series to enjoy the read but I wasn't fascinated by it. If you haven't read Cussler, get Raise the Titanic or Sahara before reading this one. Sahara being the best of the series largely because Cussler did not continue the same story line from chapter to chapter. Most chapters ended with a cliff hanger that wasn't answered right away, creating anxious and fast reading. Why Mr. Cussler abandoned this style escapes me."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have read all of Clive Cussler's books. They always get better. I hope that he's not going to retire Dirk and Al since they both were talking about marriage and their age in this book. The book kept my attention all the way. I'm looking forward to the next one. This book was a little harder to follow then some of Clive's earlier ones. However, the plot always keeps my attention. The detail given makes me imagine that I'm right there with them."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Dirk and Al do it again! I've followed every single one of their adventures and am proud to say that they are two marvelously fearless characters who I would follow anywhere.Cussler, while perhaps not sticking to the facts of earth's evolvement, has some grand description that is worth reading and even educational.It never ceases to amaze me how Cussler manages to take an event that happened hundreds, or in this case thousands, of years ago and weave it into a modern tale.This book is a wonderful read. It is exciting and contains the usual Dirk and Al wit. This is a perfect action yarn to read on a cold winter's day by a fire - or even on a sunny beach.Dirk and Al, once again, become embroiled in a conspiracy that might end life as we know it. Once again, Dirk and Al are victorious over evil. To know them is to love them.If you like intrigue, adventure, and an almost blase attitude toward danger - Cussler's Dirk and Al are for you. Read them all and you won't be dissapointed!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This was my first foray into the Dirk Pitt series - the result of a well-intentioned gift from a peer - and it will likely be my last. The best thing I can say is the book goes pretty quickly. The plot is mildly compelling in that B-movie/Saturday-serial sort of way, but Cussler appears to have an eigth-grader's grasp of plot development, dialogue, and the English language. The writing was so laughably bad in parts that I found myself reading entire passages aloud to friends and family, compelled to press on to the end for the certainty that there was worse (and therefore more entertaining) writing just ahead. How much worse could it get?! Plenty.Character development for Dirk Pitt largely consists of his recitation of print ads from Robb Report to prove he's an agent of dicriminating taste. There's enough product placement that I expected an order form in the back and a NASCAR-style book cover patched over with ads. Throughout the novel, Cussler's over-simplified and cliched characterizations are enough to make a WWF writer blush. Having read this book, Michael Crichton now seems like a genius.Needless to say, Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay must be chomping at the bit to make this clunker their next trashy summer blockbuster for the masses."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Never been moved to write a review in many years of reading, but this story is thrown together so carelessly, I found it hard to keep an eye on the plot because of all the sloppy contradictions."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I don't care what the other people have said about this book. Dirk Pitt is one of the most amazing heroes in any book today. Giordino is also one of the best. Clive Cussler hooks up with a great plot and endless suspense. A must for Clive Cussler fans. I not only recomend it, I support it 100%!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Dirk Pitt books are all fun airplane reading - lots of excitement, by the end of which Dirk and Al have saved the world. Same here. Somehow, though, while I can suspend disbelief pretty well for almost any science fiction and for James Bond, Cussler's work always seems to bring me to the brink of disappointing disbelief. And it always takes an effort to get past that. That is true for this book, in spades."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Let me make it easy for everyone. If you like Cussler you'll like this. If you've never read Cussler and your the guy who complains about the realism in an action movie you won't like it. It's suppossed to be fun, and that's all. Please don't take the english teacher's red pen to it."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have been a Cussler fan for years, which is hard to believe since I'm not that old myself. I think if you're looking for a great read and a grand adventure, this is a WONDERFUL book to pick up, especially if you're a Cussler fan. Like any good action movie or book, you need to read this to enjoy it - if you try and find errors and discrepencies throughout the storyline and plot, you won't enjoy yourself very much, will you? As far-fetched as a lot of Pitt's adventures seem to be (and this one goes right up there!), it's still grand and exciting. And these are characters you come to LOVE. As for me, I'm still cheering Dirk and Al on."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Atlantis Found is without a doubt the best Dirk Pitt adventure yet. This time Pitt is back with Al Giordino, Adm. Sandecker, and a host of others as they try to uncover the mystery behind a sealed chamber within a Colorado mountain. Filled with adventure and excitement, Atlantis Found is must-read for Pitt fans. Even if you've never read Cussler's stuff before, read this book! Great stuff."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I feel compelled to warn people that Atlantis Found is probably one of the worst books I've ever read. I've enjoyed other books by Cussler, and appreciated them for what they were. However, this is so poorly written I almost felt embarrassed for the guy. I would under no circumstances recommend this to anyone."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is the first Clive Cussler novel I have read, and found it a quick and entertaining read. I had to put aside a great deal of my own scientific background to suspend disbelief - there is, for instance, NO geologic evidence of a mass extinction on the scale described, 10,000 years ago. There was indeed a mass extinction that coincided with the end of the last Ice Age, but not like the devastation that wiped out the Dinosaurs. In the K/T event, nothing over 20 pounds survived. If the comet impact as described in this book was of a similar scale, and we are led from the text to believe it was, then again nothing over 20 pounds would have survived - which includes early humans, no matter how high up in the mountains they were living. Rapid crustal displacement is also a highly questionable theory, and is not needed to explain flash-frozen mammoths with fresh food still in their stomachs (the author's own description of weather in Antarctica would have had the same effect, with storms coming out of nowhere in an eyeblink). But that aside, I could \\"make believe\\" and get on with reading the story.The author would have done well with a sharp-eyed editor or a good writer's group, to catch all the odd wordings, missing details, and clunky sentence structure that peppers the novel, but that too is ignorable and doesn't get too much in my way of enjoying the book. The characters are shallow, but like in a good action film, they don't need to be deep. It's meant to be escapism. I did think that the doomsday scenario was averted rather too early and anticlimatically, a few chapters from the end of the book - the rest of which felt like an almost irrelevant tying up of loose ends. I must say I also didn't care so much for how *every* loose end was tied up - perhaps because I'm more accustomed to fiction in which the main \\"villain\\" lives to rise another day, or some other lingering threat still remains unresolved. However, some of the *big* questions remained completely unaddressed: the significance of the obsidian skulls, the warnings of the Amedes.All in all, though it was a satisfying large-scale story, I hoped the plot would focus more on \\"Atlantis Found\\" as promised in the title - but we only got a passing glimpse of the lost city. I did think it was clever how the author inserted himself into the story in a brief cameo, and had a couple of inside-joke exchanges with his main characters. That was probably the most memorable part of the book to me."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is easily my favorite novel of all time.Now, that tends to be a hefty statement, so let me explain:This was the very first Clive Cussler novel I'd ever read. In fact, it was the first 'adult' novel I'd ever read. I'd dabbled with the classics like Tom Sawyer and 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea, but this was my gateway into contemporary. And after the prologue I was hooked.Not only was this book the gateway drug that's lead to me reading every single novel Cussler ever put into print (as well as branching off into everything written by Jack DuBrul and Craig Dirgo, who sometimes co-authored with Cussler) but it got me hooked on the need to read every book I could get my hands on.Even though Harry Potter is the primary cause of inspiring reading in most people my age, I didn't start that series until AFTER this book lit a fire under my ass. And I doubt there's any other reason I would have slugged through The Lord of the Rings in its entirety.As to the story itself: I found it to be solid and well-written, one of the last great pieces Mr. Cussler gave us before so many of his latest novels found themselves on the receiving end of unfavorable reviews.But in all honesty, there's little else I can say while trying to explain my love of this novel. Someone may call it the worst piece of trash ever written, but it will always and forever hold the title of my all-time favorite book.Despite some of Clive's recent faults and hit-or-misses, I can personally attest to his having changed at least ONE life by converting what is sure to be a lifelong reader.I'd like to think of that as something for an author to be proud of."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I'll admit it: Clive Cussler is my favorite guilty pleasure. Dirk Pitt is definately the Bond of the new century: cool, sophisticated but also caring and sensitive. This latest went with me on a skin diving trip and it it did not disappoint: cool breezes, sandy beaches, cold beer and Clive Cussler."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Interesting reading. Although I was caught up by the action, what really hooked me was the opening pages describing the comets approach and impact. The rest of the book (99%) was OK. I found the main character/s to be a bit improbable. Dirk's abilities out James Bond to shame."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Another hit for Cussler. And once again our hero, Dirk Pitt, saves the day. But it looks like he may be losing his cohort and life long pal, Al Giordino. Let's hope Clive doesn't keep us waiting too long to find out!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"If you've read Mr. Cussler's previous Dirk Pitt novels this one is very similar, kind of far out and sort of implausible but very entertaining. I've noticed in the last few books Cussler includes himself, sort of, as a character, he does it in this one too. You will also find the heroes getting wounded several times but still managing against all odds to save the day.My only real complaint is that this story seems to ignore the discovery of the Alexandria Library (surely it would've had something about the Amenes)In the end Al tells Dirk they're getting too old for this and need to quit. I think I agree, it is time for retirement."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is the first Clive Cussler book I've read, and looking at the reviews, it seems as though maybe I should give him another chance.I actually liked the plot and ideas behind Atlantis Found, however, I had a hard time getting &quot;lost&quot; in the book, as I love to do, because of the grade school level of writing! Also, I found the Pitt character to be such a cliche of a hero that I was hoping the bad guys would win just so there would be some sort of surprise.Even though I've given it only one star, I would recommend this book in one instance - as an assignment for someone learning English. The plot is interesting enough for an adult, while the English is simple enough for an intermediate learner to follow along. If I was still teaching ESL (English as a Second Language) I would definitely use this book in my class."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Typical story of Dirk and Al's adventures. Always enjoyed his books. Have read every Dirk Pitt tale that has been published. Clive is definitely trying to close the chapter on Dirk and Al. The ending was a surprise to me. Looks like there is room for one more though."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Glad to see that clive Cussler is back on track after the rather mediocre 'Shockwave' and 'Flood Tide'. This book, although undoubtably formulaic (How many times is Dirk Pitt going to career through the streets of Washington? '), is awesome. The relationship between Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino just keeps getting better and better - the one-liners between the pair are easily worth the purchase price. However, a revelation at the end might shock purist fans of Al Giordino, but I don't want to give too much of the plot away...."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have always enjoyed Cussler's Dirk Pitt series. But, Atlantis Found disappointed me. The novel starts off in typical Cussler fashion, with a great premise, good background facts, and typical Dirk Pitt adventure. But, then, the climax and ending trail off, in an incomplete and unresolved manner. For example, Cussler tells us that there is a spy at NUMA (possibly Admiral Sandecker's secretary, Julie Wolff?), but there is no follow-up, and we never find out who it is. The significance of the magnificent obsedian skulls is never explained. The clues regarding the Nazi connection are thrown together in an uncharacteristically sloppy way. I was disappointed because Cussler is capable of better organization. I hope the next one is better (I'm sure it will be)."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This was the first Dirk Pitt novel i've read, and I found it to be a great book. It was filled with action and adventure. I seemed to not be able to put this book down until i finished it. My only complaint was that there was too much detail about brands of items in the story, I don't think anyone honestly cares why Dirk chose to use one brand of scuba tank over another. All in all, it was a fantastic story."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It is my first C.Cussler book. These stories were once described to me as &quot;The Hardy Boys all grown up.&quot; Perhaps this is true - the story included history, science, adventure, science fiction and all the action you can handle. Fast and fun reading. A great escape from the humdrum. Easy reading-fun and fast."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I hadn't read any Cussler, let alone any Dirk Pitt novels before. This one caught my attention because the Atlantis theme coincides with my interest in humankind's prehistory.Fairly early on though I decided I would need to set my disbelief to one side and just go with the flow if I wanted to derive any enjoyment from this book. Anthropologists will surely hurl this pot boiler across the room and issue indignant snorts at the notion that almost the entire human race was wiped out in 7,000 B.C. Furthermore, during the denouement, the tactics employed to thwart the villains are somewhat farcical when a simpler solution is staring us in the face!But Cussler never intended to give us an accurate history lesson, and let's get onto the plot! This is a rollicking adventure where our rugged and handsome hero knocks the preverbial out of sinister foreigners with funny accents and discovers the lost continent of Atlantis, almost without breaking sweat. Dirk Pitt is definitely up there with Indiana Jones and James Bond and probably hasn't got far to go to give Superman a run for his money. He's the kind of mega-tough guy who, if his lungs start to hurt, he spits them out and gets on with saving civilisation as we know it. He always has a witty line in repartee on his tongue too, and don't the ladies just lap it up! In real life he would probably come over as Leisure Suit Larry's more dangerous brother and would be regarded as rather corny by any streetwise modern woman. The womem in Dirk Pitt's world however are invariably beautiful and frequently in need of rescue by our invincible square-jawed hero, which, of course, he invariably accomplishes in the nick of time.But enough irony and nitpicking! The action (and boy, is there plenty of that!) is very competently described and I defy anyone not to devour this hefty tome (500+ pages) in a flurry of undemanding but enjoyable page turning. I swear you will shiver as Cussler depicts the numbing effects of wind-chill on our hero!So, classic literature this ain't, but I enjoyed it all the same and have no regrets about buying my first ticket into the rather simplistic but pretty damn entertaining world of Dirk Pitt."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Dirk Pitt you are very annoying. I love James Bond, and i love Indiana Jones even more. But Dirk Pitt, you are neither. Your toys, interests and looks are overly cliched. I'm afraid you just bother me. This novel offered an interesting insight to this lost city, but it is hard to figure out what is fact and what is fiction. The story is quite outlandish. One thing i did appreciate about this novel was the answer to &quot;why good guys' bullets hit, and bad guys' miss?&quot; The answer...good guys aim."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Clive Cussler writes bestsellers. I'm not sure how!The storyline in Atlantis Found is far-fetched. Great - no problem there. The writer's job is to get the reader to suspend belief and, so far as ANY storyline is concerned, I can suspend belief when the writing allows me to (I love the Harry Potter books, for example). Unfortunately, Cussler's writing often falls well below standard, dropping at times into the abysmal. This is why I can't understand why his books are bestsellers.Throughout Atlantis Found, my enjoyment was spoilt by badly phrased sentences, poor grammar and, even worse, large chunks of explanation passed off as dialogue. If you read through some of the dialogues and try to imagine two people actually speaking, you'll see what I mean. And, as far as clich&eacute; goes, what about the old guy on the ice towards the end? &quot;Hello, my name's Clive Cussler.&quot; That's a surefire way to draw the reader's attention away from the plot.It seems to me that Cussler has the ability to dream up good plots, but not the ability to write them down. Maybe he should employ a ghost writer."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I normally like Cussler, but this just seemed to be a similiar theme from an author that was tired of his characters - I got the feeling right from the start that it would be the last one in the series. It was a shame because it could have been so much better - there were plenty of noticeable inconsistences - not something I had seen before in his previous books. Never mind - maybe Cussler should invent some new characters, and move away from the global disaster theme! Lets face it - if it wasn't for the fact that the Bond stories are films (special effects, bond girls, corny lines, etc) then we wouldn't be interested in story number 12 (or whatever!). I suppose my point is is that it is time to leave Al and Dirk to their homemaking and scuba diving, and find another HERO!!!See yA!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This book got off on a strong beginning, lots of details in the middle, and then a weak and disappointing ending."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I LOVED this book. Of course, I love all Dirk Pitt adventures. But, I was REALLY into this one. Hope there will be another D.P. adventure from Cussler soon...."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I am a huge fan of fictional literature and &quot;Atlantis Found&quot; is now at the top of my list. It sits on my bookshelf next to other great books such as &quot;Ender's Game,&quot; &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; and the &quot;Rama&quot; series. While the story lacked some in-depth character development I thought the suspense and dramatic cliffhangers made it worthy of a 5-star recommendation. Excellent work Mr. Cussler!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Clive cusssler - You are Still and always be one of the best fiction writers of our time! If not the best ! I have all 14 of your books and your are 2nd to NONE !"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Clive Cussler has done it again! His latest book, &quot;Atlantis Found&quot; has the crew back together again. Dirk, Al, Rudy, Admiral Sandecker and the others work together to solve this latest mystery of ships frozen in time, black skulls carved out of obsidian scattered all over the world and the fiends out to cause mass destruction. In his usual way of having you on the edge of your chair and gulping a deep breath because you didn't know that you were holding it, Mr. Cussler brings everything together in a clear, educational, entertaining manner. The word play between the main characters makes you laugh out loud as you have come to know the characters from previous books and know the continuing harassment covers true friendships. Mr. Cussler's books always have you wondering when he is going to pop up as one of the characters himself. This book will not disappoint a true Clive Cussler fan. He is the best!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Having read the exploits of Dirk Pitt for over 20 years, I found the last few novels lacking in excitement. But Cussler is back in great form, and I enjoyed Atlantis Found a lot. Good story, plot moves along, and Al Giordino gets a life -- who could want more?"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"&quot;Atlantis Found&quot; is Clive Cussler's best work since the terrific &quot;Sahara&quot; came out in 1992. The plot is one of his best, the action is non-stop and there are also several pleasant surprises in the book that will make you smile when you're not rooting for the dynamic duo of Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino.I had enjoyed his most recent novels (&quot;Flood Tide&quot;, &quot;Shock Wave&quot; and &quot;Inca Gold&quot;) but they didn't grab me like his previous novels. But &quot;Atlantis Found&quot; leaves no doubt that the &quot;Grandmaster of Adventure&quot; hasn't lost his touch at the keyboard. A rip-roaring read!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Mr. Cussler's books are great escapist fiction. His newest, \\"Atlantis Found\\", I believe is one of the better tales he has told. The other enjoyment that comes with a Cussler novel is watching the professional critics try to trash his work. They don't get it, but as these novels routinely make the best-seller lists, we the readers do. The critics do get it, but they prefer books that get the literary equivalent of an Academy Award, while Mr. Cussler takes home The People's Choice Award.\\"Atlantis Found\\" is way over the top, fantastic in what is spread on its' 534 pages, and most importantly fun, and a great read. Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino are a combination of, Indiana Jones, James Bond, The Saint, the members of the old and new Mission Impossible teams, and a dash of The Duke John Wayne leading the cavalry. Sure the book has its clich&eacute;'s, but does not every Bond film as well? Mr. Cussler gives his readers what they enjoy, and what may be one person's clich&eacute;, is another's cue that he or she is about to embark on an adventure with old friends. If you read Mr. Cussler you have probably read well into this latest work, and if you are not yet amongst his readers, \\"Atlantis Found\\", is a good place to start."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I'm sorry to say but I am disappointed in Atlantis Found. Cussler is known for his brilliant plot twists and his ability to weave unrelated ideas into a suspenseful journey through a modern day treasure hunt. Inca Gold for example is one of Cussler's finest works of literature. He combines the death of two unrelated heroes and the idea that the Earth will be destroyed by a deadly microbe. The final outcome is both suspenseful and energetic. You would expect his strengths to only get stronger, but Cussler seems to have lost some of his creative genius. Atlantis found has virtually no plot twists or in-depth characters. We see none of see none of Pitt's legendary ability to pick up any woman he wants. Each character is only summarily described with no emphasis placed on their strengths or ability's. I recommend you read this book, but a library is a much better place to get it. This is one of the few Cussler books that when you put it down at the end, you may never want to pick up again."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Clive Cussler does it once again - he has written yet another Dirk Pitt adventure worthy of a place in classic popular literature! This time Dirk Pitt, Al Girodino and assorted colleagues discover the artifacts from an ancient civilisation which was wiped out by a comet hitting the Earth in 7120 BC. This part forms a fantastic prologue. Then we move to 1858 AD, where a British galleon is found in the Antarctic ice filled with treasures from a distant age . . . then in 2001, Dirk is back! What is the significance of a mysterious German billionaire and his family holding Nazi treasures? When he learns that such family, the Wolfs, are responsible for trapping them in a Colorado mine and covering up the evidence to stop others seeing the artifacts, Dirk once again uncovers more than expected - a villian more diabolical than any other he has encountered! When I read what the bad guy's ultimate aim was, it was pure James Bond material, of course, but it didn't stop my enjoyment of the book. Clive Cussler is the master of escapism. The prose is simple to follow without too much in the way of technobabble, the pacing is fast and consistent and the story is surprisingly believeable at times. And the ending was both a surprise in itself and very amusing! We also meet a certain character called Clive Cussler during the second half. 'His name sounds vaguely familiar,' says Dirk Pitt in the narrative. I don't know why people dislike Clive writing himself into the story, I think it's great fun myself. But this book ranks as one of Cussler's finest moments, along with SAHARA, DRAGON, NIGHT PROBE and TREASURE. Don't miss this one!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"The geological descriptions, mirroring those of the catastrophic meteor impact at Chicxulub off the North coast of Yucatan implicated in the extinction of the dinosaurs, caught my attention with the first page of Atlantis Found and kept me reading to the end. Although I really don't care for the Dirk Pitt persona-he seems too much of a comic book character-I did enjoy the pace and shear adventure of the tale. It is certainly very imaginative.Like the Bond series, every woman is a beauty of one type or another, every bad guy (or gal) is totally reprehensible, their demise justly deserved, and every \\"good guy\\" from 8 to 80 exhibits intelligence, fortitude, cavalier indifference in the face of physical danger, and the comic repertoire of a Bill Cosby. Each one is a hero at whichever of the different stages of the male life cycle he may be. If middle aged fathers have fantasies, they are undoubtedly of exploits similar to the Dirk Pitt series: their hair \\"maturely\\" greying at the temples, their muscles aching but undaunted by their travails, and just their very life experience able to outwit even the most brilliant of the bad guys. (Too bad, though, that we don't give the guys in our lives the credit they are very much due for reading us to sleep as children, helping us with math problems as adolescents, and forgiving us our arrogance as young adults, and for the very much braver task of being there day after day when they might possibly have realized more of their own dreams instead!)I was glad for once to find the oft repeated Atlantis story told in a more light hearted vein. I've studied ancient history, including early Greek history, and have come across the persistent modern belief in Atlantis often enough to cringe when I meet it again. The author's treatment certainly made it much more fun to contemplate. Like some of those mainstream geologists mentioned by Cussler in the book, whose stodgy concepts of earth science forbade them to believe in a continent that sank beneath the sea, I too am skeptical. But then I've studied geology extensively, too. Continents are really too light to sink. They float. Not on water, but on the much denser but more plastic magma that lies beneath them. Cussler's concept of a transgressing sea is almost the only way that Atlantis might be considered remotely possible. (Though I too believe that the Greek island of Santorini, ancient Thera, is a more likely candidate.)Although a little pedantic, the information that the scientists in the book provide Pitt about history, geology, astronomy, and anthropology is, for the most part, quite accurate. The reader gets to learn a little bit about these subjects along with the adventure (and just might develop a new interest, following up on one of them). Cussler's own background in underwater archaeology (he participated in the search for the CSS Hunley, the world's first successful submarine lost during the Civil War) and in deep sea diving make the oceanographic descriptions and the underwater exploits of his characters seem more real. Certainly his widely traveled life has given him a talent for describing the details of the world's different cities, landscapes and cultures. The pacing of the story is superb. One hardly has a chance to get in sync with any one adventure before the heros are off chasing the bad guys again in some other part of the world. I particularly enjoyed the descriptions and adventures in the gold mines of Colorado, and the description of the Opera House in Buenos Aires.Enjoyable too is the fact that the book does not take itself seriously enough to try to place itself in any \\"real\\" time. The President is a fictional character. Technology that for us is just beyond the horizon and therefore familiar only as buzz words (nanotechnology) is in the present tense for Pitt and his peers. That leaves the door wide open for the author to let ancient Atlantis and its artifacts survive the end of the story. Unlike similar stories where all traces of the discovery must be \\"lost\\" to keep the story \\"true\\" to our times, Cussler lets the reader glory in the relicts of the ancient city preserved beneath the ice. We get to imagine the treasures as existing for our enjoyment, not forever lost. Much more satisfying.The book presents itself as good fantasy fiction of a particularly masculine variety."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Okay, I'm admitting it up front-- I am addicted to Clive Cussler and have been since I was ten. I've read every Dirk Pitt book and, for awhile, I wanted to grow up to be just like him (at least I think I've given that up).I know going in that Cussler has developed a formula for his books that he doesn't deviate from. (Give Clive some credit, however-- it's got to be hard to come up with an original way to destroy the world every two years!) There will be a car chase in a classic automobile. There will be some megarich arch villian who wants to kill many people for personal profit. There will be a situation in which there is no way the woman will survive, yet Dirk manages to save her anyway. (You just knew that there'd be a cave-in and Dirk would come to the rescue, didn't you?) You will get the exact same descriptions of all the reoccurring characters that were in the previous books. I accept this because, like I said, I am addicted and Dirk and Al are fun, which is ultimately what brings me back (not to give anything away, but Dirk's actions at the end of the book are classic). After all, fiction is supposed to be entertaining.While &quot;Atlantis Found&quot; is better than the stuff Clive put out in the late 1980's (sorry, but &quot;Sahara&quot; was terrible), it still falls short of his early works. Remember when the historic event of the prelogue was somewhat of a mystery and actually became an important part of the plot? Not in this book.But if you're a Cussler veteran, you've come to expect this and will enjoy the book nonetheless. And if your new to Cussler's books, you won't care about any of this. Just make sure you also pick up a copy of &quot;Raise the Titanic,&quot; &quot;Night Probe!&quot; or &quot;Vixon 03&quot; to make sure you really get a sense of this author's mastery.One last thing-- Clive, STOP WRITING YOURSELF INTO THE BOOK! It's unbecoming."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I am only disappointed when they end. I read so quickly through them that I then regret reading them so fast.

They are great entertainment. Even when Dirk and Al make escapes more improbable than James Bond or Rambo, they do it in such style that avid readers like me let it slide -- and even enjoy it.However, a theme developed in your newest book posits an improbability that I can't quite get past...In your book, Atlantis Found, your character, Dr. Friend, describes the Ross ice shelf as the largest body of floating ice in the world. The premise of the book is that movement of this ice would cause an imbalance or increased wobble in the rotation of the Earth, triggering a cataclysmic polar shift.Here's what's bugging me... My dad, an old sea-dog told me as a very young boy that a floating object displaces its exact weight in whatever medium w/in which it is floating -- in this case, water. So, if the Ross Ice shelf were to move, the water displaced in its new location would weigh the same as the Ross Ice shelf, and the water that rushed in to fill the position formerly occupied by the ice shelf would weigh just the same as the ice shelf.The only reason floating ice is larger in volume than the water it displaces is that the ice is crystalline and has a lower density.In short, no net weight shift would take place at all. Things would be different if the ice fell from land into the sea.So, either my dad was wrong, or you are. Or perhaps your point is that Nazis are just stupid people..."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Cussler fans rejoice! Atlantis Found is Awesome! Clive Cussler's latest thriller will not disappoint the legion of fans worldwide who have been waiting two long years for a Dirk Pitt novel. Along with the classic Dirk entrances, fans will be surprised and pleased that Dirk's long time leading lady,Loren Smith, takes an active roll in the plot. Many suprises are in store for our heros as they battle the odds to save the world from a destruction beyond comprehension. Be prepared to spend a few sleepless nights reading Atlantis Found.

Obviously the so-called 'professional' reviewers have little idea of what constitutes a 'good' book written by the 'Grand Master of Adventure'. If you are a fan of Clive Cussler, GET THIS BOOK. Is it a dramatic departure from the writing style he has done in the past? Nope. In fact his style seems exactly the same, but like a fine Bond movie, we keep coming back for more to see what kinds of adventures Dirk and Company can get into next--and still escape from-- while managing to save the world at the same time. My hats off to Clive for a great tale told in fine form. If you fancy yourself a pure Pitt fan, don't deny your addiction...give IN and BUY THIS BOOK. By the end you will have staved off the nights of obsession just trying to wait until the paperback edition, and whetted your appetite for more, and you just might re- read some older Pitt adventures, just for fun. Reading the stories of Dirk Pitt is like re-joining a dream you awoke from that you didn't want to. Enjoy and thank me later."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Dirk Pitt, special projects director for the U.S. National Underwater and Marine Agency (NUMA), is a James Bond-type character who is involved in perilous activities on an almost daily basis, but seems to escape relatively unscathed with aplomb and finesse. His best friend and sidekick, Al Giordino, is an equally colorful character.The action begins in the abandoned Paradise Mine in Colorado, where Pitt and Giordino become involved in the dramatic rescue of a scientist after the tunnel collapses and floods when she in brought in to analyze some ancient hieroglyphs in an underground cavern. It soon becomes obvious that the tunnels were sabotaged by some evil murderers who didn't want anyone to know of the existence of the ancient cavern.Pitt and Giordino determine that their pursuers are hired killers employed by the Fourth Empire, which is a militant group involved in advancing Hitler's evil reign of 50 years ago. The plot becomes very complicated, moving from one continent to another. Hugo Wolf and his perfectly cloned family are the designated leaders of the Fourth Empire and are ruthless in their pursuit of world domination. Their vast wealth seems to be a result of the many purloined art treasures stolen by the Nazi's during the war.Pitt uncovers Wolf's plot to cause a cataclysmic worldwide flood that would destroy all civilizations, except for those that have been designated to live on several floating cities designed to withstand the flood and sustain life for many years until the floods recede. Pitt and Giordino make a heroic death-defying attempt to thwart the plans of the evil Fourth Empire.Atlantis Found is filled with complex, high-tech, non-stop action, although at times it veers into fantasy and is too unrealistic to be believable. Pitt's relationship with Loren, his long-term romantic interest, as well as Giordino's blooming romance with the rescued scientist, Pat O'Connell, provide some relief from the frantic, non-stop action."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Like most of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt series, \\"Atlantis Found\\" involves a wildly intricate plot that ties together disasters from the past with imminent catastrophe in the present. In this case, one of the disasters in the past was a comet that struck the Earth about 9000 years ago, causing massive tidal waves and shifting of the continents. Unfortunately for us, the comet had a twin that missed at that time, but that was predicted to come back . . . 9000 years later. Throw in neo-Nazis, nanotechnology, and the remains of an Atlantis-like civilization, and you have the latest Pitt adventure.Prior to \\"Deep Six,\\" Cussler wrote fairly realistic adventure novels -- \\"Raise the Titanic!\\" was as much about the engineering feat of lifting the Titanic from its resting place as it was about an adventure to find an incredibly rare and potent crystal. But starting with \\"Deep Six,\\" Cussler began weaving more and more science fiction/science fantasy into his book: mind control, lunar colonies, artificial intelligence, and so on. \\"Atlantis Found\\" is probably an extreme even for Cussler, and as it turns out the science/fantasy part is the weakest element. To begin with, the comet strike in 7000 BC just is too hard to swallow. Supposedly it wipes out 99 percent of animals and humans through floods and climate changes. But nothing like that remotely happened in real life -- sure, woolly mammoths and sabre-tooth tigers died out, but there's no mass extinction as one would expect.Besides the influx of science fiction, \\"Atlantis Found\\" continues other trends of Cussler's more recent novels: the appearance of numerous recurring characters (Perlmutter, the maritime history expert/gourmand; Congresswoman Smith, Pitt's on-off love interest; more abuse heaped on Rudi Gunn, the second in command of the fictional Nat'l Underwater and Maritime Agency; Yaeger, the computer expert), as well as yet another deus ex machina by the author himself, who has appeared in a number of adventures as an \\"old\\" and \\"grizzled\\" character, sometimes a prospector, sometimes a bartender, etc. It's actually quite bizarre and I'm not sure what to make of it.In the end, this is more of what you can expect from Cussler. I stayed up until 2 in the morning to finish it."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Clive Cussler is an amazing writer with an amazing character, but his plots are getting repetitive and his stories are getting old. He deals in adventure and intrigue, and is making his plots more complex with each book. Gone is the good old days of the quick, pulse pounding adventure of his earlier books (Night Probe, Pacific Vortex and The Mediterranean caper). In thier place are cumbersome and exhausting books with more depth than adventure.Don't get me wrong, this book is still a great read, but the same story could be told with a hundred or so fewer pages by removing some of the plot thickeners Cussler is so fond of adding these last few years."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"The 15th installment of Dirk Pitt has 'borrowed' the Atlantis underneath the Antartic theory to spectacular effect. Thrown in with several superships, the villains, beautiful women and plenty of undersea escapades with Al Giordino this is a great addition to the series.The best thing about the latest novels is you simply have to read them in one go.

I read this book a few month's ago and was surprised at how good it actually was. The ones i had read before it were good but not the best boooks i had ever read. Espeacially &quot;raise the titianic&quot; which really made me have to theink about buying the next one. But when i had barely even gotten into the book the adventure started to begin. I thought it was amazing. Three poeple had to be saved from a flooding cave and guess who was able to get there in time to save the day. Well it was pitt. Also in this book i got to see Rudi Gunn actually help out in a fight when he and Al Giorodino were searching an island when Pitt was somwhere on the other end of the world. They did not have much of a way to fight back but Gunn's master plan saved the day. The showdown was amazing and i could hardly put the book down and grumbled every time i had to. Plus there is another appearnce of Cussler. I admit it is very stupid how he has started to show up in every book lately but who cares. I though it was Hilarious in Dragon when pitt raced cussler and ithought it was prett funny that Cussler just happened to be at Antartica at the same time as pitt and that they just happened to come upon each other. Well i really don't care to much for the fine details as long as it could make the slightest bit of sense no matter how bizzare or unlikely it could be. As long as you are not totally hung up on everthing being completly realistic yuo will love this book."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"The only way I could finish this colossal waste of time was to skim the final 200 pages. It have the worst dialogue I have ever read in print, including stories written by my children. The plot, the hero, and everything about the book are extremely juvenile. Here's my advice if somebody gives you a copy of &quot;Atlantis Found&quot;: throw it back at him."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I must admit to being a bit biased in favor of Dirk Pitt, having read a lot of his more famous adventures. Therefore, there's no way I could think too ill of a new Clive Cussler novel. The Indiana Jones of literature is still up to his usual world-saving heroics, and even happens to be battling Nazis this time.Now, for all those people that criticize Cussler for putting in unrealistic plot elements, please take a look at the spine of one of these books. This is adventure, not science fiction. It doesn't need to have a foundation in proof or theory. Nevertheless, Cussler does an admirable job of making this one a reasonably believable story. In fact, I would say he tried TOO hard to establish a factual foundation, perhaps at the cost of some good old swashbuckling action. Atlantis Found had a lack of the famed 'Dirk Pitt blasts in and rescues hot women' scenario that is oddly prevalent in the most popular Pitt novels. I only counted two such rescues here, where Sahara was essentially full of them. The usual Machiavellian plot was in place, with a pretty sinister set of crooks, but I don't think Karl Wolf measured up to his evil equivalents in the older novels.Aside from the worldwide cataclysm, et. al. perhaps the thing that really surprised me was a hint of a certain romantic arrangement that I won't blow here. Read and find out for yourself, but let's just say that some people (Bond, Jones, you know the type) just can't conceivably end up that way. I think Dirk Pitt definitely falls into the same category."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Hidden chambers with indecipherable inscriptions and exquisite artifacts from a long-lost civilization add wonderful elements of science fiction to this mystery thriller. &quot;Atlantis Found&quot; makes for perfect escapist reading with plenty of action and espionage and charmingly stereotypical heroes and villians."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Cussler has written an interesting addition to the Dirk Pitt saga, but I wish he would stop writting himself into minor roles in the story. The first couple of times, it was interesting, now it seems like an ego issue.Dirk and Al find themselves in another thriller, facing a ruthless family of &quot;Aryan&quot; types who have the blood of Hitler in them. The Wolf family is dangerous and bent upon changing the world to their sense of a &quot;perfect world&quot;. Pitt and friends encounter murderers, plenty of narrow escapes, exotic locations, ancient secrets from a lost race, beautiful women, mercenaires along their path to lost Atlantis. Add in generous portions of shoot outs, German U-boats lurking among the ice flows, gigantic ocean liners, the &quot;Holy Lance&quot; that speared Christ, a huge comet, Hitler's ashes, a mad battle under the Antartic between SEALs, Marines, Delta Force troops and mercenaries and you have the latest Pitt adventure.Good stuff for a long rainy weekend. Has potential for the films Cussler signed up for, if done correctly. Over all a fun read, leave reality after the first page and go for it."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"As Cussler is one of my favorite authors, I eagerly awaited the release of his latest Dirk Pitt thriller. I enjoyed being reintroduced to the familiar cast of characters. The plot moved along briskly as usual but there was a noticeable lack of suspense. The conclusion lacked a great deal of excitement and left me with a &quot;is that all there is&quot; feeling. I only hope that Cussler isn't getting bored with characters. I still think Sahara was his best."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Thank goodness Dirk Pit is back, we all missed him. Once again Clive Cussler has woven an almost believable tale with just enough historical supposition to add to the realism, and to keep the reader enthralled. The new Cussler reader should be warned that once you read one of his books, you will soon be looking for all the Dirk Pitt novels. Those of us who love these stories can't wait for the next book in the series to go to press. Mr. Cussler, thanks for a great read."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Having read all his books, this one falls a bit short, but is none the less a fun read. If you have the time to get through 540 pages this holiday...it won't be time wasted."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I own every one of Clive Cussler's books. I enjoy reading them again and again. I picked up Atlantis Found on a Friday evening. I could not put it down! I finished it Saturday afternoon. Cussler develops his characters to their fullest. He weaves the storyline so that you never know what will happen next. I did not think that Cussler could get any better--I was wrong. The paths he allows the personal lives of Dirk and Al to take are ones that TRUE Dirk Pitt adventure fans have been waiting for. Cussler's storylines have always been such that the reader wonders &quot;Could this have really happened this way?&quot; With Atlantis Found, Cussler has surpassed his prior books with believability. I am still wondering if what he described is possible. Atlantis Found is truly Clive Cussler at his best. I can't wait for the next book."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I'm sorry to say but I am disappointed in Atlantis Found. Cussler is known for his brilliant plot twists and his ability to weave unrelated ideas into a suspenseful journey through a modern day treasure hunt. Inca Gold for example is one of Cussler's finest works of literature. He combines the death of two unrelated heroes and the idea that the Earth will be destroyed by a deadly microbe. The final outcome is both suspenseful and energetic. You would expect his strengths to only get stronger, but Cussler seems to have lost some of his creative genius. Atlantis found has virtually no plot twists or in-depth characters. We see none of see none of Pitt's legendary ability to pick up any woman he wants. Each character is only summarily described with no emphasis placed on their strengths or ability's. I recommend you read this book, but a library is a much better place to get it. This is one of the few Cussler books that when you put it down at the end, you may never want to pick up again."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"As usual Dirk Pitt and his friends save the country, but it is his adventures that make the story. Dirk Pitt may be bigger than life, however he is the man dreams are made of. Life and messages of other characters are not what to look for in reading unless it is history. Dirk Pitt takes the mind away and along with him on his adventures. The stories are plausable and take a true or unproven source and it becomes reality. Atlantis has always been a mystery and whether it is true or not has never been proved. Dirk's discovery of the lost continent seems almost real. Mr. Cussler's habit of putting himself as a character in the book makes the story more believable. To escape the problems of the world around us I find Dirk is the best person to be with."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This book was a great disappointment. The story line is completely rediculous. I only finished reading it, because I wanted to know if it would get any better, but alas it didn't. I use this book as an example for a bad book, if somebody asks me.plot - I guess Dirk is a superhero, he dodges every attack story line - can it get any more stereotyped?Never Clive for me again."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Honestly, it didn't start out bad, (If you don't mind egotistical, macho, womanizing, alpha-male main characters). That is expected in most of Mr. Cussler's work. However, I lost all interest in the book when my eyes fell upon the words \\"Hitler's sperm\\". I picked up this book because I enjoy adventure books. It's a nice way to escape the dullness of everyday life. A book about \\"discovering Atlantis\\" seemed particularly captivating. We had gotten as far as escaping flooding mineshafts, near death shoot outs, and chases, shooting down choppers, and exploring ancient ships encased in ice (which I enjoyed, actually). I even stuck with the plot when Nazis were introduced into the story. However...in this particular novel, Pitt's enemy is a family of rich, cunning criminals.....who are essentially genetically engineered from Adolf Hitler's sperm that was collected, frozen and transported via U-boat to an ancient Amenes cavern in the middle of Antarctica, before the fall of the Nazi party. Their main goal was to disrupt the Earth's rotation causing massive floods and devastating ecological changes by drilling through, and detaching the Ross Ice Shelf, as to throw off the Earth's sensitive rotation based on the poles. I mean, come on. A super rich, evil powerful family of genetically engineered Hitlers planning to destroy the earth, and survive \\"Noah\\" style by building gargantuan ships that would supposedly survive the cataclysm. By the time it hits you what a sodding piece of crap this book is, you're already more than half way through it, and it's too late. Just too late. I did finish the book. I forced myself to. I cannot stand to not finish a book, once I've read more than 10 chapters. I hoped that something would happen near the ending that would resurrect my faith in Mr. Cussler's writing...however, I was sadly let down.If you want to read this book, I would recommend a library, because if you purchase it...you're going to want a refund."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have read all his books and this one is just BAD (as in not good). Cussler will waste a whole paragraph on what the characters are eating or what color Pitt's eyes are (for the thousandth time) but he has no problem skipping over whole sections of the PLOT. I was repeatedly asking myself &quot;is Cussler stupid, or what?&quot; This book was SO unrealistic that I was left wondering why."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Fast-paced, mind-teasing, sprawling, historically-related, gadget-filled are adjectives that accurately characterize this action thriller starring James-Bondesque Dirk Pitt. I often couldn't put it down. But sexist, shallow, surface, hastily done, unintellectual, silly are also apt. Cussler writes so poorly that it often made me ache, but I still wanted to see what happened next. I am a buff of historical detective fiction, and Atlantis Found has enough bogus history and archaeology in it to be attractive. A fascinatingly competent, apparently non-sexist bronze age culture disappeared... But Cussler writes too hastily, too thinly to sustain the hunger. His characters are emotionless zombies, his fundamental attitudes simple, male and conventional, his research lazily sophomoric, his ability intelligently to complicate his bright flashes of historical imagination nonexistent...Cussler seems to confuse the massing of pseudoprecise details--the brand names of high-tech equipment, for example, or impossibly exact distances and dimensions--with actually working at his research or writing. This book could have been written by a gang of bright seventh graders."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"The 15th book in the Dirk Pitt series by Clive Cussler is an enjoyable, if sometimes annoying read. I'll skip over the plot details as you can read a much better version in the book description.The Dirk Pitt series has always been full of action and suspense with a dash of humor thrown in and this book doesn't dissapoint. Sometimes it's difficult to put the book down because you want to see how things will turn out for our heroes or what will happen next.My only problem with this book, and the entire series, is that the books follow the same formula. Something happens in the past, beautiful woman investigating/connected to it gets in trouble, Dirk Pitt steps in and saves the day, several times. A plot is discovered that could change/destroy the world, Dirk and friends try and stop it. It seems that almost all of the Dirk Pitt books follow this general formula.This is a decent book and a very worthwhile read, but it doesn't really have any real depth to it. A kind of book that is good to read on a plane or while waiting for someone, but one that really doesn't hold up well."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Atlantis Found was a book that I greatly enjoyed reading. It is easy to get caught up in the novel's plot, and the climax was the most captivating of all the books I have read. Some critics complained about the factual info given in Atlantis Found, but some background information has to be given for a reader to sufficiently comprehend this book. Although I would not necessarily say that Atlantis Found is a book for everyone, anyone who enjoys a great action book or movie should consider reading it."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Well I ordered this book on a whim....I thought it was really going to be blah. However, as soon as I started reading the book I COULDNT PUT IT DOWN! I was so into the book that I finished it in one night...it was so good..."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"A room carved into the solid rock of a defunct Colorado gold mine holds the key to the latest catastrophe facing the world. But what do the strange glyphs and even stranger black obsidian skull mean? And who are the assasins who will stop at nothing to eliminate anyone who has seen these strange writings? Once again Dirk Pitt and Al Giordano are thrust into a mystery that could ultimately lead to the end of the earth as we know it.Like all Dirk Pitt novels this is not meant to be taken too seriously. It's a fun read as long as you don't delve too deeply into the whys and wherefores of the story. And to me, that's fine. I always feel that Mr. Cussler has a twinkle in his eye when he spins these yarns. His Pitt and Giordano characters have always been larger than life and almost over the top. Another reviewer mentioned that this is Cussler's formula, and I have to agree. So, take it for what it is. A fun read and not earthshaking literature. The writing is not up to the level of a James Lee Burke or Stephen Hunter but it entertains and really, what more can you ask for? I've never really understood why these books haven't been made into movies. It seems to me they have all the requisites for a good movie series just like the James Bond movies. In my mind's eye I've always seen a young James Coburn as Dirk Pitt."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"As a TRUE Cussler fan since the 70's, I have been with Pitt through the good times and the bad, including the better Pitt books, and the, well there is no such thing as a BAD Pitt book, some are just more thrilling than others. 'Atlantis Found' is DEFINITELY one of Cussler's better Pitt books. I have come to almost refer to Dirk as a personal friend. I know him as good as I know my wife (almost...) and his friends are MY friends. Cussler has given me countless hours of satisfaction and entertainment over the years, and the search for the possible origins of the fabled land of Atlantis is right up Dirk's alley. I have to admit the outcome was a bit different than what I expected, but that is all a part of the fun of reading about Dirk's adventures. Let's face it, James bond...? A WIMP. Indiana Jones...? NERD. Arnold Schwarzenegger...? BIG Nerd. Dirk Pitt is the REAL deal. Tough but sophisticated, Dirk knows how to handle himslef, and in the most dire of situations, heSTILL manages to say just what YOU would like to say if YOU were stuck in the seemingly hopeless position he finds himself in on just about every other page. Cussler has once again given us a thrill ride that is every bit as entertaining as any rollercoaster. Clive makes us wonder WHY the bad guys are planning on the end-of-the-world when science says it isn't going to happen...will it or won't it? Read and find out for yourself as Cussler takes you on an adventure that only he couldhave written. After reading Pitt books now for going on 20 years, it's nice to know that seeing a new novel at the bookstore can STILL get my pulse pounding and make me anxious to get it home and crack it open. Very few, and I mean VERY FEW authors have that kind of talent...and Clive Cussler does it best...and 'Atlantis Found' is one of his very best books."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"It seems that Cussler has faltered with Atlantis Found and has given a plot that seems to Indiana Jonesish with a new history of the world. Cussler's high points were reached with Cyclops and Inca Gold, but this one seems to drop down. While I did like Flood Tide and others in the series, this one was just like a history lesson and wasn't as good as other books of his I'd read. The beginning seemed like a copy off of Inca Gold, with Dirk Pitt saving scientist's from a temple and later realizes a clue that leads him to the villain."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Unbelievable as the plot is, I find myself entranced, as usual."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"The return of Pitt sent my pulse racing and reading the book only hightened the experience. It is in my oppinion his best work since Inca Gold. Nice work Clive, keep em coming!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Clive Cusler has done it again. I have read every Clive Cusler book ever released and can tell you that the non-stop action, of his hero Dirk Pitt, is what makes his books so outstanding.With his fast paced narrative and the intricate weaving of several simultenous story plots, he keeps you on the edge of chair, waiting for that unexpected and exciting ending that is true Clive Cusler."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This was my first Dirk Pitt novel; it will not be my last. I loved it. This was a spellbinding read, well worth the lost sleep. Full of rich personalities and memorable sceens, I can't wait to read more. This is a must for any Jack ryan, James Bond, or Indianna Jones fan. The suspense never stops."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Who is this guy's editor? I'd like to have a talk with him. Atlantis Found would be a great book, if only someone else had written it. Or if someone had, you know, proofread. I have to give Cussler credit for having good intentions and ideas, but his characters are more like caricatures (when they're given any sort of distinction at all), the dialogue is horrendous, and his tendency to write himself into the plot is a bit tacky. I also found it a bit disconcerting to find every boat, plane, cycle and piece of gear Pitt was toting described by brand and model...is Cussler picking up endorsement money somewhere? In spite of what most of the fan reviews are saying, Dirk Pitt has none of Bond's panache, and I can't understand comparing the two.Good science fiction makes the impossible believable. Atlantis Found even makes what little hard science it contains hard to swallow."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have seen Clive's books in the bookstore. Finally a friend passed one on to me when we got on the subject of previous civilizations that might have been the root of the Atlantis myth. I should have known when he qualified the book by saying it was kind of simplistic - even compared to Clancy and the like. But I adjusted my expectations downward and gave it a real chance.It takes a real stinker of a book to get me to stop reading it after getting through 3/5ths of a book, but it has achieved that distinction.I started off strong, too. The set up of the story with secret tombs, civilizations etc... was great! (and for that I give it 2 stars rather than one) But the action story with the corny characters just wasn't for me. I find myself rooting for the Nazis to win. I guess I will start writing myself - obviously the bar is pretty low if works like this can make an author rich. I guess I respect Cussler and the fact he does things in real life like NUMA, but if this is representative of his writing he should stick to diving."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I had never read any of Clive Cussler's books before this one, and now I will be sure it is the last. It is appalling to me that such a poor writer can make an apparently good living turning out such asinine, amateur garbage. I will brush aside the completely ridiculous plot points, since they are actually the least of Clive's problems. I wonder if the man even goes back and rereads what he has just written at all, since he contradicts himself in the most careless, I-don't-give-a-crap manner I have yet seen from an author, apparently forgetting what he himself has just written! Example: Dirk Pitt is cut by shards of glass and shrapnel on the face, which Cussler makes clear &quot;would not require stitches&quot;. Only pages after this, Pitt's wounds are addressed again, but this time Cussler tells us that the gashes &quot;would require stitches&quot;. I am not kidding. Is this lazy writing at its worst, or has Cussler some sort of short-term memory problem? He certainly does not respect his reader.Dirk Pitt himself is annoying- a cartoonish, corny, testosterone-laden character that is impossible for anyone on this earth to identify with, since he is in all respects, perfect. He is stubborn, snobbish, and of course never makes a mistake or shows an emotion.The metaphors in this book are particularly ghastly- &quot;trapped like ducks in a closet.&quot; Huh? Once again, I imagine Cussler hunched over his keyboard, typing furiously, not pausing to think of a metaphor that actually makes SENSE, because he is in such a hurry to move on the the next explosion scene. I have a feeling Cussler desperately wants for his books to become action movies, since every time things get dull (frequently), something just blows up.Bad dialogue is another trademark of Cussler's, especially dialogue that sounds like it came from either Scooby Doo or Dr. Evil, such as the time worn- &quot;This goes far deeper than any of us imagined...&quot; Yawn.Putting himself as a character in this mess of a story was the topper for me. I can't recall any other time in my life that I physically rolled my eyes as I read a book, but I did at that moment. I cannot imagine ever reading anything by Clive Cussler again...just the name Dirk Pitt gives me hives."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Maybe I just dont get it - this is the first Dirk Pitt novel I read and I found it predictable, dull, poorly written... and just plain bad. Lame dialogue... ugh the list goes on and on!I am all for James Bond type thrillers but this is just NOT it. I will never read another novel by this author as I just found this thing a complete waste of my time."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I was amazed to read of the educational institute of one of the characters to be Saint Andrews College, Scotland. As a graduate of St. Andrews University (note St. NOT Saint) I can assure Mr. Cussler that The University consists of several colleges ( St. Marys and St. Salvators, to mention two). This is a distraction in the usually accurate writing and research of this accomplished author. Do your homework a little better next time!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Please note: This review contains some major spoilers.Although Cussler is a fairly distinguished adventure writer, and given this was the first Cussler novel I read, his novel was quite disappointing. It wasn't so much the story, which whilst stretched credibility very far, it paled in comparison to the glaring errors in the parts that dealt with Astronomy and Geology. The basic premise of the novel is that a giant, 10km wide comet crashes into Hudson Bay, Canada 10,000 years ago and destroys an ancient civilization in the process. Whilst the comet impact is not implausible, there are a number of major flaws.1) In the novel, the impactor was described as being worse than the 'Dinosaur Killer' asteroid that hit Earth 65 million years ago. If something of this magnitude had hit Earth it is certain that most mammal life would have gone extinct, including humanity, which at that time only just begun to develop the basics of civilization and agriculture. The restoration of ecosystms and animal life would take many thousands, if not millions of years to recover from such a disaster. It seems ludicrous humankind (as well of the rest of the planet) could have recovered so soon after the impact of a 10km wide comet.2) The geological events Cussler describes are wrong. If such massive disruptions had taken place, there would be geological or fossil evidence left behind, especially as the event had occured so recently in geological time (less than 50,000 years). Secondly, whilst the part about the post-impact earthquakes is correct, the wild reshuffling of the continents isn't. To speed up plate tectonics would require widespread heating within the core and mantle, or mantle plumes of massive proportions, processes that would take time and a huge amount of energy, more than the impactor could provide. (Note: An impactor may help to trigger volcanism, earthquakes and other geological upheavals, but it would not cause changes on the scales described by Cussler directly.) An impactor releases most of its energy locally, vaporising itself and excavating a crater much larger than the impactor in the process. Unless the impactor is very large (i.e. &gt;100 km) it would not cause widespread heating of the mantle or core. A very large impactor, such as the type that hit Earth during its early accretion phases, would cause extensive melting of the crust and annihalate any existing landforms. It would also boil the oceans and probably also create a hellish atmosphere made of rock vapor.Cussler claims that the Amenes (the advanced seafaring civilisation) knew about the orbit of pluto without telescopes. Pluto, due to its extreme distance from the sun, is incredibly faint. It shines at about magnitude 13. To put that in perspective, the faintest object visible is about magnitude 6 (the lower the magnitude, the brighter the object). It is simply not possible, without the aid of a powerful telescope to know about the existence of an object such as Pluto, let alone determine its orbit.I suppose all this sounds very nitpicky, but as Cussler incorporates so much science in this book, he should try to get it right.-Greg"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"My interest in this book stemmed from my seeing a piece on Discovery (or was it The Learning Channel) a few years ago about \\"the orange peel theory,\\" which hypothesizes that some natural cataclysm caused the Earth's crust to slip at the molten mantle and shift about 2000 miles on the core some 10,000-odd years ago, causing at once the quick-freezing of the Asian Mammoths, the end of the last Ice Age in North America, and the disappearance of Atlantis, the latter beneath Antarctic ice. Maybe Cussler saw the same piece and decided to base a novel on it. The orange peel theory could have made a good premise for a novel, but \\"Atlantis Found\\" doesn't come close to fulfilling that potential.I, too, am unable to finish the book. The California reader's take on the book is correct (see \\"Improbable...,\\" below).For a fan of Clancy's technodramas, and earlier of Fleming's, this book is a nightmare of bad research and technological inconsistencies. For example, on p. 53, shortly after making his first appearance, super-hero Dirk Pitt, swimming through the \\"icy cold water\\" of the mine, \\"stayed warm inside his DUI Norseman dry suit.\\" [What is this, a commercial?] Then, on p. 78, safely out of the mine, he is described as \\"the bruised and fatigued man in the torn diver's wet suit.\\" Which was it, Cussler? A wet suit or a dry suit? They are technically different. Then, a bit later, Pitt dons yet another dry suit, explaining why he prefers it to the wet suit. Rule No. 1 of technodrama: Get the technology right!And why is the water so cold? According to earlier text, the temperature in the mine increases the deeper one goes, and the water level decades ago reached just a few feet below the 1200' level where another character was working. If the air and rock are warm, that cold water needs explaining.Finally, as a lover of the logic of English I am offended to read a sentence such as: \\"They [the ancients] discovered that the stars Betelguese, Sirius, and Procyon remain in permanent positions, while other constellations move imperceptibly over thousands of years.\\" If they discovered that stellar motion, they perceived it. How can it then be imperceptible? Still more annoying is that Cussler put that sentence in the voice of a computer named Max. No self-respecting talking computer would be so illogical.This book seeks to target us Tom Clancy fans, and it will bomb with us. Heck, we even get upset when Clancy refers to a WWII Japanese flying boat as a \\"Kawasaki H8K,\\" since the H8K \\"Emily\\" was a Kawanishi aircraft (some say the best 4-engine flying boat in the war), not a Kawasaki. For us, Atlantis Found is a nightmare.But Atlantis Found is crazy enough, and has enough far-flung exotic settings, that I expect Hollywood to make it into a huge action film. I suspect that movie potential to be the reason the book was written. Sure hope the film turns out better than the book."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Honestly, it didn't start out bad, (If you don't mind egotistical, macho, womanizing, alpha-male main characters).

But.........I could not get into Dirk Pitt. He is always at the right place at the right time, I became very annoyed with his one-liners. What started out as what looked like a very good story turned into a very unbelievable tale of idiocy. The ending reminded me of an old A-Team episode where everyone turns to Hannibal with a suprised look, he leans back in his chair with cigar crooked in his mouth and grins. Everyone begins to laugh, the screen freezes and the credits role.Sorry, this will be my first and last Clive Cussler book."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This was my first Clive Cussler book, and it will also be my last...How can anyone get away with publishing a book so appallingly written? To describe the characters as two dimensional would be crediting them with one too many dimensions. While the plot may be derivative, it does I suppose, entertain and would probably make a better 'exploding helicopter' movie than it does a book.By far the worst aspect of this book though is the quality of the writing: it is so bad it would make even the clumsiest amateur blush with shame. Cussler hasn't the faintest clue when it comes to believable dialogue, his handling of exposition is atrocious (people spout what seems like whole sections of text books at each other throughout the book), there are also entire paragraphs of unnecessary detail because he just *has* to make use of his research materials...The editor of this book should have sent it back with a note saying &quot;Rejected: re-write completely&quot;. Or was there even an editor? I see little evidence to suggest that even the laziest critical eye was passed over this book before it went to print.I'd have given it no stars, but unfortunately that wasn't an option."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This is a book that is true to the author's genre - oceanography/aviation and science.

They're exciting, entertaining, and easy to read. However, this one didn't impress me much. About half way through I found myself rolling my eyes a lot and getting annoyed with the character and narration. I'm not a huge fan of Cussler's writing style in general but the plots of his books usually keep me going. Atlantis Found just got confusing, over involved and over detailed in addition to the typical unrealistic nature of the Dirk Pitt novels. If you want to read Cussler's books I would go with Sahara, Raise the Titanic, or Trojan Odyssey which I consider to be much better."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Great read! A real page turner. I liked the idea of Atlantis being found and what would be a plausible story of the people who lived so long ago.

I never felt these were 'guy books'.This one was just ok. There were many tedious descriptions that were truly unnecessary - they didn't contribute to the plot or the story or were commonly known already. When it would have benefitted the story for MORE descriptions, there were none (i.e. better descriptions of the mummy's they found). It felt to me that Mr. Cussler had to produce x number of pages and was just filling space.I plowed away to the end of the book. I gave it three stars only because I like the characters.

Clancy's stories are excellent, but they get me lost as well. Clive Cussler stuck to the point and didn't go off and use unfamiliar terms. The reading was very fluid and relaxing. The only thing that I felt was wrong with it was that I felt as if I were watching a movie. I never really got to know the characters. After I was finished, I left before the credits were done. I also found myself not believing how Pitt got out of some of the situations that he was in. I thought it was a good touch to include himself in the novell (Cussler). Another weekness I found is how did all the archeology and the comet relate, when at the end, the plot was totally different. It seemed to me that to throw Pitt off and searching for these artifacts, was a waste of a couple of hundred of pages."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Clive Cussler's latest Dirk Pitt novel, Atlantis Found, is as exciting as its predecessors. As usual, Cussler pits Pitt against an organized crime group. This time, that group is headed by the Wolf family, decendents of Hitler. They are trying to take over the world and the heroic Dirk Pitt must save the day.Cussler begins with a plausible theory that could have caused the extinction of the dinosaurs and buried Atlantis. Discoveries in a cave bring a beautiful female into the story. Cussler uses his descriptive talents to make you feel like you are really experiencing the action packed events. He uses his extensive knowledge to create believable situations and creative solutions. I always enjoy the relationships of the unique individuals on the N.U.M.A. team. In this book, Dirk and Al begin to feel their age. I hope they have a few more good adventures before they throw in the towel.I gave this book a four star rating because Cussler always write a good, suspenseful novel. It is fun to read and hard to put down. I enjoy the incorporation of classic cars, weapons, technology, and good old fashion romance. I really liked this book. (I usually save my five star ratings for Robert Jordan.) I believe you will enjoy this book even if you are not familiar with the Dirk Pitt series."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Atlantis Found is a pretty good adventure tale. The story is compelling and the action rarely stops. There is very little &quot;filler&quot; and it's an absorbing novel, difficult to put down. My only criticism is that the Wolf family is no where near some of Cussler's other villians in real hands-on-rotten-ness. General Kazim from &quot; Sahara&quot; and the evil sister/brother from the diamond empire in &quot;Shock Wave&quot; are still my favorites. It was a little surprising to find Dirk and especially Al settling down at the end. Bravo, and keep up the good writing, Mr. Cussler."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Clive Cussler consistently writes wildly entertaining books. Atlantis Found is one of his best. Like an Indiana Jones movie, you overlook inplausibilities in the story simply because you are having too much fun."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Any Pitt fans, this is a must-read, if not just the final chapter. Dirk's character mellows a bit in this novel, doesn't have his usual &quot;edge&quot;. Great family reading, I don't mind passing these on to my 60 y.o. Dad and 25 y.o. little brother!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I admit it. I enjoy reading Clive Cussler novels even though Clive really believes that he is Dirk Pitt (scarey!). The plot is the same, the characters are the same (whatever happened to those other guys from the previous book?) and I still enjoy the stories the same. But, it seems as if Mr. Cussler did it again. In his attempt to complicate the story, he forgot to tie up an important loose end. Who in NUMA leaked the information to the Bad guys? Someone please tell me."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Nine thousand years ago, two giant meteors hurtled toward the earth. One of these meteors barely missed, skating past into outer space. The other meteor plunged towards the earth at upwards of 130,000 miles an hour. Upon impact, the meteor dug a hole in the planet the size of the entire island of Hawaii, setting of a chain of cataclysmic events that would change the face of the entire planet. Seas boiled to become deserts, giant tidal waves caused entire continents to be drowned under layers of ocean, volcanoes erupted, spreading hot ash into the air, making it noxious to breath, and the polar ice caps shifted greatly, causing the earth's magnetic poles to shift. Instantly the population of the earth was wiped out near its entirety. Only those who remained on high ground survived.Centuries later, a whaling team finds an antique shipwreck, its crew frozen solid, a strange batch of antiquities, and a perfectly crafted, black obsidian skull. A decade later, as anthropologists find and study these relics, a secret underground group will kill to keep them from finding out the truth, that these artifacts from the lost city of Atlantis tell of the comet's return to finish what it missed doing nine thousand years ago.Clive Cussler will never win a Pulitzer prize. It's a shame too; his novels are extremely entertaining action packed, page-turners. In Atlantis Found from Putnam books, we have all the classic elements of Clive Cussler, ancient cataclysm involving some sort of artifact or relic, years later, someone finds out about relic and are killed, present-day archaeologists find artifact and someone attempts to murder them. Miraculously out of nowhere comes Cussler's main character, Dirk Pitt to save the day, and foil the evil syndicate's plans. After 14 novels, you would think that Cussler would tire of his formulas, but all the favorite characters return to save the world once again from the clutches of a maniacal world conglomerate, intent on taking over the world.Cussler's Dirk Pitt is an amazingly fleshed out character. His adventures of the years have had him doing everything from raising the Titanic, to crossing the desert in Amelia Earharts lost plane. Each adventure has him cheating death, finding a piece of history, unraveling secret plans for mass destruction, and still getting the girl. Pitt is a James Bond, without a decent movie to popularize him. His time will come though.In Atlantis Found, the stakes are a little bit higher, but the book's attention to detail is definitely lacking this time around. The &quot;bad guys&quot; are a weakly formed group called the Fourth Empire, descendents of Nazis who absconded from the war with all of the Nazi war chest and stolen artistic treasures. The Fourth Empire, using their vast resources, has become a corporate company of great size that uses its wealth to build four gigantic ships that will ride out the coming cataclysm, and allow them to be the rulers of the new world. The plot is ingeniously simple, yet Cussler still manages to take the reader on a ride that makes for page after excitement.Does the world really need another 523 pages of a mindless, action-spy-thriller to read on the train while they commute to work each day? Should you really spend $26.95 for the hardcover edition of Atlantis Found, when you can pick up a paperback version of any of Cussler's other books, and be assured of the exact same experience? Then again, does the world really need another romance novel with Fabio on the cover? Probably not, but we all need our secret guilty pleasures. Atlantis Found is a nice addition to round out Cussler's series of Dirk Pitt novels. At some point his character is going to be bit too old to continue to save the world, but if Cussler is anything like Dirk Pitt, it won't be that easy to get rid of him."},{"Title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This was one of the better novels I have read.

The Appendices are detailed and comprehensive, as are the attendant notes...a great resource for any study of Matthew, and its parallel pericope in Mark."},{"Title":"Hadrian's Wall","review":"This is still the best book I've read on Hadrian's Wall. Published in the 70's you can still buy it. The author does a great job of explaining the history of the wall and the significance and the impact it had on Roman Britain. It has great photos and very good outlines and graphs of the forts along the wall. He explains clearly the system of turrets and mile castles all along the wall. It is a little dated and I am sure they have excavated more or built other replicas of various buildings and civilian settlements along the wall, but this is still a great reference for anyone interested in Roman Britain. The author explains the wall was built as part of Hadrian's efforts to consolidate the Roman Empire (122 CE). When Hadrian died the policy of consolidation went away and the Roman army attempted to conquer the rest of Scotland and another wall was built about fifty miles north of Hadrian's wall, but the Romans were never able to fully conquer Scotland and the line of defense ended up back at Hadrian's wall and there it stayed until the fall of the empire itself. In the chapter on the history of the wall the author explains what the wall was used for. You see it wasn't really to defend against constant invaders along the wall. It was most likely used as a jumping point for the Roman Legions to be based and then moved forward past the wall and into the open fields where the Roman army was at its best. The most amazing thing is how long this wall stretched and it had armed guards every half mile. I bought this book to help me in an upcoming trip to Hadrian's Wall. The author also recommends the best sites to see along the wall and since it spans over 70 miles across England I don't think you could see all of it in one weekend. The tips on what to see are very helpful. Other chapters include Housesteads, Chesters, and Birdoswald which were the largest forts along the wall and where most of the army was based. There is a little social history in these chapters since these forts also had the largest civilian settlements and it is where the Roman army lived and socialized with civilians. They also raised families and retired at these locations. The book has a small bibliography, but not many books have been written on the subject so that is understandable."},{"Title":"The Cherokee Lottery: A Sequence of Poems","review":"The impressive and memorable poetry comprising The Cherokee Lottery explores the forced removal of the Southern Indian tribes east of the Mississippi when gold was discovered on Cherokee land in northern Georgia in 1828.

There is nothing tedious and overwrought here. The book begins with an invocation, and obviously the muse served the writer well. Each poem presents a chapter of historical fact and allows the reader to digest it without dipping into excessive negative pathos. The reader is brought to a new awareness of just what the plight of the southeastern Indians was. William Jay Smith has a great feel for language and how it sounds.

If you know anything about him, you'll know that he might be about 3 % or less Choctaw, but that has not even been documented. Yet he continues to make a huge deal out of it, as if it somehow makes him informed enough to write a book about Indians. The worst thing about this book is that is is told mostly from the white point of view. What is told from the Indian point of view (and there is precious little of that) suffers from Smith's fixation on the Noble Indian idea. Smith includes art from all these white artists who also had fixations on the Savage/Noble Indian...this is the kind of book that white readers will like, because it's not going to make them too uncomfortable. I suggest that Smith lose his white sources and read up on history written by those who were the most affected by the Removal: Native Americans. And get some humility: just because you might have a tiny bit of Indian blood does not make you qualified to write a book about the most humiliating chapter in American Indian history."},{"Title":"Beet the Vandel Buster, Vol. 2","review":"i read about beet the vandel buster in shonen jump(boy magazine)and it is one of my favorites okay it is about a boy named beet who dreams to become a buster like zenon his idle it is an excellent storyive seen some eps from www.animesuki.com and it is awsome! my favorite technique is zenon winzard with the excellion blade so i personally recommend this for anyone please buy the graphic novels you wont regret it at all."},{"Title":"Beet the Vandel Buster, Vol. 2","review":"Beet the Vandel Buster is an incredible series.

The focus is very \\"British oriented\\" in its strategic overview/opinions and is generally very VERY favorable to P.M.Churchill, Field Marshall Montgomery, Allied Mediterranean Stragedy, F.M.Rommel, the overall wartime performance of the Red Army and Marshall G.Zhukov's military expertise and ability. Many of the Russian perspectives and information are dated compared to what we know since the fall of the Soviet Union and David M. Glantz's many books published over the last 20 years. Still,the information contained and overall quality of writing in these volumes is equal to or surpasses the current Osprey/Vanguard Campaign WW 11 books. Each individual issue is 25-28 pages which include chapters written by Historians, WW 11 Officers, enlisted men and then current military serving officers coupled with good pictures and very good maps. Each volume is broken down into 3-6 separate chapters. Volume 3 includes - Graf Spee: The Trap, The Propaganda War, Goebbels: An Overview, Norway: Hitler Strikes North, The Norwegian View of the Invasion and The Phony War: The Time of Triviality which is a lot of information for a single 28 page issue. I discovered this series at flea markets in the mid-1980s and have been picking up issues ever since. The condition of the 20 volumes I have received over the last 2 years thru the amazon web site have been of excellent quality.

Although some might disagree with the author's Holocaust interpretation it is well reasoned and documented. But his basic point is unsettling: We say 'never again' to the Holocaust, yet we barely register what has happened in Guatemala, El Salvador in the past generation. If we wonder at the reason Germans were passive during the era of Hitler, we should find an example in our own behavior."},{"Title":"How Holocausts Happen: The United States in Central America","review":"This book was actually recommended to me by the author's mother.

However, due to the pressing of the author's Mom, I checked it out.I am very glad I did!Having spent most of my summers in Israel the past 12 years, I have been around much discussion about the Jewish Holocaust but have always been left with many unanswered questions.

However, if thinking people would simply read to page 39, they would not be disappointed. And, they would be enlightened about a very important subject."},{"Title":"How Holocausts Happen: The United States in Central America","review":"Douglas Porpora's How Holocausts Happen is a simple, short, and invaluable historical lesson. Beginning with a pithy description of the social and political conditions of the rise of the Nazis to power in Germany, the book moves on to a sociological discussion of Hannah Arendt's theory of the \\"banality of evil\\" and then into a longer history of European and (mostly) US activity in Central America. The violence in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua in the 1970's and 1980's is discussed at longer length. A central lesson is that people can easily be indifferent to the use of oppressive and murderous violence by their own governments.While some might find the use of the Nazi parallel to US policies cliched or overwrought, the fact is that the Third Reich in Germany is an essential benchmark for understanding abuse of power by governments and the failure of people to stop such abuses, simply because most people are aware of the general history of the Nazi episode. Countless other historical parallels could be drawn to horrendous violence and historical crimes which communities allowed themselves to commit, but it is difficult to think of one that would not be hopelessly arcane and mysterious to most readers. The Nazi parallel is therefore good for shaking naivety out of people, and Porpora uses it intelligently to describe the indifferent kind of citizenship in a society that power often hopes to exploit, but also the braver kind of citizenship of people who will not be indifferent to crimes on the historical scale."},{"Title":"How Holocausts Happen: The United States in Central America","review":"This powerful book is an indictment of U.S. intervention in Central America. Unlike the numerous accounts of the CIA involvement in the wars against democracy, however, Porpora focuses on American public's reaction - or non-reaction - to the genocidal policies of our &quot;allies&quot; in Central America. He draws strong parallels between the US in the 1980-90's and Germany in the 1920-30's and demonstrates that it is the moral indifference of the general public that allows evil to flourish, and that ultimately it is the general public that is responsible."},{"Title":"Legion Tourney: A Bronc Burnett story","review":"Great product, fast shipping, found a book I have not seen in 50 years.

Jane Louise Curry did a good job of writing about a kid that time travels to the1600s; however, the book does not keep the interest of children. It seems that she is not writing for children, certainly not for young boys, but for a seniors' knitting club. She uses no action whatsoever. Every time I thought that something exciting was going to happen to the main character, James, it did not. The book also confused me. I had a very hard time trying to keep up with James' whereabouts. Each time I turned a page, he was politely walking somewhere new, not previously mentioned in the book. I do not consider myself an avid reader; therefore, when I pick up a book I want to be entertained. The Black Canary, though interesting, was laborious and not pleasurable. Nevertheless, I would highly recommend The Black Canary to a senior knitting club. I plead with parents not to buy this for their 12-year-old sons, unless they are looking for a form of cruel and unusual punishment."},{"Title":"The Black Canary","review":"Jane Curry's \\"The Black Canary,\\" contrary to the view of the previous reviewer, is an engrossing read: my 13 year-old grandson went right through it (he quit \\"Harry Potter\\" V) and pronounced it \\"Good,\\" which for him is the second-highest praise (first is reserved at the moment for the Artemis Fowl books). He especially liked the intriguing portal, through which James travels from contemporary London to the London of the Children of the Chapel Royal and the plots against Queen Elizabeth I, a portal which takes him to different points in both times, so that he has to arrange his final return to the present to precede the dramatic accident that placed him in the Thames in the winter of 1600. He also comes to feel responsible for helping one of his peers to save the boy's uncle from a coming purge of plotters against Queen Elizabeth, and figures out how to do this while still effecting his return \\"home.\\"Curry is clearly interested in the world of the Elizabethan theater--Ben Jonson and other documented figures connected with the child actors and singers are characters--and the complicated politics of the time. Young readers may not be specifically interested in early music or English history, but they'll likely remember the ambience of this book when they do come to read about the Elizabethan age or go to a Shakespeare play or an early music concert. The main characters--James and his rival/mentor in the company, Jack--are compellingly drawn, and minor characters such as James's parents (one black, one white--hence James's sobriquet as \\"The Black Canary\\" when he is pressed to sing for Queen Elizabeth) and the singing teacher, not to mention Ben Jonson, are vivid and memorable. The details of contemporary London vs. London in 1600 give a lively contrast for readers thinking about how people lived then and now.I read quite a few young people's books because I vet them before sending them to my grandson (or he recommends books to me). We like books that are well written, with neat, surprising plots and interesting characters (other books we've liked are \\"Holes\\" and \\"Hoot,\\" as well as Eion Colfer's Fowl series). Maybe not everyone in the school to which the other reviewer gave the book will \\"get\\" it, but those curious about other times or experiencing difficulty finding a grownup self out of the tangle of insecurities and sometimes resentments of early adolescence will enjoy it and learn from it. Also, I thought it was well written without being at all precious."},{"Title":"The Black Canary","review":"Nowadays kids are bombarded by shallow games, movies, and books. Anything deeper than a comic book is challenging to them. I have kids who won't read a book because it is too thick. And then I have READERS. And many of them are very smart kids. They come from different family backgrounds. And so to have a black protagonist in a challenging time-travel book is a GIFT. But I wouldn't bother to review the book or give it more than 2 stars if it didn't have the lovely historical detail. I think a kid needs to like reading to get this book or be older. I doubt if a knitting group would cast off with the Black Canary, but they'd enjoy themselves if they did. Isn't knitting what all the 20 somethings are doing now? It's not the old ladies. They're all on the internet writing book reviews."},{"Title":"The Black Canary","review":"I received the book quicker than I thought I would.

A compelling story with historical accuracy made palatable and fascinating, from dress of the period to what everyone ate at table, The Black Canary sings. A perfect book for the holidays for anyone, child or adult. Miss Curry's books take children's literature to another level, which, in this age of bite information, gives a child a bite he can chew."},{"Title":"The Black Canary","review":"With the attention-grabbing theme of time travel, Curry could have gone far into the literary cosmos with this text but instead the book runs out of fuel far short of where this plot could have ventured. She goes into long, rambling descriptions of incidential items and flash backs almost losing her young readers in wordy passages barely connected to preceeding thoughts. Curry could have done a better job with the main character's impressions of 17th century London. The author should have better expressed the differences in the character's life in two different worlds instead of describing rocks, curtains and feathers, etc.I purchased this book as a donation for a school library. I hope the youngsters don't get lost in this book's outer space of disconnected words. Curry kept this canary in the cage."},{"Title":"The Cocker Spaniel: An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet","review":"This book is exactly what the new Cocker Spaniel owner needs. Not bogged down with technicalities about the dog's structure, it concentrates on presenting the important things about your new pup. A smattering of the history of the breed fills it out nicely. Judy Iby is no lightweight either...Judy herself has put over 100 AKC titles on her own Cocker Spaniels, including obedience, conformation, tracking and agility. She has mentored probably hundreds of new Cocker Spaniel owners through the puppy and adolescent years of their new companion dog's life, and now she shares this wisdom with the rest of us.I would have rated the book a &quot;5 star&quot; book for just Judy Iby's contributions, but I think the &quot;generic&quot; parts of the book that are tacked on on by Howell to construct their series of breed books almost detract from the fine quality of the original contributions about the Cocker Spaniel by Judy Iby.It is accessible, inexpensive, and a Gem for new Cocker Spaniel owners."},{"Title":"The Cocker Spaniel: An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet","review":"I recently adopted a Cocker Spaniel from the humane society.

This text provides a strong theoretical background and numerous practical tips for reducing medication errors. The book expands the definition of medication errors beyond the well-known &quot;five rights&quot; of medication administration.

First, it's immensely thick. I find it difficult to carry it around with me to class if I have both my netbook and binder with me; my backpack is not small. My other grievance is almost as bothersome. The pages are very thin, which makes the ink from the next page show up clearly (to a point where you can usually make out what the next page says without flipping pages.) Here's a photocopied page, hopefully which constitutes fair use. http://i53.tinypic.com/23ueszc.jpgAn e-book version of this would be perfect, but I didn't see one of this, plus I don't have an e-reader yet.

I've looked at other books on medieval costume, but none have been as helpful or as easy to use as this one. The time periods are listed in order under the names of the rulers of England, with detailed sections for both men and women. Half of the pages of the book have beautiful black and white sketches of the costumes of the time period, and then on the page facing the sketches there are descriptions of the garments of the time period, down to the colours and fabrics."},{"Title":"Historical costumes of England,: From the eleventh to the twentieth century,","review":"This is a wonderful quick reference of historical costumes in England. Half the book is black and white sketches of costumes through the years. The other half is a short history of the costumes worn during various time periods. The time periods are sectioned according to rulers (kings/queens) of the time. Every aspect of clothing is discussed from undergarments to headpieces. Because of the easy format, I use this book to look things up for quick answers. I am not an expert, but the accuracy of the content of this book is relatively decent as a quick reference. I would not recommend this book to those looking for detailed costume information. I would recommend it as a quick reference or for sketches."},{"Title":"Historical costumes of England,: From the eleventh to the twentieth century,","review":"this book has excellent realistic drawings of the dress of the ages.

Jake returned to his hometown of Aspen struggling to make a living while drinking diet coke with sugar to overcome the \\"Stolichnaya Flu\\".Long time friend Chief of Police Rick Rankin offers Jake work as a private sleuth. Laura Keller (whose surname is now some cereal company) needs a detective to find her missing seventeen years old stepdaughter Tinker \\"Bell\\" Mellon while her spouse (Tinker's genetic dad) is spending the season in Alabama watching football. Seeing easy money, Jake visits Laura who has tasted every male's Jimmy except his. Using Jim Rockford (rather than Mr. T) as a mentor, Jake investigates. Except for the aid of Winston (the dog) and in spite of his intimate knowledge of Rockford, Jake fumbles the ball time after time.Readers who appreciate hours of laugher from the asides, self deprecations, puns, and buddy shots will want to read ASPEN PULP, a private investigative tale that feels more like Inspector Clouseau, Rocky Mountain amateur sleuth. Though played for laughs, the Jake is a complete person holding the plot together even when he'd rather have a \\"Virgin\\" than a \\"Bloody Mary\\". Though totally irreverent, the story line is cleverly designed so that the twists and turns down Aspen Mountain add depth while the secondary cast provides insight into the Rockford wannabe or the avalanched working class. Patrick Hasburgh opens his new series with a gold medal grand slalom run.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Aspen Pulp","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. As someone who lives outside of the unbelievably rich areas of Colorado, it's always fun to see what these places are really like (and yes to have some prejudices confirmed). I hope this won't be Hasburgh's only foray into fiction - finding out what happens next to Jake and the love of his life Annie would be great fun to read."},{"Title":"Aspen Pulp","review":"As \\"Aspen Estreme\\" is a movie for skiers, so is this book.

The plot (an intricate and page turning whodunnit) is not the point. What is the point is Hasburgh's signature style which is hilarious and unlike anything in recent American fiction. By turns satiric, sentimental, and then unexpectedly profound, this book is one of those rare animals that actually exceeds its publisher's hype.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Aspen Pulp","review":"This book is a good read. The characters and dialogue are real, intelligent, and funny.

However, there is a mistake in the very beginning which jolted me. John Denver died at Lover's Point, Pacific Grove, CA not off Santa Barbara as the author indicated. His \\"experimental plane\\" failed him. The people of Pacific Grove held a candlelit ceremony honoring him. They played and sang John Denver songs."},{"Title":"The Mystery Monsters","review":"Here, in my hands, is the most splendiferous, astounding, amazing, exhilerating book you have never laid eyes on: The Mystery Monsters: Rare Creatures of Land and Sea, by Gardner Soule. This book was published in 1965, and it's still just amazing. Certainly some further scientific advancements have been made; maybe some of the mystery monsters have since been identified. But no other book has ever, or will ever, come close to capturing the sense of wonder, awe, and absolute MYSTERY that this book has.Along with accounts of relatively ordinary creatures like the heaviest whale ever weighed, and the several-foot-long earthworms, this book has engagingly told accounts of the Flathead Lake monster, the capture of the biggest manta ever caught, and the sighting of a huge, unknown turtle-like creature off the coast of Scotland, and dozens of other first-person accounts of people discovering, or spotting, previously-unknown animals -- many of which are still a mystery.There's the story of the bacteria found alive after 1,200 years in a Mayan tomb, the story of a young sea serpent -- so many great stories. There are black-and-white photographs, but only of known creatures. Even so, some of them are really good, like the fifteen-foot pike-like fish two men are hauling in the snow.Plus, this book is really well written. It has the enthusiasm, factual details, and scientific (but never boring) telling of first-hand accounts that will inspire anyone!!If you're an adult, read it. If you're a kid, read it twice as quick! Because who knows, you could grow up and discover a mystery monster of your own -- or identify one of these!The book is 191 pages long, including bibliography, but don't be afraid to skip around and read the most interesting parts first -- especially the unknown sea creatures bits. That and the Mayan bacteria story."},{"Title":"Fifty Five Castle Street","review":"Micheline Vogel tells an amazing story about people who find themselves in Brussels, Belgium, during WWII. These people include occupying German military, city residents, and other civilians who -- either by choice or by circumstance -- find themselves in Brussels during these terrifying and chaotic times.I liked the story for several reasons. One is because part of the tale concerns an aspect of the times not generally familiar to Americans and, especially, Americans who didn't live through WWII: there were evil persons systematically preying on the desperation of their own countrymen as the latter fled the horrors of the Nazis. This book is fiction, but the occurrences were reality.Also, the fact that Ms. Vogel clearly knew the geographic locations and lived the terror of those times is extremely obvious and effective. While she is not yet a seasoned author, she is certainly a WWII survivor with an important and affecting story. I am glad I was able to locate this novel."},{"Title":"Memory in the Real World","review":"This is an excellent book about how memory works. It is written in a very comprehensible way in layman terms although it is about something that not even scientists know how exactly it works.It presents in a simple but not simplistic way all the latest approaches and studies about memory. The most rewarding element of the book is that it combines research from many different fields. The title is very appropriate too, since it really tells us about memory in real life as opposed to the world of the laboratories and science rooms. There are eleven units in the book and nine of them are about different kinds of memory, for example, memory for faces, for music, for language etc. Another good point is that it is very accessible.I definitely recommend it to anyone interested in the matter either directly or indirectly. Especially teachers like me will find it particularly useful."},{"Title":"Spider, egg, and microcosm;: Three men and three worlds of science","review":"I absolutely love this book! I read it when I was about 8 or 9 years old, and it really opened up the world of science for me. Three scientists: an arachnologist (spider), embryologist (egg), and microbiologist (microcosm) write, in an easy-to-read manner, about their specialities. Interesting stories that really make the subject matter come alive! Science for the non-scientist."},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"I read this book several years ago, and just recently pulled it out to share with a friend. Please don't be put off by the length of Sacred Hunger or some of the reviews that call it a daunting read. It certainly isn't fluff, but its a beautifully written and researched story. The author has a way of painting a picture with his words and its truly a story that will stay with you for years to come. Though not a lightweight \\"beach book\\", I actually read it on a trip to Kauai and could hardly put it down. This is one of those rare books that leaves you feeling sorry you've finished it."},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"The finest piece of historical fiction ever written.Much of Unsworth's other works (while excellent), Pascali's Island and Rage of the Vulture come to mind, had deep flaws, and fail to convey well the obvious efforts of the author.Sacred Hunger succeeds on every possible level. It is a work of unmatched genius in its genre, and only John Coetzee and Peter Carey can apporach it's depth and importance among living writers. Amongst the dead, this rates with Tolstoy, Hemmingway, Faulkner, and Camus (Dostoevsky, of course, is untouchable). It is a work of pure and perfect literature."},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"could not put this down,the research about the period seemed real-made me think whilst still engrosed in a great story and a desire to find out what happened"},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"I read this book in three days.

It won the Booker prize, which is usually a good bet, so I picked it up. I wasnt prepared to love it as much as I did. Unsworth played me like a violin..."},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"So I'll admit, I had to read this book for a class in college, and instead of renting it from the library I decided to get the ebook for convenience sake. The book itself isn't terribly, nut the writing style seems to be bland at some points, and more-often than not you'll find yourself re-reading paragraphs or even pages because ideas in the text don't quite flow well into the next. After reading the entire book, I still hadn't \\"cracked\\" his style of writing, learning how to read his book.The story itself was decent, by far not the best slave novel you could read, but it does have its moments. One think I can give the book credit for is showing the complexity of Race and Enslavement as their two separate entities. A lot of people think that slavery was institutionalized because they were black, making them inferior. This book attempts to right that wrong. Considering slavery has been around since before the death of Christ, it is easy to see how the idea of slavery was accepted around the world as a whole. Being free didn't mean what it does today, being free just meant you were incapable of being enslaved, and capable of owning slaves. During the time frame of the book (and the hundreds of years following it), in the Americas, the idea of slavery was slowly brought into a more racial light, and this book I believe emphasizes that. (I won't say there was no sense of racial tension before the time frame this book depicts, there was. I am saying it wasn't the reason, or at least not the only reason, for slavery eventually being of certain groups).In all-in-all the book for me was fairly dry and had a lack of flow from paragraph to paragraph. The book itself had a decent flow from start to end, but on each page there was little. The story isn't the best you can find about the slave trade, but I won't list several books that I think were better. With that, it does illustrate the development of the institutional racism in the Americas, and shows that slavery was not all about race and superiority (at least at first)."},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"An unsettling, but important book to read about the human need to dominate. A slave ship is built in the 18th century to convey slaves from Africa to America. The juxtaposition of the young Kemp and his cousin who sails as ship's doctor is an incredible character study. Paris, the doctor, finds redemption through his acts of mercy toward the shipmates and slaves. \\"I should have known it then...Nothing a man suffers will prevent him from inflicting suffering on others.\\"\\"Man's inhumanity toward man\\" is a major theme of this book. Although a difficult read, it is masterfully done.Barry Unsworth writes historical fiction with heft. Sacred Hunger won the 1992 Booker Prize for fiction.

Trouble naturally ensues along the way, off the coast, and on the voyage to America. The narrative awkwardly shifts causing the story line to be disjointed. This novel of revenge is dull, disjointed and predictable. The description reads much better than the novel."},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"This is a very well-told story from which it is difficult to avert one's eyes once embarked upon the reading of it. But I have a few problems with the book as a whole, considered as a work of art. The stylism of the writing has some very high points, but they seem to me few and far between, making the reading of the work at times a jarring experience. I don't believe the book (thank heavens) is essentially a morality tale---If so, what is the moral? The \\"sacred hunger\\" of greed and trade certainly has a deeply plumbed negative side here, but so does a hankering after a distant Arcadia, as philosophised upon by Delbanco.--The problem really is essentially one of artistic overreaching, as exemplified by:The Tempest--One other reviewer has mentioned the connexion between the 18th Century reworking of the play entitled The Enchanted Isle enacted (or attempted to be enacted) at the beginning of the narrative and the colony founded in Florida. The failure here is that the connexion is never worked out in the book. What are the themes of The Tempest? One can argue over this question until one is blue in the face. But I think almost all would agree that one of the themes is the unreality of the perceptible world. This is artistically worked out in the work of John Fowles (The Magus), almost every work of Iris Murdoch, and various 20th Century novelists. But Unsworth has let this literary connexion, so obvious, slide out of his purview. Perhaps he simply became tired of writing, but the glaring omission of any attempt to follow up on what seems to me an obvious intended theme at some point in the writing of the novel mars the experience of reading the book for me.There are some marvellous passages:\\"There are moments in anyone's life when some blend of circumstances, some consonance of surroundings and situation and character, show him in a light peculiarly characteristic, make him seem more peculiarly himself - to the observer, that is: the subject will not be aware of it. He seems to us then to be immobilized, taken out of time - or he steps, rather, into some much older story.\\" P.165Wonderful, if only such writing could be sustained! As it is, Sacred Hunger is a good story, but not, despite the prize, one of great literature."},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"This novel really does have it all --plot, moral content, characterization, all masterfully served up. Perhaps 'Sacred Hunger' could have been slightly more modern and less literal. I would have enjoyed a tad more surreality, some unexpected wry swank."},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"I read this novel on the advice of my sister, who is a doctoral student in Comparative Ethics. The expansive, intriguing story kept my attention through this thick volume, but the author's exquisite understanding of human desire and the exercise of power make the book a must-read. It has lead to wonderful conversations between my sister and I, which is, to me, the hallmark of a great book.Unsworth chooses a fitting topic for his exploration, slavery, which could easily become too obvious if handled less deftly. The tremendous suffering caused by the slave trade is a constant backdrop, but its daily harvest of minor (and not so minor) humiliations on its participants is the real story here. Unsworth uses exacting detail to reveal how this perpetual pressure makes both the slavers and slaves engines of their own misery.Don't be frightened off by this seemingly dark subject matter, though. The book is enlightening, warmly written and engrossing. You could find few better ways to spend your time than this wonderful read."},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"this is probably barry unsworth's best book. i've read a lot of his other works but i was initially intimidated by the putative heaviness of this novel's topic. if you are too, don't be. it's a great book with plenty of personal details to leaven the political message, which is an important one. unsworth avoids being didactic and creates interesting, believable characters. it's not light reading, but it's not unbearably heavy either, and there is a feeling of hope underlying the moments of despair in the novel. unsworth has a remarkable gift for making long-ago periods of time seem immediate and fascinating. the book covers theater, utopian societies, family divisions, economics, slavery, the shipping industry, marriage, business, ethics, medicine and darwin's theories, which seems like a lot to fit into one story, but unsworth does a good job. the book is a little bit similar to barbara kingsolver's poisonwood bible, which has more engaging characters and is slightly more readable, but unsworth's book has less narrative intrusion. excellent."},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"Barry Unsworth has written a fine historical novel in Sacred Hunger. The book revolves around the crew of a slave ship in the eighteenth century, along with its unwilling passengers, and the merchant family that lays claim to the ship. The setting itself is magnificent, and Unsworth reveals his flair for shaping a believeable historical character, without modern prejudices. He uses the English language beautifully without being artificial, and his dialogue often sparkles. If it were only for these factors, Sacred Hunger would be a very good book indeed.Better yet, however, the book can be read on different levels, while remaining accessable and enjoyable. There is a woof and weft crafted just below the surface that links everyone and everything in the book, from the main characters of Erasmus Kemp and Matthew Paris to the ship and its unlikely society to the merest possession aboard. At no time does this seem overwrought; on the contrary, the book contains enough unpredictable events and fleshed out characters that even if the back of the book seems to give away the plot (in the Norton paperback edition), the novel itself reads like a non-fiction tale, where lives entwine in such unlikely ways that the back cover seems like a reminder that the book is fiction. Best of all, throughout the book Unsworth probes how the sacred hunger inside every man, woman, and child reveals itself, and even though many characters in the book agree that this hunger is only greed in a variety of disguises, the quiet conclusion offers a less cynical alternative.Read this one, not only for its exploration of human nature or deft presentation of another time (not so unlike our own), but to appreciate the eloquence of Unsworth's language. You will not regret it."},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"This epic of the eighteenth century British Slave Trade works at two levels. The first is as a straight and exciting narrative of the different stances to it of the two main characters, one who profits from it, and is at last morally enslaved by it himself while the other recognises its evil and attempts his own ultimately futile protest against it. At the second level the novel serves as a meditation on the nature of greed - the \\"Sacred Hunger\\" of the title, and the extent to which it can become a justification for any excess. Mr.Unsworth's genius in this book is however that the does not adapt a simplistic moralising tone but writes with understanding of the society that produced this abuse, and shows how potentially decent people could be drawn, unthinkingly, into the position of profiteers and exploiters. One does not get a sense here of modern perceptions and values being projected back on to an earlier age - the weakness which destroys so much serious fiction set in the past - and the characters' behaviour and attitudes, whether sympathetic to the Slave Trade or not , are consistent with those of eighteenth century British society. Like other novels of Unsworth's, this work has many echoes of Conrad, in its depiction of the depths to which humanity can so quickly plunge once the restraints of law and custom are relaxed. Though gripping from the first page it is disturbing work and the vividness of its plot and imagery will not quickly leave the reader. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"This is an original and fascinating book. The writing is outstanding and the book explores important themes: greed, evil, corruption, justice and man's inhumanity to man.When Wm. Kemp loses money in his cotton shipping, he decides to go for the big money and enter the slave trade. He sends his nephew, Matthew, along as ship's doctor. Disgusted by the horror on ship, he leads a revolt and an attempt by the seaman and slaves to form a utopia -- but his idealism is disappointed by the realization that suffering doesn't teach compassion, so much as it teaches how to inflict suffering on others.This is a marvelous exploration of greed-the sacred hunger- and how it affects people and society."},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"Barry Unsworth's historic novel that won the Booker Prize is an exceptional literary accomplishment and well worth the prize. The word 'vast' would be a good way to describe the novel since it has multiple vividly drawn characters selected from a broad range of social classes and conditions. It is also vast in chronological scope as it covers several 18th century decades in the lives of the characters. It is also vast in venue or setting in that the stately homes of wealthy Liverpool are contrasted with the back-water dens of prostitution and criminality of water-front Liverpool; tenuous military outposts in Sierra Leone on the African coast are contrasted with back-river slave trading posts; a utopian colony in colonial jungle Florida is contrasted with the decadent gentlemen's clubs where the sons of wealthy merchants flaunt their inherited wealth, influence politicians to help maintain their privileged status, and systematically humiliate the lower classes.The novel is both historic and social commentary in addition to the well constructed multi-chaptered narrative plot. There are no artistic literary games played with the reader. Rather, the narrative is a well constructed chronologically ordered structure on which Unsworth can build both character development and analysis but also commentary on the nature of social structures developed by the powerful to suppress those with less power. In this regard the novel could be called \`old fashioned' in narrative structure yet subtle and disarming in its underlying message and content.Unsworth displays incredible ability to both describe place with vivid yet not overblown language. Likewise he has great ability to reveal character through dialogue. It is his ability to replicate the language of the wealthy capitalist, the bar-maid or the hardened sailor that helps him use dialogue to reveal class, intellect, and character. The use of pidgin-English on the African Coast, aboard the slave ship, and in the Florida utopia is vivid and direct. The final quarter of the book uses pidgin-English extensively but the reader quickly masters the dialect and is amused by the witty turn of phrases.For this review I would like to discuss the four major male characters in the book: William Kemp, Erasmus Kemp, Matthew Paris, and Captain Saul Thurso.William Kemp is a character well known in capitalistic paternalistic western society. He is the father, the provider, the manager, the risk taker, the stable and controlling force within his family, business, and community. Yet William Kemp's great investment in a slave ship fails and William Kemp decides not to face the consequences of his mismanagement that long lay hidden behind his respectable upper class facade. The section of the novel whereby Mrs. Kemp manages the scandal and crisis that is left by her husband's stigmatizing death is a telling passage. Here we see stiff Erasmus, their young adult son, unable to navigate the confines and social constriction of a stigmatized death, which his mother in her lower social role as a woman can.Erasmus Kemp is an odd fellow, a brittle and vulnerable personality that is never relaxed in his own skin or in the world. When he is young he becomes enraged at his older cousin picking him up to keep him from becoming wet from an incoming tide. When he falls in love, he is so object driven that he eventually drives away the affection of his love, Sarah Wolpert. He is so unsure of his status as a privileged rich young man that he is threatened when his love, Sarah, has a different opinion than he, or when Sarah's mother dares to discuss taxation and business with males, or when his own \`weak' mother manages a family scandal far better than he does. He seems forever driven to maintain his own inflated yet fragile self evaluation and the shallow image he portrays to the world. Thus much of his life is driven by a struggle for self definition. He must have a challenge or antagonist in order to understand the borders of his self-image.His cousin, Matthew Paris, is the most developed character in the novel. Here we see a broken man. As a bright young physician he was willing to get into a power struggle with a powerful vicar over evolution. This power struggle then resulted in the loss of his profession, his incarceration and public humiliation, the death of his wife without him present, and a lifetime of restricted potential due to his record as a convict. Paris learned hurtful lessons about intellectual pride in the face of social power and realizes that his intellectual gift and self-regard set him up for a conflict which he could not win and for which his poor wife paid part of the awful price. Pride and intellect was the motivating force that initially allowed him to confront hypocrisy with truth. However after his great loss, he is not certain that pride was to his benefit and may have undermined his efforts. He is thus better prepared to assess consequences when he is faced with another social power and evil injustice in the person of Captain Saul Thurso.Captain Thurso is a fascinating character for he is hard as a rock, unmoved by any human emotions, reacting against any perceived threat like a barking border dog, and so ego-maniacal that he see the forces of nature personally against him. It is his hard cruelty that eventually causes Matthew Paris, the ship's doctor, to respond against tyranny even though his last foray against tyranny resulted in incredible personal loss. Because his egotism has been fragmented, Matthew Paris is better able to bide his time, measure consequences, and recognize when a final blow has been dealt.The utopian world in back river jungle Florida is exceptionally written, for here black slaves, impersonally chained like animals aboard ship, become human beings of vivid character and motives. The final third of the book is brilliant as we see life in a utopia and see that even in utopia oppression of the weak by the strong will always rear its head. Even here Matthew Paris must outwit greedy power if he wishes to stand on the side of the weak.Overall this book is a triumph. It is a beautiful historic novel, full of character and class, place and time, and the force of greed and power in opposition to the forces that must confront greed and power and face the consequences for doing so."},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"Sacred Hunger is pure poetry. Plot aside, this is a master wordsmith in full stride; gliding, dancing, shimmering in words that seem to have been born in place. It looks easy, it reads easy. There is a rhythmic beauty to each sentence that propels the lucky reader into the next, seemingly perfect sentence. Find that rhythm dear reader and you are in for a grand cerebral adventure.On the other hand, we have been graced with a heartbreaking but astounding and engaging plot on a number of levels. The grotesqueness of the slave trade while fully present, seems not to be the forefront of this story; rather, Unsworth explores the greed which dwells in humankind, the desires of the heart which propel even the noblest of this cast into their own tragic downfall; from slave seller to buyer, to transporter and everyone involved. This is an unflinching, stone cold look into the heart of human greed and hunger for material gain. It admonishes none and all, holding forward the humanity of the slaves themselves while also not backing away from the fact that these were indeed human commodities.This is not a book to be taken lightly, but neither is it to be read without great joy. The joy of a master yarn spinner, of the open sea variety, who takes us on a voyage of adventure, love, loss, desire and ultimately leaves us changed.One of the three books I would take to a deserted island... This is a treat. A heartbreaking, glorious treat for any reader who is ready to be swept away to someplace VERY few books can take us."},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"This is one of the best historical novels I have ever read. The vivid description brings the 18th century world to life in the mind of the reader. The story is fantastic, and filled with deep insight into the human condition and hunger for wealth. A book to be read, shared and discussed."},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"What reviewers seem to miss about this ambitious and well-crafted epic is that the themes have a strong pertinence to modern times. The move to globalization by American companies is so much like the colonialism that this book explores. The slave trade was so much an extreme yet logical extension of the &quot;god -given&quot; colonial outlook of the era them. Now we have sweatshops. Picture the similarities of our comfortable suburban lives with the gentrified English life shown in the novel. Contrast that with Third World factories making our designer goods and seduced by our ads for expensive clothes and sugary sodas. Like the colored cotton, baubles and alcohol in the novel. Nike, Coke etc, etc. Feels like the the same colonial attitudes and the same Sacred Hunger at work. Interesting, hmmmm. I'm not a fan of historical novels in general, but this is as much about the human spirit that is part of us today as it is about a harrowing historical period. I don't see it so much a story about &quot;them.&quot; but more of a powerful story about &quot;us.&quot; Do you think I'm nuts?"},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"A sweeping story enfolding a moral and philosophical debate about the nature of freedom, this book is filled with detail about the slave trade and fascinating as a fount of knowledge. But it goes further than most Afro-centric slave narratives in paying as much attention to the ship-folk, the traders, and the owners, as to the slaves themselves. It also contains one marvelously-realized character in the surgeon-scientist Matthew Paris -- a portrait that gains chiaroscuro towards the end of the book by the author's ability to shade Paris' idealism and show its failings as well as its strengths. If the narrative were only a bit tighter, the strands of life on sea and on land more tightly connected, and the enmity between Paris and his cousin Erasmus (son of the ship's owner) given a less arbitrary basis, this would be a five-star book for me, rather than merely four.I do not entirely agree with those reviewers who praise Unsworth for the beauty of his language. He writes well, certainly, and the book, though long, is an easy read. But he does not have many passages that made me want to linger for the writing alone, as I did, say, in Patrick O'Brien'sMASTER AND COMMANDER. There are other novels on my booklist which have a similar historical scope and just as easy a style -- Iain Pears'DREAM OF SCIPIOor Mark Helprin'sA SOLDIER OF THE GREAT WAR-- but they have passages of searing visionary intensity which I did not (quite) find in the Unsworth.What in the end made me glad to have read SACRED HUNGER was Unsworth's philosophical interest. His central theme -- how man imposes his will upon others -- is present everywhere, even in the choice of a version of THE TEMPEST as the play being rehearsed during Erasmus' courtship of a neighbor's daughter. The various aspects of that theme all come together in the Florida section, which I read enthralled in one sitting, and that pulled my opinion up considerably; I was especially impressed by his subtle portrayal of a failing Utopia. But until the very end, the two threads of the story (in England and at sea) are kept so far apart that when the two cousins finally come back together, they are no longer matched as equals, either in temporal power or spiritual depth."},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"One of the more disappointing Booker prize winners. Ploughs through the slave trade with its the attendant moral dilemas, but this is a vein that has been mined in minute detail in numerous works of fiction for more than a century, thus nothing new here. The shifting-scene decvice is a bit played and try as he might, the author's characters rarely break stereotype. A slog in the true literary sense for no apparent reward - other than giving the author an invitation to write a sequel. Give this one a miss and try Julian Barnes' \\"A Sense of an Ending\\" or Banville's \\"The Sea,\\" both worthy standard bearers for the prize."},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"I read this because it won, with The English Patient, the Booker prize for 1992. Some parts were boring. All the detail about practicing a play seemed pointless to me, and at the end the pidgin English really turned me off because there was so much of it. I was curious about the end, and decided that the end was neither unsatisfactory nor totally satisfactory. I feel my time could have been better spent."},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"Barry Unsworth's Sacred Hunger, is a moderately written novel about a ship during the slave trade. Unswort's novel has too much description which makes it hard to read. He switches scenes almost every other chapter,and the chapters are hard to connect together. The novel does not start to get really interesting until well in the to 400's. When it does get interesting though, the reader will not want to put the book down. This book is definately for someone interested in history, as it takes place in the 1700's during the slave trade. Overall, I'd rate this book a 3 as the ending was really good, but the beginning was just not good."},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"One of the most difficult, slow and overly detailed booksi have ever read.

Luckily I had already read this book, I just ordered it for a friend, thus I could warn him about the idiot cover.

The phrase, Sacred Hunger, refers to the power of total control and, more, the desire to own all of a family, a country, a continent - and this total control is the product of Sacred Hunger. The novel is set in the 17th century in England, America, the Carribbean and Africa.The story behind \\"Sacred Hunger\\" is one of values. Author Unsworth takes to young men, cousins, who need to make money and restore their families' fortunes. One father who is desperate, decides to build a slave ship and use it to buy slaves in Africa which are then traded for cotton and rum in the Caribbean and American colonies. Each of the young men are remarkable for their sense of morality and individual analyses of the characteristics of moral values.Paris, the cousin who becomes a surgeon and is hired as physician on his uncle's slave ship presents a full blown description description of a slave ship, the slaves and captors, captain and crew. The other cousin, Erasmus, stays at home to rescue the family fortune through careful stock market trades. His is a story of complicated love.In an unusual final twist, long after the ship has been lost, the homebound cousin returns to Africa to find his cousin and their ship. In that last quarter of the book, we meet the homeland of the slaves and Indian tribes in Africa.Author Barry Unsworth's historical research and his agility at weaving it into a story is like a theater set design, simply awesome. Likewise his writing skills are flawless. One page into this book and you're his for every page till the last. The prose is magnetic and lyrical - leaning more toward poetry than narrative essay. Although I enjoyed the book as one of the best pieces of literature I've ever read, a good deal of that pleasure came from his use of language. The following are a few of the hundreds that fill the book:a) The Liverpool Merchant crept nearer to the coast through repeated, violent squalls of rain, a suitor drawn by obstinate attraction to brave all rebuffs of the beloved.b) But there was a brightness still about the faces of these fashionable strollers; they had a charmed, invulnerable air, as if blessings were raining invisibly down through the strangely rounded clump-shaped trees.c) The last of the sunshine lay over the settlement and there was no breath of wind. Smoke from the fires rose in slow plumes and the cabbage palms outside the stockade stood motionless and stiff, the dead, withered lower fronds bright rust-colour where the sun caught them.\\"Sacred Hunger\\" is a long book, a great one. The characters are more developed than any I've ever known. Make this the next book on your nightstand. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"The writing is just plain magnificent, if not a little difficult at first;I almost set the book aside after a few pages, but I'm so glad I didn't because it really starts to flow much more easily quickly on. Unsworth's telling of the story of a mid 1700's British slave ship, her crew, and the family financing the journey is nothing short of breathtaking. Rich with historical detail, it's insightful, thrilling, often heartbreaking, and a gem of a good old fashioned read. There were a few chapters at the end I skimmed, feeling the story got a little repetitive, and wanting to get on with the story. It's one of those books that make you sit back and think about what you've read many times throughout; too many amazing passages to let it slip by too quickly.

Indeed, the story's main character, Erasmus Kemp, is a well-to-do white man. The \\"sacred hunger\\" of which the title speaks is that certain something that lies deep inside each of us, the one that motivates and drives us to change the world...sometimes for the better, but more often for the worse. \\"Nothing a man suffers will prevent him from inflicting suffering on others. Indeed, it will teach him the way...\\" is a truth readers see their eyes opened to time and time again...first, in a utopian society forged by the Liverpool Merchant's uprisers that at its core is anything but utopian, and then again even more vividly in Kemp's stop-at-nothing revenge tactics. Harboring deep-seated anger over perceived past transgressions, the sum of his existence will boil down to one hate-filled moment. Readers will walk away from this novel contemplating their own reason for being and perhaps be inspired to embrace a more worthy sacred hunger of their own."},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"Sacred Hunger is a very deep and engaging book, and portrays slavery as more inhumane than most of us ever would have realized.The book's title is essentially synonymous with its theme-greed. Unsworth demonstrates how the desire for money and power led imperialist nations, such as England, to engage in such terrible practices. Unsworth effectively shows that the upper class's desire for economic prosperity can distort their view of humanity so much that they find putting a price on another human's life acceptable. Apart from the desire for money, Unsworth examines another area of greed-Revenge. Erasmus Kemp travels half way around the world, in search of his hated cousin, desiring only to see his death. Erasmus is left to feel quite empty when his cousin dies before Erasmus is able to see him hanged.Sacred Hunger also contains profound irony. The reader learns that it was actually black Africans who were the ones selling the slaves to the European merchants. Accordingly, the most advanced and \\"civilized\\" nations were the ones who actually had laws that legitimized such a barbaric market.Sacred Hunger is an excellent novel because it details the English slave trade from the point of view of the wealthy men who pioneered it, as well as the people who were subjected to its unimaginable cruelty."},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"If you want to become absorbed in a novel, this is one that will sweep you away!

Although it is patchy, a bit dull, and sometimes a bit silly in its launching pages, once it reaches the open sea it presents us with difficult issues dissolved within a gripping plot. The characters are credible and rich. The treatment of history is both deft and deeply affecting.Unsworth is a brilliant sylist, a master of plot and character, and a very intelligent and probing thinker. Within this book he reveals some of the works he likes and admires best, including The Heart of Darkness, Victory, The Tempest and Lord of the Flies, but this novel is not derivative. Rather it situates itself within the tradition of \\"insular\\" stories, that experimental series which examines life and culture cut off from anything beyond the island's shores, and which begins with Homer, It also ranges itself within the tradition of Utopian narratives,experimenting with a mix that goes beyond race to embrace the potential for harmony between former oppressors and those oppressed..I finish this book last night.

I felt as though I was peeking into the mind of an obsessive and obsessed personality, more than one, actually, to the point that they began to make sense to me, which was very unsettling. I really have no words, not being an author, to explain the perfection of how these characters were presented. Every aspect of the human soul, from pure altruism to unbridled greed to overwhelming despair is depicted so clearly that the reader is swept along fascinated and hooked to the very end.The slave trade, while grievous to examine, is only the background for a look at what men can inflict upon each other when driven by their own sense of what is owed them, whether praise, punishment, or pecuniary.Because the novel is set in the 1700's the language is more stilted than we are accustomed to, which slows down the reading some, and then just as the reader kind of gets the hang of that, the author is writing in pidgin which slows it down yet again. But it is so worth every minute, every hour spent soaking up the poetry of Unsworth's written words that you won't mind the pace at all . . . in fact, even after six weeks of reading I was sad to see it end. The good news is that Unsworth has more books. I can't wait to get started on them.If Sacred Hunger could be done justice on the big screen, what a movie it would make! Until then, buy it, borrow it, steal it . . . whatever it takes . . . just read it. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"When I had the opportunity to read Barry Unsworth's \\"Sacred Hunger,\\" I jumped at the chance, and not because this author won the Booker Prize. I didn't know a thing about him, had never heard of him, and couldn't have cared if he had won any prize related to writing. All I knew was that I could receive credit for a directed readings class at my university for reading the novel. The topic I was working on at the time concerned Atlantic history, a hot area of research for historians, and most of the books I read up to this point were lengthy, scholarly works full of footnotes and massive bibliographies. So when my professor suggested the idea of a novel covering many of the same themes, I readily accepted. Who wouldn't take a break from the tedium of academia? I quickly discovered that Unsworth's book involved a bit of work to get through. This novel isn't a mass-market paperback type read, not by a long shot. It's an incredibly well researched, multilayered piece of historical fiction that manages to incorporate nearly every aspect of the slave trade while maintaining a level of prose that would make Charles Dickens stand up and applaud.\\"Sacred Hunger\\" follows many characters throughout its 600 plus pages, from lowly sailors to venture capitalists to slaves to dozens of other major and minor characters. The overarching storyline involves one William Kemp, a wealthy English cotton merchant currently down on his luck, and his effort to reap a quick profit from the slave trade circa 1750. He commissions the building of a vessel for just such a purpose, hires a bellicose tar by the name of Saul Thurso to helm the ship, and stakes his entire fortune on its success. He even enlists his nephew Matthew Paris, a physician who spent time in prison for challenging church dogma, to serve as the ship's doctor. The book flip flops back and forth from the travails of the slave voyage to the adventures of William's son Erasmus, a dour young capitalist whose plans revolve around marrying the daughter of a wealthy businessman and expanding his own family's holdings once his father passes on. Erasmus's plans come to naught when the slave ship disappears somewhere in the Caribbean, leading to a series of events that take many years to unravel. It takes that long to ascertain that Thurso's ship didn't just disappear into thin air, but was hijacked through a mutiny involving slaves, shipmates, and Matthew Paris.Unsworth spares no effort to convey to the reader a sense of actually witnessing the slave trade up close and personal. We learn of the vile techniques used to impress hapless sailors into maritime service through the stories of unfortunate wretches such as Billy Blair and the fiddle player Michael Sullivan. The book shows us the utter brutality inflicted by Thurso and his subordinates on both slaves and the crew. We sit in open-mouthed wonder as we witness how the captains of these ships bartered with African kings over their \\"cargo.\\" We see the ravages of disease on both slavers and slaves alike. And we quickly understand how the sale of human beings degrades everyone involved, from the merchants to the government to the Africans. The author even takes time out of his busy schedule to show how the English drove a wedge between Indian tribes in their quest to acquire territory in North America. Every negative aspect of Atlantic history--the class issues, slavery, territorial ambition, unrestricted trade, greed, murder, and torture--appear in this book in intricate and often nauseating detail. Don't come into this book expecting a joyful experience. The themes in \\"Sacred Hunger\\" are serious business, and Unsworth treats them as such.Without a doubt, the prose work is the best element of the book. Sentences spark and pop off the page as Unsworth effortlessly captures the tones and rhythms of eighteenth century speech. Whether he's writing dialogue that comes out of the mouths of upper class English elites or the singsong slang of the sailors, the effect is always totally believable. Heck, he even pulls off Pidgin English in the latter part of the book! So excellent is the prose that it's easy to overlook the deep thematic structures of the story. Don't forget that you're reading a narrative that attempts to examine the struggle between unfettered capitalism on the one hand and utopian socialism on the other. A deep pessimism about free markets seems to run throughout the book, which I don't necessarily agree with, but at the same time Unsworth doesn't reject that form of social organization entirely. I don't want to spoil the conclusion for you, but it's obvious at the end that the author recognizes that socialism isn't all its cracked up to be either. No matter what your position is regarding political organization, this book will definitely make you challenge your dearly held convictions. If you seek a more challenging theme than the rather obvious capitalism/socialism duality, try to identify each character's \\"sacred hunger.\\"Speaking of the conclusion (which I still won't spoil), did anyone else wonder about the character's sudden questioning of everything he held dear up to that point? I know I did. An individual this single-minded and...well...evil most likely wouldn't possess the mental faculties necessary to examine his motivations. I'll grant that this ending helped take some of the gruesome edges off the story, and it is poignant in its own way, but it just doesn't make much sense. Perhaps Unsworth wanted to leave his readers with a glimmer of hope that exploitation could give way to compassion and introspection. Whatever the case, pick up this book when you get a chance and follow the brass button. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"I read this book about three years ago, and some of the passages are still etched vividly in my mind. The writing in amazingly lush. As some reviewers have already pointed out, there is a great deal of detail in some of the passages which, in lesser hands, could be terribly boring (Like in Millhauser's &quot;Martin Dressler&quot;). But here, they are magical. This is one of the few books where I would actually stop periodically to re-read the previous couple of pages just to savor the writing once again. Unsworth is a gifted writer who paints luxurious pictures on every page. The passages about crossing the ocean in the hold of a slave ship are harrowing.But this book succeeds because of more than just good writing. The plot is complex and compelling, and the characters are entirely real. I'm normally not a fan of historical fiction, but this one is a real winner."},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"Make no mistake about it, reading Sacred Hunger is a significant undertaking -- both in terms of the impact this complex and epic story will have on you and because of the time and concentration it will take to navigate the book's more than 600 pages. That significance is something to savor.I will avoid the clich&eacute; of saying that the story &quot;has it all,&quot; but Sacred Hunger does come close to that. There's the adventure of a band of men moving between three continents and pushed until they snapped and yet optimistically deciding to create what they saw as a kind of utopia, there is an examination of the cruelty that humans are capable of inflicting on each other, the story includes an accurate lesson in a period of history and its economics and geography, a touching love story, a metaphor for modern times.Curiously, the pages also include the story of a small brass button. I still haven't decided what the button represents, but I did note that it is the only thing in the story that manages to survive all the kinds of hell the length of the story includes, changing hands at least six times between the beginning of the book and its final pages and yet it ends up no worse off.The title of this volume refers to its grandest theme, the desire that drives men to extreme action. It is in this aspect that the book shines brightest, as the term is defined differently but compellingly for each of the main characters, especially the two main characters, cousins Erasmus Kemp and Matthew Paris.There is a sacred hunger in almost all of the less central characters as well, in Michael Sullivan (the fiddle player who longed to be treated like a man ... and only person to own the brass button twice), in Billy Blair (who was robbed of his money and who ended up a judge), in Saul Thurso (the captain who never failed his owners), even in many of the slaves and the other seamen forced into service, and in the soldiers camped in Florida and Africa. Therein lies one of the potential stumbling blocks for readers of Sacred Hunger: it includes a great many characters and to really understand the book it is imperative to remember who came from where and which character has a problem with or a debt to whom. Most of the crew is introduced starting with chapter 12, and I found myself referring back to that part of the book often to remember the particulars of certain figures. Later, it is also important to remember the characteristics of different African tribes involved in the story.There are few female characters in the book, and those who do appear can seem unconvincing compared to the complex representations of many of the men. Similarly, I found myself wishing I knew much more about the artist and philosopher Delblanc, who comes into the story late but who plays an absolutely key role. If I have a criticism of the book it is the way Delblanc is developed.But I use the conditional on that point because I am not sure if I do indeed have a criticism of the book. It is easy to seek out minor discrepancies or personal critiques in a volume of this size and scope, but the fact remains that sacred Hunger is a breathtaking story, the best I've read in some time."},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"Our Seattle-area book club members were mixed in their praise for Sacred Hunger. Some count it has one of the top five books of our club's five year history; others note the merits of the book, but are turned off by what they feel are unnecessary details throughout the story. We all agree that Unsworth has an astute eye for capturing what motivates his characters and for re-creating the spirit of the mid-18th century slave trade and class system of England. We also agree that Sacred Hunger is a unique mixture of an epic sea-faring tale and a moral examination of a society dominated by greed at any humanitarinan cost. Whether it's freedom (however ephemeral), revenge, or greed, the reader cannot mistake each character's moments of pain or contentment made possible by the desolate clarity of Unsworth's prose. Give it a try. Suffer the play scenes. The themes and characters of Sacred Hunger will not disapoint you."},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"Barry Unsworth's novel Sacred Hunger is an exquisitely crafted tale of commerce and corruption set in 18th century England, at the heart of which lies the tension between the moral characters of two cousins. Erasmus Kemp is the intense, arrogant son of a slave ship owner, who holds the prevailing opinion of the day that the lawful accumulation of wealth is the only way a man should live his life. Mathew Paris is the ship's doctor recently rescued from prison by his uncle for publishing blasphemous and seditious views on evolution. Their relationship is set against the backdrop of the Liverpool Merchant's ill-fated voyage to Africa to buy slaves, and the mutiny that follows.Paris is a thoughtful and troubled man whose constant battle against pride enriches him with a humanity and compassion that are beyond his cousin's reach or understanding. The respective self awareness of the two characters is fascinating: while Kemp has no conscious doubt whatsoever that right is on his side, Paris is plagued by self-doubt and guilt at his wife's death while he was in prison. Kemp's hatred for Paris is a deep-rooted one, possibly founded on the sub-conscious knowledge that it is in fact his cousin who is the better man, despite what society would have him believe. Kemp possesses power and wealth, but these aren't enough to combat the monomania of his hatred for Paris and its tragic consequences. Unsworth portrays vividly the moral bankruptcy that festers at the heart of 18th century English society, where the kidnapping and trading of human beings is seen as a lawful enterprise while the mere expression of views contrary to the current religious ones is seen as unlawful and pernicious. Sacred Hunger attempts a formidable examination of human nature and what man can be driven to inflict on man for the sake of power and wealth, and the author succeeds in what he sets out to do with admirable assurance. The quality of Unworth's prose is astonishing. He writes with an economy and grace that no other contemporary author (that I know of) can match. The period detail is beautifully drawn and the style spare and evocative.Sacred Hunger is a magnificent book: it really does rival the great Victorian novels in terms of its scope of ambition, moral exploration, convincing characterisation and marvellous scene setting. I cannot believe that there has been a better historical novel published in the last twenty years."},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"This is one of the most painful books I have ever read, and my action of mailing copies to my closest friends is both an action of great friendship and great sadism. This story of the slave-trade and a new society formed after one slave-ship escapes -- through sickness, mutiny, opportunity -- pains as much as it pleases. Characters we live with and love are hunted down by characters who see them only as animals. We see both societies that can come about, only to face the fact that they will not be permitted to exist -- will be hunted mercilessly.And from the very beginning of the book, we know that events will come to a very bad end, that a paradise found will be recalled only by a pathetic old man (who we later know in his youth) whose strange stories tell us, before the book unfolds, that paradise will be lost -- *is* lost before it is even found. As for the irony of the title, *Sacred Hunger* seems to be the insatiable imperialistic drive towards hierarchy according to skin color, slavery, world expansion. It is small consolation that their seems no curbing of that voracious hunger.I find that once I send this book to a friend, I follow up to make sure it's been read. Like Coleridge's wedding guest, I need to impart this story. I lurk near the wedding guests, ready to leap out with the tale.It reached my soul, and may yours."},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"Unsworth! You have given us a truly marvelous epic--one which crisscrosses the Atlantic, from women who sip sweet tea in England, to the slave trade in Africa and the Carribean, where their sugar cane is made. There is a battle for the soul of the West--a gut-wrenching search for decency and humanity, pitted against the cruelest kind of marketplace.Naked power made manifest in patriarchy and White supremacy scour the novel, seeking out any who dare to challenge it; a 'free market' destroying and enslaving those who confront it.I dream that this will be a epic mini-series one day. In any case, it is a tale for the ages--a story of rich characters and moving human struggles. Truly this is a mighty and masterful work of art."},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"Sacred Hunger is a powerful book set during the years 1752-1765. The story revolves around the merchant familly Kemp that enters into the slave trade - allowing passage on the slaver &quot;The Liverpool Merchant&quot; to the cousin Mathew Paris, a doctor recently released from prison. Unsworths book explores the slave trade, highlighting the rationale, in painful detail - and paints a sordid picture of the merchant mind of the time. &quot;The Sacred Hunger&quot; is allowed to emcompass everything, even human life.For anyone interested in history in general, and Africa in particular &quot;The Sacred Hunger&quot; is an essential but painful read. It leaves you touched, deeply, on behalf of the millions of life lost to the inhuman trade."},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"Good writers can \\"spin a good yarn\\" from the point of view of one, perhaps two or three, characters. The better writers (in my opinion) are good at getting into the minds of several of their own diverse creations. The very best writers must do that and more; they must be masterminds, able to weave these separate tales into a whole rope to hang their realized universe upon. Barry Unsworth has achieved mastermind status here in Sacred Hunger.Sacred Hunger is a story that explores 17th Century Britain's quest to increase its empire through financial means (though most of us are more familiar with Britain's wartime strategies of that period). Through the eyes of men from all walks of life, we see the birthing, launch and journey of a merchant ship bound for the slave trade in Africa. Individual human dramas course through the tale: the merchant Kemp who is pinning his last hopes upon the profits from this voyage; his son Erasmus, whose future as an upwardly mobile husband-to-be depends on a perfect reputation; members of the crew who are kidnapped or tricked into signing on; a captain who secretly barters human blood for safe passage with unknown deities; and the ship's doctor, Matthew Paris, for whom this posting is a strange penance for his sins past.Matthew Paris slowly develops as the sympathetic underdog, observing and participating in the slave trade with steadily growing sense of conviction and dread. I believe he is Unsworth's archetype of the best of our civilized Western world, with all of his intelligence and compassion. Erasmus Kemp is Paris' counter, amoral and ruthless once his youthful hopes for romance have begun to sour. We follow into the turnings of their minds most often throughout this tale, and it is through these two that we glimpse Unsworth's best insights into the Great Question of human nature that the author is exploring, namely: would mankind, if shed of the evils of modern civilization and living in Paradise, be able to abide together peacefully?Forgive me for inserting this paragraph here: Although female points of view are conspicuously absent for most of Sacred Hunger's narrative, it is a mark of Unsworth's regard for women that their characters demonstrate the most courage and common sense of all the people in this story. One almost gets the sense that the author is slyly hinting that if the base egos and ambitions of the men were removed entirely from the picture, the answer to the Great Question might be yes. But that may just be my own particular bias showing:)Unsworth proves tops at insights into the lowliest and loftiest themes. He is convincing with his portrayals of both the speech of the 18th Century English upper classes, the harsher mutterings of the sailors and the hybrid languages of Africans and islanders. He is faithful in historical details of both the opulent and the guttural, without losing any of his philosophical scope. Rich, poetic imagery saturates Sacred Hunger, and in the end that is as good a reason as any to spend some hours on this book. Read it for that, and for the many days of ponderings that you will be left with once you are done.-Andrea, aka Merribelle"},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"I have little but praise for this remarkable novel;in every way - prose, pacing and characterizations and fidelity to history - this is a stupendous achievement. I read that Unsworth suffered from a protracted bout of writer's block and depression in the course of bringing this story into the world, but it's impossible to guess that from the fluency, clarity and power of the final result. _Sacred Hunger_ is the work of a visionary and subtle moralist.Unsworth has performed one of those feats of which gifted artists are capable: like Bruce Beresford's film _Black Robe_ or Wynton Marsalis's &quot;Blood in the Fields&quot;, Unworth has put a human face,etched in pathos, on an entire body of history. Historians have recently begun exploring the history of New World Slavery, the slave trade, and the so-called Atlantic world in depth again (Ira Berlin, Robin Blackburn, John Thornton, Philip Morgan, Wilma King to name just a few of them). By and large, the historians in this field are exceptionally good ones, remarkably free of cant and jargon, but it is a sad truth that -- barring some instance of pop cultural sychronicity -- even the most lucidly presented histories will almost never find a mass public audience. Yet, discussion of slavery, the original sin at the heart of the American errand into the wilderness, continues to languish beneath the withering rays of national denial and indifference.Unsworth rehydrates this vital discussion, by imagining a fictional, but utterly compelling and convincing, world. The narrative grid he constructs is virtually untarnished by unearned sentiment despite the Dickensian aspect. Unsworth gives readers so much to savor and ponder. The soul murder inherent in every aspect of Atlantic slavery is embodied here: the sexual economy of the slave trade (in the form of Erasmus Kemp and his pursuit of a bride), the catastrophic bleeding away of an entire continent to service the luxuries of another, the corruption engendered by this unacknowledged equation,and the reduction of slavers and enslaved alike in to mere commodities, mired in mutual fear, contempt and self-hatred. In the face of all this, occasional lapses in characterizations or voice (I wish that many of the African characters, particularly Kireku and Tabikali had been explored in greater depth) in the text are entirely immaterial. To paraphrase Ferlingetti: like Goya, in Unworth's greatest scenes we seem to see the people of the world at precisely the moment they first attained the title of &quot;Suffering Humanity.&quot; The final page will break your heart."},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"I can but echo the comments others have made about how utterly magnificent \\"Sacred Hunger\\" is. I recommend it without hesitation. Rich with detail and sharply drawn, it makes an impression not quickly forgotten. Ostensibly the story of a slave ship joining the British merchant fleet in the 1750s, Unsworth manages to capture the spirit of the times, though I am not sure if it is ultimately those times or our times.The primary dramatic tension in the narrative arises from Unsworth's portrait of two cousins. On the one hand, Matthew Paris is a sort of poor cousin who was imprisoned for questioning Anglican dogma. In despair and somewhat resigned to humiliation, he agrees to serve as the physician on the slave ship. While he seeks only to degrade himself, he cannot escape degrading others. Erasmus Kemp, the owner's son, is a type still very much with us. The reader loathes him, and all like him, as he understands no morality but money and the pursuit of profit, the \\"sacred hunger\\" referred to in the title. Although inexorably juxtaposed, the cousins sprang from the same soil, from the same genes, and are related in ways impossible to sever. This tension remains familiar in our cultural impasse. Like it or not, we are all a part of the system that produced the slave ships in the first place. We are all products of capitalism, less important than the wealth of nations, and all of us benefit, in ways large or small, from the exploitation of faceless people who live far away in presumed darkness.The image of America itself in the novel reinforces this ambivalence, and yet provides the only hope. As the British colonized America, from Maine to Florida, slavery was an accepted and acceptable part of the economic system. No loud voices protested; only soft voices, far out of the mainstream, might have dared to complain. Yet, after the slaves and this crew in this novel overthrow the captain, while he is in the process of committing mass murder in the name of cutting losses, they find their way to Florida and establish a commune of sorts. The latter part of the novel portrays the settlement after twelve years, when tensions began to arise, again, between those who promulgate the theories of equality and those who seek gain at others' expense. America was their only hope, their only safe port, and ultimately is the hope of all of us. In spite of the forces of wealth and power arrayed against us, in spite of steps backward during reactionary periods, things are possible here that can only be dreamed elsewhere.Rich and disturbing, beautiful and horrible, \\"Sacred Hunger\\" accomplishes more in one volume than many writers can accomplish in a career. It draws us back from visions of utopia while it makes us hope for something better. As the captain said earnestly enough, \\"If they would make the best of their condition, a slaveship could be a happy ship.\\" Here is a toast to all who refuse to accept their conditions, whether as a slave in the 1750s or a corporate employee these days. Read this book and think, if you dare."},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"The New York Times said Sacred Hunger is a book to be read slowly and savored. For once, they were absolutely right. It is like Napoleon Brandy or fine wine - a few &quot;sips,&quot; pages, at a time is a pleasure to be savored. Like all fine literature, this book has a plot that is a backdrop for a constant truth of human nature. The plot, set in mid 18-century England and, later, the West Indies, concerns a fortune made by a father, who, at the book's beginning, is now on the verge of losing it. His hope for saving that fortune is a slave ship, whose fortunes are not nearly as bright as the owner hopes. After the owner's death, his son strives to rebuild the family's name and fortune. Perhaps this may seem to reveal too much of the plot, though the plot is truly only the backdrop for the Sacred Hunger felt by all societies since time began. This is a rare book. Mr. Umsworth weaves his backdrop so completely that the reader easily becomes one with it, and, in doing so, eventually understands the &quot;Sacred Hunger.&quot;"},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"I can't say that I enjoyed reading this book. But I did find it fascinating, enlightening, wonderfully written and thought provoking. The title refers to the hunger for profit and societal status that is evidently engrained in human beings-- at least some of us, maybe most of us-- and the cost of this hunger to the rest of humanity. Set in the mid-18th century, the two central characters are English cousins. Erasmus Kemp is the son of an ambitious merchant whose hopes for financial redemption lie in a slave ship that he is backing. Erasmus is a materialistic, self-centered young man who is focused only on his own aggrandizement. He hates his cousin Matthew Paris, who is everything Erasmus is not. Paris is a doctor, an intellectual, and a progressive thinker. He's been imprisoned for publishing his heretical views on evolution, and while he was being humiliated and incarcerated his beloved wife and unborn child died. He's guilt-ridden and doesn't much care about his future, which is why he agrees to become the physician on the slave ship his uncle owns.No one, it seems, is blameless in the slave trade. Not the sailors forced into service and treated, in some cases, as cruelly as the human cargo. Not the Africans who sell their captured countrymen for beads and muskets. Not the English, whose hunger for worthless and harmful sugar fuels their hunger for an inhuman trade in humanity. Not Matthew Paris, who, despite his distaste for cruelty and injustice, is complicit in the slave trade. He examines the Africans brought on board to ensure that they are healthy enough to survive the journey so they can be resold.It's clear from the beginning of the novel that nothing good will ultimately come of all this. How could it? But for a brief time there is hope A Paradise found. A Paradise lost.Barry Unsworth's view of human nature may be on target. It may be the way things were and are and always will be, in one way or another.

I am Mary Todaro&#8217;s husband.One of my former professors, David Kirby, poet at FSU, was commenting about &#8220;Sacred Hunger&#8221; on facebook. I was curious. As soon as I began reading I knew I had a unique piece of contemporary art in my hands, albeit steeped in history. Unsworth writes fiction like a poet, describes every scene, character, and every detail--physical and of the heart and soul-- as if you see a painting on every turned page. Collectively then &#8220;Sacred Hunger&#8221; is a cartography of man&#8217;s soul on Earth in all its glorious tragedy, all of it&#8217;s terrible selfish selling out.

However, in addition to it being about the horrors of a slaveship, this book is really a statement about human greed for power and the perils of capitalism. From Sara Wolpert realizing that Erasmus wants to \\"own\\" her, to the bribery of officials by Erasmus, to the obvious fact of the human slave trade, and finally to the quest for power among the idyllic citizens of the cartoonish Eden the author constructed, the conclusion one draws from this book is that the desire to own or to have power over other people is a base, human instinct."},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"Just finished reading Barry Unsworth's \`92 Booker Prize Winner, Sacred Hunger; an epic tale of human diminution in the name of survival and the way life happens, as we are told growing up: success, power, desire, dominion over other human beings, and a hunger for profit, the sacred hunger--all are necessary for survival. The characters in the 600-page long odyssey grotesquely prove this thesis, instilled by an all-devouring capitalism of 1750s and 60s, swearing on the beneficence of the slave trade, not only for the white colonists of Europe and America, but also for the caged slaves, the \\"wretched heathens.\\" The relevance of the 18th century commerce argument couldn't be any closer to the cut-throat race to the extinction of human society of today, for its goals of achieving material progress at any cost. Competitions, deadlines, ownerships are just as fierce as they were on the shores of West Africa over two centuries ago. The military industrial commerce still thrives on fomented conflicts among nations, just as it did when it instigated wars among the tribes to capture the prisoners of wars, the commodity of the slave trade. Noam Chomsky aptly captures the driving force behind capitalist marketing, to which he calls the manufacturing of desire--the desire for objects one won't need. These mundane desires for Western European trivia and its weapons would start an endless cycle of the most dangerous game, the game of hunting and capturing living breathing human beings, just like a jungle quarry. The principles of this savage trade, no matter how beastly, were held sacred, except when inconvenient. The sheer span of the geographical setting, from England to Guinea to Florida, makes the story of the life in early 18th century, a story of boundless scope. Yet, in this subhuman commerce, there were a few souls disenchanted with all what they were part of, begrudgingly. At just the right time, they rise against what's grossly unjust and try to undo the wrong. But, do they get to do it?"},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"Our book club just finished reading and discussing Barry Unsworth's, Sacred Hunger. Some of us read it for the second time. A sequel entitled, The Quality of Mercy, slated for August, had many of us feeling that it would be good to go back and take another look at the first one. When mulling over this idea, we stated that in all the years of reading, in comparison with the many books we have read, Sacred Hunger remains one of our great favorites. Our book club is not alone in that assessment: it won the Man Booker Prize, the top honor for literary fiction, in 1992, tying with Michael Onadatje's, The English Patient. Being that it was extremely unusual to have a tie, one can only imagine the endless discussion and I daresay, heated arguments, taking place by the esteemed panel of judges. Since they could not give one even a slight edge over the other, they settled on co-winners which I am sure neither author minded.When asked what Sacred Hunger is about and answering that the drama takes place on a slave ship, understandably there was some reluctance. After all, could there be a more disturbing topic? We all have a sense of the truly ghastly conditions on board those vessels of despair, so therefore, one might ask, what more do we need to know? Plenty, as it turns out.Unsworth puts us in the mind of the merchant who builds the ship and sets out on this endeavor. Therein lies the dramatic tension, coupled with a growing awareness of the genuine ability we share as human beings to justify almost anything. It was perfectly legal at the time and a good business; the reality of conditions on board were an entirely different matter. They were to set sail from England carrying trade goods which would enable them to acquire slaves. They would then pick up the cargo in Africa, that's right cargo, and deliver the said goods to Jamaica. The plan was to sell the slaves there, in exchange for sugar and rum. They would then sail back to England with a ship full of the spoils of free labor, sell the goods and make a tidy sum in the process.Because few sailors would work on slave ships they were often \\"Shanghaied\\" into service, making their experience not much better, except for the fact that they would at least earn a wage. Conditions on board were described with such clarity that one simply comes away with a sense of awe at the descriptive powers inherent in Barry Unsworth's work. Each morning the slaves would be brought up on deck, with shackles clanging, and made to dance to the fiddle, a practice widely employed, in order to keep them fit. The strength of this marvelous book lies in the author's power to create an inescapable mood.Here is an excerpt from page 233:\\"The moon was high and clear of cloud, astoundingly radiant, eclipsing the stars. Moonlight gleamed in a sheet of silver over the marshes and flats of mud they had crossed to come here, so cluttered and tawdry by day, all unified and resplendent now as if lying under some moment of blessing. And for a moment this transforming moonlight was confused in Paris's mind with the sunlight of earlier, the form of the woman edged with fire against the bars. 'It is not even true that I want to die,' he said, and with this ultimate confession he saw the moonlit levels run together and glimmer, as if washed in some thin solution of silver, and then blur to bright webs, as the tears, held long in check, came freely now to his eyes,\\"The author, described as slim and elegant, was born in Wingate, England to a family of miners. He lived in Tuscany in later years, devoting his time to writing. I was shocked to learn that he left this world recently, on the same day as fellow writer Ray Bradbury, June 5, 2012 whose passing captured the bulk of the press releases of the day. Was he fated to be paired with others? If so, it is of little consequence. His writing will find its place among the greats of our time, and it will live on.If writing itself is a journey, then tales of an epic voyage that goes badly wrong, as if ill fated from the start, take their place among the greatest stories ever told. So it is with Sacred Hunger. Place this novel along side Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness; it is that good."},{"Title":"Sacred Hunger","review":"This powerful and complex novel is an extended depiction of expanding European capitalism in the 18th century. The sacred hunger of the title is described explicitly by some of the characters as the profit motive. Much of the book is the detailed story of a slave trading voyage with graphic descriptions of the acquistion of slaves in Africa and the sufferings of the Middle Passage. Through a complex but very convincing plot, Unsworth also shows the unforgiving nature of capitalist enterprise in Britain and brutal nature of imperialistic expansion in North America.The quality of writing is outstanding in all respects. The 2 main characters are a pair of English cousins, one a ruthless businessman, the other a physician-scientist who is something of an Enlightenment radical. Their opposing characters, moral positions, and views of human nature constitute something of a dialogue that runs throughout the book. There are a large number of other well developed characters. Unsworth's view of capitalism and the profit motive, which is manifested not only in one of the main characters but also in several important subsidiary characters, is complex. Somewhat like another great novel of capitalist expansion, Conrad's Nostromo, the profit motive is a manifestation of other, complex psychological phenomena, in this case, the need of some for domination.The descriptive writing is remarkably powerful and the complex plot, which has explicitly Shakespearean elements, allows an unusually clever exploration of human greed and idealism. Unsworth presents and analyzes not only 18th century capitalism and imperialism but also important aspects of Enlightenment idealism and emergent Rousseau-like romanticism. As a novel, this book is simply excellent and as a successful fictionalization of an important historical phenomenon, this book has few peers."},{"Title":"Come the Vintage (Harlequin Presents #133)","review":"I liked the turnaround where the hero, Chad Foster, is the one being stalked and the bodyguard is the heroine, Jenna Wakefield.

Only the heat of the sun by the pool caused me stop and seek somewhere more cool. This book continues, where Infiltrator left off. I enjoyed the little references to present day events and trivia (star wars fans will find it amusing). I feel that the author really tried to be true to some aspect of time travel (if thats possible) and the way the original timeline keeps trying to reestablish itself. Saying more, would give away to much. Needless to say, it was an interesting twist in the tale.Anyway, if you enjoyed Infiltrator, you will look forward to reading Rising Storm (although, the title as very close Approaching Storm for the star wars buffs...same concept?)You must however read Infiltrator first to truly get into this book. I hope there is more in the series, since there were some loose ends that were not tied up."},{"Title":"Career perspectives: Parenting and career choice : a handbook for parents to help their children with career decisions : elementary guide","review":"Twice Sarah Connor and her son John have been able to prevent Judgment Day, the time when Skynet becomes sentient and declares war on its creators the human race. After the last attack on Cyberdyne, the company that was started to create the Skynet program, the American government took the project away from the independent contractor and placed it in the hands of scientists hidden away in a top secret installation in Antarctica.One of the scientists on the base is an Infiltrator, an organic computer in human form that wants to make sure that Skynet will come into existence. John and Sarah Connor and their ally and good friend, ex-spook Dieter Von Rossbach have put into place a group of people who will be ready to fight when Judgment day arrives and the machines try to annihilate humanity. When the Connors and Dieter learn about the base in Antarctica, they prepare themselves to once more go up against an enemy determined to destroy them.T2: RISING STORM stays true to the story line developed in the Terminator movies and takes the plot one step closer to the day the Skynet computer becomes sentient. Although this is an exciting action-adventure thriller, it is also human relationship drama. The mother-son bond between Sarah and John is beautiful to witness and the audience truly feels sorry for the lives they must lead if they want to prevent the extinction of mankind.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Career perspectives: Parenting and career choice : a handbook for parents to help their children with career decisions : elementary guide","review":"There are points in T2 INFILTRATOR and in this current book that I especially like.One is the fact that the present day characters are now on their own with no help from robots from the future. Then there is the nature of villains they face...not robots programmed to kill but cyborgs with some human qualities (but not those that will make them more likeable) directing terminators. There's the slow progress being made by Skynet which prompts changing strategies on the part of our heroes. Finally, we have the philosophical theories concerning time which suggests that any attempts to change the future are defeated by the nature of times itself. Rather a fatalistic, pre-deterministic stance, but interesting.Both of these volumes are highly recommended."},{"Title":"Career perspectives: Parenting and career choice : a handbook for parents to help their children with career decisions : elementary guide","review":"Anyone who loved the movie T2 and the Terminator universe will love this series. This is what the Terminator movies should have been like after T2.

Then the fun really begins!Pick this one up!"},{"Title":"Career perspectives: Parenting and career choice : a handbook for parents to help their children with career decisions : elementary guide","review":"Stirling's follow up to Infiltrator is not quite as good but it still provides plenty of thrills. Dieter Von Rossbach, ex-Sector agent and template for the T-101 Terminator, is a worthy addition to the Terminator mythos. He's an excellent character and a role model for future savior of humanity John Connor. Lots of action and features a twist to the creation of Skynet that was unexpected. Loads of action and character development for John Connor. The villian is not quite as interesting as her predecessor and this detracts from the enjoyment of the novels but she's still effective enough. Cameos by two characters from the first two films may bring a smile to your face. Stirling's prose is quick moving and engaging and he knows how to write thrilling action. He knows the characters of Sarah and John Connor quite well. This is shaping up to be an excellent sci-fi trilogy. Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines invalidates the trilogy since it's continuity conflicts with what's laid out here but that's no fault of Stirling. And it will not affect the readers enjoyment of this novel or the first one."},{"Title":"Career perspectives: Parenting and career choice : a handbook for parents to help their children with career decisions : elementary guide","review":"Part two of the T2 trilogy, this book continues the trials of Sarah and John as they try to stay alive, evade the terminator sent back in time to kill them and change the future.

If you are, then read the first, and then read this one!"},{"Title":"Career perspectives: Parenting and career choice : a handbook for parents to help their children with career decisions : elementary guide","review":"Much as I said about T2: Infiltrator, T2: Rising Storm is a well-written sequel #2 to the second Terminator movie--Terminator 2: Judgment Day. In fact, Infiltrator and Rising Storm, written by veteran SciFi writer, S.M. Stirling, are a much better sequels to Terminator 2 than is the third movie in the series.I had hoped, in vain as it turns out, that the next movie (Terminator 3) would follow Stirling's series. Stirling is a powerful fiction writer and his understanding of combative behavior is refreshing. (See some of his other works such as Drakon and Island In The Sea Of Time.)This one is a good read."},{"Title":"Career perspectives: Parenting and career choice : a handbook for parents to help their children with career decisions : elementary guide","review":"What a complete let down after the terrific T2: Infiltrator also by Stirling. This books is a compilation of technobabel crossed with some juvenile fantasy idea of romance that reads as if was jointly written by a room full of screen writers who couldn't agree on anything, and so instead compromised on everything. Here are some of the most nauseating examples that render it impossible to suspend your disbelief: a fully functioning T101 that already has it hands on Dieter is destroyed with a sledge hammer (remember what it took to stop a T101 earlier), despite that fact that both the Sector and the Infriltrators know of their base in Paraguay the Conners and Dieter return it no less than three times from sabotage mission. No surprise the bad guys keep showing up in Paraguay to kill them. The brilliant Tricker can't recognize the Serena Burns clone even with prolonged contact because she died her hair and is wearing glasses. The Serena Burns clone assembles proto-nanites by picking at her fingernails while walking down the halls because it has the slackest camera surveillance. Virtually every player from the original movie is reintroduced including Dr Silberman and even Donald the orderly. The convolutions of the time loops have degenerated from implausible to down right stupid.Save your money.

Which I did. I figured out how it would end less than halfway through. But then, there's the obligatory love interest, the disaproving mother, escapes that are too convenient, and the last one is by far the worst. A needless death of a loved one to turn a character from a sympathetic hero, to a hardened warrior. What a let-down. I could almost have enjoyed the book but for that last one."},{"Title":"Career perspectives: Parenting and career choice : a handbook for parents to help their children with career decisions : elementary guide","review":"This was a really bad book. I kept looking back at the cover to see if I could find (in small print) a co-author who had actually written it. It's hard to believe that Stirling would want to take &quot;credit&quot; for this turkey by himself, particularly after the Infiltrator gem. I fully concur with scifigaltx's review. It has the feel of multiple screenwriters - not necessarily authors - who have communicated their portions by email among themselves.Has the economy sunk so deeply that the publisher has laid off all of the editors who would normally be paid to point out inconsistent points of view and motivations? Where is the reality and believability that Stirling brings to his writing? Can someone tell the real author that action sequences are most effective when they are forced upon the protagonists? Action in this nonsense is always the result of stupidity on the parts of all concerned, and is never a surprise.The real surprise is the first awful book from S. M. Stirling. It happens to all authors, I suppose, but it's disappointing just the same."},{"Title":"Career perspectives: Parenting and career choice : a handbook for parents to help their children with career decisions : elementary guide","review":"After &quot;Infiltrator&quot; the story continues.The book is wonderful and worth reding.

And what a gift it was! I've read it cover to cover many times, and it has sparked in this lay reader a sincere interest in genetic research. It conveyed the excitement of discovery in an understandable and readable way.Then I started looking for additional books that survey the status of genetics research in the same way Genome did. I always wished that another, updated version of Genome would come along. Lo and behold, one did!And now for the disappointing news. The &quot;updated version&quot; doesn't deliver. One short epilogue chapter is added to cover all of the happenings in the field in the past 10 years! Even the pictures are poor in quality, implying to me a rush to press on the part of the publisher. What happened with the experiemental treatments for DMD? What's new on the race to uncover the secrets of cancer? How goes the battle for our ethics to catch up with the science? No answers to be found here that date from any time after early 1990.All this said, the material is still exciting to read, and I would recommend it to someone testing the waters in genetic research. But for those who's interest was sparked by the original Genome, this update isn't worth the money."},{"Title":"Genome: The Story of the Most Astonishing Scientific Adventure of Our TimeThe Attempt to Map All the Genes in the Human Body","review":"A difficult but very important book!

This is our future and we must think about not only the medical promise involved, but the cultural implications it brings. By all means read it!"},{"Title":"Genome: The Story of the Most Astonishing Scientific Adventure of Our TimeThe Attempt to Map All the Genes in the Human Body","review":"Excellent survey of 2 decades of progress in genetics, 1970-1990. The updated part of the book is a 15 page Epilogue, hardly doing justice to the past explosive decade. Authors put great conflict and human interest into their stories, e.g., the couple, each carrying the recessive gene for cystic fibrosis, had each given it to both of two daughters before they realized they were playing genetic casino. They \\"realized their gamble only after they've already lost the bet.\\" The questions of whether to offer a new gene test for a serious malady when no treatment was available were especially troubling to the researchers.Authors present a scary picture for the future role of medicine and physicians. Doctors will have to order genetic profiles to avoid malpractice. In pharmacogenetics, drug companies will take one's blood to develop personalized medicine to avoid side effects. The profile will allow them to peek into your health, your personality, your IQ potential and physical skills. With that genetic profile they can, with their pals the insurance companies, become tyrannical Big Brothers.Authors try to raise red flags about future genetic discrimination. They don't seem to realize how much of current discrimination is already based on genetics. Society has been coping with discrimination for centuries. They mention the probable arising of a biological underclass (perhaps like the caste of untouchables in India?) and see that a genetic profile could become a scarlet letter following one throughout one's life. Employers would get the data and make a group unemployable. But aren't there already laws protecting the handicapped? In the near future most everyone will be seen with defective genes and partially handicapped.Perhaps, however, Author's concern about a hereditary meritocracy is just genetic hocus-pocus. One's current illusions of choice and one's ignorance of the current genetic basis to behavior are likely to continue. The realization that one typo in the replication of a gene can cause a defect or disease is not likely to change one's current illusions of self control. The vast number of 3 billion interrelated nucleotides will more than likely always keep both science and lay people amazed at the complexity of human life."},{"Title":"Genome: The Story of the Most Astonishing Scientific Adventure of Our TimeThe Attempt to Map All the Genes in the Human Body","review":"My dad has worked closely with Mike Waldholtz in revealing the dynamics of genetic research as it moves from a descriptive science into an actual tool in medicine.

He is a staff officer for Kenneth Widmerpool, a major at headquarters. Widmerpool is a school associate. As a schoolboy Widmerpool was unpopular. General Liddament cherishes Trollope, but Nick responds that he has never found Trollope easy to read. General Liddament believes that a transfer will make better use of Nick's gifts.Nick runs into Charles Stringham as the new waiter at the mess hall. Widmerpool contends that Stringham was a a badly behaved boy at school, (and that his low position isn't surprising. At the same time Widmerpool is nervous that he will be connected with Stringham and so where possible he uses his efforts to get Stringham moved.) Stringham does not want to go to dinner with Nick. It isn't just that they would be violating the provision prohibiting fraternization, it is easy to hide in London, he doesn't want to change the rhythm of his routine as a waiter.On leave, Nick has dinner with Hugh Moreland, the composer, who, as a consequence of the war, is finding a lot of employment in the music field. Following up on the help and information provided by General Liddament, Nick is interviewed and offered a postion to serve as a liaison with the Free French. Alas, he is unable to show mastery of the French language and so must pass up that opportunity. Although Nick makes a botch of the language test, Major Finn tells him he will keep him in mind should something else arise.Relatives of Nick's wife are killed that same night, as Nick dines with Moreland, in a bombing raid. Returning to the mess, Nick learns that Stringhamm, subject to the machinations of Widmerpool, among others, has been transferred to the laundry, an outfit that is to receive orders to go abroad.This novel places the reader in the thick of things in wartime London and the armed forces. Nick and the other men of his generation are really too old to be placed on active duty, but they feel compelled to do something to express their patriotism. This volume seems less episodic, more structured, and more solid than some of the other books in the series. All are excellent in their way, it is just that this one, given the events portrayed, has a more serious tone."},{"Title":"The Soldiers Art","review":"THE SOLDIER'S ART is the eighth novel of Anthony Powell's long work \\"A Dance to the Music of Time\\" and the second covering World War II. Nicholas Jenkins continues to serve in a division in Northern Ireland, suffering the whims of new superior Kenneth Widmerpool. No longer, however, is the war a distant rumour. The narrator's companions are sent off to battlefields across Europe and Asia, English civilians are suffering daily bombings, and Jenkins himself is tasked with overseeing anti-aircraft batteries.Indeed, characters start dying in earnest. Powell is at his most effective in conveying the tragedy of these deaths when they are mentioned in passing. After a vivid sketch of some character's colourful personality, Powell concludes with the aside like \\"But then he was killed by a landmine a week before the German surrender.\\" When Powell does depict deaths right \\"on screen\\" as it were, he does so in a flat and unconvincing fashion. THE SOLDIER'S ART became for me the least satisfying volume of the Dance because of the middle section where Jenkins sees several people dear to him die on one London night.There are still some memorable elements of the novel, however. Stringham returns, cured of his alcoholism but more pitiful and melancholy than ever before: though he's of the same generation as Jenkins, he's become an old man already. I was let down a bit here, but I still look forward to what the Dance has next."},{"Title":"The Boys","review":"Written by Henri De Montherlant in 1969, the story is set in France of the 1910's, and reflects all of the society of that time. It is a dark and brooding story of the friendship between two schoolboys. A constricting cloud of Catholicism permeates the story, and acts as one of the heavies in the plot.Alban, sixteen years old and the heir to a dukedom, joins a new school. Here he discovers a culture, officially encouraged by the teachers, where the boys form close attachments. He pairs off with the younger Serge, who is only fourteen. The two are attracted to each other, and fall in love.While falling in love and forming a couple is OK, the school applies a high moral tone, and forbids any intimacies beyond hand holding and kissing.Father de Pradts, a teacher, watches the pair, and warns Alban not to cross the line in his relations with Serge. de Pradts is secretly attracted to Serge, but is in denial. He interferes greatly with the two boys, what with his constant carping and spying. Eventually he manages to get Alban expelled from the school, to break up what he considers an unhealthy relationship. Unfortunately, Serge is also expelled.There is a very tragic ending, involving one of the boys and poison. It is all very depressing, since this need not have happened if the boys had been left alone to develop and enjoy their love for each other. The interfering priest and the strict society of that time play equal parts in formenting the tradegy.The highest interest in this novel would be for its insight and detailing of the behaviour of 1910 France, and in particular the rules applying to teenage boys. For comparison, see the more recent mores shown in the 1945 novel, Special Friendships, by Roger Peyrefitte. This is also the story of the love between two French schoolboys."},{"Title":"Rudyard Kipling (Obras selectas series)","review":"Since I was young, I always heard about Mogly and Baloo in the Jungle book.

I was pleasantly surprised to find a clear and well-written account of the lives of the Popes who saved the Church during great times of crises.The introductory chapter recounts the problems facing the Church and how nine popes faced these tribulations. Starting with the first Bishop appointed by Jesus Saint Peter and ending with Saint Leo the Great. These men planted the seed of our Church. At this time to accept a leadership role in the Church, you knew that it was only a matter of time before you meet a bloody and violent death. And by Constantine's time we begin to see the difference in the Bishops. Those of the east vying for glory and spouting heresies, while those of the west by in large try to keep the faith. The defense of the trinity and Mary were in the forefront between east and west. True men of Faith stood up to defend against these attacks on the Catholic Church.In this book we see popes whose aim was to sanctify men. So every man and everything he did, and therefore every nation and king would be live in the fullness of the Catholic Faith. And strive for all nations would owe fealty to Our Lord and to his earthly vicar, the Pope. And in this book we see strong Vicars of Christ. They do their appointed mission from Christ and stand up for our Church regardless of consequences. And took strong stances against those who refused the fullness of the faith. Enough faith in God to march out and face even one like Attila the Hun. These Popes faced invading invasion, heresy, and pestilence among other opposition while trying to perform their duties as Vicar of Christ."},{"Title":"Our Glorious Popes","review":"I first read this book ten years ago and enjoyed it. I sold it and missed it and bought it again. It is a well written book about our Popes that has enough information to assist the reader in understanding their lives and times and how they shaped our Faith and the world. And in doing so, the reader is able to thank God for our Popes; and better understand our gratitude to Peter, remaining secure in our faith in God's care. It is also very exciting and shows us our part in the greatest adventure there is. There is no remoteness in these descriptions, no feeling as though &#34;these men were too holy and have no relationship to me&#34; that one can feel when reading about some of the Saints. It is also humbling to see that after 2 millennia, ten were chosen, beginning with St. Peter and ending with St. Pus X, since the book was written in 1955. This means to me that it is difficult to be the Holy Father and that our Pope needs our prayers! In reading this book, hope the reader will want to then pray especially for our Pope, the great the good.

In addition to the courageous and charitable actions of several key popes, the important actions of notable historical figures are described that give insights into their character strengths. Emperor Theodosius the Great gives evidence of humility and a God fearing temperment. Charlemagne displays a fatherly love for his subjects and a deep personal commitment to the Christian faith.This book is important because it gives appropriate and due credit to Christianity, more specifically Roman Catholicism, in the shaping of Western Civilization from the time of Constantine to the 20th century. Too many contemporary history books exhibit an animosity to Christianity and its undeniable impact on Western man.The prose is very easy to read and the subject matter is interesting."},{"Title":"The Passive Solar House: Using Solar Design to Heat and Cool Your Home (Real Goods Independent Living Book)","review":"a very disappointed old book ! a book from the seventies! very few pictures, many boards for american countries.

This book is a must read (even if you live elsewhere! :-)"},{"Title":"The Passive Solar House: Using Solar Design to Heat and Cool Your Home (Real Goods Independent Living Book)","review":"I picked up this book in a bookstore in Bar Harbor, Maine and 1 year later built a house around its concepts on the coast in Downeast Maine. The house is performing to expectations. We have had no problems over 3 years.Before proceeding, our building plans were independantly verified by a mechanical contractor. He found that the formulas presented in the book were accurate and dependable.The concrete crib added about $3K to the overall cost of the house (it has a 25'x40' footprint) and the windows had to be specially ordered from Andersen. We also had some trouble finding the 6 mil aluminized mylar.The only departure we made from the plans presented was we decreased the amount of air exchange by 50% over what was recommended. We used an outside air intake that funneled outside air into the crib and the bathroom vents (2) for exhaust. We have had no problems with this.I was fortunate to have found a contractor who was willing to take the time to understand the concept and then successfully build to the specifications. A number of foundation contractors turned us down. The contractor had to do the foundation himself. It went very smoothly.If you are serious about building this house, be sure to have very specific architectural plans for your builder....she/he will need them. Procuring the services of a &quot;green&quot; architect who buys into these stuff is most helpful."},{"Title":"The Passive Solar House: Using Solar Design to Heat and Cool Your Home (Real Goods Independent Living Book)","review":"\\"The Passive Solar House\\" explains in detail a system that the author patented (patents since expired) for a passive design using a concrete slab for thermal mass. There are detailed worksheets to let a prospective homebuilder figure out expected temperatures and available solar intake throughout the United States. Along with the formulas and worksheets, you can figure out how much insulation, concrete slab mass, air duct area, and heating plant capacity you'll need to incorporate the author's system into your house plans. While the author's patents were in effect his company sold dozens of passive solar houses in factory-built modules. Many of those houses are depicted in both exterior and interior photographs.While the thermal slab approach works equally well to buffer temperature swings for both heating and cooling, the book's emphasis is on solar heating. Conventional above-ground construction is assumed for the most part, but the treatment on the \\"sidehill\\" variant can be extended to included earth-bermed or buried houses.The illustrations are generally good. In a few cases they are more diagramatic than detailed; however, with enough attention to the illustrations and the text, most details can be gleaned. (I'm still trying to figure out the spacing relationship between the concrete slab channels and the return air duct, though.) But this is definitely a book more about solar design than engineering or construction.\\"The Passive Solar House\\" could be improved by including more techniques for summer shading (such as awnings and overhangs) rather than just assuming deciduous tree plantings (which are expensive to keep watered in desert regions). Coverage of solar absorption properties of floors and windows would also be helpful.Summary: while not perfect, this is a very good book for explaining the author's thermal slab approach to passive solar design."},{"Title":"The Passive Solar House: Using Solar Design to Heat and Cool Your Home (Real Goods Independent Living Book)","review":"It is amazing how many houses are plopped down in this country with no consideration of the sun. After reading this book, it becomes apparent that even if we built the same houses, but simply oriented them with respect to the sun (i.e., windowed rooms facing south, closets on the north wall, etc.) we could make drastic reductions in our consumption of natural resources.The book has general information on site selection, house layout, etc. but also details a manner of building involving forgoing a basement for a floor of concrete (for thermal mass), window placement and insulating shutters. During the day, the house will not overheat because the 'solar slab' soaks it up, while at night recirculation techniques are outlined that make this heat available and comfortable at night. The book also includes all the formulas used in the calculations of thermal mass, window sizing, etc. Even if you don't plan on building the house in this book, I got some great ideas involving placement of a hearth (a vertical thermal mass) in front of windows to put the sun to work minimizing the need for heating fuel. If you are planning a house, I'd highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Passive Solar House: Using Solar Design to Heat and Cool Your Home (Real Goods Independent Living Book)","review":"I was planning a major two-story, south-facing addition to our home on a slab and wanted passive solar already so I was intrigued by this book. It brings together the need for thermal mass to moderate temperature swings, backup heating needs, and provides much needed cooling assistance. I liked how he determined a practical level of insulation and didn't over engineer that aspect. He also covered air quality issues at length.One small error, I think, was in his design of thermal shutters saying the foil surfaces would reflect heat back into the room while behind wood veneers. I may be wrong, but reflective surfaces don't reflect heat unless there is an airspace adjacent and not up against a solid surface.I would like to see spreadsheets on disk to make it easier to run your own calculations for your home design and for your region. I would also like to see a chapter on making additions to your home like I'm planning. Adding more information about solar water heating would help complete the book too. I'm curious about the author's experience in this area."},{"Title":"The Passive Solar House: Using Solar Design to Heat and Cool Your Home (Real Goods Independent Living Book)","review":"I far as I can see, Kachadorian's houses operate reasonably well because of the passive solar orientation and room layout. The saltbox design deflects cold north winds over the house and adds value. The increased insulation and emphasis on air-tightness also adds value too. The solar slab, at the core of his design, I consider near useless, adding little if any value, and uses purchased heat to heat it up, a no, no, in passive solar design. He sues teh floor as ducts. It is near impossible to get an air-tight floor. There is far too little insulation under the slab too. The house actually needs a heating system, which says something. Kachadorians passive solar saltbox design with superinsulation and being air tight, minus the solar slab (which attracts vermin under your floor) would perform very well.For a house to remain cool and warm it required a high thermal mass of concrete walls and floors with superinsulation around it, not a stick built timber frame.Knowledge of passive solar construction has moved on since Kachadorian did his houses. Look at the Pasiv Solar standard in Germany, who use mainly concrete.If you want to know passive solar principles, then this book will give you that. Ignore the solar slab and build the house out of air-tight masonry, superinsulation and install a Heat recovery and vent system."},{"Title":"The Passive Solar House: Using Solar Design to Heat and Cool Your Home (Real Goods Independent Living Book)","review":"My father found this book and used it, in the Southwest, to design his passive solar heating/cooling system. I am in the process of doing the same. In the winter he needs only a few cords of pine to heat a large 2 story house and in the summer, while I swelter in an appartment w/only North facing glass (!!!), his house is very cool and comfortable. The few negative reviews above appear to be from folks who either didn't pay attention as they read or have pie-in-the-sky \\"theories\\" of what passive solar really can do for you. Kachadorian is an engineer and very pragmatic. He is not a \\"green\\" builder so keep that in mind. His system works very well in real conditions and does so in a cost effective manner if you do the calculations which are all at about the 7th grade level. Id recommend building them in a spreadsheet- easy to do and lets you \\"tweak\\" your design as you go along. Honestly, even if you don't use his system, his calculations are very worth while to design in adequate thermal mass and back-up heating into any house.Good luck!"},{"Title":"The Passive Solar House: Using Solar Design to Heat and Cool Your Home (Real Goods Independent Living Book)","review":"Most of the book discusses the author's (admittedly clever) passive solar designs.

More than this, he inspired Shambhala Publications and was the silent Guru to many practicioners, setting them straight, during the sprititural shopping era of the 60's and 70's. He practiced meditation in the 1930's in San Fransicos's China Town, a lone Westener, and lived a life of a Bodhisattva and Guru until his death. He did this with no thought of gain or without ever promoting himself. His favorite saying was \\" Give Love with no thought of return\\". He practiced and taught this daily. Not with words only, but through his being. The people he worked with are many and some are famous, but that is not the point, His ordinary-ness \\"is\\", and it is captured in this book."},{"Title":"Great Song: The Life and Teachings of Joe Miller","review":"If you have ever wondered if there are any real, American born and raised, GREAT BEINGS, saints, or however you want to describe someone who really knows the score, doubt no longer, Joe Miller was the real thing.

Joe said when asked about what to look for in a teacher, \\"A sense of humor, all the great ones have a sense of humor\\" and Joe had humor by the bucket load. The kind of self-deprecating, never mean, en light tening humor, the best kind. And the he was all heart.

The X-Files Lexicon certainly does not qualify as an invaluable reference guide. It may prove slightly helpful to new fans that have just now begun watching the show in syndication or on DVD, but as long as you have actually watched or will watch the first three seasons of the show, the information in this book is really of little use. On top of that, many of the listings included here feature in-jokes that you may not even understand until your viewing of all the actual shows is complete, by which point you won't need this book.The book is organized in three distinct sections. The first and largest section is an alphabetical listing of important terms, places, and people. Following this is a short summary of all the episodes of the first three seasons. Additionally, you get a &quot;case file datebook,&quot; which features a few scribbled dates and notes on facsimile monthly planner pages. Last and definitely least is a list of &quot;addresses&quot; which qualifies as overkill in my mind.I guess I'm saying this book isn't worth having unless you are an obsessive X-Files fans. When your friends come over, you can point to The X-Files Lexicon as yet another of the many X-Files-related books in your collection, and that in and of itself is about the best use you will be able to come up with for it."},{"Title":"The X-Files Lexicon: X-References from Anti-Walton to Zuni","review":"This book was funny. That's the best way I can put it in words. Most of it was written in dictionary format, but it's best to read it cover-to-cover. Besides, the feeling that you've missed a joke in the book will cause you to read it straight through anyway. I really enjoyed one entry in the &quot;U&quot; section. It's the picture that sells the joke. But all the pictures were in black and white and the episode guide only goes through season 1 and 2. Also, you have to REALLY watch the X-files to understand it all."},{"Title":"The X-Files Lexicon: X-References from Anti-Walton to Zuni","review":"All I have to say is: &quot;Samantha Scully.&quot;"},{"Title":"Lion's Roar of Queen Srimala: Sri-mala-sutra","review":"Books like this are the bread and butter of Buddhist Studies. Or at least they should be. With the passing of a few decades, with sudden shifts and ever cycling trends and tendencies in the academic world, the approach taken in \\"The Lion's Roar\\" here has fallen a bit by the wayside of late. And while it would've been bad (as well as ironic) for the study of Buddhism to get stuck in a permanent rut, it's perhaps all too easy to overlook just how fundamentally essential, even basic, such straightforward studies as this are to the field. And how much hard work they are. This relatively slim volume is the result of over ten years of much painstaking scholarly labor, after all.And it shows, for this is an exemplary work of classic \\"old school\\" Buddhology in all its glory and in all its quirks. That means you get a carefully rendered and fully annotated translation of a classic Buddhist text, in this case the Srimala Sutra, along with a detailed textual study of the sutra with extensive consideration of the sutra's commentarial traditions in India, China, Japan, and Tibet and its overall place in the development of Buddhist thought--all rendered with a disciplined philological exactitude and attention to detail. And yes, that also means you get a pronounced textual and doctrinal bias, a sense of Sanskrit as absolutely definitive with a sort of underlying but persistent anxiety when as in this case no Sanskrit copies of the sutra are extant (and the several Chinese and Tibetan translations in existence differ somewhat among themselves), and last but not least whole swaths of the book where the footnotes encroach further and further up the page and seriously threaten to push the main text off entirely.The sutra itself is interesting in many respects, if prone to some of the redundant repetitions and rhetorical hyperbole common in this genre of sacred literature. Considering that Buddhism has sometimes had a bad habit of taking a dim view of the spiritual capabilities of the ladies, it is notable and maybe even a little remarkable that the sutra's sermon is delivered by a woman--this usually the role of the Buddha Himself. And what she has to say here is among other things a key locus classicus for the Tathagatagarbha theory--the idea that all sentient beings are endowed with a Buddha Nature, a potentiality to achieve the highest state of Buddhahood. Like the Vimalakirti Sutra it assigns religious agency to the Buddhist laity, but unlike it without denigrating the monastic vocation in the bargain. It may also (as the Waymans convincingly argue with superb detective work) demonstrate an important moment in the very development of Mahayana Buddhism itself, in this case from Mahasamghika antecedents in South India around the 200's AD.For anyone interested in East Asian Buddhism, too, this is a key sutra of understated but formative influence regardless of its contemporary semi-obscurity relative to giants like the Heart Sutra or the Lotus Sutra. Within its pages can be found a primary formulation of some of East Asian Buddhism's characteristic doctrines and the inspiration for many of its prevailing orientations (some of which are controversial today among some circles of \\"Critical Buddhists\\" in Japan, for which seePruning the Bodhi Tree: The Storm Over Critical Buddhism (Nanzan Library of Asian Religion and Culture)). So whether your main interest is in Buddhism more generally or East Asian Buddhism more specifically--or even just East Asian cultural history, for that matter--this is a definite classic that's been given the classic treatment. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Native American History: A Chronology of a Culture's Vast Achievements and Their Links to World Events","review":"Judith Nies presents an excellent overview of both native american and european events as they parallel and eventually coincide with one another. Until reading her book, I was unaware of the extent of the brutality of the hispanic history towards the natives of all the areas of the americas; their responsibility for the genocide of millions of natives through a combination of enslavement, warfare and disease, creating a world where the natives preferred to kill their children and commit suicide rather than to continue to live. This is followed by a second tragedy, the establishment of the african slave trade to replace what they destroyed. Perhaps what is most effective in her writing is the objective and factual presentation of a complete history, free of personal or cultural bias. Recommended reading for anyone."},{"Title":"Native American History: A Chronology of a Culture's Vast Achievements and Their Links to World Events","review":"like the title says, it's a great referrence book for those who wish for a brief overview of native history in the present-day united states as well as much of mesoamerica. good starting off point for further investigation. the great thing about the book is that it not only is a chronology of native events (which appear on the right side of a page), it also displays many significant events throughout the world (which appear on the left side of a page) so the reader may gain a greater perspective. also includes short articles thrown in for good measure and to expand a bit on topics such as the iroquois influence on the u.s. constitution, to tenochtitlan (present-day mexico city, site of ancient aztec capital), as well as brief introductions to certain time periods. not a thorough examination, but a nice listing of significant events in native history. recommended nonetheless."},{"Title":"Native American History: A Chronology of a Culture's Vast Achievements and Their Links to World Events","review":"This book should be required reading, at least for any member of the government who has dealings with Native Americans, if not for every American History class in the country.

It should be considered an invaluable asset in any attempt to present a balanced perspective on our country's history.

When the book arrived, I naturally went to that section. The text indicates that Little Crow was hanged in Mankato with 37 other Dakota which is false. Indeed, that is not only stated falsely in the general narrative, but also under the photo of Little Crow (one of a dozen or so photos in the book) on page 267. It is well documented in other sources that Little Crow fled to Canada after the Dakota war. Well after the uprising, in 1863, he returned to Minnesota where he engaged in stealing horses. He was mortally shot in a firefight in a farmer's field (Lamson Farm). There, Little Crow and his son were happened upon while foraging for berries.I don't feel this is nitpicking - Little Crow was a prominent figure and feel the story should have been stated correctly.

I gave it quite a few shots and failed miserably.I recommend that before you bite into this one, you read some other books of his."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"There are no words to describe this book. Or any other he wrote. You just have to read them and then you will know what I am talking about. I only have to say that he never missed once writting a book in all these years. Gabo is simply The great."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"This is not a novel with a story, though it is a monstrous tale. It is a fantastic description of the rotten guts of tyranny. Enormous, steaming sentences, reeking with exotic images and jaguar tracks contain a sorrowful epic of the surreal politics of hot, underdeveloped places that know more corruption than justice. Weaving in and out, from one person's thoughts to another's, from one time to a second, with almost no dialogue, no conversation, no quotation marks, but moving from the mind of a general to dictator to \\"the people\\" to the female love interest and back again, Garcia Marquez spins a horrific story that is unlikely to be similar to anything you have read before. Maybe you will be satisfied to read this as a \`one-off' kind of book that demands your total attention, all your powers of imagination and your determination. It is not a simple novel. I realized that Milorad Pavic, the Serbian author of fantastic tales, owes much to Garcia Marquez, sometimes even images (eggs of a certain day, news-spreading parrots).The \\"Patriarch\\" is the ur-dictator, the tyrant personified, an old man who never steps down, who rules behind a double whose death thus gives rise to a legend of immortality. The dictator's underlings invent Potemkin everything; his palace is full of cripples, blind people, lepers, and domestic animals; he is a monster who, like all the tyrants he represents, cannot love, but only cultivate power. There is his mother, who failed to be a saint, the dynamited clergyman, the roasted general, the nun-mistress, the murdered children, the wife eaten by dogs. Was there anything he did not violate or corrupt ? Garcia Marquez gives one of the best-written pictures of the corruption of absolute power. The dictator is unnamed, perhaps a composite of Colombians, perhaps more. We find Stalin in him, Hitler, Mao, Idi Amin, and Saddam Hussain. And the reaction of the crowd, the mass, is the same every time. \\"The only thing that gave us security on earth,\\" they say, \\"was the certainty that he was there....dedicated to the messianic happiness of thinking for us, knowing that we knew that he would not take any decision for us that did not have our measure...\\" In the end, they mourned him---as Russians did mourn Stalin---despite the massacres, the coups and brutal suppressions, the repression of religion, the selling off of every resource the country had---because they had wound up not knowing what would become of them without him.Brilliant imagery, product of a fantastic imagination, that pours out on the pages, seemingly with endless abundance, can only dazzle a reader. It's a stunning novel whose moral may be that \\"a lie is more comfortable than doubt, more useful than love, more lasting than truth..\\" The person who understands and exploits this is the most dangerous type of human being. Unfortunately they exist in all countries and have appeared throughout history. THE AUTUMN OF THE PATRIARCH is not really a South American, magico-realist novel, though it is that. It is a painting of the human tragedy."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"It's inevitable that this book should be somewhat off-putting compared to One Hundred Years of Solitude or Love in the Time of Cholera--Autumn of the Patriarch isn't really meant to be a 'pleasant' read. It is a grim portrait of the title character, and other characters come and go without having inner lives of their own; they have relevance only insofar as they intersect with his life. It is without a doubt one of the least novelistic novels you will ever read--indeed, in many ways it's more like a prolonged character study than a novel.Some people complain about the style in which the book is written--no paragraph breaks, few chapter breaks, long run-on sentences (the final chapter--fifty pages or so--is one massive sentence), perspective shifts mid-sentence and even mid-clause--but the truth of the matter is that, although this can become a little bit wearing at times, it is by no means 'difficult.' Not in the sense that Ulysses, Gravity's Rainbow, and Absalom, Absalom! are difficult. It can occasionally be disorienting, but in general it's always pretty easy to tell what's going on, and the style results in a surreal, dreamlike atmosphere that, I think, is perfect for describing the General's long, nightmarish reign. Sure, it could have been written in a more conventional style, and it could well have still been a good book, but Garcia Marquez's decision to push narrative boundaries provides just the right feel. After all, the General is a composite of many Meso and South American tyrants, and to couch his reign in more concrete, everyday terms would have taken away some of his universality (his selling of the Caribbean is a clear demonstration of this, as well as one of the most striking literary metaphors you'll ever encounter). He isn't really a human being; he's an implacable, negative force. For all his flailing around, occasionally making half-hearted and futile efforts to change, his life ultimately has no other meaning.Autumn of the Patriarch certainly isn't the best of Garcia Marquez's movels to start with (that would be One Hundred Years of Solitude, of course), but it's an important part of his oeuvre, even if it's not as 'fun.' I recommend it to literate people everywhere."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"In his second novel, Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez reinvents himself in the wonderful work of &quot;Autumn of the Patriarch&quot;. The work took him 8 years to write, however the result was well worth the work. By using a stream of consiousness technique and constantly altering between first and third persons, Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez exhibits his techincal mastery. He transplants the reader into the mind and world of a dictator in an unnamed Latin American country. Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez really captures the mind and spirit of this solitary power. An important reading for understanding power in Latin America. Similar books include &quot;Senor Presidente&quot; by Miguel Angel Asturias and &quot;Reasons of State&quot; by Alejo Carpentier. This novel is particularly relevant with the circumstances surrounding ex-Chilean Dictator, Augusto Pinochet."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"Beware, those of you who have not read a Gabriel Garcia Marquez book yet! The style and literary techniques employed by the venerable author here are not, at first, user-friendly. In place of a sequence of actions, a run-on assault of descriptions tell the tale of a seemingly immortal yet completely despicable Caribbean tyrant. Sentences last for pages, each chapter is but one paragraph, the narrative perspective changes in mid-sentence, etc: This anti-traditional approach proves to be extremely rewarding, I felt the ending was even better than the build-up. Worthy of a score of Doctorate theses--but none by my hand. Upon finishing this book you will be awakened to a unique artistic literary style by one of the century's greatest authors--then go out and buy yourself some more Marquez novels. The more straightforward &quot;General in his Labyrinth&quot; and the illustrious &quot;100 Years of Solitude&quot; I also highly recommend."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"While it lacks the startling originality and narrative sweep of \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude,\\" this novel is Gabriel Garcia-Marquez's masterpiece of prose. The story is good and the many surreal touches are magnificent and deployed to great political effect (the selling of the sea, for example, is an unforgettable image of impoverished nations selling their natural resources to wealthy nations and only suffering from the transaction), but the real story here is Gabo's prose: he channels William Faulkner to create a style that's as sinuous and labyrinthine--and beautiful--as anything yet accomplished in our Western Hemisphere."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"This is a good book, don't get me wrong. And I will only speak for the English/translated version. It's a classic in fact, not just going by the author who is a brilliant man. A classic in terms of experimental writing. A first: something so original you will always remember forcing yourself through this difficult to read material. There are times where I read the same page three times, just to get the story line right. From that perspective it's timeless just as the book itself. But after a while you get the feeling as if Gabriel is toying with you. Torn between loving the old man, hating his guts, cursing his second wife, saluting his victory over himself. Anyone with any ambitions for power should read this. It's Machiavellian theme, its hidden storyline, its wonderful depictions of real and everyday life... so real, too real perhaps. But not for your everyday, easy reading pleasures. You really need to take time off to enjoy this. Sorry,"},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"The people who have said this book is difficult probably just weren't prepared for it. This is second only to 100 Years as Garcia's most amazing work. Of course it's challenging. Of course much of the book is atmospheric--that's the point. It's told from the point of view of an entire country, a country that's been raped and starved and brutalized for so long it can barely remember who it is. It's a portrait of a complicated love/hate, co-dependent relationship between a nation and its caudillo. Don't try to read this if you're expecting something light for the plane, and don't read it as your first Garcia Marquez book either. I'd start with Love in the Time of Cholera, then more to 100 Years of Solitude, and then read this a year later, when you finally understand 100 Years. This book demands nearly as much attention and respect as Joyce; be ready to give it."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"This is perhaps the most difficult book I have ever read in my life. Could be the hardest I will ever read. It is a discriptive Stream of Consciousness novel. What does that mean? Stream of Consciousness means that it is written as a man experiences things. It can be erratic and all over the place, like our minds. And sentences will and do go on for pages upon pages. One of the hardest things to get into. But if you do it, the rewards are great.This book is about a cruel dictator of a small Carribean island. He is at the end of his life and is trapped in his own personal coutry ruled over by a cruel dictator. He is in his own personal hell. It is a very intense story, some of the things he does and has done can utterly disgust you, but you know that there is a small chance this man could find redemption. And on and on through the story, you begin to feel sorry for this cruel, horrible man.The description of this novel is great. I would reccomend this book only after you have read perhaps more than two of his books (unlike me) and perhaps other &quot;difficult&quot; books. The book is only a little over 200 pages, but could take longer than reading The Odyssesy.All in all, another masterpiece by Mr. Garcia. I think he should get special recognition for this work. Both the story and the style are perfected. Good job!"},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"I can't say that \\"Autumn of the Patriarch\\" fits into the mould of novel writing. It is, however, an examination of a despot and the wreck of his poisoned kingdom. Filled with black humour and grotesque images, it pulls the reader forward in spite of the endless sentences. One can almost see the squalor and smell the rubbish in the city. I would hesitate to compare it to anything else that Marquez has written because it is so different but what it does have is Marquez profound insight into the ways and failings of mortals."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"Marquez is one of the greatest writers on the planet, and he was greatly inspired by that old master of &quot;stream of consciousness,&quot; William Faulkner. This book is not only a good example of Faulkner's influence but also an absolutely delicious hybrid of those two literary geniuses. The result is brilliant. The imagery is hypnotic. If you're a fan of Marquez, don't leave this one out! And if you're new to Faulkner, read this first, then read Faulkner's &quot;As I Lay Dying,&quot; then go from there."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"I decided to read Gabriel Garcia Marquez's stunning book The Autumn of the Patriarch after reading Didion's Salvador because of her claim that it was based on former Salvadoran president General Maximiliano Hernedez Martinez. In actuality it is a composite of several dictators including Spain's Franco.While the patriarch is a composite of all he is really none. He is a mythological creature who lives to near eternity and rules the country for over one hundred years. This however is not a plot based story. It is a rambling stream of consciousness with no paragraph indentations and sentences that ramble, curl and change pronouns. It is the confusion and chaos which happens in these countries under a mad dictator.So while it is a stunning read it is also a stumping read, often leaving the reader wondering what is happening. Here is an example of one of the shorter sentences, which gives a description of the essential patriarch:\\"Contrary to what his clothing showed, the descriptions made by historians made him very big and official schoolboy texts referred to him as a patriarch of huge size who never left his house because he could not fit through the doors, who loved children and swallows, who could guess a person's thoughts by one look in the eyes, and who had the secret of a salt with the virtue of curing lepers' sores and making cripples walk\\"Despite the difficulty in diagramming a single sentence in this book and its frequent inaccessibility, I found the book intriguing and its prose brilliant.

On one hand, a novel replete with artistic vision can alienate a reader. On the other, a novel devoid of artistic experimentation and philosophical exploration leaves a reader flat, akin to eating Pop Rocks for dinner.In a recent essay, Jonathan Franzen wrote:\\"Think of the novel as lover: Let's stay home tonight and have a great time. Just because you're touched where you want to be touched, it doesn't mean you're cheap; before a book can change you, you have to love it. Or the novelist as the cook who prepares, as a gift to the reader, this many-course meal. It's not all ice cream, but saut&eacute;ed broccoli rabe has charms of its own.\\"The question then: does \\"Autumn of the Patriarch\\" succeed in giving us enough to enjoy as a balance to the artistic experimentation Garcia Marquez doles out in staggering quantity?I say no.\\"Autumn\\" is a painful read. Literally. Sentences that go on for pages. No paragraph breaks. A handful of chapter breaks. This book will hurt your eyes, cause eye strain, there's no resting place.Admittedly, there is much to like within \\"Autumn\\"'s pages. The detail of Garcia Marquez' world. The complex character of the general. The cyclical plot structure that seems to wander, but really circles. If you've read Garcia Marquez' books, you'll recognize \\"Autumn.\\"But then...why? Why create such a difficult style? What's the purpose? I've always felt that if an author deviates from standard story-telling she'd better have a good reason. And there are plenty of examples of successful \\"artistic\\" texts. Saramago's \\"Blindness.\\" Woolf's \\"The Waves.\\" Heller's \\"Catch-22\\" and Vonnegut's \\"Slaughterhouse 5.\\"Is the cyclical, surrealistic nature of Garcia Marquez enhanced by its style? If we look at other, similar texts written by the author, we see that's not the case. \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude,\\" for example, shares a similar theme and plot structure as \\"Autumn,\\" but includes a more standard structure, and I think all would agree that there's nothing lost there.Ultimately, \\"Autumn\\" feels like an authorial experiment, even a challenge, an attempt to shed readers in the wake of suffocating popularity. \\"Can I do this?\\" Yes, he can. \\"Should I do this?\\" It's his book, but I don't have to laud it."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"I recognize this book as the work of genius it actually is but I am put out of sorts by the fact that it challenges me in my way of thinking and forces me to re-read passages that are at times difficult and too unpredictble for my tv addled mind. I feel compelled to critically penalize you for confronting me with life's inherent contradiction through litterature. Mr. Marquez, you lose stars for not letting me think I am as bright as I like to think I am. Just kidding folks.... Will and Grace anyone?"},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"I like Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez's literature. Three of his books are among my favorites. But this one I didn't like. I must say that I usually prefer demanding readings over &quot;light&quot; literature, so it's not the &quot;stream-of-consciousness&quot; what bored me (I love &quot;Ulysses&quot;, for example). But I did not find it interesting. 50 pages-long sentences must be really excellently crafted. I think in this work they are not. Perhaps for non-Latin Americans it is a wonderful tale about a bizarre Latin American dictator and the savage world over which he reins. But I knew right from the start that this would be a long mock and attack on dictatorships (which is perfectly fine), and I didn't want to read more. No problem, even the best artists are entitled to some bad results."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"This was the wrong book to select for a road trip even thoughI loved two of his other books, and felt up to the challenge, even so was not able to handle the tediousness of the story of a failing dictator, nevertheless, its cruel images haunt my thoughts even weeks later, and if you think this sentence is run on, you won't appreciate Marquez's style which dominates and therefore diminishes the underlying brilliance of the story."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"Once in a while, in my masochistic phases, I will read a book like Autumn of the Patriach. This is like much of Faulkner's writing: Chapters made up of single paragraphs, made up of single sentences. As I read, I annotated to show some natural breaks.I know others who can dive into this kind of book and really get something out of it. I guess I should give it another chance and exercise my brain a little more. But if I do get into it again, I have a strong temptation to rewrite it in the style of Ernest Hemingway.I have all of Garcia Marquez fiction and some nonfiction available in English. This is by far my least favorite."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"The title of my review sufficiently sums up the novel but brevity does not constitute a review in the eyes of Amazon. As far as the novels of Marquez are concerned, I have heard it said (more than a few times) that there are three masterpieces: One Hundred Years of Solitude, Love in the Time of Cholera and Chronicle of a Death Foretold - I ignored the warning and paid the price as I laboured through 'Autumn', fighting off sleep at every page."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"Unlike other writers who embed the Christian ideals and symbolism into their work to evoke mystery and majesty, Marquez uses a religious vernacular to cast the dictator into the same shadow of doubt into which he wants the reader to hold the god figure. Marquez' countless allusions to Christ and his Mother render the reader into a surrealistic land of never-ending make-believe deaths and resurrections.The Autumn of the Patriarch rends the \\"terror of the miracle\\" (p. 237) in the form of the macabre mini-miracles of Marquez' magical realism: the general who sprouts fish scales, the general's weathered skin turning into infant skin, the cows who eat from paintings, leaving little doubt that these miracles dominate the novel. What is less evident is that Marquez' assertions after these or the more debased miracles occurring in the form of tyranny are a screed against the dictatorial nature of religion. The dictator is not the anti-Christ but rather the reverse embodiment of Jesus Christ. The General of the Universe becomes the King of the Universe and neither comes out well ahead of the game in the telling.The accumulation of religious detail is sometimes so evident and overpowering that one wonders whether Marquez is merely ornamenting the Roman Catholic Latin American culture begun by Spanish clerics in the 1500s. However, religious imagery and incantation cannot convey a sense of religiosity within the dictatorship because they blaspheme rather than uphold a religious connotation of the novel. If the General \\"[remembers] suddenly that cow was written with a c\\" then Marquez also writes god with a lowercase \`g.' (p237)The General's meditations on the aloneness of power stand as counterpoint and counterpart of his partner in the game of all-powerfulness. The General does becomes Christ meandering in the desert of his solitude, wondering if his lofty perch is worth enduring. Like the General who is pained since birth with his malformed [...], Christ was born to and had no choice but to endure. For Marquez, the question is not one of endurance but rather a perdurance of \\"uncountable years.\\" The General and Christ suffer the \\"fiction of commanding without power, of being exalted without glory and of being obeyed without authority.\\" (p. 254) Marquez fuses the actions of the debased General by debasing the inauthenticity of Christ."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"When I first began reading this book I must admit that I was confused by the stream of conciousness and one sentence chapters. But what a treat it was! It's rare the book that makes you stop to re-read a phrase to yourself while you exclaim, &quot;Wow!&quot; I recommend this book to anyone who has read Gabriel Garcia before. If not, read One hundred Years of Solitude before you pick this one up. You won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"Written during 1968-1975, Marquez has fashioned a grand narrative of a Caribbean tyrant caught in the prison of his own power, slowly losing it and dying (with shades of Lear and Macbeth).Garcia Marquez's theme is once again solitude. The language is more like a poem than a novel -- sentences run on for pages, changing voice several times before coming to a period. This style can be irritating, forcing re-reading to find out who is speaking or acting, but it also lends a dream-like, fluid quality that perfectly embodies the ambiguity of reason and truth. In this it is Post Modern. In it's surreal content and luxuriant sensual prose (the translation by Gregory Rabassa is an inspiration), it shows who is the father of Magical Realism. It is worth reading alone for the details -- a herniated testicle that whistles, the effete torturer listening to Bruckner records, the mighty dictator napping in a hammock under tamarind trees at his mother's house while his cabinet ministers argue the fine points of law, and the final act that brings ruin on his nation -- the sale of the sea (numbered and boxed for shipping) to foreign creditors."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"After reading only a few pages of The Autumn of the Patriarch by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, I was convinced that I would go crazy if I tried to finsh this book. Believe me, I am quite fond of strange literature, but this book seemed to me the epitomy of all that can be wrong with storytelling.However, I now want to say that if you do attempt to read this book, don't let the gigantic sentences and the peculiar manner of writing lacking dialogues scare you away. To love this book, one has to accept it for what it is, and not for what it could have been.It is certainly not a happy story, but a story of life stripped of all pretenses -- the life of a man who never knew who he was, who died never knowing. It is interesting to see how the life of the cruel dictator unravels before our eyes, revealing its tragedy. It is painful to witness his inevitable and deplorable end, and we can't help but cry when M&aacute;rquez presents us with the tragic truth about the tyrant's life: that &quot;the only livable life was one of show, the one we saw from this side which wasn't his... this poor people's side.&quot; Because &quot;everyone ended up finding his place in the world, everyone except him&quot;. And when we discover the bitter truth, we plead the author, just as the dictator pleaded the bishop: &quot;I don't know the truth, promise me that.&quot;Read it, and if you do finish it, you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"I personally think that &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; is overrated; I am not particularly enamored with the whole genre of magical realism. Nevertheless, Marquez uses that style to perfection in &quot;Autumn of the Patriarch,&quot; creating a nightmarish world in which a sadistic, perhaps mentally deranged tyrant rules over a small Caribbean country. I liked the surrealist style in this book because there really is something surreal about totalitarianism. The aura of omniscience that lends legitimacy to most dictatorships is based on nothing but lies. From Joseph Stalin to Idi Amin to Kim Jong Il, tyrants throughout history have cultivated images of invincibility, machismo, wisdom, and righteousness to justify their authority. I consider such monstrous perversions of the truth perfectly reprehensible, especially considering that they are usually used to legitimize the most heinous crimes. In this book, Marquez cuts to core of totalitarinism, revealing that underneath all the grandeur lies nothing but a sick, despicable old man. The imagery in this book is grotesque to say the least, but for that reason it remains embedded in your memory. In one unforgettable scene, the dictator's lookalike is killed. The nation, unaware that the leader even has a double, thinks that he himself is dead. There is widespread jubilee on the streets. The leader reappears in public, portraying the whole event as a resurrection from the dead. He naturally slaughters those who cheered at the false news that he had died. There are many other scenes just as memorable that would take too long to relate. I guess I should conclude with the warning that this book is structured unlike any book that I have encountered. There are no paragraph breaks, the dialogue is not italicized, and the sentences consistently run for several pages. This is not so daunting as it sounds, though. The book actually does not read that difficult once you get going. It is not an easy read, no doubt, but the reward definitely exceeds the effort required."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"My favorite Marquez and high on my all-time list. Like most good prose the book is best read aloud, even sung. Consider that if you read it in English, Gregory Rabassa should share full credit for the beauty of his translation.No reviewer has mentioned the ambiguity of identity which is the central theme of this marvelous story. Early on something happens that leaves a mystery behind. Perhaps you have been mislead.The remainder of the book glitters with clues."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"Autumn of the Patriarch was a fantastic book, endemic of the classics, deep on many levels and actually better than One Hundred Years of Solitude. Much like Marquez's other work, he paints pictures and concepts in fragments of time, glimpses of memories and remembrances, and pieces of his characters personalities. The perspective and narration shift, sometimes intangibly and in mid-sentence. The effect is mosaic and powerful. He eloquently captures the essence of dictatorships and abuse and distortion of power from a distinctively non-Western perspective. The character in this novel is a composite of multiple Latin American dictators, written in the fantastic and surreal style that is Marquez and is similar to Rushdie."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"Gabriel Garcia Marquez's novel, The Autumn of the Patriarch, threw me into the sea to which he constantly referred to. The frustration in the beginning gradually swept over me, just enough so that I was able to enjoy the content of the book. Placing me in the twisted world of a disillusioned government official did more than shock me. It intrigued me, forced me to consider the world outside of my own, and tossed me into the tidal wave of symbolism, metaphor, and stream-of-conscious sentence structure. I recommend this book so that you, the reader, are able to touch upon this story that shocked the literary world beyond its wildest imagination."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"I have been a big fan of Mr. Marquez for many years now, and have read at least four of his other books. This one intrigued me when I read about it, since it is reputed to have been his first.I found the first fifty or so pages difficult to get into because, typical of Marquez, he tends to write in run on sentences, no paragraphs, and differing persons. Stick with it, however, and the book will captivate you. For anyone familiar with one or more of the dictatorships typical of South America, either past or present, you will become enthralled with his eye for detail. A great read, and an object lesson for would be dictators."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"G.G.

With every brutality he commits, he closes a door on reconcilliation. Till ironically, by the time he reaches the autumn of his life, the power structure around him wants him to stay, and he lives his last years, lonely, sorrounded by farm animals, detached from reality, watching the world on closed-circuit TV.Gabriel Garcia Marquez tells a stroy that transcends time and location, poetically capturing the brutality and loneliness of a monster and his &quot;realm of gloom&quot;. With sentences that run for pages, and no paragraphs, the book reads like more like a poem than prose. There were sections that I had to read alound to truly appreciate their beauty.

I see four layers in the story.1. At its most basic, the story is a psychedelic oozing of mixed consciousness', a seething mass of point of view violations.2.

When I finish reading, I think...Gabo has captured the inner workings of every single dictator who has ever lived, still lives, is in diapers, and is yet to be born.4. And the hard reading of the sentences that go on forever, and there is no respite, and you think just the onslaught of all the words is going to make you go crazy which makes the structure of the novel as inaccessible and inscrutable as the psyche of the subject itself.Wow.I am left with memories of that patriarch wearing the denim uniform without insignia and the gold spur on the left heel, who is always dragging his feet through the government house full of chickens and cows to the latrines where he and no one else writes on the the toilets long live the general, long live the stud who after selling a sea, sought in native science the only thing that really interested him which was to discover some masterful hair-restorer for his incipient baldness whose life had been seen in the premonitory waters of basins by his mother of mine Bendicion Alvarado of my heart, he was as deaf as a post not only because I would ask him about one thing and he would answer about another but also that it grieved him that the birds were not singing when in fact it was difficult to breathe with that uproar of birds which was like walking through the jungle at dawn and they created newspapers and tv shows for him just the way that he liked them and every night he slept in his office behind three bolts, three locks, and three bars which is where they finally found him stretched out on the floor, face down, his right arm bent under his head as a pillow where he had realized at the moment of his death his incapacity for love in the enigma of the palm of his mute hands and in the invisible code of the cards and he had tried to compensate for that infamous fate with the burning cultivation of the solitary vice of power.And FINALLY, a period. That is kind of how you start to feel, and by the end of the book, you are gasping, yearning, craving, needing, dying for that little dot.Brilliant. But not light. Very heavy."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"That this is a tough read is an understatement. But worth the effort. The story is so relevant: a warning never to forget, as those who hear the word of God hustle politics, believing their own shtick. Marquez's imagination is so astounding it makes me fearful that Western civilization died a long time ago. In the best of my dreams I can only sustain for five seconds what Marquez holds together for his entire novel."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"Amazing.I have no other words describing this book. The narrative style, for those complaining - is in my humble opinion Marquez BEST : spell binding magic realism.The book details in long and convoluted sentences the minutiae of every day life of a maniac, a universal type of tyrant - which just happens to be caught in Marquez writer's cross hairs in South America. It may be one of the many South American dictators and it could easily be one of their European monster counterparts. Marquez is sometimes sublime, often bold and always funny in a strange way. Recommended !"},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"I loved the novel, had to read it very slowly, carefully, and piecemeal and each sentence that I read (actually all are a few pages long) recriprocated in my thoughts till I picked the novel to read the next few sentences. The novel by Marquez is a brilliant piece of imagery that blends the nauseating, dark, dying rule and regime of a tyrant with a poetic wordplay that arouses hatred, pain, sympathy and understanding for the patriarch. The writer has written a story that delights and anguishes at the same time. The protagonist is a dictator who rules with utmost authority, through fear and iron hand but at the same time is a slave of his own power, alone and old, diseased and dying. It takes some effort to grasp the narration style of the suthor, but once a feel is developed for this incredibly complex and intricate writing style, complex emotions and life like experiences enthrall in every sentence. I thought Rushdie was brilliant, Marquez beats him hands down!This is at times a story of unfulfilled love, of solitude, of loneliness at the top, of the extremely spiteful shades of power, of grief that goes uncured, unhealed, of superstitions, lies and naked ugliness of life in corrupt regimes. Artistically, the novel is an endless potrait, with each part beautifully drawn, colored, etched, put together in perfection after painting each part with a tremendous skill, imagination and ability that is both rare to find and emulate. I am sure every avid reader will be as affected when he reads this incredible novel."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"I read this book in the original Spanish and it amazes me that the same person that could write Love in the times of Cholera which deals with love, could also write a book this violent and dark. This novel is a masterpiece because it illustrates one of Gabo's best traits as a novelist, his ability to describe. The dictator's name is never actually revealed but the reader is thrust into his paranoid, paralyzed world of pain and suffering. He's seperated from the rest of humanity. It becomes apparent that the dictator's evil and hatred overtake him.It's obvious that Gabo used his experiences with tyrants such as Franco, Stalin, Trujillo, and Castro while writing this novel. They would serve him well as the main character of this novel is a combination of all of the aforementioned leaders. The traits of the dictator are not just limited to leaders of state but also to anybody who allows corruption, greed, and violence overtake them. In the end, this novel is difficult to read but a neccesary oeuvre of one of the best Spanish language novelists of our time."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"Garcia's story, to borrow from the text itself, is its own herniated testicle. Each page is inflated, yet strangely it may be our badge of unusual and distinctive honor to reach the ending. The text is the patriarch, the sole dictation, every voice indistinguishable from each other's, and we chosen readers soon find ourselves its sole constituency.So how else does one approach narrating a Caribbean dictatorship? Nice and pat and publisher-friendly? Such that \\"reader response\\" will cast a vote in the author's or characters' favor? Should it be written in order to please a publisher's project management timetable? Surely not, for no self-respecting dictator ever allows other ideologues into his inner circle than the mistrusted and select few. And such as it is, Garcia correctly adopts the only allowable narrative trope. What's more, horrifyingly we should note that these grotesque and endearing passages--the formidable blocks of text a hooked reader cannot easily quit--is the unlikelihood of such a work being published were written today.Politics aside, if and when you may arrive at a point in the novel where you are scratching your head, it might be helpful to consider the work as its own community of voices. And this place may very likely be shortly after beginning. Communities are ever so much deeper than the politics that govern them.After a bit of reading, perhaps a little like Burgess's A Clockwork Orange, Garcia's delivery begins to become sensible. After all, why should he obey grammatical and lexical conventions of his time? Autumn of the Patriarch is an outright attack of totalitarianism in literature, and totalitarianism simply cannot be understood within a normal frame of reference. For more on this subject, please refer to essays of the same kind by Hannah Arendt. Additionally, considering some of the recent avant-garde poetry of New York's Nuyorican movement, a school of poetry that regards language itself as a patriarchal syntactical institution at the core, it is likely that Garcia works with this very same principle, redefining or at least defying what literature is supposed to be, who should write it, whose work should be considered for publication, and what is lawful in print.These are simply some speculations, and there is much to speculate. As with One-hundred Years of Solitude, Autumn of the Patriarch is steeped in fantastic, endless and rich descriptions, the contemporary likes of which are found only in a Garcia novel. Unlike One-hundred Years, however, I cannot characterize this piece as endearing or captivating in the same way. It is a much darker, but it is Garcia unmistakably. I would also not recommend reading this at bedtime as a sleep-aid, for though Garcia's grammar eventually becomes perfectly clear, there are few convenient places to quit reading. Pages and pages pass without periods. And period stops are for easy, individual thoughts--like mine stopping here."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"The Autumn of the Patriarch is perhaps one of the greatest works of literary artistry of the twentieth century and certainly one of his most innovative works, but most likely it won't appeal to the general reader because of its unconventional structure. The main character, a tyrant of a small country, is the only 'real' character in this book, in that being the supreme leader and dictator of his world and all that surrounds him, he 'owns' all that the novel encompasses, yet his comprehension of life is riddled within a strange shroud of misguided purpose and a directionless ego. Marquez distorts the boundaries in many aspects of his writing structure so that it seems a blending of actions and thoughts that are being portrayed in order to show with full effect this dictators life through all characters and descriptions, sometimes switching between first and third person within the same sentence, giving a sense of the often displaced and cold objectivity of this man. There is an interesting contrast here, as his world is a concentricity of solitude and paranoia, yet a free and rich world grows around him that he seems to never really be able to touch. This book is confusing to many people upon their first reaction, because it is a work of multi-faceted characteristics, packed with symbolic despcription and living sentences, all coming together to create a very unique work. This novel should, perhaps, be absorbed more than studied, as you can spend a lot of time trying to figure out the structure of it in order to form a linear perspective of what you are reading, but it's probably a waste of time once you realize that everything presented here lends to the broader environment instead of single plot turns or actions. I have read comments upon the complexity of this novel, which is understandable if one is used to reading the standard serial novel that we come to expect, but if you can grasp the kind of picture Marquez is trying to paint, it makes the novel a much simpler and enjoyable piec! e of art."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"This novel, written in a stream of incessant imagery of beauty and cruelty, is a masterpeice of narrative skill. One must be 'in the mood' to tackle the work which is dense and whose language is difficult at first. I say at first because, once underway, and the narrative understood, the book unfolds like a dream.This book is a testament to Marquez's skill. The events that take place (three hundred donkey-pulled pianos falling into a ravine/ the attempt to hide two thousand children)are almost beyond comprehension. I finished the book last night and was beside myself. The use of language and imagery will stay with me forever. This book alone should've earned Marquez his Nobel prize.And don't think the style of the novel is pretensious or used to make something easy difficult. There are many literary devices at play but all to serve the purpose of the story.This book should also be interesting for anyone curious about the lonliness and insanity of despotism.And don't be fooled by Oprah and the critics, 'One Hundred Years of Solitude' is NOT his best book by any means. \\"The Autumn of the Patriarch\\" is where 'magical-realism' really comes to life.For anyone intersted in contemporary literature or something wholly original, this novel is a must."},{"Title":"THEORY AND PRACTICE OF COMMUNISM: AN INTRODUCTION","review":"Everything about this book is fascinating, and Hunt's erudition with regard to the subject is unmatched. His dispassionate exposure of the premeditated and unimaginably sinister methods used by Communists to steal and retain power is a service to the free world...especially given that so many modern, radical organizations (particularly those on the left) utilize the very same tactics to cynically manipulate opinion and exert influence. It is a better and more practical book on the subject, in very many respects, than is Wilson's \\"To the Finland Station\\"."},{"Title":"THEORY AND PRACTICE OF COMMUNISM: AN INTRODUCTION","review":"One rainy Sunday afternoon while holed up in a sleezy hotel (best in town) on the Azuero Peninsula in the Republc of Panama, and with nothing better to do, I read this little book. The truth, or at least as close to it as can be had, why Communisum as a system of government couldn't, and didn't work, is explained so clearly that even an uneducated fool like I was at the time, found the read to be quite illuminating.Many years have gone by, my knowledge has expanded a thousand fold and still, what Carew wrote then, has become manifest for many, if not all of the very reasons he predicted they would."},{"Title":"The conduct of life","review":"The book was on time and was a brand new book.

While striking up a conversation with Sandra, she related to me a little about her yearly visit to Cancun; she even had a stack of current pictures (of her wonderful friends that she so poignantly wrote about). Noticing how intrigued I was, she mentioned that she had a copy of the book she wrote that chronicled her adventures with Yazmin and other amazing Mayan and Mexican people. These are the marvelous people that the Songdahls 'adopted' and who, more importantly, had adopted them.Even with all the many activities of a busy vacation, I read this book in two days. I then gave it to my husband who was also instantly mesmerized. I am in awe of the great work that Sandra and John Songdahl do throughout the year: collecting food, clothing and supplies for the poverty stricken Mayan people. When Jesus said, &quot;When you do this unto the least of these...,&quot; I honestly feel that the Songdahl's were his example.Sandra's writing is compelling; very easy to read. Her writing enables the reader to become instantly involved with the characters in the story. I plan to share this book with my Sunday School class; what a fantastic project--to follow Sandra's lead!Incidentally, this book only covers the period from 1988-1995.

Unfortunately, I could not relate to Lizzie Simon. She is elitist and she is very self-congratulatory. It is so embarrassing to read about her relationship with Nicholas, and somehow she thinks that she's the only one who could understand him. He can't understand himself!!! Needless to say, I don't understand what all the hype is when reading this book. I think there are plenty of people out there who have written excellent books on their struggles with mental illness (i.e Kay Redfield Jamison, William Styron). This book, though entertaining, is very base."},{"Title":"Detour : My Bipolar Road Trip in 4-D","review":"I read this book several years ago and am still horrified. Lizzie Simon seems to be elitist, as others have pronounced. The book is certainly self-congratulatory, and her view of Lithium as savior is certainly narrow minded. My approach is lifestyle/faith based, does that make me a \\"crackpot?\\" It was also embarrassing to read about her relationship with a love interest (TMI), and how she thought she was the only one who understood him. I'm just thankful my copy was from the library, not bought with my own money."},{"Title":"Detour : My Bipolar Road Trip in 4-D","review":"I admire the courage Lizzie Simon has to peel away- everything- and show us all the inside of her brain!This is the memoir of her journey to find other young successful people like herself who suffer from bipolar disorder. She interviews seven different people who have similar stories to tell.\\"Everybody has stories about being misdiagnosed, mistreated, misunderstood and disrespected by the medical community.Everybody has spent long stretches of time as zombies waiting for medicine to work. Most of us have been good sports about humiliating side effects like weight gain, bed-wetting and drooling.Everybody experienced a time when it didn't look as if they were gonna make it. Everybody did make it.\\"How brave of her to write this honest and eye opening memoir about the struggle and the stigma associated with mental illness.I was so impressed by her ability to communicate the sadness but especially the mania. She was so unflinchingly direct with not one word of psychiatric jargon. This was a very real and often raw account of her cross-country adventure.This was not a scientific study, this is the story of Lizzie's experience, it's a hopefully story. I feel the people she interviewed were very fortunate most of them had good parents who educated themselves and helped their children through their crisis.Of course this could have been a very different story if Lizzie had chosen to write an objective scientific study about people suffering from bipolar disorder in America. I most likely wouldn't have read that book. I'm thankful she wrote this story, I found it very insightful."},{"Title":"Detour : My Bipolar Road Trip in 4-D","review":"Detour provides another perspective for those who are bipolar or have a loved one who is bipolar. There are other books out there that cover the science and case studies of the disorder. This is a much more personal book. I certainly don't think it is the only book you should read on the subject. Beware that the focus is on the under 35, college educated, relatively recently diagnosed bipolar person. If you are that person you need to read this book. It is a very quick read and well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Detour : My Bipolar Road Trip in 4-D","review":"I am a physician and recently suggested Lizzie Simon's book to by book club, a group of eight woman physicians. &quot;Detour: My Bipolar Road Trip in 4-D&quot; got strong positive reviews and everyone acknowledged new insight into living with this tough disease. This was the first book that I suggested to this tough group of critics that they actually liked! As a physician, I feel that reading Ms Simon's book would benefit all health professionals at any level and lead to fewer missed diagnoses and more compassionate understanding for patients trying to cope with this complex disease!"},{"Title":"Detour : My Bipolar Road Trip in 4-D","review":"I worked and volunteered with youth in Colorado for over two years. Some of my young clients were diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Many of my colleagues worked with bipolar kids as well. Frequently I was challenged to provide resources to a bipolar client, their family members, the community as a whole and other professionals. Ms. Simon's book is at the absolute top of my list as a resource for all those folks. This young woman's writing details her search for herself in the face of a complex, cloudy and potentially crippling disease. Her insights are uncannily accurate as other young bipolars have revealed similar experiences to me, and my colleagues, as well. Ms. Simon's writing is a documented inspiration for the thousands of young people who are struggling with the disorder. I imagine many of my former clients benefitting greatly from this young woman's search for a piece of sanity in a world that stigmatizes this and other mental health disorders. I have no doubt that it provides insight for the many people that love and care for someone with the disorder as well. I recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Detour : My Bipolar Road Trip in 4-D","review":"I heard Lizzie Simon interviewed on NPR and was prompted to write. I loved DETOUR--it's compelling, courageous, unfailingly honest. I thought the review in the Providence Journal was right on in so many respects, e.g. how her style brilliantly captures the essence of her subjects. Also, as someone who worked in the mental health system for over a decade, I have to concur with Lizzie's assessment of the inadequate services for the mentally ill.

Ms. Simon does a great job explaining the processes of mania and depression, how they attack a personality from different angles, how they control behavior in an uncontrollable manner. Untill I read Detour, understanding what those processes was completely foreign. While the book only takes a look at a few people with the disorder, it does a great job educating even the most highly educated people on a very misunderstood topic."},{"Title":"Detour : My Bipolar Road Trip in 4-D","review":"As parents of a bipolar daughter, this book has completely changed the way we view our (our daughter's and our) challenge.

As a therapist, I have recommended it to many of my patients and they all claim to have been helped by her words. Whether you have a diagnosis of bipolar illness or not, whether you have ever known anyone with a mental disorder or not, Ms. Simon's book is a must read. She's a brilliant writer, very insightful and gives us positive and hopeful stories about people living with mental illness.

What I was searching for was a book that displayed a group of young bipolar persons that I could not relate to but just maybe slightly through the pages connect with. In turn, I found slight biographies of people that all had warm, loving, wealthy, highly educated families. Although, some did not understand the illness, they were responsive to it's diagnosis. Not everyone has this response and maybe if Simon did a bit more research than a couple month road trip and considered a wider variety of people the book would have been allowed the reader to make more a connection. ..."},{"Title":"Detour : My Bipolar Road Trip in 4-D","review":"This is a coming of age book if there ever was one. Throughout the book, Lizzie talks to the reader, reminding us that she is an idealistic, talented girl. I get the impression she was looking at one of her journals that she references frequently and thought &quot;I could publish this and be a star.&quot;I would add to this book a foreword by someone in the medical profession to provide the disclaimer that this is Lizzie's opinion of the bipolar affective disorder and that it is not a dummies guide to bipolar.My critque is in Lizzie's self-character development. The whole business of drive around in Daddy's SUV and interview Daddy's friends' patients was basically meaningless. Just statistics. Perhaps a collection of essays by people would have been better. Her relationship with a unstable person could have been expanded on to much benefit. This is why I term this book 'coming of age.' Her discovery that she can't make herself better by giving it all to someone who is worse of than her is a critical point for the mentally ill, drug addicted, etc. In her emphasis to find her clique, er, herd, she realizes the illness does not define her. I am suspecting that Detour 2 will have more insights as Lizzie grows beyond her ivory tower, so to speak.This said, the book is a quick, fast read. I see it as breaking new ground and hope there will be some books or essays available that are not written by celebrities (Patty Duke, Carrie Fisher) or rich white girls (Lizzie Simon), but instead from the perspective of one of the many average yet function mentally ill. I think it is an excellent book for anyone looking to get a anectdotal information on manic-depresson or who enjoys the coming of age genre.Lizzie Simon deserves praise for sharing her coming of age as a bipolar kid story. She also deserves praise for taking on the role of spokesperson of the young to this important issue.Read the book, but take it with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"Detour : My Bipolar Road Trip in 4-D","review":"Lizzie Simon's book is not only a terrific read, but an incredibly eye-opening revelation, shedding light on a disorder which few people really understand.

Her prose is stilted, her perspective is entirely self-congragulatory and thus narow to an extreme. I am astounded at the positive reviews this book has recieved. The only real insight it seems to offer is the extreme mania and and detatched from reality quality that Lizzie, despite her claims to be managing her very real illness, evidences on every page. My sense is that people are intruiged with this book due to the voyeuristic opportunity to access a hip young new york ivy leaguer's life. Baring all isn't really that hard, but crafting an insightful and well-written book should still be on lizzie's to-do list."},{"Title":"Detour : My Bipolar Road Trip in 4-D","review":"This is one of the most amazing books I have ever read. Knowing that I had been diagnosed with bi-polar disorder a few years previous, when a friend of mine stumbled upon this book he bought it for me. I knew that he would ask how I liked it, so I decided to read it just so I could say that I had.I was amazed by how much Lizzie Simon's experiences mirrored my own, down to having to leave school in order to deal with her diagnosis. I was stopped dead in my tracks at the sentence \\"Going back was the ultimate surrender to the power of the illness.\\" Simon managed to encapsulate in one sentence what I had tried to say in 18 months of therapy. For the first time I felt like there was someone out there that understood what I was going through and that I was not alone. Upon finishing the book, I wept from being overcome by knowing that there are others who understand and a hope for my own future which had been lost.This is a must read for anyone who has been diagnosed or loves someone who has been diagnosed with bi-polar disorder. This allowed me to become more comfortable with my diagnosis and those in my family to understand some of what I go through.

She did an excellent job of describing what it is like being bipolar and she was a very relatable character....... that is, for someone like me who has struggled with mental illness. Her writing was fresh and young and full of life. She confronted an illness with so many negative stigma's in such a positive way. Her goal of the book was to find and interview successful bipolar people. People who are functioning just fine in normal society.If you have bipolar, or know someone who does. Or just want more information on what it is... This is a great book. It isn't stuffy like a lot of other mental illness books tend to be."},{"Title":"Detour : My Bipolar Road Trip in 4-D","review":"Though Lizzie Simon's Detour fills a literary void for people with bipolar disorder -- being the first such work to address the issue in such a poignant, informative way -- it also raises larger, universal questions. Who am I? Where do I fit? If I'm abnormal, what is normal? -- and is that normality something to covet? Her search is wrapped in easy and gripping prose, making for a quick but indelible read."},{"Title":"Detour : My Bipolar Road Trip in 4-D","review":"Lizzie Simon has put words to the thoughts that have been cascading in and out of our minds since we were little. She is not trying to solve our issues or even break down our assumptions about mental illness. Instead, she has given us a window to peer through, ignoring her own vulnerability, so that we are forced to reconcile and accept our parallels. As we are privy to her emotionally honest, raw, spastic, and seemingly flawed thought process, we begin to recognize her objectives for sharing this memoir. Thanks to Lizzie for staring down those who want to label us as a pretty package that could explode at any time, but rather, as the soulful creatures that we are."},{"Title":"Detour : My Bipolar Road Trip in 4-D","review":"Lizzie has written a memorable book that probably will appeal most to young people afflicted with bipolar disorder or some other mental illness. Is she a voice for her generation? Yes, or at least more so than Elizabeth Wurtzel. I have but one point of contention with Lizzie- this search for &quot;successful&quot; people with bipolar disorder seems a little off the mark. I realize finding people who are bipolar and successful can serve as a source of hope for those who are not (yet) successful, but perhaps it would have been more compelling to seek out bipolar individuals of all types, regardless of their degree of success. Overall though, this is a very good book, Lizzie is an excellent writer, and I believe she has broken new ground in the genre of mental illness narratives. Avery Z. Conner, author of &quot;Fevers of the Mind&quot;."},{"Title":"Detour : My Bipolar Road Trip in 4-D","review":"Detour: My Bipolar Road trip in 4D is an awesome must read book! I recommend it to anyone and it is a helpful book explaining what you go through when you experience living with bipolar. I commend Lizzie Simon for writing such a well written book."},{"Title":"Detour : My Bipolar Road Trip in 4-D","review":"Even though I knew how the book would end, I was still on the edge of my seat. The protagonist's journey to find &quot;her herd&quot; that took her driving alone thru the south with a malfunctioning cell phone and a half-formed itinerary was positively harrowing. This doesn't read like any psychology book you have ever read. I look forward to the sequel."},{"Title":"Detour : My Bipolar Road Trip in 4-D","review":"This is a tricky review to write since I have tremendously mixed feelings about this book. Ms. Simon has a good voice as a writer, but this book still came across to me as half-baked. Between the pages that were three-quarters empty and the wide double-spaced lines, I felt like I was reading a final paper someone turned in for a freshman year composition class after procrastinating too long. She also comes across as elitist and cloistered, particularly when she visits the South. I mean, how worldly do you have to be to realize that people on the whole take religion pretty seriously in the South? She is dumbfounded by that. There is more to the world than Providence prep school, Paris, and Columbia. And I question her methods of tracking down successful bipolar people. I wouldn't expect to find successful (by her definition, anyway) bipolar people by contacting local public support groups. Usually you're in support groups when you're not doing so hot, then you do better and you leave. She would have been better off figuring out who the high-dollar psychiatrists were in different cities and contacting them for their successful patients. Instead we get her driving around, sort of taking a vacation, sort of working, making a bunch of calls, and hoping it falls together. And in some ways it did fall together: I really value her story of her illness and the way she described it. It was moving and gripping. Also, her interviews with the more successful people and the contrast with Nicholas was very enlightening. There are a lot of self-medicating bipolar people out there that manage to get by but are living on a knife edge. It's good to read about some people who have figured out a healthy way to manage their illness. Despite my critical tone though, I did really enjoy most of the book, but I was left wanting more, both in a positive and negative sense."},{"Title":"Detour : My Bipolar Road Trip in 4-D","review":"The navel-baring, hip-hugging, short-attention-spanned shadow of Elizabeth \\"Damage is Sexy\\" Wurtzel casts its pall over every page of this book - an unshapely (and, no doubt, commercially motivated) graft of Memoir onto Inspiring Life Stories. I found the former more engaging than the latter, but neither seems to completely have its head together, so to speak.Simons is a familiar kind of super-achieving, high-school-literary-magazine-editing go-go-girl. (The kind who gets book deals in her 20s, in other words.) She describes her descent into antidepressant-triggered psychosis with chilling clarity. But she doesn't seem to have any insight into how strongly her literary project smacks of mania-fueled grandiosity, or how close to potential institutionalization it brings her.This (sadly) ties in with the pathos of her interview subjects - only the last of which comes even within squinting distance of being the kind of young, successful, happening, date-able Psychiatric Illness Survivor [Elizabeth Wurtzel, in other words] with which Simons would like to inspire the sufferers of this horrifying affliction. If anything, this book only succeeds in conveying (even if against its intention) how discouraging the odds really are."},{"Title":"Detour : My Bipolar Road Trip in 4-D","review":"This is the best book I have read this year. Lizzie Simon set out to write the book that she wishes had been available for her to read when she was an adolescent newly diagnosed with bipolar disorder. With this book she has achieved exactly that, an honest and straightforward account of what it's like to be young person facing a lifetime of coping with a chronic mental illness. Through her voice, mental illness is exposed and destigmatized. I highly recommend that all curious readers join her on her bipolar road trip, it's one not to be passed up."},{"Title":"Detour : My Bipolar Road Trip in 4-D","review":"I thought that I would be able to relate to Simon's book as I have a few things in common with her. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at nineteen after experiencing a manic episode induced by antidepressants. I too have felt quite lonely at times; I've found myself wishing I had a friend who could relate to my experiences with bipolar disorder. I thought the book would be encouraging, and in a way it is. After reading it you remember that you aren't alone, that other teenagers and young adults have struggled with this disorder and they've survived.I think that memoirs of this type can be misleading. I've read Jamison's book and Patty Duke's book to name a few and I have the same problem with these books as well. Anybody reading these books might think that the answer to bipolar disorder is simple enough, you need to take Lithium. Don't get me wrong, Lithium is an amazing medication; it brought me out of a manic high in about a week. And I took it for about two years and then it lost its effectiveness. Lithium can save lives but it isn't always the answer and it definitely isn't a perfect solution.I finished the book feeling that medications are the answer to bipolar. But what about people like me who don't respond to Lithium or who can't tolerate the horrendous side-effects of the other mood stabilizers and antidepressants? There is no answer to this question in her book. And that's fine, I suppose, that isn't what she wanted her book to be about but she doesn't need to put down people who go the alternative route. In one section she is at a support group looking for \\"successful\\" bipolars and they are going around the circle describing their personal situations. Simon writes: \\"Next is this crackpot bipolar nutritionist lady who says that at the Parsons Institute they taught her how to change her diet and do eight million behavioral adjustments so she doesn't need so much medicine. She is fifty-nine, not young enough for my purposes.\\" After I read that I wasn't at all convinced that it was the woman's age that deterred Simon from interviewing her but rather it was her \\"crackpot\\" nutrition.In the same section she describes a woman whose son has bipolar schizoaffective disorder; the woman is there trying to gather information about treatment. Simons writes: \\"She has no clinical diagnosis herself, but I identify her immediately as a real nut.'. The woman says that her son gets put on all types of different medications and he isn't getting any better, he just sits in his room and does nothing. Simon doesn't verbalize her opinion in the group but thinks to herself: \\"Maybe he just hates you\\".Simon seems quite conflicted. On the one hand she does a good job at expressing her disgust with the stigma surrounding bipolar disorder. On the other hand she is quick to use derogatory language. It's as if by using such language she is contributing to the very stigma that she is trying to fight. I found this particular aspect of the book unsettling.Anyway, despite my criticisms of the book I would still recommend that you give it a try, it's interesting enough. But here's my warning: please don't feel bad if you find that you don't fit into Simon's definition of a \\"successful bipolar\\", she's a hard marker."},{"Title":"Detour : My Bipolar Road Trip in 4-D","review":"An engaging, enlightening and entertaining read. I am touched by the honesty of this young writer and impressed by her insight and narrative skill. Bipolar disorder made real, scary, sad, and funny, a bit hip. Lizzie Simon writes a refreshing, and feminine addition to the few books in the Bipolar section of the bookstore. An autobiographical, picaresque work, bipolar - crosscountry. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Detour : My Bipolar Road Trip in 4-D","review":"I usually have a difficult time keeping focused while reading but found myself at the end of this book in 2 short days! I found the page layout to be easy to read. It keeps the reader's attention focused. What may have started out as a great bipolar idea to take a journey and write a book about it became more a learning tool for life. Lizzie Simon takes us on her journey to find her sense of belonging to the group of people that have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. She only wants to interview young successful bipolar because she is afraid that she will lose her success due to this illness. She is afraid that she will give up on herself at some time in her life. Lizzie Simon gives us a glimpse into the struggle that bipolar people go through to find their way. She comes across as a know-it-all at times but proves that she is on a journey like all people. She makes mistakes too. She talks about her inability to believe alternative treatments but at the same time drinks alcohol while taking lithium.I agree with Lizzie about learning all you can about what it means to be bipolar. This book should be a definately recommend for all mental health professional's reading lists. I got more out of this book as compared to Kay Redfield Jamison's &quot;An Unquiet Mind&quot;. I found that book slow and it skirted around emotional issues more than Lizzie Simon's book. I have been looking for a book like this for some time now. Like a bipolar person, it still feels like there are things or issues not said. Leaves you wanting more in a good way!"},{"Title":"Detour : My Bipolar Road Trip in 4-D","review":"I felt that this book was able to show the many different faces of bipolar disorder, as well as showing the many faces of the people that survive and even manage to thrive in spite of or maybe because of this disorder.I am bipolar and I was able to laugh out loud at many of the things Lizzie and the others describe, not at them, but at myself for the same things. I was unable to keep from crying towards the end for the same reason.I hope that this book will help someone understand."},{"Title":"Detour : My Bipolar Road Trip in 4-D","review":"This is a difficult review to write. Ultimately, I am reviewing this book through my own experiances as a bipolar person. And I suppose I am filtering her experiences through mine which are both more...and less than hers.The books starts at the place where she becomes most *ill*...symptomatic, if you will. She is prescribed an anti-depressant and becomes manic in the extreme. The CIA is around every dark corner, sleep becomes foreign and the mundane takes on evil connotations. It is the discription that is probably portrayed in crime drama prime time television the most.Ultimately, with diagnosis and medication her life evens out (to the extent that a bipolar person's life can really ever even out) and she decides to find her *herd*... People that she will have the most in commom with... People who are young and successful... People who, I think, she can draw the knowledge she can succeed from.The book is of her travels cross country in her father's SUV interviewing bipolar people who were diagnosed between 16 and 35 years of age. It is of how they feel, how she feels about them... and ultimately how her disorder intersects with the book and her relationships.I had reservations about reading the book and how it would make me feel. In the end, I am glad I did. I think that her observations were astute, non-judgemental, and not self-serving. I think she was very open and very clear and correct about her observations of *stigma* in our society. How it affects and effects people, how it's very insideous. I think she is correct in that there isn't one *bipolar herd* to be found and that people can and do do very well. That success is an individual measurement and best measured by the individual.I would hope that non-bipolar people reading this book would grap these things as well as other things... including the courage showed by everyone in this book, just to go on another day, just to try one more drug, just to make amends for things done.I had alot of sceptical feelings going in... but I had nothing but positive feelings on the way out. Full cycle, you might say."},{"Title":"Detour : My Bipolar Road Trip in 4-D","review":"The most effective thrust of Lizzie Simon's short novelare the opening chapters of her wicked, heart wrenchingexperience overseas before attending Columbia University.She describes a real emotional collapse full of crazythoughts, confusion, vulnerability and the effects ithas on others. Moreover, her description of her flight backhome to her parents is a small gem of decription...the eventsof a sick, emotionally unbalanced young women in the midst oftravel...meeting a stranger, their conversations, her thoughtswhile sweating the ride out. Amazing and brave writing here.Quickly...maybe too quick, Lizzie begins to summerizeher rehabilition...she is stabilized on lithium, graduates fromColumbia, gets a hip job at downtown theater company, etc, etc.So, things appear normal and that is how the book plays itselfout. She goes on an unorganized cross country road trip tomeet people like herself, implicitly challenging the &quot;stigma&quot;associated with these types of sickness, while, also, searchingto &quot;find her own herd.&quot;She chooses young, working, successful people tointerview to shows us that this illness can be dealt with,their stories are interesting...but, Lizzie just doesn'tfeel happy on the road, she's not really connecting, she'slonely and wants to return home. The shift of focus fromMs. Simon, to her quest to travel and interview,splits the bookin half. We hear interviews that are not conducted well.Lizzie listens and plays the role of an earth mother...short, reassuring responses, or biased remarks about the condition. We don't want to hear that!This book felt smug, elitist in some way. It did not dealwith the real struggle of bi-polar disorder...THE REHAB!It can take years to find the right doctor, the medicineand the therapy to get stabilized. Then it's a hell to adjustand filter into society...the slow painful, so sad truth of thesepeople. For Lizzie, all this is overcome much too fast for the ordinary experience.When Ms.Simon tells us about her own experiences, and recollections, we listen...suicide, her growing up, her relationship with her father...the trouble is that we don't get it enough. Her road trip is really a way to illustrate her frustrations and confusion. If this was expressed more the bookwould of kept up the promise of the beginning...she tries to do too much in it and leaves us confused and distanced."},{"Title":"Detour : My Bipolar Road Trip in 4-D","review":"Thanks, Ms. Simon! Growing up not with bipolar, but with a family tree whose history is all over the block (anxiety disorders, clinical depression, schizophrenia, agoraphobia, alcohol addiction), I commend her for writing so honestly and openly about living with a 'mental disorder', which still relates as 'crazy' to most of the modern, supposedly more enlightened world. In this quick, nicely written work, she relates what it's like to be first lost, then wildly successful, then lost again...finally on a journey to find her 'herd'...and I have felt this so many times over, feeling the affects of my family history, feeling 'lost' without that herd...Lizzie, to our, or (my own personal) benefit, realizes at the end that the 'herd' is 'her' without the 'd'...one's struggle to realize one's own destiny and come to grips with one's own self. I commend her for this brave account...she may be seen as 'self-indulgent', as many have branded Kay Redfield-Jamison (I've read both 'An Unquiet Mind' and 'Night Falls Fast'), but I say it's not self-indulgent, just the truth, raw and real. I only know one bipolar, and he's one of the most bright, intelligent persons I know...I think that if genetic research 'wiped out' the 'mental disorders' as we know them, that some of the most special, creative and brightest persons we know on this planet would not exist...and although mental illness places a great toll on families, on individuals, on society, as Lizzie explains her troubles with her families and relationships with other, the world would be a rather bland place without their insight. I think the great Abraham Lincoln (known to suffer black moods himself) once said something to the same effect. Suffer kindly your 'fools', your 'drunkards', your 'crazies'...they just might change the world."},{"Title":"Detour : My Bipolar Road Trip in 4-D","review":"Lizzie Simon writes movingly about her struggles with bipolar illness. This book should receive plenty of attention, since more and more children and teens are being diagnosed with the condition and yet there are relatively few good first person accounts out there. This book is the best I've read so far amd a must for anyone wanting to know more about what it is like to deal with the challenges of handling the ups and downs of being bipolar.The wrong meds can be harmful or even disastrous for bipolar individuals, especially some of the drugs routinely prescirbed for ADD, Attention Deficit Disorder (some bipolars are mistakenly diagnosed as ADD). One of Simon's episodes, in fact, was triggered when she was given an inappropriate medication, setting her off on a frenzy of hallucinations, delusions and outright pyschotic episodes. But within days of getting on the right meds, she was rational and much more in control of herself. Simon's riveting account of this period in her life underscores the importance of proper diagnosis and medication for those with bipolar illness.Another plus of this book: Simon met and interviewed about other people with bipolar illness and shares the info here, revealing the range of personalities and individuals who have it.I found Detour to be an inspiring, educational and very moving book - honest without being overly dramatic or hokey."},{"Title":"Detour : My Bipolar Road Trip in 4-D","review":"Thank you, Lizzie Simon, for having the courage and drive to tell us a little bit of your story, and the story of some others.

There are a large number of exercises included, and the later ones in a section are usually quite challenging and enlightening; many of them extend the main text substantially without increasing the length of the exposition.

His reputation is, if anything, grossly inflated. In this book, Malonetries unsuccessfully to provide a country music chronology, breezily passing fromone musician and singer to the next, and fleetingly touching on one topic afteranother. It's all very fast-paced and unremarkable.20 minutes with this book and any reader is forced to conclude that it's not ascholarly work at all but merely a pastiche of cliches and extremely old, tiredand regurgitated information lacking in insight and understanding.In his earlier works, Malone betrays his tired-out liberalism by making cattyreferences to politicians and country music stars he disagrees with. He onceclaimed that Merle Haggard probably liked Ronald Reagan because Reagan \\"in anearlier stint\\" (clever use of words, right?) as Governor of California pardonedthe country legend.In this book, Malone still just can't seem to figure out why in the heck Haggardbecame a conservative, claiming that critics have differed \\"wildly in their assesmentof the kind of populism that he and his music represent.\\"Yes, that must be it, Bill!

The only thing I got right is the locale.Basically, \\"Headbanger\\" is the story of Pat Coyne, a police officer in Dublin who is determined to arrest some big-time criminals who have evaded the law for years. The problem is that Pat does not have the support of the Garda or his fellow police officers. In Pat, we meet the ultimate maverick police officer who takes it upon himself to bring these drug lords and murderers to justice single handedly. He employs methods that are not only are outside the system, but are downright illegal.In the course of his single-minded determination to bring down these bad guys, Pat also manages to get himself involved in the lives of friends and strangers alike, none of whom welcome his attentions. This is a man who reacts without regard to the consequences of his actions. His rash behavior could prove dangerous not only to him and his beloved wife and children, but to anyone who comes in contact with him.Pat thinks it is his responsibility to make things right for the whole world. Quite a tall order for one man. But, you see, Pat is on an endless search for the meaning of life and what role he can play in setting things right. You can't help but love this guy whose greatest joy is quoting inane statistics about everything in the world you didn't care one whit about to anyone who will listen...or pretend to listen...and spending time with his family.\\"Animosity\\" has scenes of hard-boiled violence, sensitive character explorations and, at times, is just plain funny. The book has no chapters or quotation marks around the dialogue. At first, it was slow reading but once I got into the rhythm, the story flowed. For this reason, I am rating the book four stars instead of five.

While his partner prattles on about golf, Coyne is pondering the bigger problems of the world, especially environmental ones. Unfortunately no one-not his colleagues, nor his wife and kids, or harridan mother in law-seem to understand him. His frustration manifests itself in increasingly rash acts on the job which earn his the nickname of \\"Mr. Suicide\\" as he goes to extreme lengths to clean up Dublin's streets of all its criminal trash.Over the course of the book, his transformation from misunderstood family man to Dirty Harry starts veering more and more toward Travis Bickle territory as he encounters a criminal's girlfriend and is struck by the need to protect her. This pits him against the city's nastiest gangsters in a series of impulsive, clandestine, off the job actions with their own repercussions. Meanwhile, on the home front, his wife is throwing her self into painting, and possibly the arms of her instructor, which only ratchets up Coyne's breakdown. The climactic showdown brings all these threads together and resolves them with very symbolic actions.Ultimately, the book, while an enjoyable quick read, is not the tour de force the cover would have you believe. It is refreshing to find an Irish novel that doesn't tread upon the topics of religion and sectarianism (although the jacket copy writer seemed to think otherwise) for once. There are enough unexplained elements though, to leave readers scratching their heads. For example, in the very beginning, there's a chase scene, and an axe is thrown at Coyne and his partner. There's no talk of taking the axe in as evidence, taking prints off it, using it to convict anyone, it's just like \\"Oh, well someone through an axe at us, hopefully we'll run across them some other time.\\" Coyne has a sort of mentor/father figure who dispenses Obi-Wan type advice to him from time to time, who seems to exist only to point Coyne in the right direction (ie. keep the plot running). And finally, although Coyne is clearly self-destructing and not thinking through the consequences of his actions, it's hard to believe he'd so blithely put his family in the danger he does. It's hard not to compare Coyne (and the book), to Irvine Welsh's imploding Edinburgh police detective Bruce Robertson in the much more inventive and rewarding \\"Filth.\\" Still minor problems aside, it's well worth reading if you're into modern Irish literature, plus, Coyne's story continues in \\"Sad Bastard.\\""},{"Title":"Essential Director 8.5 fast: Rapid Shockwave Movie Development (Essential Series)","review":"This books was very, very step-by-step.

Sometimes they are merely missing the tools this book provides.I am certainly going to recommend it to my patients and give it as a gift to many of my male friends who are struggling with their relationships.

I mean, if you don't know a thing about viruses, or any scientific mumbo-jumbo, then your left out to dry in this book. There's maybe 150 interesting pages in the book. It was a good plot and wisely written. But it lacks the explanations on terms and is written as if you should know this material and if you don't you are stupid."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Even though it was a summer reading book assigned for school, I was excited to read this after reading the enthralling reviews online. Now after reading it I can say that not only was it a huge disappointment, it was quite possibly the worst book I have ever read. Take &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (another book by this author), shrink it down to the biological scale, and give it the most disappointing and least energetic ending possible. The book is loaded with meaningless outdated pseudo-science, flat characters and brief encounters with exciting events unrelated to the actual plot. It is in my opinion a bad turn in a book when characters start having seizures simply to add a lively turn to the monotony of the current sequence of events. Any thrill the reader may have for the solution to the problem itself will be firmly beaten down by the ending of this book. Since the events themselves are simply not exciting, the author's attempts to make them seem like action-movie material fail utterly."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I have read four of Crichton's books before and I have to say this was a disappointment. It was all about the technical terms and the science and doctoral words. Andromeda seemed weighed down by those. The ending cut off too abruptly. The epilogue didn't flow with the story and there were no references to the future. What happened to the disease? Did it kill more people in the world? Did they get samples to study it furter? All these questions left unanswered. Overall, it was not very thrilling. I recommend this to doctors, techno-happy people, and \\"sciency\\" people. It is an easy read and they could obviously understand it better than me."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I read this book for a school report in which I had to read a book by an American author. When I checked it out from the library, I didn't think I'd have much fun reading it, because I don't like reading very much. However, when I did read it, I became so interested in it I read all three hundred pages in only four days. The book was that interesting. The only fault of the book was that it used some words that the average person wouldn't know. I knew them only because I had recently been through a biology class. The author of this book is great, having written many books, including the first two Jurassic Park books, and directing a few movies. Anyways, I like the way he writes because he doesn't use too many words to describe one thing, and makes the book pretty easy to understand. Also, he uses the omnipotent style of third person writing, which is my personal favorite. So, if you're looking for a good thriller with a little irony in it, and have a pretty big vocabulary, at least in biology, then this is a great book for you."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I liked this, but not an exceptional novel. The good bit is the pace and the tension it builds up, but ends on a whimper, almost. Contains portions that are too heavy on scientific technicalities, though some parts are informative. Reading this reminded me of high school biology classes - refresher courses on what are enzymes, proteins, etc.! Though written almost four decades back, the story, the science and the technology referred to in the narrative does not feel dated or stale. Overall, read it if you have don't have a better sci-fi on your shelf for the moment."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"The Andromeda Strain was a brief, fun, and anti-climactic novel by Crichton. I gave it four stars though and that does mean I really liked it. I loved the scramble to figure out why an entire town's population, except for two beings, was killed by a contaminated satellite. I love novels where preventing a world-stopping epidemic from spreading, or at least finding a cure for it before it can kill the entire human race, is the main plot. This one does it better than most with its realistic feel as if this actually happened or could happen. Like I said, I found it to be a bit anticlimactic but that is my only complaint. Some of the information in this book, just like all Crichton novels, was a bit much for me and I had to reread some parts, but it is fun to read intelligent fiction too."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I first read this book in the early 70's, but decided to give it a re-read since NASA announced finding bacteria in California that incorporated Arsenic into its DNA and Explorer I launched in 1977 is nearing the end of our Solar System. These 2 plus our experience with space exploration in the last 30 years(NASA also announced recently that over 100,000 planets in the Milkway might be able to support life) make the circumstances of this novel more real than when I first read it.The crisis of an alien substance starts on the first page. A returning satellite lands near Piedmont, AZ leading to the sudden death of nearly the entire town's population. Two NASA employees intending to retrieve the satellite also suddenly expire in Piedmont. A jet does a flyover investigation of the town, then scientists in special airtight suits land in the town, find the satellite and discover two survivors, a baby and an old man. The bulk of the remaining story is about the five scientists who attempt to determine what infects the satellite, how it caused the death of the residents and what the survivors have in common. Descriptions of the scientists, the top secret location of their examination and the fail safe mechanism in the event of a safety breach are engrossing.The weakness of the story is the drama of the Hollywood ending and the improbable scientific explanation of the denouement. However, if you can accept the last 20 pages, the premise of the story is more relevant today than when first published."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I think its a very interesting book.

We had about 2 weeks to read our books and I finished mine the day after I took it out from the library. I just could not put it down. After reading other books by this author, I realized it was a lot like the other ones or the same basic scheme. Crichton deals with adverse effects of technological advancement:ie.

Piedmont was a desolate ton to begin with, and only got worse after a strange and unknown virus took the lives of all the citizens, save two. This is when the story begins to get juicy. These two survivors, a small child and an old man, are then transferred to a maximum security laboratory in Nevada. From here a team of scientists work toward investigating the virus.As I was reading I often became confused and sidetracked, in particular in the beginning, when Michael Crichton explained the background information on the team of scientists. That section was not especially necessary and somewhat useless. However, quickly I came to find that the book would take a turn for the best when the plot became exciting and interesting. The story in roughly the fifth and sixth chapters became interesting when the team of scientists were sent to work on the case in Nevada. If I were to recommend this novel, I would recommend this book to science fiction fanatics and people interested in a virology or bacteriology field. I, personally am not much of a science person but I too was entertained and enthralled all the way throughout. I wouldn't change much except the scientific terminology.

Fortunately there were two survivors in the toen that lived through the virus. Mr. Stone and Mr. Hall were able to do tests on them. Mr. Stone started a top-secret program called wildfire. This program was designed to make a vaccine for the virus. Whenever they got real close to finding an solution they would always find a problem. They could not find a relationship between the 65-year old man and a baby. They looked everywhere. They thought of everything that they could think of. They kept running into the same thing. Mr. Hall was convinced that there was a relationship that wouldput all the pieces together. They kept going back to the same thing. The were convinced that there was something to do with the old man's ulcer. Eventually they found out that the mysterious germ could live with no protein. They could not believe this descovery because there was nothing else known that could run with no proteins.

Amazingly undated (given the scientific nature of the book), it is exemplary of Crichton's ability to marry fact with fiction.The book's basic premise begins when an unmanned satellite returns to earth contaminated with an extraterrestrial substance. A group of scientists analyze the new particles, racing to prevent a worldwide epidemic. The attention to detail surrounding the secret lab and the protocols followed during the strain's analysis were very interesting. How does one even go about analyzing something that does not come from earth? Something that may not even follow the same laws of physics? What literally unimaginable things can happen to a world invaded by such a thing? This is the rabbit hole Crichton takes the reader down...The beginning of the novel is particuarly explosive and intriguing. And, the style of writing (Crichton writes the novel as if having merely collected old memos/reports/data from real, true events) gives each page of the novel an eerie feeling. Are you reading a novel or a true top secret? That's the beauty of Crichton fiction - the lines between fact and imagination are so wonderfully blurred. As usual, Crichton is able to take incredibly complex concepts and make them digestible - all within a fast-paced fiction setting.The one caveat I will call out is that I did not find this novel to be as suspenseful as some of Crichton's later reads. It's not \\"Jurassic Park,\\" but then, very few books are. And, I did find the end to be a bit lacking. It did not quite live up to the rest of the novel."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I read this when it first came out, just before the movie.

This work really established Crichton, and was well within his Sphere of expertise. I recommend this novel to anyone who had not yet read Crichton."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"The Andromeda Strain is a science fiction novel by Michael Chrighton. It's main idea is based on the possibility of encountering an alien microorganism that is harmful to life on earth. In the story of the Andromeda Strain, a military satellite called Scoop VII, tasked with finding harmful alien microorganisms for use in bioweapons, crashes in the small Arizona town of Piedmont. The organism onboard is then released amongst the citizens of the town, causing both instantaneous blood coagulation and insanity, and resulting in death either way. Only two survive: a senior citizen suffering from an ulcer that drives him towards bad habits that make his blood acidic, and a newborn child found crying in it's crib. A government project created by Jeremy Stone, entitled Wildfire, was created to deal with incidences such as this and it is assigned to clean up the mess. It's team of medical and scientific experts are tasked with both finding out how the bacteria, entitled the andromeda strain, functions, and what allowed the survivors to avoid it's effects.Believing that Piedmont has been decontaminated via directive 7-12 (nuclear bomb), and that the Wildfire facility is the only possible source of contamination, the team takes it's time in finding a way to counteract the bacteria. However they soon discover that directive 7-12 was never put into effect by the president, who chose to activate directive 7-11 (surround area and wait) instead. With this new information the team is left racing against time to find a way to combat an alien bacteria that can grow in virtually any growth medium, contains no proteins, and kills anything with the exception of an acidotic old man, and a perfectly normal infant.I liked this book because I found the idea behind the plot to be very interesting. Whenever you think of encountering alien life, you would never think that the said alien would be a harmful bacteria that life on earth has no previous experience with. I also enjoy the way the story was told, there was a lot of backstory and information mingled in with the main plot. This does a good job of explaining certain elements of the plot, such as scientific theories, to the reader in a non confusing way. In all I thought this book was good, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys science fiction."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I read this book in 11th grade while taking 3 AP courses and working part-time.

So I looked in fiction and there it was! I was relieved to know that the story wasn't based on fact, but I knew the concept of biological warfare is a reality.

The book takes place over a four day period and it only took me 2 days to read it. The book is that quick and good of a read. I don't want to give away what happens but i was just a little disappointed by the end, but it made sense. I really enjoyed this book and i think that it isvery entertaining."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"In Crichton's first novel, he explores the possiblity that first contact might not be with an intelligent lifeform, but a single-celled organism that is more like a virus than anything else. A satellite crash lands is a remote down in Arizona. A virus from the satellite seems to have decimated the local populace and scientists must find a way to contain and destroy the virus. Written in 1967, the novel still manages to be just as scary today as when it was first published. Those looking for something more action oriented, like Jurassic Park or Congo, might be a little disappointed. But the suspense and thrills are abound in this book. I've read it several times and have found it just as exciting each time. Crichton's background in the medical field serves him well in his first novel, with top notch scientific know-how to match the suspensefull plot. Simply a must read."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Although I thoughly enjoyed all of Michael's books, his medical ones are the best (have you read \\"A Case of Need\\".

The only problem is that thoughout the whole book, the scientists worked to find a cure for the strain. But at the end everyone is just like \\" Oh Boy, the strain went away. Hoorey!\\" No way to end a book. Oh well, the rest of the book made up for that!"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I just finished reading The Andromeda Strain for the third time, and I still found myself on the edge of my seat. Crichton created a truly gripping, engaging novel his first time out, and this book deserves to be revisited every few years. Crichton's background in medical science and filmmaking makes him an author to be reckoned with. Michael Crichton is one of my favorite authors, and this book proves his mettle.I'm sure you can read a description of the plot in any number of places on this page, but what I especially wanted to mention is the way Crichton piles coincidence on coincidence to show how quickly something can go wrong. As he says in the acknowledgements section, \\"As in most crises, the events surrounding the Andromeda Strain were a compound of foresight and foolishness, innocence and ignorance.\\" Perhaps most impressive is how subtle some of the setups are, so that the reader never feels like something comes out and hits them in the face. What I mean is that the story is frighteningly plausible. Should you read this? Absolutely. It's the best couple of hours you'll ever spend with a science fiction novel."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"The Andromdeda Strain was the first Crichton book I ever read. I recieved it as a Christmas gift from my mother, but put it aside after reading a few pages. After taking an introductory college biology class, though, the story came alive for me; the real science Crichton incorporates into his writing gives it an air of credibility and reality that wouldn't let me set it down.I love Crichton because his writing is so thought provoking.

He gets the call he was hoping would never come, and is transported immediately to a 5 leveled lab, underground, with six other men to activate a project known simply as &quot;Wildfire&quot;. I won't say anymore, except one thing: project Wildfire will be dangerous - VERY dangerous if it gets out of the lab!I thought that this was a pretty good book, but it was probably aimed at more higher level readers than me. Some parts of this book were confusing, and others were just stupid, but overall it was pretty good. The only part that really bothered me was the ending. Michael Crichton built the story up so much that you were left saying,&quot; WHAT? THAT WAS IT??&quot; I mean, it was a good ending, but it was kind of dissapointing, because it was not as exciting and dramatic as the rest of the book.Another thing about this book was that it changed view points a LOT. Almost every chapter was a different one of the 7 main people. This was good, because that way, you could see what everyone was thinking, and not one person's biased opinion. Kind of like these book reviews!!!Again, this book was for adults, but was good all the same!"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"The Andromeda Strain is a science-fiction thriller, based and written in the 1970s. The story begins when a secret military satellite designed to collect extra terrestrial organisms from orbit crashes in a small town in Arizona. The retrieval mission seems to be fairly routine, until it is discovered that all but two of the population of Piedmont has mysteriously died. This causes major concerns for the Wildfire team, a group of several scientists recruited to determine the threat factor of alien organisms, and if necessary, destroy it. The mission soon turns to one that could determine the fate of all life on Earth.Working in a top secret government facility in Nevada, the Wildfire team struggles to find an explanation for the deaths of the people of Piedmont, and the nature of the alien organism codenamed Andromeda. The nature of the deaths and the two survivors with seemingly nothing in common also contributes to the mystery that is the Andromeda strain. The scientists encounter one problem after another, and the fate of the planet is in their hands time and time again.This suspenseful story will keep you interested from beginning to end. Although this book seems less suspenseful than some of Crichton's other books, it is still a great read. The only problem I had with it was the constant scientific jargon that plays into the story at some points. However, I would still recommend this book to any science-fiction reader."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"The Andromeda Strain is the first Michael Crichton book I have ever read, and I will honestly say that I found it intrigueing and quite a learning experience. I felt like I was attending an advanced science class that require more research in order to pass. Good thing, he explained some of the things mentioned to give a better understanding of what he was writing about. He made me a believer in the science fiction.The attention was mostly on this new discovery, and I was eager to find out everything they discovered. I wanted to know the exact details; like it was real nonfiction reading. This book really caught my attention and wouldn't let go of it.This science fiction is really a turn around from what I usually read, and I'm glad I broaden my reading to include this novel. I was impressed and inspired. I turned each page waiting for the cure to the Andromeda Strain.This is an excellent read, and if you are a science fiction junky, this is the book for you.

I am glad I did because the novel was quite intriguing. I found it very realistic despite some dated technology, particularly in the medical arena. Yet that didn't stand in the way of a good plot and strong characters. Like many others, I found the ending disappointing, which is why I gave it a 4-star rating. Nevertheless, it is easy to see why Michael Crichton is such a successful novelist today."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"One of Crichton's greatest strengths is his ability to infuse science 'fiction' with plenty of science 'fact.' It is a refreshing change from sci-fi writers who simply toss around science vocabulary words, or rely on worn-out cliches such as hyperdrive, teleporters, and wormholes. In this classic tale, Crichton uses his background knowledge to conjure an alien microbe that infects the earth. He follows the progress of the scientists who study the Andromeda Strain...their discoveries about its nature...the details of its structure...and it looks as though all the little details will soon tie into a revelation about the Andromeda Strain...a microbe more incredible and bizarre than any microscopic lifeform on earth...and then the book comes abruptly to an end. It would not have been much more disappointing to end the story with, &quot;He woke up with a start, covered with sweat.

I was just expecting a more creative, and more fulfilling, conclusion."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"The story &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot; by Michael Crichton is one of the best books I have ever read. It is about five prominent bioshysicists who give the U.S. government a very urgent warning.

The government ignores the warning and continues with the dangerous project.Two years later, another Project known as Scoop sent out 17 satelites to collect space dust and organisms for examination procedures. Tragically, one probes falls to Earth and unleashes a dealy alien virus. Peoples dead bodies are ending up everywhere, and they all have been victims of the deadly virus.

I remember reading it and being on the edge of my seat throughout, so I thought it would be fun to listen to the audio on a recent trip.The first tape is actually kind of boring. Actor, Chris Noth makes all the characters sound very much the same during the first tape, which makes it difficult to follow. (Especially during the many passages of description) However, during the second tape, he seems to find his stride and begins to create vocal characterizations.It was also amazing to me how much the technology of the story is outdated, and/or even common place. The story is still a classic, and the second half of the tape is very good, you just need patience for the first one."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"First of all, I thought it was very interesting at the begining. But as I reached the middle I found myself skipping paragraphs, just so I could get it over with. I can understand why they had to go through all those procedures but Crichton could have made it a little more thrilling. And to all the people who keep commenting about the bacteria itself, relax. Just try to imagine that such a bacteria exsists, it's only a book. Use your imagination !!!!"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Michael Crichton has written two great books and one really good one. They are, in order of their appearance, Andromeda Strain, The Great Train Robbery and Congo. Having produced these, all of which were made into movies of greater or lesser mediocrity, Crichton started writing screen plays, among them, Jurassic Park (I may vomit), Lost Whateverthehellitwas (barf), and Disclosure (double barf, surely one of the worst books ever written). Andromeda Strain is a great piece of work - feasible to a non-scientist who couldn't care less whether a microbe like this could exist in fact, but constituted a very real threat in the world of fiction. Personally, I read this book twice in 24 hours (the only other one was Silence of the Lambs), and reread it with some regularity. Its really too bad that this represents the peak of a writing career for a skilled author with immense potential who tragically sold out to the Hollywood scenario."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"A very intresting story about a killer virus that lands on Earth in a contaminated satellite called Scoop. The virus clotts up your blood or drives you to the brink of total insanity and causes you to calmly kill yourself in sometimes a very odd fashion.If Crichton keeps this sort of novels coming out for a while longer he will be known as the king of the technothriller, or the master of suspense. If you haven't read any of his books, and you're looking for a intresting and suspenseful author who delivers a powerhouse of a novel every time he writes, read Crichton, and read The Andromeda StrainThe reason I enjoyed this novel so much is that he doesn't write it from the viewpoint of someone who is running from the virus, but someone who is trying to stop it.If you are planning to go to the library anytime soon, check this out and start reading it ASAP."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"This was one of the first stories I read of Crichton's and it is the reason why I line my bookshelves with his other novels. Crichton is a master at taking a reader down one path and having it lead to a dead end. In this novel he has the reader all worried about the alien virus outside of the research station. It is going to destroy all life on the planet and then it turns into a harmless plastic eater. Meanwhile, it is inside the station that we are to be concerned about. He builds up the sense of dread in the station by giving exact details as to the precautions for each level of the station. I think this is his best novel and it might be because of his blend of action with his knowledge of medicine. I would recommend this to all readers interested in reading their first Crichton novel. Moreover, I wish they would make this into a movie again; instead of making Sphere"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"This book describes a fictious encounter with microbes from beyond. The men sent to recover a sattelite from where it has landed in this small town wonder why there are no lights at all in a town at ten-oclock at night. They enter the town and within five minutes are dead.Next we encounter a number of scientists in different locations as they are alerted to the situation and sent to the government labratory that has been prepared for this situation, and the steps that they take to analyze and isolate the organism. The lab is the perfect place to study such an organism: it is even equipped with a nuclear self-destruct in case things go wrong.....Mr. Crichton tells a simple but logical tale in this volume and as he often does in his books, makes it hard to distinguish between the real elements of science that he uses for the basis of the premise, and the fictious facts he makes to take the premise to its conclusion. This is classic fiction, and the fact that it is over thirty years old takes nothing from it. Definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Michael Crichton must be a psychic. Thirty years before researchers discovered the effects of microorganisms, Crichton predicted a virus just as deadly. The Andromeda Strain is a classic, terrifying novel of biophysics. The way Crichton combines facts and fiction results in a masterpiece. With the exception of some intense scientific vocabulary, the descriptive language used by Crichton in this novel is brilliant.When an unmanned satellite returns to earth lethally contaminated, four American scientists are ordered to a secret lab to work against the threat of a worldwide epidemic. There are no villains in this novel - only the microscopic organisms of earth's extinction. This is a perfect story line, written with immense detail. Crichton does a superb job of setting the scene and describing the characters. He leaves his reader not wanting to stop, having great cliffhangers at the end of each chapter. The suspense builds inevitably to a heart-stopping conclusion. It is an intelligent and tightly plotted suspense-thriller.Many of Crichton's works masterfully combine fact and fiction. The Andromeda Strain is no exception as the scientific elements are expertly interwoven with the fictional world of underground laboratories and secret agents. Crichton's facts about bacteria and viruses are right on - he goes as far as using quotes from professors and scientists as well as diagrams to support his arguments. When he switches to fictional mode, Crichton does not lose a step. His theories about government testing grounds and secret government projects, written thirty years prior, do not seem at all unrealistic in today's high-tech world.Although the novel grabs the reader's attention from the very first page with its crisp prose, there are some minor impediments in that this is a highly technical narrative, centering on complex issues of science. Even Crichton, in his acknowledgments preceding the novel, apologizes &quot;...if the reader must occasionally struggle through an arid passage of technical detail.&quot; Fortunately, Crichton was also able to mix up his writing style. Here is an example of a beautifully written verse:&quot;He often argued that human intelligence was more trouble than it was worth. It was more destructive than creative, more confusing than revealing, more discouraging than satisfying, more spiteful than charitable.&quot;This passage clearly shows how diverse Crichton can be in his writing. The metaphors he uses fit perfectly with the plot of the story at the time this passage is used. Crichton constantly switches from technical to figurative language as if to cater his novel to all of his readers."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"This isn't my first Michael Crichton book, but i think it's the best. I've read Jurassic Park, and the Lost World before this, and they were fairly good. But this book topped both of them. It was assigned summer reading for me this year, and i thought, &quot;Oh great, another boring book that i have to read.&quot; But when i started reading it, I found myself reading for 2 hours just striving to complete the next chapter.(I'm a slow reader) The words that he uses are sometimes hard to read, and i pulled out a dictionary for all the ones that i couldn't figure out. I don't really like reading books, but this book has changed my mind on reading. It was so suspenseful in the end that i found i chewed my fingernails down to stubs when i finished reading. Anyone who loves suspense will be over powered by the amount of it generated by this book."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"This book is the best, and I could never put it down! It describes the search for an organism that is killing people. The way Crichton portrays all of his characters is magnificent, which is why I really connected with this book. I felt as if I was the missing scientist from the team! I sincerely liked the way Crichton concealed the identity of the person who deciphered the mystery. I genuinely enjoyed reading about the long hours spent down in Level V of the Wildfire base. This is where Hall took care of Mr. Jackson and the baby, where Burton performed his autopsies, and where Stone and Leavitt worked on finding the organism. The other part I thoroughly enjoyed was reading about Burton and Stone while they were in Piedmont, looking for the satellite. What they found was so startling, that you hardly new what to expect next. I really believe you should buy this book, because it is such a wonderful scientific mystery!"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I really love later Crichton, but this one was one of his earlier ones, and you can tell. It starts out VERY intriguing, and sets the reader up to keep the pages turning. However, towards the end he seems to try to wrap it up too quickly, and he left me saying, \\"That's it?\\" \\"State of Fear\\" and \\"Prey\\" hooked me in and left me saying, \\"WOW!\\" at the end. So I was a little disappointed. But still a good book."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"The back cover starts: &quot;Five prominent biophysicists give the US government an urgent warning: sterilisation procedures for returning space probes may be inadequate to guarantee uncontaminated re-entry to the atmosphere.&quot; Biophysicists, right? One can hardly find a more appropriate reading to read on the train, when I was travelling to the 3rd European biophysics congress in Munich earlier this month.This novel will teach you that the life on earth was in early February 1967 close to disaster comparable to the impact of Chixculub meteorite 65 million years ago. An US space probe, Scoop VII, brought with it a highly virulent and pathogenous alien life form from the orbit, before it crashed into the Arizona desert. After wreaking havoc in a small Arizona town, the space probe is transferred into the ultra-secret high-security US government lab in Nevada, built just a couple of months before to prevent dispersion of toxic extraterrestrial agents. Here, a group of five scientists led by a Nobel prize winner, bacteriologist Jeremy Stone, starts a race with time. What exactly is this alien life form? By which mechanism does it affect human body? Under what conditions does it multiply? How can we stop it before it wipes away the human population?The novel contains quite a bit of technical details - it's science fiction after all, right? - where Crichton will pause and explain with a patience and persistence of a good-humoured teacher. So in case you didn't know what proteins are and what they are made from; or how electron microscope operates; or what can cause blood acidity in a patient - you will learn it all here.It would be interesting to know how many scientists today were influenced by this novel to pursue a career in science. Because, after all, what Crichton writes is mostly how a scientific experiment is conducted. OK, the method in biosciences have advanced somewhat from the late sixties, but the spirit is still here. So while you are unlikely to encounter the situation when you have a few hours to save the humankind, scientific research never loses its share of excitement, either."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"This is the first Crichton book that I ever read. The book is a thrilling account of the introduction of a space-borne bacteria into the earths atmosphere. The bacteria wipes everyone in a small town except a drunk and a crying baby. The book is a life-like account of what the scientists found, how they tried to find what the bacteria is, why these two people survived, and how do they find a cure. I felt the fictional technology was incredible by todays standards, much less in 1969 when this book was originally copywrited.As an Engineer, I found this book absolutely awsome. The way the book was written in general was excellent. They way the story was layed out for the reader made it so that I never wanted to put it down. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes science/science fiction based work."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"\\"The Andromeda Strain\\" was Michael Crichton's first best-seller and set the stage for what was to come in his subsequent books: one-dimensional characters and an irresistable story. Crichton missed his true vocation; he should have been a high school science teacher. He has a rare gift for taking difficult and incomprehensible scientific topics and making them interesting and even fun for all us techno-dummies.\\"The Andromeda Strain\\" tells the story of a space capsule returning to earth bringing a very unwelcome hitch-hiker in the form of a microscopic organism that reproduces exponentially and acts out in all kinds of nasty ways. It's timely and topical and raises the age-old question, could it actually happen? As Crichton suggests, there may be all kinds of surprises, both pleasant and unpleasant, lurking out in deep space waiting to be brought back to Earth, and we had better be ready for them.The 58 references for further reading listed in the back of the book are probably meant to whet our interest further, although none of them are probably half as interesting as this book is. You turn the final page of Crichton's books feeling you've been both entertained and educated, which, flat characterizations and all, makes him so much fun to read.Judy Lind"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I've enjoyed a number of Michael Crichton's novels, finding his erudition and dedicated research and some of his philosophy in sympathy with my own interests and concerns. In looking through a list of his books, I found that I had read most of the later works but had missed one of his very first, The Andromeda Strain. I decided to correct the omission and fully enjoyed the book. Although it's a little dated (having been penned in 1969), it bears up well. I was amazed at the number of scientific discoveries that were already put to technological use as early as the 60's (fiber optics being the one that comes most readily to mind).As in so many of his other works of fiction, Crichton introduces underlying issues of modern society, bringing some of the behavior we tend to accept as a &quot;given&quot; into question. In the case of the Andromeda Strain, he focuses on the hubris of the US military and of the scientific community. He highlights society's blind faith in technological &quot;fixes&quot; for every miss management of the environment, as though scientists and engineers can unfailing forestall the effects of every misdeed perpetrated by humanity on the rest of the planet.In Andromeda Strain, the space program has been more or less subtly commandeered by the military to probe Earth's upper atmosphere for non-terrestrial bacteria with which to culture biological weapons of mass destruction--sound familiar? They succeed more fully than they are prepared to handle when the tiny organisms get loose among the naive biota of the earth, wrecking havoc with every living thing. To the rescue is a team of 5 carefully chosen scientists from a variety of fields, sealed away in a hyper-isolation facility in the middle of the Southwestern Desert. Can they save the earth in time? Read on!An excellent early book, worth reading even in the 21st Century."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"What would happen if bacteria from space were to infect people on Earth and how would you be able to fight a completely alien disease? This scenario is the plot line for The Andromeda Strain by Michael Crichton. A satellite was given the job of collecting upper atmosphere bacteria for possible use as biological weapons and one of these satellites crashes and ends up in a small Arizona town. Every citizens, except for a sickly old man, and a baby, dies a horrible death, either dying because all of the citizen's blood has clotted up, or going mad and committing suicide. The government learns about the death of the village, and calls in Project Wildfire. Project Wildfire is a group of elite scientists, hand-picked for their knowledge of clinical microbiology, epidemology, pathology, and electrolyte microbiology. They report to their hidden base under the Nevada desert and work to find a cure for an alien disease, that is unlike any earth sickness, before it can multiply enough to infect the entire world. All of Crichton's books that I've read are good. His books always have a heavy scientific background. Drawing from his Ph.D. from Harvard, his Jurassic Park and The Lost World, the two books that Crichton is best known for, use a lot of information about genetics. The Andromeda Strain uses more of a mixture biology and virology. The Andromeda Strain is a good techno-thriller, and the reader could actually learn something about the two sciences above. I couldn't figure out what most of the diagrams were supposed to mean, but I could understand the parts involving the bacteria and how it worked. I was also impressed by the scientific papers used in the references for the book. I'd give the The Andromeda Strain a 9 out of 10 because, although The Andromeda Strain is an intelligent and entertaining book, it drags in some parts, which takes away from the good parts. Still, I enjoyed reading The Andromeda Strain though I wouldn't recommend it for everybody."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"This was the first Michael Crichton book I read and is still the best. The story is compelling and makes you believe that this really occured within the US Government. All the characters are strong and the book moves with amazing pace which keeps you turning the pages. A book to read again and again."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I just recently finished one of the best books I've ever read. Andromeda Strain was exciting and very action packed through out. One of the main reasons I really liked it was because it started out with a very fast paced and excitng plot. It didn't get caught up in describing the sunset and scenery etc., it just cut to the chase. This book is about five scientists who are trying to get to bottom of a possible biological plague. The strain entered the atmosphere on an unmanned satallite, and that's all they know about it! This book is written very well, and in a style I really enjoy. Michael Crichton writes from the perspective that the whole story is true, and it really happened. He uncovers the top secret dealings of the government and reveals them to the public. All in all this is a great book for any one remotely interested in science fiction, or even if you're not!"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"All in all, the book left me hungry for more details and deeper relations to the characters, a climax that was suspended or lengthened would have been nice, and an ending that didn't leave you feeling empty would have been much appreciated. Compared to Crichton's other works, this was a failed attempt to win millions of fans, but surely one that left you thinking. Instead of mesmerizing you chapter by chapter, he waits until you have completely finished the book, laid it down, and then he lingers in your head while you contemplate what just happened. If he wants you to remember this book, he should get five stars. If he wants you to like this book, two stars is the result!"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"This book is about Project Scoop, a project used to find alien life, which sends a small, unmanned space craft up to retrieve samples of organisms in space. The craft comes down from space and lands in Piedmont, Arizona. Scoop sends men to recover the craft but they find something very interesting: lots of dead bodies all lining the street. What happened here? Does it have something to do with the craft? Or was it alien related? The government sends five biophysicists in to gather answers. The biophysicists find two people who weren't affected, and they can't find out what makes them special. Then there is a plane crash, and the pilot finds the rubber dissolving in front of his very eyes. Is there an outbreak? Will the scientist find an answer to what this is and how to stop it? Or will they be too late, and the world be doomed?This book has a really good plot and at times, it feels like you are actually in the book. The characters have full backgrounds and are very relatable. An example is when: Stone gets pulled away from a dinner party and there are federal agents outside his house with guns. Granted this most likely will not happen but it proves that these men have very normal lives.Some negative points were the use of scientific language, because I didn't know what they were talking about, and I couldn't get into the book. Sure I know they had to use scientific words because they were scientists but couldn't the author have explained a little more? The next negative point was the charts and maps. Every time I was really into the book, they through one in and I had to look at that and lost my place.In conclusion, I really liked the book, but I wouldn't recommend it for everyone. If you really like science, go for it. Anyway, the rating would have to be a three because of the fact that I couldn't really get into the book because of the charts, maps, and not enough explaining of parts of the book. I give this book 3 stars."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Reading this book is almost like watching that gray-haired, ultra-smooth-talking painter, Bob Ross, from PBS all those years ago, creating a near-flawless scene on a canvas in under 30 minutes.

The satellite prematurely crashes right near Piedmont, a small town in Arizona. This unknown microorganism causes all but two people in Piedmont to meet their maker. It is the job of a small team of scientists to unravel the mysteries of this microorganism. Isolated, in an underground facility the scientists go to work.I found most of this book to be at least mildly interesting. The plot seems somewhat plausible on the surface (even if it really isn't). The ending is a bit of a deus ex machina and some of the plot devices are entirely too clich&eacute;d (the clock ticking down to ultimate destruction for instance). There are also elements that are way too contrived though I won't discuss them here because it would spoil an important aspect of the plot.In the end, it was entertaining enough to keep my bookmark moving."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I actually saw the movie before I read the book.

The plot is about a group of scientists that gather in a maximum security research facility to deal with the problems that arise after a lethal virus kills the inhabitants of a small town. At the time this suspense thriller was written in 1969, none knew years later that a similar outbreak would occur of the Ebola virus years later. In what some scientists hail as a prophetic work of fiction, I was not so enthusiastic. Reading the book I struggled somewhat with the medical jargon and detailed images of binary code which were skimmed circumspectly. Plot twists occured but often any sign of creativity by the author was overshadowed by his scientific knowledge. As short as the book already is (283 pages) it could be condensed to a novella by taking out the filler present within much of the book. A general response to sum up this review would be of dissapointment because the book begins to build up an interesting plot but falls short of the goal. I would recommend this book to anyone who holds an appreciation for science and the unknown but not to those who are looking for excitement."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I don't know. This book was okay, but I have read better. This book was overflowing with technical insights so if your into a more scientific book, get this. But when I read for pleasure I'd prefer not to read something which reminds me of school. It just didn't hold my attention like Timeline and Jurrasic Park did. It still had a good idea behind it, and it seemed like it could've happened. You should read it on a rainy day."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"It is a good, quick read - much like all other Crichton books. If you like them, you'll like this one."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"The first and ONLY book I have read by Mr. Crichton, I expected a book of great suspence and action from an author so widely known. BIG LET DOWN!!! For one thing, the storyline seemed to constantly leave things unexplained (maybe it was just me). In numerous parts of the novel, I found myself reading back two and three pages, thinking I just somehow missed something, but it never did explain what I wanted to know. Also, many terms used could've been, to me, some newly invented language. Maybe it's just because I'm not a science freak. In any case, I thought the book was boring, draggy, and, take away the very first and last few pages, extremely uneventful. What amazed me was the number of acclaims that were listed at the beginning of the book. Were those critics reading the same version of the novel I read?"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"For some reason, even though this book is highly rated, I didn't enjoy it at all. I'm not huge on science, so the technical mumbo jumbo throughout the book was a little to much to handle. I know that I'm not the only one either.I guess I was expecting \\"The Stand\\" when I picked up this book, so you can imagine how utterly disappointed I was. I felt like Crichton was giving me his resume and showing off his med school mind instead of focusing on making the book enjoyable to read. I kept waiting for the climax....and waiting...and nothing every happened!I give a two star only because I try and reserve 1 stars for terribly atrocious books. This pushed the envelope though."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Book in good condition -- sent promptly."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"the book was not as good as i expected. the begning was very good, but torwards the end it got too confusing. i think you sould read this book, but expect much from it. i think timeline was ten times better than this."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Crichton is a master of detail and tells a very complete story, but this one was just too scientific for my liking."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"KINDLE edition:Would give this horrible collection of words no stars, but I can't.I have a guilty pleasure of reading paperback novels so I wasn't expecting a literary work of art, just a fun, quick read. Something on the level of Stephen King.I knew they made some pretty successful movies from Crichton stories so I thought this was going to be some light entertainment.What I got was a total time suck.First, I received a free sample from Amazon. The first chapter was great. Really cool set up. This is where you get bamboozled. This is where you should stop and make up the rest of the story in your head.SPOILER:Basically a biological outbreak from space. What is going on? Where did it come from?That's the most excitement you will get, I promise.The rest of the book takes place in an underground lab where scientist try to solve and stop a worldwide biohazard.Characters are boring.Story is boring.Biological killer from space, boring.Climax is boring.Characters still boring.Ending is boring.I'm bored.Good luck, If you ignore this review and just make the leap into loosing around 8 bucks let me know how it worked out.I don't want to say I told you so, but I did."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"The book kept me interested. The best part of the book was that it was not far-fetched and that Michael wrote this book about 25 years before diseases like the ebola virus where in the news.

A great science-fiction book!"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"This novel by MC had me glued in to the chair and thinking of only the book! Not much action but has a lot of the classic Crichton details and facts."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Michael Crichton's The Andromeda Strain was a brilliant page-turner from start to thrill-packed finish. It offered an enlightening, and refreshingly cerebral, perspective on the possibilities of extraterrestrial life and man's biologic defenses to that life with the complications of socio-political beaurocracy and the challenge of saving the world in a very limited amount of time. I thoroughly enjoyed this book for many reasons, mainly because it challenged a scientifically untrained mind such as mine not only to hang on for the ride but to explore and learn a myriad of new concepts. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wishes to expand their mind and explore new avenues of thought or for anyone who just loves a good suspensful novel and is not afraid of big words."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Andromeda Strain ranks as Crichton's most compelling and fascinating book (with Jurrassic Park a close second). Every aspect of Crichton's storytelling: the characters, the scientific insight, the suspense, are all at the top of their form. A true classic."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"This is an excellant book about all that scientific stuff. This is the best book i have ever read that doesnt have any human or animals for bad guys. Andromeda Strian is put together well and is one of his best. It starts out pretty slow but it picks up towards the end."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"This is the kind of story that, maybe, one day will be history. Crichton reveals the beautiful, but even so, dangerous, world of biological research. Very well written with lots of technical details, perfectly blended with action and drama. It is not, however, his greatest book ever...If you like his style maybe you will want to read the great classical from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle - &quot;The poison belt&quot;"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"It was one of his ok books, but still very dull in some parts. I didn't like the ending much and the thinking of some people puzzles me. However, it influenced my thinking in someways about aliens and other stuff like that. However, it is an intelligent book."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"This is my favorite of all his books. It requires an interest in the field of medicine/microbiology though. It was great how he inter-twined the fact and fiction of what we know today and leaves the mind open to think of what kind of diseases we will come to face in the future. A real classic for all science fiction lovers!"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"The book puts you in the place of the scientists. That also gets the reader to wondering what is going to happen next. The book is a good book for people that are into suspense novels. It also gives an accuret account of what happens during those five days of the biological battle with andromeda."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Well, I won't go into the details of the story (that's what your job is), but I'll give you my opinion. Crichton integrates a tremendous amount of medical/biological, and scientific knowledge, clearly influenced by his time at Harvard Medical School, and large amounts of research, with elements of fiction that mix so perfectly, it seems as if it's actually happened. His vivid descriptions of events, locations, and everything else appearing in the story set the scene beautifully, so you can visualize everything to the smallest detail. Overall, an amazing book, just as his other novels were, and follows Crichton's usual medical/scientific theme for a great read."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"The Andromeda Strain is a fantastic book filled with scientific themes and drama. It was a book that increased my knowlede of the biological field. The book did not drag on like books from other authors. It just got to the main points and told an interesting tale of a virus that was unknown to human kind that we were not prepared for even though there were scientists that recomended that special facilities be built the facilitities just were not good enough. The cure for the virus was not hard to find even though the scientist could not find out the cure right away. They just overlooked a few facts that I am sure they would have found if they took there time like scientists should in a non emergency such as the case was because it was not spreading anywhere. I was not able to put the book down through all the excitment that was going on. I am sure that if Michael came out with another book even if it was along the same lines I would enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"&quot;The Andromeda strain&quot; shows very exciting view of the dangers of the modern space exploration.Crichton tells about the possibilities of the modern medicine as well as about the future of mankind in space.If somebody thinks of aliens , he imagines &quot;little green men&quot;, but the kind of aliens we will get to know pretty soon will be microscopical viral lifeforms and bacterias.This lifeforms might be a danger for the whole mankind, because no human body is able to defend itself against bacterias it never knew.So an organisation like the &quot;Hell Fire&quot; team could be our last hope.In this book the story had a good end. This danger is shown very realistic by Crichton."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"This book has a lot of technical details. A lot. The book itself it is not very long, but a portion is tech details. Nonetheless, this sci-fi epic is fresh as ever, although the technology and dates date it somewhat. When a mysterious virus either kills all of the inhabitants of a small town there or makes them insane, shortly after a space probe crashes, a team of scientists must study this virus to determine a way to control it. Leading the team is renowned biologist Jeremy Stone, along with several other experts, to determine the nature of this elusive strand. The ending is unexpected, and a little disappointing. I dislike the analyses of a certain characters' actions, i.e. (It was twenty-four hours until he realized his error.) And there is too much foreshadowing, to the point where plot twists become predictable. But these are just minor things, not to be worried about. All in all, this is a good book, and rightfully a classic, and a worthy start for the Author"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I still haven't been dissapointed by a Michael Crichton book. This is a great book that I went through in a week. The introduction really made me think the story was true which I'm sure added to my excitement in reading. This book was published in 1969 so you may have to put up with some age difference. He tells about how expensive microscopes are(pretty darn cheap now) and explains briefly how a computer works and what they're for(everybody has them now). The ending was something very unexpected for me and not like I may have wanted it, but it was still a great Crichton book."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"This was a great novel, it was full of suspennse and kept my hair raised. It is erie how plausible this story truely is. I would recommend this book to enyone and everyone, especially if they enjoy science fiction books."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"This is a great science-fiction thriller. It's one of my favorite books by Chrichton. I love how Chrichton researches about subjects before he writes about them, this is an excellent example of it, he actually knows what he's talking about. I highly recomend this book to Chrichton fans and science fiction fans, and just about any, it's a short, easy read."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I would actually rate this as 4.5 stars. What makes this story so good is the mystery that comes with this virus that you have read so much about. You never know what it is going to do next. This creates lots of suspense, which makes this a FUN novel to read. I didnt really like the ending, though. I would have liked to see something different happen, but I'm sure a lot of people would like it. I highly reccommend it."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"The Andromeda Strain by Michael Crichton is an interesting look into the world of science. Under the code name Scoop the government sends a satallite into outer space to collect unknown organisms. The government thinks while in orbit the satallite hit a meteor, and crashed land in Piedmont, Arizona. When they send a team to recover the capsule they find everyone dead except an infant and a sixty-seven year old man.The government created a high tech lab for such things as Scoop called Wildfire. They also got together the best scientists and doctors in the U.S. Once the team isolated the organism they gave it the name the andromeda strain. One day during testing one of the doctors became contaminated when his rubber suit was eaten throught by the virus. The team found out that the virus had mutated and that is why the doctor hadn't instantly died. But the government had installed a self-detonating bomb to go off three minutes after contamination, which meant the one team memeber with the key had to stop the bomb. I would definintely recomend this book because it is great for all people, and is easy to understand because the author details everything perfectly. This book is a classic and will be popular for a long time, READ IT."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Although this was one of Crichton's best works, it is not the best. There are several reasons why. First, there was too much foreshadowing on the plot twists, which took out some of the suspense. Secondly, the ending was, in my opinion, a bit of a letdown. The book is inevitably dated, yet it is still a compelling bio-terror novel, but if you want Crichton's best, pick up a copy of Sphere."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I would recommend this book to everyone out there. This book is great and I never read a book anything like this before. I truly recommend it to all the readers out there."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"The Andromeda Strain had great potential, but does not exploit it. The book's action is thinnly widespread, and the technical and scientific terms are a nightmare to read if you don't know them. On the good side, the virus was great, and so were the descriptions."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I reread The Andromeda Strain and rank it as Michael Crichton's third best novel behind Sphere and Disclosure. The Andromeda Strain is the scariest however because of its realism. Crichtoin has many excellent books, The Andromeda Strain is unique in its own way because after you're done reading it, it leaves you with one question: Are we safe?"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I remember when i first read this book, i was young, probably too young seeing that i was around 8 years old then. but i could still see how good it was.Now, as a 14 year old that is taking biology, i can understand it all the more clearly. I read it over again every two years becuase i learn more and more things about science. I admire the critchon's guts in using all these techinical terms."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I read many books by this author and others like him. This is by far the best book I have ever read! I reccomend this book to everybody who likes books that lead you to different conclusions about the virus every chapter. I feel this book is for mostly adults, however I am 13 and I loved this book. The reason I think mostly adults will like this book is because you need to have a backround on biology. You don't need to know much, just a little bit. I know most of my friends like and understand it, but some people don't. I LOVE THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"the book is really great! but what about the end? did crichton run out of paper? it's a pitty he did not finish his great story properly."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"\\"The Andromeda Strain\\", by Michel Crichton portrays the trials to control a lethal contamination brought to Earth by a government satallite. The satellite crashed in a small town in Arizona. The contamination it contained, the Andromeda Strain, kills all its inhabitants except for an old man and a baby. A group of elite scientist are assigned to project Wildfire to find a cure for the deadly strain. The scientists discover that the strain is a living crystal that uses everything and wastes nothing, in addition it can thrive in any material known to man. In an attempt to eradicate the strain, the president or the US orders a nuclear weapon to be detonated in the area of contamination. The scientitst must then race to find the cure for the strain.This scientific point of view defines the way the book is developed. The book contains somewhat extensive and sometimes drawn-out descriptions of scientific fact. These descriptions add greatly to the believability of the book, while they consume so much of its content that there is little room for action or character development. The book could almost be considered a technical manual on biology and viruses rather than a fictitious work. Despite its extensive explanations of scientific fact, it will leave the reader questioning the reason of many of its events. Overall, this book will satisfy one's scientific mind while the general plot is somewhat simple and ends very abruptly. A reader is likely to finish feeling little closure, which could very well be the intention of the author to add suspense, and define the theme."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I would recommend this book to everyone out there. This book is great and I never read a book anything like this before. I truly recommend it to all the readers out there"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"The ANDROMEDA STRAIN is one of Crichtons best. It is very exciting and makes you think about how scary being sick can be. It is about a small town called Peidmont in Arizona. A government satlelite lands there and is opened. Inside is an unknown terestrial virus from space. The virus is taken isolated and contained while the government biological wildfire project is executed. But the virus mutates and then the real danger starts. The ANDROMEDAN STRAIN is an interesting novel from the author of JURRASIC PARK."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I absolutly couldn't put it down. I started reading it at night and didn't go to sleep until I finished it."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"This book still remains near the top for my all-time worst endings for a book. For me, the book was very engrossing throughout. Contaminents brought to earth from a satellite has killed everyone in a small western town except an old man and a crying baby and the nation's best bio-physicists are in a race against time to identify and contain the situation before it spreads. The struggles of the physicists keeps you glued to the pages. I sat in my car at lunch just to get in a few more pages. Crichton leaves you guessing with statements that &quot;they wouldn't know the errors of their decisions until much later&quot;. What mistakes, what's going to happen?Grisham grabs ahold of you and doesn't let go (thus my rating of 2 stars). Until the ending. It seemed as if the publisher told Crichton, you only have x number of pages for this book - if you write one page over this number, you won't receive any money. Crichton is heading you at breakneck speed to the climax, only to have the climax be anything but. I picture him at his keyboard furiously banging the keys with exhilaration as the end is nearing, but rats...I've met my page limit, the story is over. To not solve the problem, merely to have it blow out to sea by the chance wind? C'mon, Michael!"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"This book was a pretty good read. As a Biochemist, I enjoyed reading about the 'cutting-edge' laboratory technology that Crichton wrote about when writing this book in the early 1970's. Most of the laboratory equipment is commonplace nowadays, but still quite useful.The story takes place inside a fictional underground military installation in the Nevada desert. The base has one purpose, to contain, evaluate, and eliminate infectious agents that might be brought back from outer space.The Scoop 7 satellite has brought back something so deadly, that within seconds of breathing it in, the victim is dead. The team must evaluate the infectious agent and determine how to protect us from it. The story has a good flow, and lots of edge-of-your-seat action.In addition to this story, I recommend Sphere, Jurassic Park, Eaters of the Dead, and Congo."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Michael Crichtons Andromeda Strain involves a highly sophisticated team of scientists searching for alien strains of bacteria in the upper atmosphere. Their project has not yet succeeded when disaster strikes in a tiny Midwestern town. They find their latest collection capsule in the midst of the town where all of the population, excluding two, are dead, stopped in their tracks. The capsule is transported in a helicopter to a high-security lab where the scientists call an emergency meeting . They must attempt to stop the illness before it spreads across the country, leaving a swath of destruction in its wake.Personally, I thought that this book was very good in all but three respects. I loved Crichtons detail in writing, and he put in excitement a little at a time, so I found it hard to put the book down from beginning to end. The book starts off with a bang, which got me interested, and there was a good amount of suspense to keep the story going. In addition, I liked the futuristic equipment in the lab. He also adds little extras which are funny and interesting which make the characters more believable and realistic. However, Crichton did not explain several of his scientific points, and at times I felt that I needed to know more about microbiology to fully understand what he was trying to say. Also, some of his comments were not very clear, so I ended up rereading passages to discover his meaning.In the long run, however, the main plot definitely makes up for its shortcomings. Overall, this is a very good book which I would highly recommend to science fiction lovers from middle to high school."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I gave this book 5 stars because it kept me entertained. Its all about a satellite that has fallen to earth near a little town in Nevada and is infected with a virus and kills eveyone but two people. A team is sent in to investigate and ends up getting trapped in their shelter. This book kept you reading on."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"As a high school student with high degrees of interest in medical technology and great literature, I can say this book caters to both. This thriller is based on an upper atmosphere-born contagion being unleashed upon a small town, and possibly the world. To counteract it, a top secret project, known as project Wildfire is set in motion. Several things about the novel pleased me. First off, I read this book in the year 2000. Keep in mind that it was written in the 1960's. Yet, the science fiction aspects avoided that outdated death sentence and were as interesting as the day they were written(the completely automated medical examination device was my favorite). Second, the detail in which the virus and the facilities to stop it were described was incredible. This was so believeable that I find myself remembering technology from the book as fact! To put it the short way, if you love science fiction, medical thrillers, science mysteries, or any kind of thrilling tale, read The Andromeda Strain!"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"A gtoup of five intelligent biophysicists team up with a group of scientists, as well as NASA, to start a program that recovers organisms from outer space, swich was given the name of Project Scoop. They would launch satellites up into orbit to collect organisms and bring them back to Earth. Due to the fact that this was a top-secret organization, they picked isolated places to have the satellites come back to land so no one would find out about the events going on. Previously, six &quot;Scoops&quot; were successful in bringing back life from space, in the form of bacteria. However, the seventh went wrong. The seventh &quot;Scoop&quot; crashed near Piedmont, Arizona, where the poplulation of 50 people went to see what happened. A doctor opened the satellite, exposing the people to the Andromeda Strain, which killed nearly everyone. The strange thing was, 2 people out of 50 did survive with no damage done: A baby and a 63-year-old man. Many hypotheses were tested by research and experiment, but all failed to explain the fatal disease. In the end, the Andromeda Strain gets loose, spreading all over the labratory when... I would definitely recommend this novel, especially to those who find science fiction, as well as the thought of new life forms interesting. I know I do. This book contains some actual facts, as well as some created stuff, which makes it all the more interesting. Once you get hooked into this novel, it becomes a fast read, mainly because the plot is so intense. You cannot put this novel down! This book is a great one, which I know I will most certainly pick up again!"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Some people think that action only exists in movies, that certainly no amount of print on a page can put someone in suspense. If you ever meet someone like this, hand them The Andromeda Strain. I read some of the reviews of this book with skepticism, reviews that stated that the reader stayed up all night reading this book. I thought it was just a gimmick. I was dead wrong. I didn't finish this book in one night . . . it took me two. IT IS THAT GOOD. Crichton writes with a coolness that defies logic. The apocalypse is at hand and Crichton calmly describes it to us. It is this journalist like prose that makes the reader follow along. It is not fiction we are reading, but fact, and we believe this because Crichton does not present it as fiction but as fact. Crichton does not raise his voice to get attention, he doesn't need to, the story makes us pay attention. Crichton's writing is so good, it's scary. Read this book. Read anything you can by Crichton. You won't be sorry. Jurassic Park, Sphere, Terminal Man, all are written with an icy coolness that draws us into the story. Crichton shows the reader that if the story is good there is no need to yell, just state calmly what you have to say and the reader will scare themselves. An amazing work, which is what one comes to expect from the man."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"The basic theme of the book is that an outer space bacteria enters earth and starts affecting people - this is a life form which is unfimiliar to our environment and bodies, and a group of scientists are assigned to explore it and find a cure for it.The book itself is full of suspence and makes a good read, but I think the author did overdo the technical bit a little, especially since they are really old fashioned and are either irrelevant or known to many people nowadays."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I give it a 2 star rather than a star because the idea was good. Unknown bacteria causing disease on Earth.It was really too bad that I read Sphere first because I saw too many similarities in the two books. For example, the suspense scenes with the doctor climbing through the underground 5 level lab was just too similar to the main character in Sphere climbing up the submarine to get away from the squid. Maybe its just me, but I would not recommend this book.Go read &quot;Ender's Game&quot; by Orson Scott Card or &quot;The Golden Globe&quot; by John Varley because they will give you your money's worth. Don't waste your time on Crichton."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Although I tend to absolutely hate science fiction I loved this book! I am a 15 year old girl and was surprised that I enjoyed a less main stream story line. I was interested the whole time, even through the quasi-scientific parts. I kept on forgetting it was not actually a true story. Chriton's ability to incorperate &quot;facts&quot; was amacing and really enhanced my experience. This is a must read, and goes more quickly than I would have liked, because I was dissapointed I had no more to go."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Michael Crichton wrote this the best bug book ever!! This classic thriller is still as disconcerting today as it was 30 years ago. If you like bug books, you will love this Crichton classic."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Whoa! This is one freaky book. Not scary, just freaky. Great plot too. I'll sum it up: somebody brings down an alien germ, which crystalizes blood as soon as you inhale it. Soon it begins to mutate, and a team of doctors and scientists must find a way to stop it. Great book!"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Andromeda Strain is one of Crichton's best fictions novels for one simple reason. It's so simple. Simplicity in the fact that the threat is not huge dinosaurs, crazy monkeys or giant squids. The threat is a single celled organism called bacteria.Andromeda Strain is about project wildfire, a group and project organized to prevent/contain alien bacteria. Most scientists today believe that there may be life on other planets, but most agree those life forms would not be multiple cell and complex organisms, they would be single celled bacteria. Well here it comes to life, and the truth can be scary.A satellite has crashed near a small town in Arizona, and the townspeople, looking for something exciting retrieve at bring it back to town. Little do they know that they have now invited an alien bacteria to invade and experiment with live human bodies. What, I ask, can kill an entire town, causing some to hemorrhage, others to go crazy, filling there mouths with modeling cement, and yet leave two people alive. So what does a little baby and a drunken man with a failing liver have in common? That is what Project Wildfire must find out, before this deadly bacteria is exposed to the entire human population!"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"This is a great book about the incredible powers that little bacterial organisms can have over us. In a war of one cell organsims against complex and multiple cell organisms, we find a struggle that will end all struggles. Only to find out that we are not as adaptive as we think...A satellite falls from it's orbit and lands near a small town in Arizona, the people of the town decide that they need to recover it and find out exactly what it was. Little do they know that the government located the downed satellite. When the government sends a team out to recover the downed satellite they find that the city has died, except for two survivors.Project Wildfire is called in to find out what happened to the city and it's inhabitants. Medical doctors, chemists and other doctors are called in to find out what did this. Their only chance is to find out what a little baby and an old drunk, with a failing liver have in common. If they fail then the world might suffer the same fate as the those that died in the town."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"After years of saying I'd read this book, I finally followed my New Year's Resolution and did. Having read some other Crichton books (Jurassic Park, Congo, Sphere, etc.) I'd have to say this ranks up there with the best of his work.A lot of reviews say you can read this book in a day or two. While I don't always have time to read every day, I did finish this book in about three sittings. You'll polish off 80-100 pages at a time without realizing any time has passed at all. That's because of tight writing, fast plot, and good attention to detail without drowning in it. I wish a lot of other writers who pad their stories could do that.Crichton's work clocks in at about 270 pages. He could've easily watered down the plot and beefed up the book to 400-500 pages, and you've got to admire him for not doing that. He also explains very complex theories on bacteria and other biological phenomena without totally writing over the layman's head. Consequently, you actually learn a thing or two. Other works (i.e. Outbreak, the X-Files movie) have tried to copy plot elements of this book with minimal success.In short, the book was not quite what I expected (somebody told me it was about bees!) but I was pleasantly surprised with a great biological thriller. You would do well to invest the short amount of time it would take to read this fantastic book."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Since this is one of Crichton's early books, I have to say first that this is one of the better ones. In books like this one or 'Sphere' he didn't seem to write for the film that will be made. Here seems to write a book.This one has a lot of suspense and an interesting style. It doesn't seem like a real novel, more like a report. This results from the scientific facts he not only throws in, but explains everything and after a while you feel like reading a schoolbook. I know, he does this with every book, but sometimes it's just too much.The ending is weird somehow, it's so easy and 'happy ending'-like you feel strange after reading it. But on the other side it's realistic.It's a good book, but 'Sphere' is much more better. Most of his other books are more worse, so..."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I thought this book was way ahead of it's time and fairly interesting. The idea that a disease as deadly as the 'andromeda strain' is very unsettling. 'The Andromeda Strain' is also very realistic and it doesn't seem that unlikely to me. But it seems like I hardly knew anything about the main characters. They were sort of mysterious in regards to their background. They told what they did and where they were from but he didn't really help me to know them real well like in his other books. It was also a little boring at times. But besides those problems it was a greaet book."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"When I read words from Michael Crichton, I can visualize them all. I imagine visually the entire story. His stories are technical and flowing. This book is highly recommended. I won't bother to tell you about the book because you should read without knowing to make it more exciting. This book is for techincal thinkers who can visualize."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Michael Crichton's first novel is one of his best, setting in stone the pattern that he continues to follow to this day, and for one reason: it works. Yes, this novel masterfully intertwines science fact and science fiction, and in turn gives us, the reader, a great book of suspense. It is written in such documentary fashion that you have to convince yourself that you're not reading out of a history book (well, not really, but...). Yeah, it can get quite technical at times, but it still appeals to a wide audience because of it's excellent plot.Also, this book has something that you rarely see in sci-fi: an author going against the alien stereotype. Are you tired of seeing the cliche'd &quot;little green men&quot; or &quot;E.T. ripoffs&quot;? Well, then this book is for you. One of it's subthemes is that we really have no idea what aliens look like, in fact, they may be mere bacteria! Or, maybe not so &quot;mere&quot; as Stone and his team find out..."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"This is Michael Crichton's first novel (not considering the pseudonym thrillers he wrote while in college). It's also his best and the most thrilling science fiction novel I've ever read. If science fiction to you means aliens, spaceships, monsters and all those things, you're in for a big disappointment.A scoop satellite sent into space to collect micro-organisms for study crash lands in a desolate area of Arizona. Two army officers are sent to retrieve the satellite. But before they get there, people from a nearby town find the wreck, and try to investigate. When the officers reach the town, all they find is deathly silence. Miles away, in Mission Control, the transmission from the officers is monitored, and the last thing heard is a high pitched scream.Further investigations reveal that all the people in the town have been killed. Some just dropped dead on the streets, their blood clotted, and others driven hopelessly insane and finally committing suicide. The only survivors are a drunk old man and a young baby. It's a biological disaster that wiped out the entire town. Immediately, a team of experts is gathered in a top secret underground laboratory to investigate the deadly bacteria code-named 'The Andromeda Strain'. The team must race against time to learn more about the organism, which begins to mutate and take on even more dangerous forms. The biggest mystery, of course, is why the two individuals who seem to have absolutely nothing in common survived...Definitely a best-selling plot. Once again, the high point ot the novel is the technological detail. The secret lab is amazing. It has a decontamination process that takes almost a whole day. The bacteria itself is entirely authentic. As in most Crichton novels, the action is accompanied by essential illustrations to better explain the tests carried out by the scientists. Even if you're a layman, Crichton makes you feel quite comfortable even with all the seemingly technical gibberish.Although there's not much action, the plot is quite thrilling. I read the entire book in a single sitting! The only disadvantage is the climax which is slightly disappointing. Still, it's a fabulous book you simply can't afford to miss. I loved it, and I suppose you will too!"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Just like all his other books, this one was easy to read and fun to read"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"This book is about a man who has to figure out why a disease wiped out a whole town and only let 2 people live? Want to know why? Read the book."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I'm getting to the point where I'm starting to think I should just quit reading Crichton's books. \\"Prey\\" was OK; \\"State of Fear\\" was pretty dreadful. Thankfully, those and this book are the only ones I've read so far. I'm not even going to touch \\"Next,\\" from what I've heard. I picked up this early book of his, hoping maybe it'd be different. But no -- it's the same old cardboard characters whose quirks are told to us rather than shown (did he never attend even one writing workshop?). The same old making science into an image that fits the plot, bending facts at will and just making some up (eg, having the guys swim open-eyed through some mysterious disinfectant, like that's going to get all the bacteria...). The same old blunt-force foreshadowing. The same old lecturing and moralizing. Ugh. The one saving grace was that it was a fast read."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"While the book successfully expresses some of human kind's most insecure thoughts of lethal bacteria or viruses from outer space and provides well-researched information concerning modern technology as well as some data about modern science, the book, overall, is a huge overreaction.It had been exciting in the beginning as the new virus was introduced into Earth's atmosphere, but the resolution was a disappointment, especially for an author such as Crichton.The scientists trudged through all that research, spent all those sleepless nights in the facility, and it turned out their work has amounted to nothing. The reader basically suffers through the information that Crichton bombards at us, and that is what made it seem as if the novel was a biology textbook - it contained countless pieces of information that was useless in the very end.I admire Crichton for his characterization and the suspense he carefully builds, but I do not admire the overall plot. I suggest, unless you absolutely adore microbiology or if you have time to kill, that you do not read this book."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I'm not sure why this clumsy book has been re3-introduced to the public. Perhaps because thoise who saw the movie so many years ago have either died off (from causes other than deep-space viruses) and the publisher hopes to dupe a few additional readers. The basic concept, of an unexpected deadly virus being brought down to earth, isn't bad. It's just a bit too unbelievable here in the 2000's."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"The Andromeda Strain comes across as a book that should be an on the edge of your seat, nail biter type of read. This was my misconception. The book is actually very information and a little bit interesting for scientifically gifted people. Most of the book uses many techinical and scientific terms I was not familiar with, but I could catch on. The last part of the story really carries the weight of the entire book. There is not much progress in about the first fifteen chapters of the book, but near the end it picks up and the plot thickens, making a person nibble, not bite their nails. Overall I found the book to be satisfactory, but not a best-seller in my humble opinion."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I have read many books by Mr.Crichton. This book is not one of his best. I have read over 21 books for my reports this year and I wrote this opne was one of the worst. The book Postman was the only worst one. The character development is very impaired. I am unable to assosciate with any of them. Association to a character is something I need to get into a book. I belive other books such as Sphere and Jurasic Park were much better. The content in both books were closer to sci-fi than other books. Empidemics are something we are used to reading and seeing nowadays. I teachers at school taught u to write with adjectives which this book is lacking. Do not read this book if you have something better to do."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I saw a good portion of the Andromeda Strain on TV and it looked pretty interesting. I recalled that I had picked up the book at a book sale a few months ago so I got the book out and began reading.Normally, the book is much, much better than the movie, so if you liked the movie, you will love the book. Not so with this one. The book was very difficult to read - you get to a point where you don't care if you finish or not. The book started off pretty slow, but I thought it would improve. It did not, not even a little. The ending was horrible and really didn't seem to finish the story. There were a lot of loose ends (such as what happened with the infant and the old man?).The story is basically about a US satellite that brings back an extremely volatile virus from space. The virus kills just about everyone in a small town. It is studied in a top secret laboratory. I think they found a cure (it really was that boring).The book was filled with interesting computer-generated graphics that really didn't add anything to the reading experience and looked just weird. Of course, this book was also written in 1969, so maybe they considered that to be top-notch back then.I really don't recommend this book. This is the first time I would actually tell you to watch the movie as opposed to reading the book.I'm glad this was not the first Michael Crichton book I read, because it would have turned me off to his other books (I've read several of his other books and I love them)."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"This book is thought of by many to be a sort of modern classic, but I really didn't like it. It's full of plot twists that lead absolutely NOWHERE. There are certain revelations that make the preceding part of the novel seem a total waste of time. The character's efforts have no effect and eventually, the book is resolved when the virus mutates into a harmless form. The whole book is a waste of time. The characters are useless. The book is just a way for Crichton to show off medicla knowledge. All in all, it's a mess"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"As a biologist and a med. student I am appalled that Crichton made a basic and blatant error that his entire book rests on. If you have a population of organisms, and there is a mutation, THE WHOLE POPULATION DOES NOT MUTATE TOGETHER. The majority of the population stays in the old form. In this book Crichton has a population of organisms that all mutate together into a few scary things and then finally into something harmless and that saves the day. If this were REAL biology we would have a separate population surviving after each mutation. At the end of the book there would still be a population of rubber-eaters as well as a toxic population, etc. Needless to say this &quot;Deus ad-lib&quot; was a huge let down. Crichton needs to go back and read some of his biology texts. No wonder he doesn't practice medicine any more."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I just finished the Andromeda Strain this morning and was very impressed. Not just with a good story, but with how a thirty year old book that has a strong scientific theme does not read as outdated. The use of fiber optics, electron microscopes, and clean rooms are just a few examples of his ability to predict what is commonly used in modern times . I've noticed each of Chrichton's books have a theme. With Jurassic Park, it was DNA and the Chaos Theory. In Congo it was Lasers, and in each book, he gives you a breif lesson in them to continue the story. In The Andromeda Strain, the lesson is molecular biology and since it is one of his first, the story suffers for it. Especially toward the end. If your looking for a fast paced thriller, your not going to get it. But as a thinking mans thriller it is outstanding. I wish my biology teacher in high school was more like Chrichton, because he makes it interesting and easy to follow. But again toward the end, it is trying, which is why I'm giving four out or five stars. A great book for Chichton fans. If your just now getting into him, I would suggest Jurrasic Park first."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"The Andromeda Strain by Micheal Crichton is an intense book about several scientists racing to eliminate deadly bacteria, which came from outer space. In some ways I see it as a horror because of its direct applications to real life, its believability. It doesn&iexcl;t infer any blame on the government, like a lot of biological thrillers do. Yet it does surmise the possibility of underground facilities in which the equipment is tech enough to handle many kinds of biological disaster, or outbreaks. The premise of the book was good and the action sequences were nail biting. Although there was a lot of dated components, old computers, methods, etc., I feel it still ran miles ahead of its time, for a book that was written in the 60s. I felt awfully empty when reading the parts of the book in which the town was described. It made me feel like I was going to die. The scientist that did the fieldwork wore these moon-suits with tube for oxygen bulging from the sides. The people they found were dead, when the veins were cut open on the corpses the blood rolled out like sand. But before they left, two brought along&iexcl;Xalive. All of these things were part of plot development and key to the book's clincher. The characters in the book were easy to identify with. They had families, personality flaws, and compassion. Characters, I feel, make or break a book&iexcl;s quality level. The Andromeda Strain is a good book to read if you&iexcl;re a fiction junky. It also tantalizes the intellectual, and entertains the novice."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"The Andromeda Strain is the depiction of how a rare disease attacks the body and alters its blood. It goes through the process of how four scientists discover the effects of this disease and how it attacks peoples circulatory systems. It is not a story to read if you do not feel like thinking.

One of his first novels, in fact, if I'm not mistaken, Mr. Crichton's premise for a biological Apocalypse shuffles along at a snail's pace. What could've been a truly zip-along read is plagued and ultimately bogged down with interminable sequences of 'faction.' Understanding why the long passages of facts are present does not counteract their tedious and painstakingly detailed drone. The flip-side of this, however, is that The Andromeda Strain is a powerful science document. Unfortunately, it exhibits little else.

Now I am on the last chapter and it seems that when Mr. Crichton was writing the novel, he just decided he had had enough and just banged out a few pages to abruptly end it.The abrupt and shallow ending spoilt what could otherwise have been a classic.

Crichton (pronounced &quot;Cry-ton&quot;) was a lad of 26, just out of medical school, when he decided to become a writer instead of a doctor. THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN is a very well-written first novel, although it is a bit too heavy on technical scientific detail. I found that to be a problem when I first tried to read the book 10 years ago; I only got about a third of the way into it because I found this level of detail to be overpowering the story, this rendering it noninteresting for me. By comparison, I had found that JURASSIC PARK, which I had read before my first attempt at ANDROMEDA, had just the right mixture of science and story; it was an extremely fascinating read which took me only three days to complete. Now, with THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN, I have just recently read the entire book cover-to-cover, and I'm glad I finally did so because, even though I find the scientific detail to be occasionally overpowering at times, the human story is remarkably compelling.This human story is of how five widely different members of a top-secret government research team combine intellectual forces to deal with the horrific results of an infectious biologic agent, which had been accidentally introduced into the small town of Piedmont, Arizona by way of a returning space probe that had been sent from Earth, killing all but two of its 48 inhabitants. The team must find out what the nature of the infectious agent is, how it killed its victims, why the two extremely different survivors, a crochety old man and a two-month-old baby, survived, and how they can stop this agent before it is able to do any further damage. The book is written as a real-life account of the incident and the team's research, with all of its failings and discoveries, and Crichton supplies us with various illustrations and computer codes from this research; some of which are lucid and interesting, and others which are not. Although your enjoyment of this novel is not dependent on how much science you know and understand (although the more you know and are interested in, the more it definitely does help), it is dependent on how much you can tolerate as you follow along with the suspenseful story. The ending, crucial in a book like this, is really good; it made me glad that I stuck with it to the end this time. Although not nearly as fascinating as JURASSIC PARK (part of which is due to the datedness of the story and the associated technology), THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN was a good first novel for Crichton, and set the tone for his future medical thrillers.RECOMMENDED, AGES 16 &amp; UP"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"This is the first time I want to explain a 3 star rating in this way. Technically, it's a brilliant novel. The scientific details and explanation make the terrifying discover of an alien bacterial life form plausible (I'm not denying it's not plausible.

This newly discovered germ is so lethal, the famed Andromeda strain that could conceivably wipe out humans, but the plot is clinical and has no rush of adrenaline or emotion. It's the human stories in this kind of disaster scenario that make the story interesting to me. That and gross out medical descriptions, not description of how an electron microscope works.

This book could have taken place today (instead of 1969) because I could visualize a lot of the book. I found myself thinking \\"Awesome technology\\" more then I was thinking that Crichton is sure a great author. He seemed to involve a little too much foreshadowing.This book does involve a lot of research and \\"up-to-date theories\\" for 1969, but is a little dated today. This does not take anything out of the story.I would recommend this book because it is really interesting. Lots of research went into this book. The book is fast paced and has many modern aspects of a Crichton novel."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"This is now the sixth Crichton book I've read and I always seem to come away with the same feeling...slightly disappointed. I always enjoy the immense amount of detail he provides in his books about the subject matter at hand but am always disappointed in character development. His characters are typically very thin and I am left at the end of the book not really caring about how the story ends. If rating this book based on the interesting background on biochemical studies I rate this book a five. If rating the book on character development I rate it a one. Overall a three."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I am an avid Crichton fan and have read every novel he has written. This was his first Novel and I did find it good, but not as good as his newer ones. It is a very interesting subject, but there are points in the novel that seem to drag on a bit to long. I would suggest getting it and reading it, but dont expect to be hooked page to page."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"When I read The Andromeda Strain years ago, I found it a clever blend of technological facts and human fiction. I even read it again this week and still think it is one of the better techno-fiction books. So, what happened to Crichton? Since my first reading of Andromeda Strain 15 years ago I've read Congo, Sphere, Jurassic Park, The Lost World and Timeline. They were all a total waste of my time and of paper, except for Timeline - it was no waste of paper only because I read the e-book version.In Andromeda Strain Crichton took a good idea and keeps it going to the conclusion. It gave me faith in his ability. In the others, he sometimes has a good idea, sometimes doesn't have a good idea, sometimes seems to know that he doesn't have a good idea, and just turns it into mush. His rich character development? Only if you mean that he must have characters who are financially rich as a plot device. If you've read any of these other books, still try Andromeda Strain, it is so superior. If you're new to Crichton, read Andromeda Strain but learn from my mistakes and avoid these other books like the plague."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Michael Crichton is my favorite author, and this book shows his ability to write a very good book without a lot of action and blood. This Book misleads you and many places, (E.g., you think the man in the white robe, Peter Jackson, killed the men retrieving the space probe)and eventually leads up to a good yet unsatisfying ending. Crichton also does a good job explaining some of the terms he uses. He also lets the reader know about things the characters don't, like that Leavitt is epileptic, and that Burton made a big mistake when he forgot to autopsy the anticoagulated black norway rats. Overall, this is a great book, although a little more action would be nice."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"For me it's the best book I ever read (even from Michael Crichton). At first I thought there would be some kind of magic involved, but in the end everything turned out to have a logical explanation. The book may be a little old by now, but it still contains important lessons. Perhaps they will help us to be prepared in similar cases, when we are getting into such extraordinary situations.If you are interested in the government's handling procedures in such critical cases, you just have to read this book or Sphere, which I like very much too, and you'll at least have a very good insight.Thanks to M.C."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"This was a very good book. My favorite part was when they were exploring the town. I recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I've read almost all of Crichton's novels and this seems second rate when compared to Sphere, Congo, and Jurassic Park. I've gotten use to the rigidity of Crichton's characters, and plot usually makes up by putting the characters in situations that they must immediately deal with. From this a reader of depth can draw their own characterizations and motivations for the characters. With this novel, however, the plot was often tedious and the writing seemed a bit contrived. Also, the biology error of having the entire population mutate instead of part of it mutating as the old population remains was rather glaring and dropped my rating from a 7 to a 6."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"This book appeals to those who like fiction that is given a technical base. Even those who are not in the technical field will appreciate it."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I loved this book, assigned to me as an outside reading assignment. Aside from the great story, there is a large amount of techincal information. The plot twists, which many people loathed, added to the realism of the book. After all, every twist in real life does not lead somewhere. A must read for anyone who likes modern literature. The scarriest thing is that it could someday happen!!"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"This is the best of Michael Crichton that I've read so far."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"This is my favorite book in the world. Crichton is an extremely detailed and exciting writer. I can not believe I don't have all his books yet. That's what Amazon.com is for!"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I found Andromeda Strain enjoyable. Many plot twists went nowhere; I find this adds realism. Such a blight is plausible; Mad Cow Disease victims exhibited protein changes in brain structure, hypothetically dissolving grey matter. I appreciated meticulous detail to technology of the time. Aspects of the sterile medical environment proved surprisingly entertaining to read about. Lastly, I considered that the virus seemed to have suddenly changed within the Wildfire Installation, while I would assume that two colonies of viral organisms would remain; blood clotting and rubber eating. However, on review, I observed that earlier in the novel, the virus had not affected the vultures at the epidemic locale Piedmont, Arizona. It had become inert on the ground. Overall, enjoyable and entertaining. I would appreciate it, if anybody knows, where I might find additional information concerning the Wildfire Installation, if it indeed exists, along with the thick booklet, including the odd-man hypothesis and other information along with exact location; longitude, latitude, etc."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"As a college student, I have very little time for extra-curricular pleasures such as reading. Luckly, this book was a VERY fast read (once you get past the initial chapters) and it kept my interest the whole way through. I read the last 40 pages in a half hour. I was crusing! The climax was pretty good, I've read better, but very nice. I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"The Andromeda Strain was the first novel by Michael Crichton I ever read, I picked it up on a whim when I was in 6th Grade. I'll be the first to admit that it is not Crichton's best work, it is short and lacks depth in both characterization and plot. That said, I still loved it when I read it the first time, and continue to love it to this day. The author's medical background provides an authentic weight to the novel that makes up for the lack of deep characters in my opinion. This is even more true for me now, as a college student with some formal biology courses under my belt, I understand the plot much better than I did when I was a teen."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"The Andromeda Strain...the best fiction book I've ever read.This book will have you on edge of your seat. What Crichton accomplished here is almost impossinble; he made technical description very interesting, and, easily understandable. The movie, while very good, cannot begin to approach the book. This is science fiction at its best; captivating story, suspensful anticipation, and heartpounding.Joe ArrigoAuthor of, The Secret Factor for Uncommon Sales Success"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I just finished this book, it took me 6 hours to read it. I'm an avid reader and I have to say, I just could not put this book down! It ended kind of abruptly in my opinion, but was a wonderful read and it was fun to see what he predicted for the future as far as technology and to compare it with the things we actually do have now. What a great book. Don't hesitate to pick this one up. One of the best books I've read in years."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I just started reading Michael Crichton and The Andromeda Strain was the next book on my list. It is definitely a Crichton classic and will keep you guessing. It has that similar theme of some of his other books, man and technology. Man is his worst enemy, creating things that ruin. There were also alot of technical terms. My main problem was that I found it to be a little anti-climatic, especially at the end. It's a good book, but it was one of his early ones, so don't go into it thinking that it's going to be like Jurassic Park. It's written in a form as if it were non-fiction. Crichton even said himself that people actually thought it was a true story, after a while he gave up on telling them that it was fiction."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"For as much Michael Crichton as I've read, I'm surprised it took me so long to get around to this, his first, book.But not surprisingly I wasn't disappointed.This book is amazing and for having been written over forty years ago, even more so.Here's why:Ostensibly the story of mankind's first contact with an alien life form, the Andromeda Strain is the story of a space probe that returns to earth with microscopic visitors from the great beyond...alien bacteria and with them a threat more deadly than other one space creature from any alien movie.When the Earth probe crashlands, nearly everyone in a small town is killed almost instantly on contact with the bacteria. Shock government scientists take charge of the probe and begin their study of this strange creature.The story of what goes wrong and how things proceed on reflection now is reminiscent of the story line in his later Jurassic Park but like all good sci fy, it's about the ideas.And the ideas here are thought provoking:What is life? Crichton spends a lot of time on this issue yet in his brief treatment he manages to add just as much to the discussion as Erwin Shroedinger did back in 1944 with his ground breaking essay on the same topic and as University Adeliade professor Paul Davies' later The Fifth Miracle (where Davies opines on the same question).What is our most likely first contact? Based on compelling reasoning Crichton suggests that bacteria are the most likely candidates. Here on Earth, he observes they account for the overwhelming majority of life (he puts the figure at just under 80 percent). This information suggests that perhaps elsewhere the relative distributions would be similar. To his credit, Crichton makes alien contamination more scarey by coming up with a plausible way in which bacteria which had origiated on Earth itself was actually the new \\"alien\\" strain.How bad will we screw things up? As George Lucas would later do by making his future tech falible, Crichton did here too. He had his heros make plenty of mistakes...and stupid ones too.This was an amazing book for the same reasons that still make it compelling and entertaining reading."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN was written while Michael Crichton was in medical school. Arguably, this is his best book, written at the height of the U.S. Space Program, and guaranteed to terrify the reader with its tale of an unmanageable pathogen from beyond the Earth.Written as a real documentary report, Crichton manages to impart significant information about Chemical-Bacteriological Warfare, epidemiology, hot zone protocols, computerized patient diagnosis, hemotology, and much else to his readers while still entertaining us.It may be that his supersecret pathogen laboratory, \\"Wildfire\\" isn't real, but it could be, and so could virtually anything else between these covers, which is why THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN still inspires chills forty years after its publication. The 1971 movieThe Andromeda Strainis a worthy effort, but read the book first."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"\\"The Andromeda Strain\\" was Michael Crichton's first book published under his own name as the author. Eleven of his first 12 books were published under a pen name; usually it was John Lange, but he also used the names Jeffery Hudson and Michael Douglas. This was probably the book that helped established his illustrious career, not just because it was the first in which he used his actual name but also because of how well written it was. Crichton was the master of suspense. He could develop a serious crisis unlike any other, but it wasn't just the suspense and action that made his novels so great; it was also the unique characters he created and the way they evolved throughout his stories. Also, Crichton's narrative was at times very informative and free-flowing in ways that could almost be read like a work of non-fiction within the fictional story he was telling, and it helped bring the characters and events in his books to life. \\"The Andromeda Strain\\" is a great example of this.The story follows a bacteriologist named Jeremy Stone who is working with a group of other scientists in, what was then, a technologically advanced, state-of-the-art facility as they try diligently to unravel the mystery behind this extraterrestrial bacteria that came to earth via a satellite that. This satellite was one of many that had been launched a couple years earlier by the army to search for extraterrestrial life (which most likely would be in the form of a bacteria). One satellite actually picked up a bacteria and crash-landed near a small town in Arizona called Piedmont. The bacteria quickly spread like a virus and killed all but two people in the town: a crying baby and a strange old man. The scientists find themselves encountering many problems in their facility as they try figuring out how these two people survived and how this deadly virus can be stopped before it kills them and spreads throughout the country.The ending is somewhat anticlimactic, and there are parts of the story that read at a rather slow pace as Crichton describes things like the scientific theories regarding bacteria from outer space and the now outdated technology being used in the facility. As a result, the book didn't seem as suspenseful as it could've been, though there is still a lot of suspense in it. Overall, Crichton did a great job handling the mystery elements in this intriguing and unpredictable story, and he did a really good job with the character development as well. It's very interesting and entertaining to read just like all his other books."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I have read and re-read this book many times, I've seen the movie and TV series. This is absolutely one of the best tales of science getting out of control. A space probe is sent to seek organisms that can be used for germ or biological warfare. The quest is far more successful than the government wants and things go down hill from there.Crichton graduate from Harvard Med school, so he has the educational and technological background to make this entirely plausible and absoultely frightening. He has excellent writing skills, making what could have been a dull accounting of science and medicine into an emotional thriller that keeps you interested, building tension until the very end.You may have heard of some of his other works: Congo, Sphere, Jurrassic Park, Rising Sun to name a few. A brilliant mind - his fiction often has footnotes and factual sources the reader can pursue to follow up on the facts."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Remember when you saw a shooting star, and thought, you know, well THAT could fall to Earth and crack open, and it could be a secret U.S. satellite with biological testing equipment that has faulty seals, and hick residents in some small 'burg in Arizona could find it and drag the thing into the center of town, where they would breathe air that escaped from the capsule and start to become sick, and everyone would collapse in horrible, painful heaps, and the government would send an investigative unit to find out what happened but they would mysteriously stop reporting back, and panicky scientists would declare a state of emergency, even though nobody in the entire country knew about it except the President, who would ultimately decide to nuke the town, which would cause a global bio-calamity? Yeah, I've thought about stuff like that, too."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"When it comes to reading an author for the first time, you want the first book you read by that author to be a good one. That way you have a good first impression, and that author gets more chances within your realm of reading. I wasn't too interested in the work of Michael Crichton, but I wanted to read him at least once. And the more I asked, the more experienced Crichton readers suggested one book to start with. That book was THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN. As I opened the first pages of this classic by Crichton, I discovered that it was written back in the 60's. Yet the genius of Michael Crichton thrived even back then. And what he had to say can still be considered relevant today.It begins with a warning by the U S government, and it grows with a satellite falling to Earth. By the way, this is not a good thing. Just ask the folks of Piedmont, if you can ask them. Most of them are dead, and that is just the beginning. That is Dr. Jeremy Stone is called in with a team of specialists. And also part of the team is Dr. Burton, Dr. Leavitt, and Dr. Hall. They will set out to tackle THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN and take on the killer!From great suspense, to old men and babies, Crichton put a thriller together back in the 60's that is still relevant today. So there might be a lot of scientific stuff to be explained. So what? Just enjoy the trip you are about to take. Let the great storytelling help you along the journey.So if you were to ask me which Crichton book to start with, I won't hesitate and tell you THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN. Because it made a great first impression on me, and I plan to read more Michael Crichton!"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I read this book for school, during the summer. I wasn't expecting much, since I had never read a Michael Crichton book before, I just knew him as &quot;The dude who wrote Jurassic Park&quot;. The amazing thing about this book and most of Chrichton's other novels is that he makes an exciting mix of action with, well, events that don't put you to sleep, and a lot of realism to back the plot up. I'd suggest this to everyone, because the story is just so amazing. That's all I have to say."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I like hard SF and was at first very reluctant to read Crichton because of the garbage at the cinema which is based on his work. However, I am impressed with the amount of research and detail in his novels. It is refreshing to read a novel that has ideas in it--a playground for the mind as Larry Niven put it--rather than the usual trite, melodramatic silliness which passes for &quot;Literature.&quot; If you other reviewers do not understand some technical jargon or concept you run across in his books, use the internet to find out what it means! Or even an encyclopedia or dictionary. It isn't 1969 anymore and it's very easy to use a search engine. (It was rather tedious of crichton to explain in detail how to convert base ten numbers to binary, something most kids learn nowadays in 5th grade. Also, listing every single cryptic parameter in a CBC w/o any explanation was a bit much... Does he just want to fill up pages? Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate, Mean Corpuscular Volume, etc. were not covered in my 5th grade health class.)I agree with a few other reviewers that the characters in the AS are somewhat lackluster, to put it nicely. This is often the case in hard science fiction such as that of Arthur C. Clarke, Stephen Baxter, and Larry Niven. While this is a shortcoming, I find that I would rather read about new ideas and learn about science rather than about people. With them, so often it's just the same old nonsense. Even if you find the AS a difficult read, I'll bet it was more thought-provoking and inspiring than trite, formulaic nonsense the likes of Harry Potter and the Vampire Lestat. Amusing characters, but how can they compare to the contemplating order of the cosmos?"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"While the ending was a bit lame, and Crichton's persistence that this was a true story is quite frustrating, the book was very entertaining. It wasn't as thrilling as some of his others, and I am reluctant to give it 5 stars, but I haven't done so in a long time, so I will.I feel that if the book were written today, it would be even more exciting. Much of the story has become dated. But someday a movie with a similar plot like Outbreak will be dated as well.This book started Crichton's career and was a bestseller. I wouldn't make it my first Crichton read, but I think it is a step above his latest, _Prey_, but only because of when it was written."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"written in 1969--ahead of its timean interesting style of writingput forth that man has the power to destroy and to heal"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"In 1969, Michael Crichton wrote his first novel, which he has, so far, left unequaled (although he has come close). He starts out with a chilling scene that goes unexplained for a while: an entire desert town gets wiped out. Why? We don't know yet.As we delve deeper into the novel, we see a group of respected scientists looking into the case of a space satellite that crashed nearby, and apparently carried an extraterrestrial bacterium with it, that caused an entire town to die of hemmorages. As the scientists investigate and experiment further, the pace is quick and never dull, despite the fact that it's mostly a bunch of guys working in a laboratory. The ending is a little anti-climactic, but by no means dissatisfying. What really makes the book worthwhile is all the science involved in the story. This is science fiction (of sorts), yet it draws on science facts of the day, and made it a mostly plausible story even when in was written in the 60's. The accuracies are fascinating, especially concerning the fact that if we are to come in contact with extraterrestrial life, the chances are over 99% that it will be single-cell (the book has a chart for this--see it for yourself).A marvelous book from a writer sadly unrecognized by most literary snobs. Read this!"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"It was awsome. The way the Crichton used something that was so farfetched, yet so close to reality. Sweet."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"The Andromeda Strain is a sci-fi thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat.....sometimes. This book was sometimes really boring because half the time they are in a labratory trying to figure out what the virus is. However, there are some very interesting and action-packed parts that made it an ok book. I have not read any other Michael Crichton books but I hear that they are very good. The Andromeda Strain may be one of his worst, I disliked most parts because they were very boring to me, they just test things in a lab and I don't understand it. I liked the very end and when they go to the town, those are the best parts. This was an ok book that would be good if they had spent less time in the lab testing stuff."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"The Andromeda Strain is a fictitious book written by Michael Crichton. It is about five scientists who are trying to understand an extra-terrestrial organism by finding out how it works, and how it kills people so fast.

I found it very entertaining, and I also found it profoundly interesting with all the questions given like &quot;how do you define life?&quot;, and there are also many interesting scientific aspects of biololgy stated in the book, of of which hold merit as Crichton does his homework and simply does not BS this stuff.Overall: 4/5 with one star off because of the bad ending."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I loved this book all the way through until the last page.

It starts out allright, drags slowly throughout the middle, and ends entirely wrong."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I'd give it NO stars, but that isn't an option. It's too bad that Crichton had to write such junk- especially after his sensational SPHERE, THE LOST WORLD and JURASSIC PARK. THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN is very, very long and very, very, boring. And the thing is, he expects us to actually be disease experts, because he rambles on and on about these technical words Einstein couldn't grasp. The charictors are all idiots, bumbling around, doing nothing but complaining how this disease wiped out an entire town except for 2 people, an old man and a baby, who somehow know each other, and, who with dozens of birds, somehow survived. These IS NO action in this entire book, except the climax, which feature the computer throwing darts at the hero, who somehow miraculously ducks them all. Why is the computer throwing darts at him, anyway? Virus of its own? Also, the story constantly shifts to another bozo, who seems to be the big boss, flying around in the air in his personal plane. Why is that in the story? What does it have to do with the story? Pretending, of course, that this book has a story. I don't think there is a reason for those parts to be in there, Crichton was just killing time (and trees). In short, this book is phenomenal waist of time and paper. I'm such a big fan of Crichton, too. It's just such a terrible book. Crichton has been known to give us the best books in history and the worst books of history. To prevent yourself from becoming a victim to this, please read the following: GREAT BOOKS FROM MASTERMIND MICHAEL CRICHTON: 1) JURASSIC PARK: Excellent action and dialogue. Every word is to be treasured. 2) SPHERE: Simply one of the greatest books ever written. 3) LOST WORLD: Great charictors and heart-stopping action. 4) THE TERMINAL MAN: Interesting with non-stop action TERRIBLE BOOKS FROM MICHAEL CRICHTON: 1) CONGO: Most of it is talking. About two pages total about the grey gorillas. 2) ANDROMEDA STRAIN: Simply one of the worst books ever written"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Okay. I really didn't like this book. The characters were too blah. The story and setting really needed a tune up. After the frist chapter I was yawning and popping Hrry Potter into the DVD player. There were no girls characters (and I found that sexist),and if the ending would have been decent Michael should have at least given a little effort.Don't get me wrong. I think Michael Crichton is a great author. I just think this book was really tacky."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Since passing on the book as a teenager, I decided to read it now 20 years later. It's completely believable!!! It still makes your skin creep with its \\"real-life, documentary style\\", creation of personality in each character, even the expected? unexpected? mutation of the strain. It was a great book in those years, and IS a great book these years. A mark of a truly ACCOMPLISHED writer who knows the issues he writes about and creates a world real and unreal at the same time."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Crichton's 'The Andromeda Strain' was a pretty good read. I didn't have much trouble getting to reading many pages at a time. Sometimes I did have to use my mind some to figure out the scientific theories and such, but once I got past all that intellect, the story was pleasing. It is a sci-fi, mystery book in that the entire novel was based on figuring out what wiped out an entire city's population, and how to stop that thing from killing more cities' populations.The last 50 or so pages I did not find any trouble in reading, putting it down was where I found the trouble. So many things started happening at once right at the very end that I was totally spellbound. I didn't, however, like the way Crichton ended the novel. It was a little too basic. Everything leading up to it could have gone for so much more. Crichton seemed to be doing so well, and then just ran out of time and needed to end it quickly and chose the way he did. But, aside from the quick, base ending, I really enjoyed and would recommend 'The Andromeda Strain' as an easy read."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"The little desert town of Piedmont lies dead. Or almost so, with just two of its residents still alive: an elderly man and an infant. The apparent cause? A crashed space probe. When two Air Force men sent to investigate die, also - so fast that they never get out of their vehicle - a group of five top scientists assemble at a secret facility called Wildfire. If they can't figure out what \\"Project Scoop\\" brought back before the infection starts to spread, humankind could be decimated.This is a familiar science fiction concept, the \\"alien germ\\" against which humans have no defenses. What makes this novel's use of it compelling (even when somewhat dated, 35 years after first publication) is the author's sure grasp of the science involved. While the detail presented is overwhelming at times, and the characters wooden, the story still has frightening credibility."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"'The Andromeda Strain' involves a new deadly disease that has been brought back to earth, by a military/science sattelite. A space rpogram has been designed to enter space and bring back samples in the hopes of finding a new bacterial weapon. The book describes a secret government base where such diseases can be contained and researched.Well, the program is a success. A deadly germ is brought back to Earth, and proceeds to wipe out a remote town. The germ is isolated in the governmetn facility, and the race is on to find how this entity reactes with the human body and how it can be cured or neutralized.The book is a little dated, but none the less a great plot. I remember seeing the movie when I was young and loving it. I finally found the time to read the book. It is one of Critchon's early works, but stil very good.If you are a Critchon fan (or not) I would recommend this book. It is quick paced and good for those days beside the pool or at the beach."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"The book I am reviewing in this review is a book I would have never foreseen myself reading. It is called the Andromeda Strain and it is by Michael Crichton, author of Jurassic Park. It deals with a hostile organism from outer space in the form of a disease. I loved the way he incorporated science into it without deafening the excitement. It was very thrilling.It starts with two men on a retrieval mission into Arizona to find a satellite that went down. Their truck is approaching the small village of Piedmont, Arizona, when they notice buzzards circling the town. Suddenly transmission is lost as a scream rips through the air.A special team of scientists organized for such work is called together and discovers a disease that can kill as a person takes a breath, and drives others insane. They retreat to a special research base in Nevada where they proceed to attempt to find a cure, or a weakness of some sort.This book is excellent and very suspenseful. I would recommend this book to 5th graders and up, mainly because the death and complications might not be good (and/or) interesting for young people. Other than that, it is a great book, and I recommend to anyone with a craving for a good book and a little time to kill.So although this book may be kind of random for me to read (I picked it off the library shelf as a joke), I do not find it strange that I am recommending it to others now. It's not the first time this has happened."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Originally the Andromeda Strain was to be based on certain events that mixed biological entities and science fiction along with the era's events. A graduate from Harvard, Crichton just entered the time where his writing was done under other names, and a book that was to be known as his works was still being considered.The Book was an experiment, a test to see if Crichton had what it took to make good novels. And it worked.Written in the late 60's, this book has sold more than 1.4 million copies, translated into several languages, and is still read.The main point of the book is an explanation to the downsides of both the space program, and the use of biological warfare. Remember in that time, the cold war was still at its high point, and both powers (US, and the Soviets) were building up their weapons. The book introduces the newest of these weapons: a space program designed to send sattelites into space and pick up dust particles, or anything that may be out in the cold darkness of space. However one of the orbiters encounters a problem about 40 hours after its launch. The sattelite, and whatever particles it has caught falls back to the Earth, crashing a short distance from a small town of Piedmont, Arizona. Soon the object is taken into the town and opened by the town's doctor. However high above a hill watching over the town, a pair of agents have been keeping vigil watch on the town and its new shipment of declassified goods. Soon they notice the eerie silence that falls over the town. Something is not right. Soon the last transmission sent to the headquarters is a loud-pitched scream. Something is really not right.The Andromeda Strain is a great military science thriller. It combines some of the military protocal, as well as Crichton's Medical knowledge and of course, his good science fiction imagination.Although this book is a little old and out of date in the terms of technology, it is still one of the best books written by Crichton-even if it was an experiment. It is his introduction to what he has written to this day, and it is that introduction that changed the world's look on the government's action."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"How do you fight a deadly micro-organism brought to earth by a returning satellite? You know nothing about this micro-organism other than it has completely wiped out an entire town's population except for a sickly old man and a crying baby (clues!). Exposure to this organism will kill you instantly. Do you dare try any of the conventional methods for destroying viruses and germs? Anything you do (even nothing) may cause the micro-organism to multiply faster, mutate, etc, and you risk decimating the earth's population!That's the challange faced by Michael Crichton's team of elite biophysicists in their top-secret, ultra-sophisticated underground research facility (code name: Wildfire). Rich in scientific details, the book speeds along from the shocking discovery of a town full of dead people, to the cloak-and-dagger process of alerting and assembling the team of civilian experts (some of whom have secrets), to the action occuring in the facility itself (a central character with a few secrets of its own).The ultra-biologically clean government facility is equipped with automatic safeguard mechanisms that I will only characterize here as extremely thought-provoking. I was intrigued by the elaborate procedures and mechanisms for decomtaminating the scientists prior to entering the facility (not as straight forward as one would think). Also interesting was a side story involving the unexpected results of an experimental drug that kills absolutely every single bacteria, germ, virus, and organisim in the human body.Logically plotted, highly technical and suspensefully timed, this is a thinking-man's sci-fi story which constantly reminds you of time running out with everything at stake. If you've read Michael Crichton's work before, you'll recognize his recurring theme involving the unpredictability of the universe (chaos theory), and man's mistaken belief that he can change and control nature with technolgy.The subject was highly topical in the late 60's and early 70's when Apollo missions were bringing material back from the moon on a regular basis. Today, who knows what micro-meteorites bearing alien bacteria may be captured by space shuttles, space stations, etc?A SIDE NOTE:If you like this book, you should check out the 1971 film that was based on it. Considering when it was made, it is a surprisingly well-made science fiction film directed by Robert Wise. This is one of the few films that is actually as good as the book it is based on. The acting, production values, set design, and art direction are all very impressive. Sure, the computer hardware may be dated, but this was the real equipment in use at the time and actually increases the film's realism (no ultra flashly graphics, talking computers, over-produced effects, etc.). Like '2001: A Space Odyssey', the film still plays well today. Rent it!"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"The Andromeda Strain by Micheal Crichton is an intense book about several scientists racing to eliminate deadly bacteria, which came from outer space. In some ways I see it as a horror because of its direct applications to real life, its believability. It doesn&iexcl;t infer any blame on the government, like a lot of biological thrillers do. Yet it does surmise the possibility of underground facilities in which the equipment is tech enough to handle many kinds of biological disaster, or outbreaks. The premise of the book was good and the action sequences were nail biting. Although there was a lot of dated components, old computers, methods, etc., I feel it still ran miles ahead of its time, for a book that was written in the 60s. I felt awfully empty when reading the parts of the book in which the town was described. It made me feel like I was going to die. The scientist that did the fieldwork wore these moon-suits with tube for oxygen bulging from the sides. The people they found were dead, when the veins were cut open on the corpses the blood rolled out like sand. But before they left, two brought along&iexcl;Xalive. All of these things were part of plot development and key to the book's clincher. The characters in the book were easy to identify with. They had families, personality flaws, and compassion. Characters, I feel, make or break a book&iexcl;s quality level. The Andromeda Strain is a good book to read if you&iexcl;re a fiction junky. It also tantalizes the intellectual, and entertains the novice."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Since early about November of last year have been on a Crichton spree of sorts...and i can honestly say this is the worst Crichton novel i have read...the whole book is fairly boring...it is ALOT of scientific talk and not alot of action...but the ending is just not good at all...the ending left me wondering why i read that whole book...it is EXTREMELY anti-climactic...pretty much the only thing that kept this book out of the 1-star range for me was that i liked the idea...read if you want...i just dont like it"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I have enjoyed the Michael Crichton books until I read this one.

And then what if it spread all across the Earth? Well that is exactly what happens in The Andromeda Strain by Michael Crichton.The book begins with two men traveling in van along a dessert in Arizona looking for a satellite sent into the atmosphere to take certain measurements. As they are looking for it they find a town with buzzards flying over head. They look down at it and see it deserted with people dead on the ground. An organization called Wild Fire is then in charge of figuring out what happened, and what can they do to stop it. They learn that there is a disease spreading in the area and it kills people within seconds of contact. And worst of all they have only a couple days to figure it out. What can five elite scientists do? Can they possibly save the Earth in time?The Andromeda Strain is a very well written book and would have to be one of the best books I have ever read. The way Michael Crichton divides the book in to five different sections, each section being a different day, almost makes you feel you are there. The author is very descriptive and makes you almost think that it is not a book, but a report on actual events that took place. \\"This book recounts the five-day history of a major American scientific crisis.\\" This is the first sentence in the book. Right then you get an idea of how serious this book is. This book is great for people who love science fiction books. I would highly recommend reading this book to anyone in mood for a great book. And when you really think about, this whole epidemic could happen to us."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Re-read after a (10-15?) year hiatus from my original reading. Crichton makes for a quick read and he throws out some compelling ideas in his prose. This one is a real page-turner. I enjoy the novel-as-historical-document style that he adopts here (and (if I recall correctly) in some of his other work) but it also colors the text a bit and makes for some awkward passages in places."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Has a nice story.

He told me a lot about his books, but his main focus was the one that he claimed was his very favorite: The Andromeda Strain. Knowing that my buddy has good taste, I finally checked it out.Now, I love to read. But I can't remember if I ever finished a book in less than a week. If not, Andromeda Strain is the first. I could not put it down. My favorite author was once Stephen King. My favorite of his books arePet SemataryandThe Stand: Expanded Edition: For the First Time Complete and Uncut (Signet)While these are very entertaining, I didn't read through them like I did with Crichton's book. I've never used the term \\"page-turner\\" until now, but that's exactly what this is. Crichton is my new favorite author, if only for this one achievement.I will be reading more of his books. I hear that The Andromeda Strain is not even his best book, which is surprising for me to hear. If you're looking for something new and unbelievably entertaining, get The Andromeda Strain. It's that good!"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"The book, The Andromeda Strain depicts an epic story of scientific proportions. It tells the story of four scientists and their mission to stop a potentially worldwide epidemic, code name: Andromeda Strain. Without getting into too many details and spoilers, I can say for a fact that The Andromeda Strain is a must read for all science enthusiasts. It does contain a lot of scientific terminology (particularly pertaining to biology and chemistry), which at times can be kind of confusing. The story is rich and full of excitement. Michael Crichton does an incredible job of making the story seem non-fictional, and at times, I felt like I was reading a news story. This book also transcends the realm of science and can easily get one stuck on government and politics. After reading this book, I found myself thinking, \\"Does stuff like this really go on?\\" The Andromeda Strain includes suspense, thrills, cover-ups, and a realistic sensation that this could really happen. And to see what I mean by, \\"This could really happen,\\" I guess you will have to read the book yourself!"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"The book The Andromeda Strain by Michael Crichton is a fascinating book that shows what could happen if a lethal alien pathogen is introduced to earth. I thought the book was very interesting, and was just the right mix of science (fact and fiction) and action. Although some parts of the book were a bit slow, there were many pages of what I would consider worthless military talk, I was hooked, and excited to see what was going to happen next through the entire book. What I did not like about the book is the ending; it was almost like it was to movie like, and it seemed like the entire book was getting you ready for the end, where there was the main climax, than suddenly everything was resolved. The pathogen from space mutated, stopped killing humans, and than harmlessly floated out of earth's atmosphere. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in science, and has at least a small background in biology."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"The Andromeda Strain is a very suspenseful book about a pathogen that invades a section of the Untied States. I liked the book because the author makes sure to make the book seem real. The book has a large number of charts that either describe or elaborate the text. This makes the book all that much more real and interesting to read. When there is a chart the author always makes sure that there is also an explanation of the chart. The one thing that I think that I would change is how the book starts. The beginning is very slow but as soon as you get into the middle of the book the pace picks up a lot. The people that would enjoy this book the most are those that read science fiction and are old enough to understand basics in both mathematics and science."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"In his book The Andromeda Strain, Michael Crichton has crafted a fairly excellent story, explaining very complex technology in simple terms while building a dynamic plot and filling the world with believable characters.

From beginning to end there's not a dull moment, and if I had to spend twenty dollars to read this book I'd think it would be worth it.

The action adventure mixes scientific and technical data together, and envelops the reader in a fictional tale of the failed armageddon of Earth.

Which may lead them to locating an extra terrestrial life form of any size.Scoop VII lands in the middle of a small-town Arizona. The population of 48 soon gets curious and opens up the capsule to take a look for themselves. Little do they know they have just released the most deadly organism known and not known to man. Before the \\"virus\\" is allowed to spread, five scientists who are part of the secretly run government organization known as \\"Wildfire,\\" must use state of the art equipment, and their heads to try to stop it before the \\"virus\\" before it ends the legacy of the human race.The very well written book, even though written 20 years ago, is remarkably close to real life.

Even though it was one of Chrichton's first books, I think it is one of his best!"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"The Andromeda Strain was the first Michael Crichton book I ever read.

The first 80-90% of the work was near perfect: absolutely brilliant writing, full of suspense, that I found almost literally hair-raising.Unfortunately, it appears that somewhere along the way, Crichton boxed himself into a corner, and couldn't find a plausible way out. The net result is one of the most illogical endings I have ever read; the final 20 or 30 pages feel like they have nothing to do with what has gone before.

But after 30 years the story is still almost cutting edge. Crichton's first (or one of the first, anyway) was his best. I suspect more than one reader has been taken in over the years by the pseudo-documentary narrative. If so it's almost understandable; the story seems entirely plausible.(For that matter, who's to say there's not a Wildfire-type facility, or that there wasn't an incident like this at some time? Not suggesting any government coverups -- just saying that the reason the book works so well is that you know it could happen)."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Okay, so you've seen the movie a hundred times.

I opened the cover on Saturday morning, called my three golfing buds at 11:30, cancelled my golfing date (they haw-hawed when I said I couldn't put a book down), read through lunch, piled up on couch during the afternoon, grilled outside that evening --- all the while reading the book. Finished reading, served the burgers to my family and handed my wife the book, saying: &quot;This is the only book I have never been able to put down!&quot; And that, gentle readers, is a carved in stone fact. I'm neither a techno-philiac nor much more than remotely interested in science fiction. This book is not science fiction. This book doesn't miss a beat; it seems real.

The virus takes no prisoners and just when it is ready to launch itself out of its prison in the Nevada lab ......... Crichton hasn't written a book this good ....(I simply cannot use the hackneyed term &quot;taut and riveting?&quot;).... since Andromeda. Some of his books have been downright goofy. Most have been okay. The success of 'Andromeda' is probably why he hung up his stethoscope and said goodbye to whines, aches, and pains of patients.

I read all the summaries-on the back of the book, on the Internet, reviews and all and it seems like a simple concept, but I am so confused and ignorant to what is going on, I feel like I'm going to scream! I AM just going into 8th grade this year, it probably has something to do with knowledge of all these scientific facts, but still-you'd think I'd understand SOMETHING. I only understand when there is dialogue and I liked the part where Mark Hall gets totally &quot;clean&quot; and disinfected by all these antibacterial tests, but other than that, I'm dead bored. I feel stupid for not understanding anything and am getting frustrated with myself and with the book for not explaining anything. In the acknowledgments, Michael Crichton says, &quot;...if the reader must occasionally struggle through an arid passage of technical detail, I apologize.&quot; OCCASIONALLY? A PASSAGE? It's more like CONSTANTLY struggling through PAGES of technical detail! &quot;Sphere&quot;, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, &quot;Disclosure&quot;, &quot;Lost World&quot;, those were all great, but this was like AAAHHHH!!! Since I don't want to give Michael Crichton another one star rating (I gave him one star on &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot;), I'll give him two for the occasional relief with some dialogue.

The caliber of Michael Crichton's research is such that I still found the technology and science in the book impressive (though the computers were obviously dated) despite the book's age. The plotline is thrilling, and though some of the scientific and philosophic asides are lengthy, most are equally fascinating. I was slightly disappointed by the ending; however, the rest of the book was amazing and made the reading worth it."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I think this was one of the best \\"first books\\" of any author I've read. It seems even today to have this uncanny timeless quality, as if its plot could be going on right now. Oddly enough the characters seem better developed then his later works, they seem human. The book did provide some interesting theories to trifle with, a little bit of mystery, and even a smidge of psychology thrown in if you look hard enough. The only real complaint I have about it is I found it a bit anti-climactic, but in being so it was certainly unique. It is deserving of its reputation and place in science fiction literary history."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Years before Jurassic Park, Michael Chrichton wrote this absolute gem about aliens landing on Earth.

While my memory of the movie is sketchy, the 1969 novel's style is reminiscent of many books of that era... The pacing plods along, with mock (real? simulated?) dot-matrix computer printouts inserted intermittently, and unfortunately [SPOILER AHEAD!] after a good deal of melodramatic Cold War-era suspense, the story ends on an anticlimax to the effect of, \\"Oh, sorry! Never mind!\\" (\\"Or *is* it the end?\\")However, this is most likely some of Crichton's earliest work, and I'm sure if he sat down to write the same story today, it would be written much more tightly and the action would probably progress more quickly. Even so, Crichton uses the passage of time here to create tension, a device he continues to use to this day to good effect.Given the current state of computer graphics, I wouldn't be surprised if a 21st century adaption of the novel surfaces sometime in the near future. In fact, my research for this review uncovered an Internet Movie Database listing for a 2005 \\"Andromeda Strain\\" mini-series as \\"in production.\\" It'll be interesting to see what 35 years of movie-making progress can do to improve its on-screen appearance... as well as plotting and characterization."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Would you like to travel on a scientific adventure, where you are trying to solve something literally out of this world? Well, in The Andromeda Strain, you are able to travel a difficult five day journey with the scientists, trying to find the answers to this extra-terrestrial organism or virus. In my opinion, I feel that it would be at your best judgment to read this book. Besides being filled with many biological facts, one can also gain an exciting thriller of a plot line, as well as connections with the characters.If you have a passion for science and love trying to find the answers, then this book is for you. Constant situations and facts are thrown at you, and you must try to organize them so you can solve this problem. With the detailed descriptions by Michael Crichton, you can even feel like you are one of the four scientists struggling to find the solution to it all. As I read, I could not stop especially with those moments of discovery, suspense, excitement, and even surprise.When analyzing this book, I find many strengths and weaknesses. I believe that Michael Crichton is an incredible scientific writer. Somehow he finds that perfect combination of science and suspense, to deliver a fantastic book. He created a fascinating story with science; writing interesting dialogue, using a colorful vocabulary, descriptive settings and situations, which were all able to tie in with the reader. Trust me, I am not always the person interested in sci-fi books, but this book was so much more. Although this book delivers a creative idea, it has only one miniscule problem. Sometimes Crichton becomes too descriptive with his situations, creating a confusing and exaggerating picture for the reader. Besides that, Michael Crichton delivers an incredible book that will keep you guessing till the very end. The Andromeda Strain is a great review for Biology as well as a thriller for reading. I suggest that you read this book because I give it two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"If you like an edge of your seat threiller that has to do with science, danger and advendture than this is the book for you. it has to do with a strain of a virus that origenated in space and crashed down to earth on a sattelite.

It is exciting and full of surprises. So exciting, in fact, that you might not even be able to put the book down once you have started. It takes extraterrestrial life into a new direction of exciting possibilities. It makes you wonder if what we have to worry about are the things we can't see. The Andromeda Strain has many strong points. It goes into great detail about the things that are going on throughout the story. It shows and tells how many of the machines and tools are used or their function. It has many interesting turns and unexpected events. Though the Andromeda Strain has many strengths, there are also some weak points too. Some of the beginning and a few other parts of the book are slow reading and quite boring. I would recommend this book to those who enjoy science-fiction. If you have read other books by Michael Crichton, then you will probably enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I have always avoided authors whose books have been adapted to screen. That policy is under review due to The Andromeda Strain.A mission has been assigned to a team of four scientists: Analyze the contents of a returned space capsule and determine why almost all the inhabitants of the immediate vicinity are dead. Mission can only be accomplished if the team survives.Jeremy Stone, a lawyer-turned-bacteriologist; Peter Leavitt, a parasitologist; Mark Hall, a surgeon; and Charles Burton, a pathologist were the members of this team. Starting from the elemental, combining intellects and egos, defying bungled analysis, and omnipresent danger, will this group succeed, or will they doom the earth to its worst nightmare?If by any chance Crichton has to leave his day job---a guess, since he could be a night-writer---I predict he would have no difficulty getting employed as a lecturer. His familiarity with science is evident in the writing. The Andromeda Strain abounds with illustrations and pedagogical aids that simplify some complex scientific principles.What I found most refreshing was Leavitt's addressing the meaning of life. What defines life? Indeed a scientific question, although more importantly, a philosophical one, it demonstrates the limits of science in the face of man's transcience.The plot is taut, the writing tight, a la New York Times investigative scoop mode. This is the nearest thing to a movie I have read.Please Be Warned: The Andromeda Strain is infectious, and currently, there is no effective innoculation."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I finished THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN about 6 months ago, and I still think it is ONE of the best books I've ever read in my life.

This book is extremely interesting and scientifically in depth. If you are a science enthusiast, you will love this book. I liked the book, but there were some things that I would have changed. There was a lot of background information during the book explaining why certain events happened. This information seemed too much and the novel could have been much more interesting if some of it was removed. Like I said, people who are interested in the science background would definitely like this book. Anybody who didn't take biology in high school wouldn't understand the basics of the virus in the story. If I were to change anything about this book, I would remove some of the background information and unnecessary events in the story.

The book is very suspenseful and exciting ...for the most part. The book starts out with a bang, introducing many exciting themes and situations. Soon after though, the book tends to slow down, almost to a crawl. Sometimes there were parts in the book where he would spend six or seven pages just talking about scientific lingo that no one, unless you had a science major, would understand. This seems to be the common theme through out the book; he talks for a long time about science then throws a chapter of pure action and suspense for a chapter, but then its back to the science. I personally found this to be quite annoying. I also found the ending to be a total let down, It was very uneventful and it seemed as if he had to find a way to end the book quickly, other than that I found the rest of the book to be fairly interesting. Overall I would give this a 6/10, it was a decent read and was fairly exciting, but it had some flaws."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"An amazing book. I could recommend this book to Michael Crichton fans or any science fiction fan. Crichton does a wonderful job explaining technical scientific information so anyone can understand what is going on. I loved this book and if you want an excitind and suspenseful read, you shoud do the same. And for some extra information, the movie based on this book isn't that great at all. Maybe if they mae a remake of it."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Wrapped in the guise of a techno-thriller, Crichton's \\"The Andromeda Strain\\" is actually a brilliant exploration of \\"First Contact.\\" Even though the book is now nearly 40 years old, it still holds its place in modern science fiction because of it's thorough and highly accurate scientific research. Crichton wrote this book (and several others) during his days in medical school, and the care and attention to detail certainly shows through.I notice that a great many reviewers (and, in fact, my own father) object to the ending of the novel -- that the virus simply mutates into something benign, and thus we have a happy ending. I have two responses to this point. The first is that the \\"happy ending\\" is due not to the mutation but to the fact that we find a means of killing and controlling the virus -- its vulnerability to high acidity or alkalinity (pH factor).The second argument, however, is the more important one. Objection is made that no virus mutates in an orderly fashion. The idea is that a single colony of viral tissue, split into many smaller parts, would result in at least as many mutations as the parts. Mutation, in other words, is random rather than controlled. It is here that Crichton makes his most brilliant stroke: The mutation IS controlled -- by those who made it.Remember that this organism is a form of first contact. How many of our sci-fi readers and fans out there remember the myriad books and stories which feature an attempt to contact a different species by using mathematics? \\"Prove that we are sentient: Tap out the first seven prime numbers, then repeat the sequence.\\" This mathematical demonstration of order, method, logic, and higher thinking is represented directly in this virus; there is no random mutation, but rather a strictly controlled series of mutations, perhaps based upon the mutation -- or, more accurately, the division and replication -- of the crystalline structure on which is is based.Thus is this novel the most unique \\"First Contact\\" novel ever written. It presents a biological organism which, in effect, taps out its own version of prime numbers, to show us that it is not a naturally occuring thing, but was in fact created by an intelligent race seeking contact.And apart from all this, it's just a plain ripping-good read."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"The man does his research very well. I loved the Dan Brown books and was looking for something to tide me over until his next one was published, this did the job."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"A man in a ghastly white robe passes over plies of dead bodies. A young infant is found, howling in the ominously silent night. 46 of the 48 people in Piedmont, Arizona were dead. How could such evil be found on our beloved planet? On the other hand, how is it possible that there were survivors, when all the rest had been killed? Drs. Jeremy Stone, Peter Leavitt, Charles Burton and Mark Hall had met, in order to solve the scientific mystery. These four scientists create a group project known only to the government as \\"Project Wildfire\\". It is up to these people to either rescue, or let loose a virus that may wipe out the world. These scientists begin to investigate and observe everything and anything that may give them even the smallest of hints, in order to find the answer to this question: How do you stop something that is utterly alien-and savagely lethal?These four scientists start their research and lab work in a secret government building in Nevada. Jeremy Stone, a balding and very thin man at the age of 36, was without doubt the most successful and known scientist out of the four. He was a man that \\"knew everything, and is fascinated by the rest\\", quotes a friend. Dr. Charles Burton, however, was quite the opposite of Stone. Burton is a 54 year old pathologist who is very logical, and a great observer. He was different however, because \\"where Stone was organized, Burton was sloppy; where Stone was confident, Burton was jumpy and nervous.\\" Dr. Peter Leavitt was a pessimist who was experienced in the works of the treatment of infectious diseases. He was also very imaginative and thought logically. He suffered a common disorder known as epilepsy, and \\"he suddenly doesn't know what happens to him, where he loses just a few minuets of his life\\" The last member of the Wildfire team is Dr. Mark Hall, the only single man on the project team. He is the only person that can turn off an automatic nuclear bomb, should something go wrong. Thus, these four men put their differences aside and work as a team, in order to save earth from being exposed from this virus.Project Scoop had been setup in order to retrieve deadly microorganisms from space. Six of the seven sent were complete failures...yet the seventh was knocked off its orbit pattern, and had landed near the township of Piedmont. Stone and Burton had entered the town to find and observe nothing but a nasty stench from the heaps of corpses. The two scientists began to search the town, and found what they had been looking for: Scoop VII, the contaminated satellite. Yet, they find more than they intended to: an old man and a young infant, both had survived death and insanity. Thus commenced long hours of examination and research for the answer of how an old man who is acidosis and a baby that is alkaline, were similar, when they were suppose to be completely the opposite. All of a sudden, on the fourth day at the Wildfire centre, strange things began to happen: first Burton had actually been infected by the virus, and then Leavitt suffered strange seizures. While Stone attempted to keep Burton alive and well, Hall was forced to do some serious thinking. He received a newspaper article stating that another person, Officer Willis, did survive the Andromeda Strain for a few hours before he went mad and shot not only himself, but five others. Officer Willis also had been acidosis. So, the old man and Willis had some things in common, yet, why did the baby survive? When Hall and his colleagues finally solved the mystery of the Andromeda Strain, an alarm went off and a voice came on: \\"There are now three minutes to self-destruction.\\" Three minutes...until the world, all of humanity, would come to an end.The entire story took place in the laboratory that was underground. It was isolated from everything else, for if something had gone wrong, the virus would have spread. The laboratory was also located in Nevada, a very large state, with a small population, reducing risks of endangering people as well as making sure that no one becomes suspicious. Although the book does not describe the setting very much, because of its underground location, it created more tension, danger, and anxiety.From the beginning with a man walking amongst the corpses to the end in which the world may come to an end, this book has been unbelievably uptight and bloodcurdling. The mysterious and horrifying events in the beginning led to a suspenseful and hair-raising plot with a great and incomparable ending. Though it is in the science fiction genre, it includes a little bit of everything, making the situation seem so realistic and so close to us. Although the use of many difficult scientific terms and the complexity of the story made it hard to understand for boys in my age, it is sure to be a pleasure to all those who love and follow science fiction adventure and even horror books, because there is nothing that The Andromeda Strain does not have."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"This book really caught me all throughout the book until the end. It was a shocker. It was unexpected. It was a weak ending! I really couldn't see why Crichton just had to do that... You'll know what i'm talking about when you read it for yourself. But you'll be dissappointed in the end because until the end your predictions of the ending will be nothing more than a great exageration of the actual ending.It's great and all but if you only like books with great endings this is not your book.

Considering that it is heralded as Crichton's best, I really expected more. I've read Jurassic Park, Rising Sun, Lost World, Congo, Binary, Sphere Airframe and Timeline. I enjoyed them all, especially Jurassic Park which is perhaps the greatest book ever written by anyone (I've read that about 8 times now). Andromeda Strain isn't, as I say, a bad book. I have a great deal of respect for Micheal Crichton and I love much of his work, but this one seemed to misfire a bit. It just didn't grip me like any of the above titles did. I didn't even finish it the first time I tried to read it."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I first read this book when I was in high school, in the late '80s. I liked it - but even then I thought it was dated in its depictions of modern society. (For example, the main characters are all educated or military white men who are single or who have placeholder wives. The film version tried to remedy this by changing one of the characters into a woman, but the film had its own problems.)The concept is great, the execution ... not so much. The parts that deal with the actual story being told are very interesting and move well. A lot of science is dumped on the reader, though, and I do mean dumped. The story comes to a screeching halt so that Crichton can explain, for example, the way to translate a number between base 2 and base 10 or the difficulty faced by scientists in defining &quot;life&quot;.Still, &quot;Andromeda&quot; is far superior to other Crichton works, especially &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. Here there is at least some attempt made to give characters depth. Sure, some characters are blatant walking signboards, but not nearly to the same degree here. (The replacement physician is a standard plot technique - his function is to ask the questions the author expects the reader would ask - but a faint sense of character still comes through.)[If it isn't clear, I want books to have some sort of plot or idea, but my primary requirement is that the characters are well-developed and believable. This is sadly rare in science-fiction. This aside is my version of a disclaimer.]As far as the plot/idea goes, the contamination of the space probe and its aftereffects make for a good one. The topic is handled well, and most of the occurrences are honest. That is, the mistakes that are made are believable, the way that events develop is plausible, and tension is maintained well through the story.In all, it's good (but not great). If you want strong characters or smooth storytelling, &quot;Andromeda&quot; is not your best bet. (Harry Turtledove, maybe, if you still want science fiction.) If your primary requirement is a great idea, though, this book satisfies, and it stays with you long after you've finished."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"As a high school student I would challenge my instructors about isuses raised in this tome, I got no significant responces and carried the book for years.

So it's good to go back and see exactly why he became a superstar author in the first place. I've read most of Crichton books and I have never much cared for them, but this book is different. The Andromeda Strain, Crichton's first novel, is quite simply the best thing he has ever written, a classic of solid science fiction. It is a masterpiece of suspense and attention to detail, about a showdown with an alien disease that provides an eery precursor to modern biological boogeymen like the Ebola virus. Even some 25 years after it was written, it still seems fresh. Highly recommended, even for people (like me) who don't like Crichton's other work."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"The Andromeda Strain by Michael Crichton is an interesting look into the world of science.

The government thinks while in orbit the satallite hit a meteor, and crashed land in Piedmont, Arizona. When they send a team to recover the capsule they find everyone dead except an infant and a sixty-seven year old man.The government created a high tech lab for such things as Scoop called Wildfire. They also got together the best scientists and doctors in the U.S. Once the team isolated the organism they gave it the name the andromeda strain. One day during testing one of the doctors became contaminated when his rubber suit was eaten throught by the virus. The team found out that the virus had mutated and that is why the doctor hadn't instantly died. But the government had installed a self-detonating bomb to go off three minutes after contamination, which meant the one team memeber with the key had to stop the bomb.

Critchon has a special knack for keeping things exciting right up to the last few pages. When reading this book I had no doubt in my mind that these exact events had taken place.The are only downsides to Androdeda Strain, one being that it is very graphic. Another being that the main charectars are in the same place for a large part of the book.

The progress of science over the last 30 years does not 'date' this book at all, it remains the page-turning, suspense extravaganza it was when it first came out. I've read most of his other works, but for me, this is the ONE. And don't think the premise is something that still couldn't happen - our knowledge of space and 'what's out there' is still extremely limited. 'Nasty surprises' can still come in 'small packages'."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"One of Michael Crichton's earliest novels, \\"The Andromeda Strain\\" showcases his frightening imagination and his command of several branches of science. Unfortunately, the book suffers from its own clever design.Crichton has written the story as if it were an after-the-fact report. It's an interesting framework, and it hooks the reader right away, but it makes a build-up of suspense almost impossible because the reader already knows the ultimate outcome. Crichton compounds the problem himself by throwing in phrases about character reactions many weeks later. The book simply plods along, often reading more like a textbook than a work of fiction.Crichton overuses two techniques. He tends to end chapters with the ominous \\"They could not have been more wrong\\" or some variation on that idea. And he frequently sets off incomplete sentences as separate paragraphs to give them more weight.Something like this.Both techniques can be effective if used sparingly, but Crichton makes use of them so often that they lose their potency and become almost comical.In general, the book is well-written and thought-provoking. Fans of Michael Crichton will certainly enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"The Andromeda Strain is one of the best books I have ever read. This wonderfully written novel is a story concerning an extremely deadly organic structure that is introduced to human knowledge by killing the majority of a small town while driving the rest insane. Outside of the main concept, the book tells of a special team that was set up just in case something like this happened. By the end, the team known as Wildfire is working restlessly to find a cure for this organism. The setting for this book is the southwest of the United States somewhere around the 1970's. The main characters in the novel are Jeremy Stone, Mark Hall, Leavitt, Burton, and Peter Jackson. I particularly enjoyed this book because of the knowledge the author appeared to hold in the subject discussed in the book such as; diseases, human health, micro-biology, biology, and several other areas. When reading this book, you have to pay attention to what you are reading the entire time, this is because there are small bits of important information throughout the book. I would highly recommend this book to any reader, especially thosewho enjoy science-fiction. I thoroughly took delight in reading this fantastic book and thought one of the best aspects of it was the way it is written. it seemed as if this might have really happened, or will happen, especially in this day and age. I could hardly put this book down due to the suspense and how interesting I found it. This is the first of Michael Crichtons works I have read but I will doubtlessly read more of his works in part of this superb novel.Tom N."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Michael Crichton passed away last year, so I thought he would be a good choice to read. I know there are people who have problems with Crichton - his later books revealed some distinct political leanings and display very clear biases, the most obvious of these being State of Fear, in which he attacks the environmentalist movement's support of global warming. His attacks are blatant, and even though the novel is said to be a good read, it's burdened by the obvious slant of the author.It's tough to know what to do with authors who inject their own personal morality into their works. Some of them, like Heinlein, do it in such a way that it's not a distraction - it's Heinlein. Others, such as Orson Scott Card, are so vocal in their political opinions that they risk losing a large portion of their readership. In this situation, you have to make a decision: read the book for the story or read the book for the author's politics? Or don't?I take the same route here that I do with actors, musicians and other artists who make their political and social views known. I disregard those views and just judge their work on its own merits. It's not that hard to do, really....Anyway, I remember seeing this movie for the first time, and it scared the hell out of me. Not in the same way that my childhood slasher films scared me, of course. In those, there was always someone - Jason, Freddie, Michael - who was lurking behind curtains, waiting to turn you into steak tartar if you were foolish enough to have sex in the camp counsellor's cabin. But at least they were human (sort of), and they had motivations, however insane these motivations were.In this book, we are not facing a psychopath with a chainsaw. It's something more terrible and more impossible to deal with.The premise - The US space program, in an attempt to figure out exactly what is lurking in the upper atmosphere, has been sending up special satellites - the Scoop satellites - to sample the air up there and then return so that scientists can do what they do best. The theory was that if we were to encounter extraterrestrial life, the odds are that it would be some sort of simple organism rather than a four-foot grey humanoid.People like Carl Sagan seemed to support this theory, and Crichton makes a very good case for it through his characters. Radio waves attenuate, even light pulses can't last forever - but build an organism that can survive indefinitely in space? That is an excellent way of telling the rest of the universe that you're out there. A microbe needs a lot less to keep it going than your average movie E.T., so it would be reasonable to assume that it would make an excellent message in a bottle in a vast and harsh cosmos.Back to the book - most of these satellites went up and came down without incident, but one - Scoop VII - had some unexpected problems and crashed in the American southwest, just outside a small town called Piedmont. The good citizens of Piedmont, wanting to know what it was, brought it home to have a look.Within eighteen hours, nearly everyone in Piedmont was dead. The lesson? Never go near something that comes screaming out of the sky. Yes, it might give you super-powers, but odds are that it'll kill you.The government, always looking for the worst case scenario, had planned for this, and put Project Wildfire in action. Wildfire called for a team of scientists with varied backgrounds to be brought to an isolated lab in Nevada. Scoop would be brought there, and they would attempt to unravel the mystery of what killed the people of Piedmont.The story sounds pretty simple, and Crichton makes a point of saying that, ideally, there should be no story to tell. Wildfire facilities are insanely well-guarded, and the design of the complex itself is nearly foolproof against something escaping - to the point that, if the facility becomes insecure, it will be vaporized in a nuclear explosion.As usual, Crichton is meticulous in his science. The book has a bibliography in the back with 58 references to justify his use of x-ray crystallography, culture growth, electron microscopes, and other theories. The point is, he is saying that the incident in The Andromeda Strain could happen. Maybe. And it is possible that, despite our best planning and efforts, we might not be able to stop it.This brings up the question: is this really science fiction? Well, yes, because A) it's fiction and B) the story is dependent on the science. But it's not science fiction in the way that we're familiar, since very little of it is actually fictional. Most of the technology is extant, and the tech that is a little more outlandish is certainly within our ability to create. The only thing that is really speculative is the Andromeda organism itself. And even given that, the story is not so much about the organism as it is about the race to figure out what the organism is - it's about the scientists, not the science.Where the actual story comes in is with the introduction of Mistakes. A simple malfunction in a piece of communications equipment. A medical problem that is hidden until it is too late. Miscommunication and assumption abound, which is what makes this book interesting. Otherwise, it would just be a matter of the scientists trying to figure out what this wee beastie that hitched a ride on Scoop can do, and why. Perhaps it's not so much science fiction as it is scientific fiction. If that makes any sense....Indeed, the silly humans are saved from worldwide extermination by virtue of the microorganism's own nature, oddly enough. This isn't The Stand - Crichton didn't set out to write an End of the World story. He wanted to talk about science and what might happen if an unknown pathogen should appear from the darkest regions of space.As I said before, this is what makes it so terrifying. The villain of this story is a bacteria. We don't know where it comes from, how it works, or why. It has no ambition, no plan. It is not hostile, malicious, or vindictive. It can't be bargained with or tricked.Perhaps that is why disease stories are so interesting. On the one hand, they point out how vulnerable we really are to something we have never encountered. On the other hand, they show how sometimes, just sometimes, we can avert disaster with the ingenuity that keeps popping up in humanity.So - it's well-written and well-researched, not to mention a sci-fi classic. The movie's pretty good as well, and sticks relatively close to the book. Either are recommended."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Michael Crichton has done it again! This is one of his best novels ever!I usually try to wait to watch the movie until I read the book, but I admit to watching this movie prior to buying the book. The book was 100 times better than any movie I have ever watched! I loved it!This is a story that could actually happen, developed by an author who has the skill of no other author in recent memory. You will love the characters, and the hundreds of pages will fly by like they are nothing. Enjoy the ride as you read this legitimate thriller!Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Interesting flashback to an earlier version of medical science fiction. I read it after viewing the recent remake for TV of the film version, and in anticipation of viewing the original film version on DVD.The recent TV remake is better than the book, which today seems a little hackneyed. This long-ago first novel by Crichton included enough errors in the author's writing craft that, today, I must wonder how it ever got published."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"It was about 15 years ago in my science class that I watched the movie Andromeda Strain, and I just finished reading the book last night in about 6 hours. Yes, it was difficult to put it down.The story line is simple yet compelling. Satellite falls down into a very small town, and all the people were dead in very strange ways. The most striking point is that their all of their blood has been clotted, dried like solid, inside their body. When more thorough investigation was done, there are two survivors. These survivals and the satellite are brought to top secret laboratory designed to contain and study extraterrestrial life form.Because the \\"disease\\" causes immediate death, group of scientists are at work to find solution or cure, as quickly as possible. As the scientists examine & learn more about the satellite & survivors, the plot thickens.Keep in mind this book was published almost 40 years ago. Author has done incredible research and the whole idea of laboratory designed for alien life form seemed \\"radical\\", and truly science fiction 40 years ago in my opinion.It's a great book to read, and I also recommend to watch the movie if you can find one.I also know & realize that the ending is not quite good as it could've been and I agree. However, the ending shouldn't be the judging point of a book.One other things people mentioned was that the book was too \\"scientific\\" & \\"technical\\". Author tried to explain basic biology & chemistry terms & ideas that was discussed in the book. I realize this may be confusing to some non-science people. Since I studied both chemistry & biology, I understood most of the techno-lingo. So be aware for non science people."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"This is my second reading of Crichton's \\"The Andromeda Strain\\", and it hasn't lost its luster. In fact I think this is the authors best work. A simple storyline: the bugs against humanity. And I found it as interesting, and suspenseful as the first time. However, like other authors I'm sorry to report Crichton's more recent books don't measure up to this classic."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN was Michael Crichton's first big novel, written in 1968. It's a remarkably inventive novel about a killer virus that has come to earth.This book, which many critics claim is Crichton's best novel, is actually not even close to that. THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN is enjoyable, but is nowhere near as good as some of Crichton's later works, such as THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY, SPHERE and JURASSIC PARK.My problem with this book is the almost non-existent characterization. Most of the scientist characters are bland and almost interchangeable. Crichton invests little time in developing their personalities. Instead, he spends page after page on explaining a lot of technical details, which gives this novel a definite non-fiction kind of a feel. The ending of this novel is also remarkably limp, given the massive buildup.THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN is interesting, but I felt it fell short on the storytelling, which made for a rather flat reading experience."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Michael Crichton has surely made a name for himself within the science fiction circle, and here with his stunning debut is where that name is founded. \`The Andromeda Strain' is one of those edge of your seat novels that keeps you glued to every page, glued to every image and scared senseless at the possibility that maybe, just maybe this isn't all make believe. Building on a strong premise that small one-celled alien life forms have eradicated a small town and threaten the existence of mankind, Crichton one ups himself by giving us more than aliens to fear, he hands us ourselves. By creating a claustrophobic atmosphere for his characters Crichton doubles the fear and suspense and allows the reader to become completely absorbed in what he/she is reading.One thing I've always campaigned when it came to Crichton's work is his visual imagery, and while \`The Andromeda Strain' is more or less contained in just a few areas Michael is still able to make everything feel so three dimensional. From the opening scenes of morbid death and gloom Michael immediately starts painting a picture that leaves no doubt in the readers mind that this will leave a lasting impression.And what an impression, one that makes you jump at the chance to read anything directly related to this man. If you have the opportunity as well to watch the film adaptation, please do, for it is fantastically orchestrated, much like Crichton's brilliant debut. With increasing tension as the selected scientists try and save the world from a terrestrial related outbreak \`The Andromeda Strain' doesn't let up and proves to be an exciting read for the mind, filled with suspense, tension, fear and enlightenment. It's amazing to see how technically advanced the novel is for the year it was penned. Highly recommended for any fan of Crichton's better known work or anyone wanting to give him a try...start here for it's surely one of his best."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Out in the desert of Arizona, a United States satellite crashes down near a very small town. Before United States officials can retrieve it, the satellite is pried open. The contents kill nearly everyone in town. Most die immediately--within three seconds. Some live slightly longer, but in that time they get hopelessly insane and commit suicide. Those sent to retrieve the satellite also die immediately.The U.S. government has prepared for something like this. Ever since the first rockets were sent up in space, they knew there was a possibility that some extraterristrial material could make its way back to Earth and infect humans. A secret laboratory was set up to serve as an isolation tank, complete with five levels of sterility, to secretly and safely study any organisms that make their way back.Now four scientists are sealed inside this laboratory, sterilized completely and cut off from contact with the outside world. They are examining this deadly organism that traveled back with the satellite. They alone have the mission to identify it and figure out how to fight it. But they must work quickly. If the government thinks this organism is too dangerous, or if it begins to spread, a nuclear bomb will be detonated to destroy the area.I liked the suspense and fast pace of this story. It was hard to put down. I also liked the precise scientific descriptions of what the researchers were doing. Crichton is good at including enough technical information to make his plots seem plausible. I thought Crichton could have focused a bit more on character development, though. I didn't feel like I got to know the characters in this story very well. I also thought the ending was a bit of a cop-out."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"This book is about a space capsule from space that fell down into a small town in Arizona. And the capsule carried an organism from space, that killed the whole population in a small town, except two survivers. Four scientists then meet at an underground site called \\"Wildlife\\" and goes on to investigate the microorganism and how the two people managed to survive.At least that is what people in the 60s believed: that bacteria brought down to space by a satellite or organisms from space entering the Earth would cause some kind of crisis like death. But not right now, no, astronauts can come back and go home immediately instead of going through a 3 week decontamination process, since no life form have been found anywhere in space... Yet.This book was written in 1969, and remember that time has changed, and beliefs have changed, so don't read this book and laugh at the idea because 2000's and 1960's are totally different eras.Anyway, it was an intersting book. I liked it!"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"This, \\"The Great Train Robbery\\", and \\"A Case of Need\\", old though they may be, still remain Crichton's best production. The \\"Jurassic Park\\" series is downright boring; and \\"Timeline\\" is too stupid for words. Time and experience have not improved Crichton's writing. It's quite evident he keeps writing not for the sake of writing a good book, but with an eye to a Hollywood adaptation to a film.

It put Crichton on the map, and, as far as I know, laid the foundation for a &quot;race against technology/the unknown&quot; formula that he has used many times in subsequent novels. This book is gripping and suspenseful, moves with relentless pace, and demands to be read from start to finish without being put down. It achieves what most thrillers hope to achieve without being overly pushy with the reader. The characters are cool, easy to identify with, and well developed. The science is also technically interesting, though the book was written quite a while ago. Overall, a classic book that anyone with an interest in Crichton or science should read. Avery Z. Conner, author of &quot;Fevers of the Mind&quot;."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"This book was incredible. It did build up rather slowly, but that was because of all the scenery set up required to make the book readable. I would recomend this book especially to any one living in the west, where urban legends of what goes on at Edwards and Nellis run rampant and thrillers like this feel real enough to make you sweat."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Been a while, and I doubt I have anything really brilliant to say. But. . .Like the best of the plague books, this one is scary as hell (especially now). What makes it really scary is that the plague itself isn't so terrible: death is sudden and peaceful, not like say \\"Cap'n Trips\\" (The Stand), or HIV, small pox, etc. And it just \\"happens\\".One of the grpies I have always had with Crichton is his preference for concepts over character, and his preference for dissertations over storytelling. Not that case here, both blend nicely, smoothly, and I legitimately learned a few things.Definitely worth a read, and even a re-read."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I love how easily Michael Crichton brings esoteric subjects to laymen in understandable terms. This book is no exception. That being said, there is little else I liked about this book. There is a lot of superfluous information about the characters. There is a lot of foreshadoiwing that left me waiting for something really extraordinary to happen, and nothing really ever did. The plot kept building as if at any moment the characters will realize how dangerous the situation is in which they have found themselves. However, the suspense is unfulfilled, and the ending very anticlimactic. I will continue to read books by this author, but I can not recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"This book was very good for many reasons. I found the story to be extremely interesting, and the book made me think of what our country would do if something like this really happened. One of my favorite aspects of the book was that the characters, although being very intelligent and good at what they were doing, still made costly mistakes when trying to identify the &quot;andromeda strain&quot;. I liked the ending to this book, where many books leave you hanging or wanting a better resolution, I did not feel that way about this one. I would reccomend this book to anyone interested in the scientific or medical fields and anyone that likes science fiction."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"What a great book! This is not a book for the simple-minded. Crichton's writing is so educated. I believe this is Chrichton's best book. I would recomend this to any lover of science fiction."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"The Andromeda Strain is a great science fiction book. It will leave your heart pounding every second that you read. I don't really like reading books, but this one was just too hard to resist.

Given the excellent plot, detailed characters, and the general &quot;feel&quot; of the whole book, any weaknesses should be disregarded.This is, I understand, Crichton's first book. I thought it would be best to begin with his first, so I'm afraid I can't compare it to his other work. I'm sure he has refined his style a bit; this much is obvious from his growing popularity over the years.Though I can't collate this work with his others, I can contrast it with general sci-fi. In comparison to most of Bradbury's work (for example), Crichton's early work is a little more down to earth, more believable. I'm not at all discrediting Bradbury, I'm just pointing out the differences I saw. The occurences in this novel seem all too real. The operations, scientific procedures, etc. are incredibly genuine. The way the characters interact coincide with the direct descrpitions Crichton gives them. The plot and the timing are so tightly woven, I found myself wondering how he ever came up with any of it.I once read that Crichton attempted the book because someone had mentioned that upper-atmosphere organisms had never been used by writers to create a science fiction story. He set out to do it, and the results are chilling.This is a distinct departure from the &quot;little green men&quot; stories. Crichton's idea is that perhaps the first extraterrestrial beings we encounter will be in the form of microoganisms. This is an entirely different spin on sci-fi, and I think anyone in need of a good brain-picking should check it out.The flaws I found were few. Maybe he could have let up some on the foreshadowing, because I was totally able to predict the ending. Sometimes the scientific &quot;stuff&quot; gets a little heavy and slows the story down. All the little charts and computer read-outs kind of disrupted the flow of the story, but I guess he was going for authenticity.All in all, it was a great read. It's a fast-paced book with an original plot, and I'm certain that most sci-fi readers can appreciate it."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Like the first featured reviewer (at the time of my writing this) I also wish my biology teacher made things this interesting! Crichton's ability to predict the future is quite amazing as well. It's been exactly 33 years after the first hardcover edition came out, and it still could seem very up to date and &quot;modern&quot; by many peoples' standards. I think anyone could enjoy this book. I remember at around the same time I was reading this book, practically half my english class was reading it too. The other half was reading &quot;The Hot Zone&quot;, which is based on the same idea of microorganisms killing off humans. The battle between humans and disease has raged on for a long time, and this book perfectly captures that in a very smart and interesting way. Highly recommended, but like the other reviewers have said, don't expect a thriller or even a page turner."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Michael Crichton really knows how to subliminally teach science to people.

Although the story was written thirty years ago, It still holds true to what could happen today using equipment that most of us are familiar to, thanks to high school biology. If you are looking for a fast paced, on the edge of your seat thriller, don't expect to get it here. The Andromeda strain is more of a psychological thriller, right down to computer printouts, and the bibliography to the end, leaving you in a state of mind of &quot;wow, this could really happen.&quot; Chriton masterfully executes even the small aspects of the story.

I was actually interested for most of the book and the parts when I nearly fell asleep, only rested my eyes for the action that was to come later. Typically, I dislike books that can be easily dated, but in this case, the obvious 60's/70's feel of the book (you could practically smell the bell-bottoms) helped, rather then hindered this novel. Rather then try to hide the time period it was written in, Crichton brilliantly writes this novel, as if telling about an actual event. The little diagrams that he sticks in of the computer printouts and the maps, while doesn't further the story line, does give the novel, a decidedly realistic feel.This \\"true story\\" novel unfolds over four days, documenting a top-secret government team, called Project Wildfire. It starts out with the discovery of the death of an entire small town, with the notable exception of two people. The Project Wildfire team (consisting of only four members and assistants), race to find the cause and cure, documenting the course of this viral threat from outer space. Once you get used to the techno-babble, which Crichton filled the book with, the story is engaging and the excitement builds as time runs short and no apparent cure can be found.Contrary to the proper way things should be done, I'm going to do this backwards and start with the ending (because it bothered me so). I won't ruin it for you, but know that he totally copped out at the end. However, I will say that I was incredibly disappointed that Crichton used the expected \\"deactivated the bomb with seconds to spare\\" device. The action, up to that point was understated and tense with the scientists mental race against the virus, but the use of the bomb device, changed the story from one of understated subtly, to a crass pandering to the masses. The tension and excitement is already there, this was completely unnecessary to the plot.Not surprising, there were no character developments; all of the characters were just static and flat, virtually undistinguishable between each other. Important details about these characters aren't revealed early on in the story, but just sentences, before certain character quirks were needed (such as one scientist's epilepsy...the moment it was revealed, it was obvious that this would start a chain of events). This rather shoddy unfolding of the details quickly became tedious, and made otherwise unexpected, predictable and trite.However, I do have to compliment Crichton on his technical details. I think I learned more about chemistry and biology then I ever did from college, however he quickly glossed over some basic facts (that was needed for the reader to come to the same conclusion that he did) with big long words. Also, he has a horribly heavy hand in the foreshadowing of events (the best example of this heavy handedness was in his book Disclosure). This seems to be a classic Crichton trait, as are the incredibly tedious flashbacks (they are totally pointless, and he flashes back to the same scene, from 20 different angels...and is NOT necessary for the continuous flow of the story).All in all, it was enjoyable reading for a long flight back from Dallas, but I was disappointed in that it was also a very typical Michael Crichton book. One of his better ones, but still typical..."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I don't tend to read popular fiction, but Andromeda Strain is the basis for any sort of biological, viral or bacterial plot gone haywire. Since I focus my reading on sci-fi, I thought it only natural to eventually read the classic, according to some people.I've read Congo before I didn't like it for the reason that the science, while cutting edge at the time, was too far ahead of time to be applicable to the time period. Communication lasers and satellite uplinks in 1979 was just too out of place. Likewise, AndromedaStrain has science which is clearly out of applicable practice for 1969... and as a sci-fi reader, the science is an important part to the plot. The science doesn't match the time period so it all has the feeling of being temporally misplaced. If Crichton wanted to include all this fancy technology, then he could have just placed the plot in the future... not so hard.If this was an attempt to solidify himself as a hard sci-fi author back in 1969 then he did made some snafus along the way. Just in 1968 there was 2001: Space Odyssey by Arthur C. Clarke as well as Neutron Star by Larry Niven. Crichton a lot of competition in that era and he took a different approach: he didn't define his characters nor did he provide any sort of guess work. I found the book to be predictable and dry. The 5-day unfolding plot about the extraterrestrial agent felt like a step-by-step instructional manual rather than a disaster diary (of which War Day [1984] takes the cake). The science is full of analogies, which miffs the reader who actually partly understands the science behind the technology. The book reads as if it is for the mass public, who have little grasp of science and are keen to read a popular novel. I'm not one of those people. I'll pass on the next Crichton novel recommended to me and I'll stick to my sci-fi which is obscure in the mass public.Perhaps it was groundbreaking for its day, but since then the idea has been infinitely refined in many ways, including technologically."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Those who have read Crichton works, especially the later ones, know of his excellent talent of combing scientific approaches with pure fiction, writing \\"Worst-Case-Science\\" Stories based on actual fact.The book \\"The Andromeda Strain\\" is one of his early works, and one can read that. Though he manages to \\"hook\\" the reader on the story several times, getting him interested in the plot and story line, he just as often \\"unhooks\\" them and starts talking \\"tech\\" for a couple of pages, before trying to \\"catch the fish\\" once more. Over the years he got much better with this interesting approach. Yes, one can learn some scientific facts from this book, but those are not as brilliantly integrated as those in his later works.Interesting however is, reading this book in 2006 and having beend written 40 Years age, the difference of technology back then and how it actually has developed in contrast to how Crichton back then THOUGHT it might develop.All in all it is worth reading it,if you have some leisure time for trivial writing."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"The Andromeda Strain by Michael Crichton is a thrilling sci-fi novel that will keep readers on the edge of their seats. The story is told in third person, which makes it fascinating, as the reader learns important facts that even the main characters do not know. The novel begins with the discovery of a satellite that has crashed in Piedmont, Arizona. After being illegally opened by the townspeople, the satellite releases the organism known as Andromeda. Shockingly, the powerful organism kills all but two of the town's inhabitants. Now, five brave scientists have taken it upon themselves to study Andromeda, hoping to find a way to stop or cure it. Working in a secret government laboratory in Nevada are Jeremy Stone, Peter Leavitt, Charles Barton, Christian Kirke and Mark Hall.Once I started reading this book, I could not put it down. It made me think that this really could happen. A satellite that recovers an alien organism, as simple as a disease, could cause unthinkable chaos. The Andromeda Strain is a very suspenseful book that will catch even the most alert readers off guard with its continuous surprises and twists in the plot.I would recommend this book to teenage readers and adults. It has some strong language and intense moments that would be unsuitable for young readers. If you want a terrific sci-fi novel that will \\"blow you away,\\" then get reading The Andromeda Strain."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Not sure of what I wanted to read one weekend, I plucked this from the shelf since I couldn't decide between the three or four other books that were next in my queue.Some 48 hours later, I was done with it. Lots of medical jargon and plenty of charts, yet very quick reading. How a book manages to both be light reading and bogged down with terms better left to bio experts, I don't know. But this manages it.Oh. And it was an enjoyable read, too.I had never read anything by Michael Crichton before and found this to be a real page-turner in every way. It read very fast despite Crichton's always obvious desire to show you the science behind his story. Good premise - a bacteria scooped out of the upper atmosphere kills a small town of 48 people in Arizona, prompting a (top secret) government panic before the bacteria spreads - that works really well (though it suffers from a poor, too-easy ending). Enjoyable enough so that I might finally go ahead and read Jurassic Park (or Timeline, which I own but have never read), because Crichton shows that he's very, very capable of piling on the tension and keeping those pages turning.If you haven't read Crichton before, seems like this is as good a place to start as any."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"The Andromeda StrainBy: Michael Crichton3 out of 5 StarsThe Andromeda Strain starts out by having a called Piedmont dieing. Everyone in the town died. An organization monitoring Piedmont wants to find out what happened so they go to a secret government base called Wildfire. They start doing tests to see if they can find out what happened in Piedmont. They return to Piedmont and they find a man and a baby who is still alive. They use the baby and the man to find out why the Andromeda Strain didn't affect them.In this book I liked the beginning. It was fast paced and a lot of things happening.I didn't like how the book was full of science terms. It made the book a bit hard to understand. The more you read the book the less action occurs. It was hard to determine whether this was a Sci-Fi or a mystery.I think someone who took science in as there major in college would like this book. It would probably make a lot more sense to them."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"In order to read this book you either have to understand lots of science or be able to let things slide over your head, and accept them without understanding. This a story about a little town in Arizona called Piedmont. A satellite has fallen to the ground and it has brought a deadly organism to the town. A team called Wildfire is sent to collect samples and study them. Throughout this book, Wildfire is trying to find what the organism is composed of, and how to cure it or destroy it. This book is a really good one for science buffs and anyone that enjoys an interesting story. I don't suggest this book to anyone who doesn't like science or the study of life. I enjoyed this book a lot, but I enjoy a story more when it's about one person's conflicts in his life instead of a story with a bunch of people all with the same conflict. So make sure you know what kind of book you like because if you start this one and think it's terrible, you'll have to finish it anyways because you just have to know what happens."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"a problem is the absence of common sense. There is a happy ending because the virus or whatever it was, mutated into something benign. But as my father pointed out a long time ago, so what if one of many many individuals of a certain species of virus mutates into something nicer? It does nothing to lessen the virulence of the vast majority of that species. If the original virulent strain burned itself out by killing all its hosts and then was successfully quarantined, that would make a sensible almost happy ending.If you want good \\"hard\\" science fiction with a human element, try early Heinlein instead.(pre 1963)"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"After reading all of the other reviews made by other high school students on this book, I had to step in and say something.The Andromeda Strain is an awesome and completely believable work by one of my favorite authors, Michael Crichton. Science fiction like this takes place nowhere else in the literary world... or, at least, in my school's library.The only thing that I can think which would throw off younger readers is the intense descriptions of all the scientific elements of the work. I was lucky; my Biology teacher was awesome, and, towards the end of taking his course, when I first read this, everything was clear and precise and I actually had half an idea what was happening.So... as I said. I love this book.But don't expect to get the full impact of it unless you have a bit of a background in science."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Given that most life forms on earth are of the single-celled variety, it is likely that our first contact with extraterrestrial life would also be simple bacteria or spores. When a space probe crashes in the desert near a small town, the crew sent to retrieve it finds only 2 survivors seemingly with nothing in common and a mystery as to the fate of the townspeople. An expert team is assembled to study the probe and discover the cause for such quick and unusual deaths. What they discover and some mistakes lead to an exciting ending.While it may have sounded somewhat far-fetched when it was written in the early 70's, scientists today routinely take precautions to avoid such contamination. A good example is the recent destruction of a space probe into Jupiter to avoid the chance of it crashing on one of the moons and possibly contaminating it with any hitchhiking Earth bacteria. This story is written as though it were an actual event and the details, along with an analysis of the errors made along the way, having been pieced together in retrospect. The idea is certainly plausible and the story was interesting to read. Michael Crichton's medical and scientific knowledge lend and amazing air of credibility.I enjoyed reading it very much - certainly much more than watching the hokey movie based on the book."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"This book was written around 1969, when astronauts were first landing on the moon. There was a serious concern about the possibility, however slight, that there were micro-organisms on the moon that might return to Earth and cause an epidemic. This concern led to the quarantine of returning astronauts (and the rocks they collected) from the first few missions that landed. This ended when the fears proved unfounded. (There is an interesting side note. The second moon landing recovered several pieces of an unmanned probe that had landed several years earlier. It was found that bacteria in the probe had survived the launch, the landing on the moon, and several years on the airless surface of the moon with temperature swings of hundreds of degrees.)This book plays off of this idea of &quot;bad stuff from space causes problems on Earth.&quot; There are more than 300 other reviews, so I'll mostly leave the plot alone here. What I liked about it was the sense it gave of scientific investigation of an important topic on a short time scale. Trying to &quot;beat the clock,&quot; the scientists have to come up with and discard theories for how the unfamiliar organism works with unaccustomed speed, which (as you might imagine) stresses them out. In parallel with other Crichton books, the action takes place over about a week, with simple errors and accidents costing valuable time. The book is newly relevant with the possibility of &quot;designer&quot; biological agents from labs in rouge nations (or from terrorists) playing the role of the alien infectious agent in the book."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"A satellite that orbits the Earth to collect particles and organisms for study goes off course and crashes near a small town in Arizona. The satellite recovery team discovers streets full of bodies and their base loses contact with them. The Wildfire team of scientists is activated to study and hopefully stop the spread of this disaster. They recover the satellite and two surprising survivors from the town and head to the secure, sterile laboratory located beneath the Nevada desert.Will they find the organism that killed the town of Piedmont? Can they recover from their mistakes and a lack of information? How did the two very different survivors (a baby and a sick, old man) stay alive? Will the Wildfire team prevent a final catastrophe as their sterile environment is compromised? The scientists are racing against the clock to find the answers.The Andromeda Strain is Michael Crichton's first novel. Written in 1969, the technology is a little dated -- what was cutting-edge is now fairly commonplace. However, the plot is still relevant in this age of biological and chemical weapons. It was fresh and exciting when it was first released, but it may feel a bit clich&eacute;d now, if only because many authors have followed in Crichton's successful, groundbreaking footsteps.The urgency of the scientists is plain and the twists of action that occur outside the laboratory should add to the tension, but the documentary-style narrative leads to a somewhat dry and distant feel to the book. Heavy in scientific details, the science is clearly the star of the show - overshadowing the characters."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"A real Crichton classic. I would reccomend it to anyone and everyone, although it's age level should really be suited for 13+. You don't have to be a science lover to enjoy this sci-fi thriller, you can skim over the science talk if you have to. If seeing the DVD/Video discourages you from reading this, boy are you wrong. This book is so much better, more interesting. Let me take you to a small secluded town in Arizona...In a town of very few people, all but two instantly die. Those two, an elderly man and a baby, are vital clues in helping the team assigned to Andromeda save the world (Not the 'Save the World' you think). This team of scientists are equipped with the latest technology (well, back in '69). Join them in this journey through havoc, fear, and relief as you experience Andromeda one-on-one.Be careful - right when you want to put the book down, BAM! That's Michael Crichton all over. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"I found \\"The Andromeda Strain\\" to be the best sci-fi book I have ever read, and a nice break in the sense that I actually understood it. Most sci-fi books that deal with anything actually scientific or medical were written by doctors and scientists, for doctors and scientists. If you try to read those books, you end up lost by the third page.But \\"The Andromeda Strain\\" is different.It picks up from the first chapter, and it's an uphill climb all the way until the climax at the end, which involves the threat of contaminating the entire US, and maybe even the world. The characters stand out at you, and you really come to care about them.There's Dr. Jeremy Stone, a seasoned scientist of only 36 years but who has invalueable experience. He's sort of the unofficial leader of the whole project while at Wildfire, the secret underground labratory where they attempt to isolate the Andromeda Strain. Then there's Dr. Charles Burton, a bumbling but crucial scientist who plays the final piece in the cause for the climatic ending. There's also Dr. Mark Hall, a young and cocky doctor who is the team's leading doctor, and who is the only one who can stop the automatic self-destruct feature of the Wildfire labratory. He's also the one to care for the two survivors of the epidemic, a cranky old man and a crying baby. Last but not least, there's Dr. Peter Leavitt, a patient and intelligent scientist who is Dr. Stone's main man and the person to propose ideas as to how the organism may have originated, and how it might attack the body. It also turns out that he has a secret, that he hides from his colleagues because it would ruin his scientific career. But his disease becomes known to everyone at the end. (HINT: he can't let himself look at blinking lights.)The plot is fast and fascinating, and it will keep you attention from start to finish. I highly recommend Micheal Crichton's \\"The Andromeda Stain.\\""},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Michael Crichton's work often may be formulaic, but in the Andromeda Strain, he takes full advantage of a standard sci-fi formula to create a gripping, frightening tale of biological disaster.The premise: a crashed space probe releases the Andromeda Strain, an alien bacteria that coagulates human blood. The scientists dispatched to study the bacteria in an underground biocontainment facility soon find themselves in a struggle of science vs. nature and eventually discover the Andromeda Strain's weakness in a very H.G. Wells-esque realization.Overall, the book is well done and enjoyable despite its reliance on formula for its plot, and though slightly dated, the tale is still compelling today."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"&quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot; is an exciting, realistic novel that chronicles the discovery and study of an imported-from-space pathogen. Four scientists and a team of technicians working in a top-secret government facility created specifically for such an emergency must isolate, characterize, and neutralize the Andromeda Strain before it infects, and quickly kills, millions.Crichton brings the full force of his research abilities and scientific knowledge to bear on this book, explaining the scientific aspects of the story without detracting from the faced-paced action. He draws readers into the story within the first few pages, and constructs a plausible and page-turning mystery.The book has two flaws. The first is that Crichton's narrative voice waxes a bit preachily on the subject of human fallibility; this is at times irritating but usually short-lived. The second flaw is more important: the ending, which arrives at least a hundred pages too soon. Throughout the novel, the narration touts the impending consquences of the scientists' mistakes - consequences that are given only twenty pages of discussion at the book's end. Crichton doesn't even stop to wrap up the loose ends of his plot, leaving the reader with half a dozen unanswered questions and an unconvincing, uncompelling denouement. Such an interesting premise in the hands of such an entertaining writer deserve a fuller treatment. However, while the front-heaviness of the book is a serious literary flaw, 260 of the book's 290 pages are exciting, controversial, and engaging - good light reading even if the ending fails to deliver."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Two men in a car, in the middle of an arizona town, with dead bodies everywhere the eye can see.

The ending. The ending is really lame. It is over in one paragraph, and you think that it can't be it, but it is.

What this satelite had was a new organism that was very deadly. It killed the entire town of 48 people except for the alcoholic and the baby. Four scientists are notified after the satelite was recovered to study the new organism. Many experiments were conducted on Level V of the government building. Everything had to be isolated or else the scientists would be killed. The organism was named Andromeda Strain. In order to keep things in Piedmont contained, a 7-12(or an atomic bomb dropped) was issued. The plane incenerated before it got to its site from Andromeda.

The latter is what interested the government was most interested in. One probe crashes into a small Arizona town, and mysteriously everyone dies. A group of scientists is assigned to identify what killed them, how it worked, and how to get rid of it, from inside a secret compound in the middle of the desert.This is an excellent book that deserves two readings to get the full effect. Crichton is an excellent writer, and this book, the first that he published under his own name, proves that. He is always on top of the game. It makes you want to read more of his books. The rest of his books are also great. I give this book five stars."},{"Title":"The Andromeda Strain","review":"Michael Crichton's first, and wildly successful, novel to be published under his own name is a terrifying tale of an alien microbe, one that is toxic to earth residents, getting loose in northern Arizona. In what would become a trademark storytelling style, Crichton describes the fictional events as actual occurrences, so the novel reads like non-fiction reportage. Undoubtedly a few were suckered in by the realistic mimicry (ala the infamous Orson Welles War of the Worlds radio broadcast). This faux realism keeps the novel pulsating with energy even today, some thirty years after its original publication, helping retain its narrative edge.

The Andromeda Strain is similar to other science fiction works by Michael Crichton. The story is written with a lot of detail and scientific vocabulary. What I like best about this book was its realistic plot. The problem has been previously proposed and I'm sure discussed by many in the scientific world. Also Crichton used fantastic imagery and great descritption of the setting and background of main characters. &quot;Merrick was a rebellious, unorthodox scientist whose reputation for clear thinking was not enhanced by his recent divorce or the presence of the handsome he brought with him to the symposium&quot;.

The book also takes into account the reducing barriers in English usage in various parts of the world such as the USA. Such a catholic and broadminded dictionary makes it useable by people from all over the world.The other useful features of the dictionary include the detailed etymologies, the pronunciation guide, idiomatic turns of speech and the literary words from around 300 to 400 years ago. It also has quotations from Latin, Greek and other modern languages; musical terms, signs and symbols; the Greek and Russian alphabets; Roman numerals; conversion tables and mathematical symbols, among other useful features.The comprehensive nature of dictionary makes it weighty and this makes it not very portable especially if you are travelling.

I didn't like these negaitive traits and I wanted to make some serious changes. What this program, along with other Robbins material has done, is to help me where I am not able to produce the desired results in my life I want. And by applying the techniques with focus and work, I have been able to overcome my shortfalls and move forward logatithmicly in my life. To compare my life now to ten years ago, I can not even begin to tell you of how much greater my life has improved.In ten years I've gone from:Being hopelessly single to happily married to my best friend and the love of my life;Worked on having a successful marriage;Have two wonderful daughters my wife and I have adopted;Being in a lousy low paying job to owning my own successful business;Built a custom home from scratch;Became a local chapter president of a very prestigious organization comprised of my peers;Became chairman for a local well-known charity;Lost 20 pounds and have stayed in somewhat decent shapeAttained a Masters Degree.And I am on my way to:Becoming independently wealthy;Owning a vacation home;Getting my private pilot's license;Owning my own plane;Starting another business.and others...And the conduit for having all of this is through the Lord God Almighty and having investing my time in what God and Tony Robbins has to teach. Others may choose to nay-say. I just want to put in my yea-say's. Take it from a previous die-hard skeptic, Tony Robbins' programs can have had a profound and positive impact on your life if you CHOOSE to open up and give what he has to teach a try. There are no Samantha Stevens' nose-twitches, magic wands, or genie's in a bottle. There's a lot of hard work that goes with Robbins' curriculm.Now, to the previous reviewer from the great State of New Jersey... If your desired goal is to become the best Tony Robbins critic and basher, CONGRATULATIONS! You've succeeded in setting and accomplishing your goals...WITH PASSION! (See Matt, I told you this stuff works!) ;-)"},{"Title":"Lessons in Mastery","review":"Anthony Robbins talks about different topics on these audio CD's. Some of these include decision making (a big one with him), using metaphors in our life, living in our technologically-advancing world, and knowing what we want. These are just a few of thing concepts and topics he talks about. I like many things that Tony Robbins writes because he gives us the key to any of the technical stuff that he uses--that we have to take the effort and do it! He constantly talks about not just listening to the tape, and this is important to hear. In these CD's, he discusses his role as a coach, and that is what he is. Not just someone who gives the information, but also reminds us that we have to do something with it.As for the techniques, I have not been able to take advantage of all of them yet. I think the beauty of it is that I think one of his strategies is to give people many different ways of reaching their goals, becoming happy, and improving their lives and people can choose which ones they like and might fit in with their personality and style.I recommend this to you if you are willing to do some work in improving yourself. If you just want to listen to the CD's and say, &quot;that's nice&quot; it probably won't work for you."},{"Title":"Lessons in Mastery","review":"I play these cds when I do housework to keep my mind occupied. It's amazing to me how listening to them can change my attitude and my day completely. Tony can, in about 5 minutes, take me from lonely, depressed, tired, and unmotivated to energized, happy, grateful, solution-oriented, and completely motivated. I am actually on Amazon now to buy some other Tony Robbins product.Also, to that person that says the cds are worthless because they contain too much &quot;common sense,&quot; I say that if you are ever a person who feels ungrateful, overwhelmed, or depressed, then you probably need reminders of these &quot;common sense&quot; principles once in a while."},{"Title":"Lessons in Mastery","review":"If you are set in your ways and are stubborn than any lesson will be difficult and perhaps impossible. I have listened to the comments stating that Anthony Robbins is merely more than a professor of common sense, and that in part is true. We may listen to these discs and read these books and say to ourselves, &quot;Duh, that's simple.&quot; This simple realization made, common sense is something we all have but rarely tap into. We often dispel common sense for a more complicated answer to our troubles. It is often simple, subtle changes to our lives that can make lasting improvement.While Robbins may seem to perpetuate the same principles, as a reader of his material I can say that each new piece offers new value to the reader. I would say that this is not a regurgitation of previous material but a consolidation of many great works of Robbins.The index and topics are well organized helpful and well laid out. The CD's make a great filler for a long road trip and are only cerebral enough to engage those interested in change. Robbin's subtle yet substantial presence may be worthless to the skeptics and those who are not genuinely interested in change.I give this a 5 star rating for value and quality."},{"Title":"Lessons in Mastery","review":"This audio tape program by Anthony Robbins is excellent. Some of the information is familiar...some is off his popular Power Talk series, but hey, sometimes we need to be reminded. However, there is also new information that you won't find on other Robbins programs.With Lessons in Mastery, you will learn how to:* Experience true happiness* Harness yoour decision-making power* Anticipate and prepare for major life changes* Commit yourself to daily improvement* Replace dormant resources with new assets that will improvethe quality of your life.* Empower yourself to take the right moves at the right timeThis program is 4 tapes and 6 hours of power packed information that will make a difference in your life."},{"Title":"Lessons in Mastery","review":"I think Tony Robbins is the best speaker I ever heard. If you want to change your life for the better than buy these cds. I don't see him as a motivator I think he's more of a coach because he strongly recommends you take action to get results. I also recommend Live with Passion!"},{"Title":"Lessons in Mastery","review":"I borrowed the audio set from the library and listened to each CD 3-6 times! When the time was up, I knew that I had to buy it! In the short about of time it has positively affected my life. It was so moving and powerful. I have listened to many audio books and Anthony Robbins's voice is the most inspiring!"},{"Title":"Lessons in Mastery","review":"Put this on your mp3 player and listen to it everywhere you go."},{"Title":"Lessons in Mastery","review":"He has way with words, no doubt. Tony Robbins has some heavy duty charisma. No doubt. It even shows in his book. I think he is an alien with some powers or something. You read his book and it motivates you to think you can take on the world. Problem is, that doesn't last long once you go back out into it. Another book I would like to recommend, one that I love, is called, The Little Guide To Happiness. Don't leave home without it."},{"Title":"Lessons in Mastery","review":"This is a great audio introduction to Tony Robbins. You have to listen and to experience his Live events to really get the most out of his information. Tony Robbins is the top communicator of this era. Study what he says and how he says carefully. Repeat after his words and model his tone.Tony Robbins shows us the principles to gain an edge in life in this powerful program that covers the topics of power, results, relationships, energy, emotions, financial freedom, and the purpose of life.I recommend listening to this program and Get the Edge. If you want more, sign up for his live seminars as your next step. Make sure you are getting the results you want by applying the strategies in your life. Don't become an information junkie who just buys things without doing anything to change your life."},{"Title":"Lessons in Mastery","review":"I think, this is one of the best Anthony Robbins' audio series. I really like listening to the different mastery techniques that Anthony Robbins teaches.I know some of the stuff he teaches are already on his other audio series, but it is good sometimes to be reminded of what you already know. It is good to listen the wisdom and knowledge that are shared in the CDs several times because we tend to forget what we learn the first time.When you drive a lot to go to work or a business trip, this audio series will be a great one for you to listen to. It will inspire and energize you as Anthony Robbins will teachers different level of mastery skills to bring you to a different level of thinking.Just like what Earl Nightingale said \\"We become what we think about.\\" This audio series will be a great investment to give to your mind."},{"Title":"Lessons in Mastery","review":"This is a very motivating and helpful set of CDs. Tony Robbins puts things into perspective and outlines step by step how to take his advice and make it work. He explains how to change negative thoughts to positive ones and how changing your focus helps to create a new reality. I listen to the CD's in my car on the way to work and by the time I get there I have more of a positive attitude and a better perspective, I would definately purchase more products from Tony and I hope to be able to go to one of his seminars."},{"Title":"Lessons in Mastery","review":"Me and my husband listen to this in our cars as we drove to work daily until we finished it! This is the first CD book I have listened to 3 times and passed on to others! It is absolutely inspiring, life changing if you incorporate the teachings into your daily life. Its not about doing some drastic workbook. Its about reflecting everyday for a few minutes as you drive to work or anyother time of day on ~\\"CANI\\" ~ stands for Constant And Never-ending Improvement. The concept of CANI, improved my married, my career, my friends, my family, EVERYTHING.CANI.....

The product came in excellent condiction. Will keep using the matierial forever.

Of course doens't stop there, it goes beyond common sense as it gives interesting tools to praticly use to keep track on your goals and even maybe wake you up if you needed some fresh new starts!And listening to him is really refreshing as well, it's fun."},{"Title":"Lessons in Mastery","review":"I am certified with Anthony Robbins company as a life coach, so I am biased in that he is a personal hero of mine. However, when I saw this program I wondered how much content would be here for the price.Rest assured, it is 6 jam packed CDs. This is one of the least expensive and most comprehensive CD courses he has. For those who have looked at Personal Power and The Edge, this is costs less.Understand that any subject Robbins discusses can be covered for many CDs because he is discussing how humans work. So what he talks about here he goes into much more detail in his other programs or live events.But the bottom line, you get several hours for less than $30 so it is a great start."},{"Title":"Lessons in Mastery","review":"Anthony Robbins is among the very best in not only the self help section, but in all audio books. Some of them offer good advice but put you to sleep,; some are entertaining but offer nothing in terms of real value when it comes to good advice that will help you in any way. Anthony (Tony) Robbins, on the other hand offers great advice in a way that most people (from teenagers to presidents and ceo's) find very entertaining and fun. A very rare person indeed. What more could you ask for?? Lessons in Mastery is another must have set, and among his very best. If you don't have it get it! You won't be sorry, and when you're done with it you'll realize that you would have paid 5 times the price and still got a great deal."},{"Title":"Lessons in Mastery","review":"This is a great series if you haven't heard it. Great and quick response time."},{"Title":"Lessons in Mastery","review":"Right up front, I haven't listened to this set yet. I'm just purchasing it. But I have read and listened to everything else that Tony has done, and I felt compelled to respond to some of these reviews.Tony is the first to say everything he teaches he learned from someone else. He did a lot of reading when he was younger, and he learned a lot. Because of that, he has a lot to offer, both in terms of bringing the ideas together, and in bringing a new perspective to them. Part of his philosophy is finding the right people to model, and this is just an example of practicing what he preaches.Tony is also focused on getting you to change. If you don't want to change, you might not be interested. But don't count that against his ideas or presentation. I've read and listened to many of the motivational speakers, and Tony is the best IMO. If you hear him, you WILL be motivated. And you will understand his ideas. And if you don't apply them, it's because you didn't, not because they don't work, because they do.Tony focuses on breaking down the barriers to change, and on figuring out what you want and need. He doesn't focus on why you are the way you are, or at least not very much. This is a far more effective approach than many take. Sure, it would help to know why we adopted the bad habits and disempowering beliefs that we hold onto, but changing them will in the end have nothing to do with understanding them. It will simply be on the day we decide to change, we will change. Yes, you will have to the face the demon and decide that it's OK for change to be less painful and difficult than living the way you have been for years and years. But this is a tremendously freeing concept, if you think about it. I don't have to change the past to change my future. That is Tony's message, always has been and always will be. Because it's the right message, and he knows it.Many here have pointed out he only espouses common sense ideas. True. But that has nothing to do with whether we live by them or not. A few that say this are truly self-motivated and don't need the help Tony offers. That's great for them. But most of us are stuck somewhere on the road between what we want and where we've been all of our lives, and all of the roads we take end up going back, not forward. If that's not true for you, then you should be writing books on why that is, because anyone who's successful in this should tell others how they did it.That's what Tony does. In very down to earth and approachable ways.Aside from the motivational side of it where Tony shines above any others I've listened to, there are the wealth of ideas he brings together in one place. If you like the underlying details, then read Awaken the Giant Within. It is a far more detailed treatment of the motivational ideas he presents in the tapes and CDs. I have to be honest that I still struggle to take hold of change in my life, just like everyone else. So while I have made changes based on Powertalk (the earlier program I already own), I have learned a lot from ATGW. And what I have learned has helped me to make significant changes in my life, albeit over a much longer timeframe than he espouses you take in the motivational programs. Tony brings together a wealth of ideas that make a lot of sense, and are the result of a lot of learning and thinking on his part. For the price of a paperback book and a tape or CD program, you can learn from the investment he made and I guarantee that you will take away far more from the time you invest than the small investment in money will get you in any other way you might choose to spend it.So, if you aren't intersted, you aren't interested - in which case you don't need or want help in making your life better. But if you are, you can't go wrong with Tony Robbins. There are scores of ideas he will present in this audio program and in ATGW or his other books. Just one of those ideas can change your life in a measurable and meaningful way. What else have you done in the last year of your life that you can say that about? If you take a chance and buy this program, you won't regret it.No, I don't work for Tony, never have. I just believe in what he has to say, because everything I have learned from him and actually applied to my life has made my life better. And what I haven't applied is my own fault, not his. I can say I believe if I took to heart and did everything that Tony teaches, it would absolutely and completely change my life for the better. We aren't all ready for that level of change, obviously myself included. But you might be. And even if you aren't, you will make smaller changes that are worth the investment."},{"Title":"Lessons in Mastery","review":"I was very impressed. Well worth the purchase."},{"Title":"Lessons in Mastery","review":"I haven't opened the box yet, but was surprised that Amazon would allow this seller to apparently continue selling audio CD's while claiming they are DVD's (video).They are indeed audio CD's as it clearly says on the sides and back of the box (not shown on the front of the box which is pictured in the listing).I suppose for 6 hours worth of Tony Robbins it's still a good value (MSRP on the back lists $39.95 in USA), but that's not the point.DO NOT CALL THEM DVD's when they are NOT... Amazon needs to clamp down on this and it should not be tolerated!"},{"Title":"Lessons in Mastery","review":"The information that I got from the cd's was great.

I think its a follow up to his other longer programs. Being as there is only one other review and its a positive one, I felt it was my duty to step in and let the public how crappy this set really is. I mean, how many programs does he need to come out with? Its like everyone is the one to change your life. Its all the same repeitive stuff. Not only is the sound quality poor, but the cds lack content as well. Just a lot of personal stories, seminar plugs, etc. I still can't beleive morons fall for this stuff. Get it through your head the guy's a phony."},{"Title":"Lessons in Mastery","review":"I actually went through this one again. Maybe I did miss something. Nope. It's still garbage. Tony markets people common sense. His 'ideas' are ones you probably knew when you were 12 years old. Im not saying the advice is bad, but it's common sense. You don't need to listen to Tony to produce results. Most of these 'success/motivation' programs are for the weak. I don't need someone else telling me what to do or how to live my life."},{"Title":"TRADITIONAL UKRAINIAN COOKERY","review":"My two sisters and I each received our copies (1987 - 15th edition) for Christmas 1988. This book is a constant reference for me any time I have \\"people to cook for\\" or am in charge of a holiday dinner. Having met some folks who have immigrated in recent decades, this cookbook also serves as something of a time capsule / cultural snapshot from back when Ukrainian cooking had not been so affected by Soviet \\"Russification.\\"I hope it comes back into print soon so that current and future young cooks will have access to it years after our own copies are full of the spatters and spots and smudges of normal love filled cookery. If I had to buy this book at current used prices -- I would be just another among the thousands of North Americans of Ukrainian descent who do *NOT* have their own copy. Rationalizing $21.95 (list price) for my own personal copy of a book other family members already own is no trouble at all. Rationalizing hundreds of dollars? I'ld make friends with some Uke who owns one of the 80,000 copies *already* out there. What's better than good food and new friends?"},{"Title":"TRADITIONAL UKRAINIAN COOKERY","review":"This is the cookbook that my mother had and I had gotten a new one to replace it. This is the \\"secret\\" recipe for perogies that she use to make and I make to this day. Its a classic and I am ordering one for my daughter for her to have. It has great detail on the traditions and what dishes to serve at the holidays, which was a blessing, for my parents passed away when I was young and it helped us plan the holidays. Great book, and yes, well worth the money!"},{"Title":"TRADITIONAL UKRAINIAN COOKERY","review":"This cookbook was first published in 1957, so it's a wonderful piece of history as well as an excellent collection of recipes and cultural notes. The recipes range from easy to more complex, with clear instructions and many variations on simple themes (several recipes for possible holubtsi stuffings, for example).I first enjoyed Ukrainian food while visiting Winnipeg several years ago and bought this, my first cookbook, not too long after. I was able to recreate much-loved dishes using this book, with almost no cooking experience at all and without spending a lot of money, since Ukrainian food relies on simple ingredients that are brilliantly prepared. I highly recommend this cookbook for anyone who would like to learn to cook this unpretentious, delicious fare."},{"Title":"TRADITIONAL UKRAINIAN COOKERY","review":"The first of its kind in Canada, Traditional Ukrainian Cookery preserves for posterity the Ukrainian way of cooking. Based largely on a number of selected recipes from various Ukrainian cookbooks published in Western Ukraine before the Second World War, several recipes have been contributed by a representative group of Ukrainian-Canadian homemakers. With over 80,000 copies sold, Traditional Ukrainian Cookery saw its eighteenth reprinting in 1995.As author and culinary artist Stechishin states in her Introduction: \\"the style of this book departs somewhat from the standard way of writing a cookbook. Along with the old-world recipes brought up-to-date, there is a brief portrayal of a way of life of the Ukrainian people, giving a chronicle of customs, traditions and ceremonies.\\" Might I add, that I've referred to my copy of Traditional Ukrainian Cookery many times over the decades precisely to peruse those extremely helpful references; and, yes, I've also presented the book as a gift--for it's sure to be utilized, appreciated, and handed down through the generations as a treasured heirloom.In addition to recipes featured specifically for Christmas, New Year, Yordan, and Easter, are those explicitly included as a cuisine cornucopia of recipes for sundry delicious, daily consumption: appetizers, soups, soup accompaniments, meat, poultry and game, fish, stuffings, sauces, eggs and cheese, griddle cakes, starchy foods (lokshyna, varenyky [pyrohy], holubtsi, and kasha), vegetables, salads, salad dressings, desserts, dessert sauces, breads and bread pastries, tort fillings and icings, confections, preserves and pickles. Also included are: common food equivalents and translating foreign measurements. This cookery is a virtual encyclopedia of gastronomy and culinary arts.A graduate in home economics from the University of Saskatchewan, Savella Stechishin worked as a home economist for women's services of the university and lectured to women's groups in the field of foods.In addition to studying, she was also the Dean of Women at the Petro Mohyla Institute, where she organized evening courses in cooking, homemaking, Ukrainian culture and cuisine, and public speaking for young women. Later, she taught in public schools and lectured in Ukrainian Language and in the Department of Women's Services at the University of Saskatchewan, as well as ran an outreach programs for Ukrainian immigrants. Moreover, she lectured throughout North America and in Western Ukraine (Polish Galicia) prior to its annexation by the Soviet Union in 1939.As a Ukrainian born in Ukraine, Savella Stechishin, n&eacute;e Wawryniuk, made significant contributions toward the recognition and preservation of the richness and beauty of Ukrainian traditions and handicrafts in Canada. In addition to being awarded many honors, Ms. Stechishin was appointed to the Order of Canada in 1989, was a recipient of the Saskatchewan Order of Merit in 1998, and has been described as \\"an ethnocultural social maternal feminist.\\"She helped establish the Ukrainian Women's Association of Canada in 1926, which she headed for many years, and the Ukrainian Museum of Canada in 1936.Author of two books in Ukrainian: Art Treasures of Ukrainian Embroidery (1950) and a 50th anniversary book for the Saskatoon branch of the Ukrainian Women's Association (1975), she assisted her husband, Julian Stechishin, with a Ukrainian Grammar (1951), and completed his History of Ukrainian Settlement in Canada (1971) after his death--an English translation was published in 1992. Stechishin's most prominent book in the English language was this book, Traditional Ukrainian Cookery (1957), which saw its eighteenth reprinting in 1995 and has sold 80,000 copies.Besides being an author, she was an editor of the women's page for over 25 years and columnist for the Winnipeg-based Ukrainian Voice weekly (Ukrayins'kyy Holos); contributor to other Ukrainian women's publications in North America and in Western Ukraine; and, writer for the Canadian Consumer Information Service during the Second World War--these are just a few of the myriad hats that this remarkable Ukrainian-Canadian leader and giant wore prominently.Five stars plus for what I consider to be a virtual encyclopedia of gastronomy and culinary arts sure to be referenced regularly, presenting recipes sure to satiate everyone's appetite, whether for Ukrainian home-cooked fare or whether for those special Ukrainian holidays and festive occasions.Addendum: Readers, you're invited to visit each of my reviews--most of them have photos (with notes) that I took in Ukraine (over 600)--you'll learn lots about Ukraine and Ukrainians.

It's very expensive new and out ofptint so the used one is great."},{"Title":"TRADITIONAL UKRAINIAN COOKERY","review":"Being of Ukrainian culture, I have eaten Ukrainian food all my life. My mother and my Grandmother all cooked from recipes out of their heads like they learned from their Mothers. My father also was an expert Bread maker, and he seldom used any food referral book although from time to time, he did consult the Stechishin book for more complex desserts.Stechishin's Book was one of only two books that my Mother ever had and used in her kitchen for cooking and baking ...and she was a Journeyman Chef. Even though Ukrainian cuisine is regionally diverse, Stechishin does an admirable job at providing different types of cuisine, like, for example, Borsch and Strudel. Eight pages of Strudel recipes and fillings are alone worth the price of the this book. I have never tasted better strudel recipes tham my Mother made by following recipes from this book...and I have travelled all over Germany and Austria....well maybe, I am a little biased, but.... In addition to her own recipes, Stechishin compiles, and acknowledges, recipes that came from Ukrainian women from all across Canada.Stechishin first wrote this book in 1957 [I have Edition 6 - 1973], long before it was fashionable to write cookbooks. Firstly, she came from a long tradition of Ukrainian women who were excellent cooks, and secondly, she trained as a Home Economist at the University of Saskatchewan. As such, she was especially well-grounded in being able to produce this permanent history of traditional Ukrainian food.My edition is 496 pages long and contains hundreds of \\"homey\\" recipes, sub-classified into 29 Sections [from special Dinners to appetisers to soups to all major meat types to sauces to breads to a plathora of desserts, and more] that people actually cooked for their families using basic foods out of their gardens and ingredients generally available to most people at the time. In addition to the recipes, she weaves in Ukrainian social and cultural traditions that, sadly, are being forgotten today.I highly recommend this book, not only to persons of Ukrainian descent but for anyone who is interested in preparing superb-tasting dishes that are healthy to eat.."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"As a mystery author with my debut novel in its initial release, I have been quite amazed by the frequent crossover of readers, writers, and titles between the mystery and romance genres. Linda Howard's OPEN SEASON is the perfect example of such a crossover title. Ms. Howard's lead, Daisy Minor is a librarian who wants a more daring life. She decides on the changes she wants, and she goes out and makes them. She even meets the man of her dreams, yet by then she is in severe personal danger. A killer would like her for the next victim. Linda Howard's OPEN SEASON is the perfect romantic mystery, mysterious romance, mystery-romance, romance-mystery, or whatever you want to call it."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Open Season was another good one from Linda Howard. I loved Daisy and everything that made her aghast. This book certainly had more heart than All the Queen's Men, but didn't quite match the steamy story of Mr. Perfect. Still, all in all, the best book I have read all summer. Hated for it to end. And speaking of the end, what was with the last two pages?? Strange final ending."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I love Linda since last year's MR. PERFECT and could not wait for OPEN SEASON. Once I started OS, I couldn't stop. Linda is absolutely amazing at what she does, and she makes many reader happy at that.Can't wait for her next one."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"This was my first Linda Howard book and unfortunately, it may be my last. Open Season was very shallow in its story line. Characters jump into situations without much thought and the book seems to have been written on a whim."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"This is not one of my favorites. It was a ok read with not alot of action and the ending I wish could have had a little more excitment.The interaction between Jack and Daisy seemed alittle forced with her telling him he's not her type and there was no chemistry between them, something was missing there for me. The way Howard described Jack - graying hair, thick neck, body builder, is that supposed to be attractive? I felt Howard wrote more about the puppys antics than she cared to write about the romance or action. The book was worth reading if you have nothing else to read or important to do. It just could have been so much better. Not up to Howards usual books."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I used to be such a huge Linda Howard fan, but I have been so disappointed in her last couple of books. This book was not the worst book I have read this year - but it came very close. I loved the book All the Queen's Men so much and also enjoyed Kill and Tell. It just doesn't seem possible that this book was written by the same author. I just couldn't get into it, it was that boring. I found the character of Daisy to be totally unbelievable - nobody is that dowdy and uptight. Women do not just wake up on their thirty-fourth birthday and decide Gee, maybe I shouldn't live with my mother anymore. They don't wake up at thirty-four and suddenly decide Gee, I think I might want to have sex. She talks about all the magazine articles she reads, but never realized until her thirty-fourth birthday that her clothes were ugly, or that she should try some makeup. Come on! I couldn't help but notice that after her makeover - she looked exactly like Linda Howard on the back cover (right down to the anklet). Jack is O.K. - I just don't believe for a second that he finds Daisy so captivating. As for suspense - forget it, there is none. Linda Howard is just trying too hard to write comedy when she should stick to the stuff she turned out so perfectly in 'Queen's Men'. This book just isn't worth your time (or money). I didn't like Mr. Perfect either, but this one was worse. Unless she starts writing her characters and situations as well as she has in the past, I can't recommend them to anyone."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"This book was not horrible. It was not great. It wasn't a complete waste of time. I've been reading a lot of this author lately. This is not her best effort. I agree with some of the reviews that suggest that the suspense is lacking. I think the characters are not too interesting. I found some of the secondary characters (Aunt Jo, Sykes) to be more interesting than the main characters. The puppy was a distraction. I kept worrying about him and couldn't focus on the story. The ending seemed to be a non sequitor. There was no chemistry between the main characters. Maybe the author was under a deadline. LH is capable of better. I can forgive her for having an off day (or year), I suppose. I got the book from the library, so I'm not feeling robbed. Overall, worth reading if you're bored, but not worth buying."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Story was a drag, in fact i skipped pages that didn't contain Diasy and Jack together which i rarely do.Jack was really great. Daisy was sometimes too uptight but at least she did realise she was wrong in behaving like everyone's School teacher.Jack did manage to loosen her a bit which she really needed. Jack was so sweet with her worthless dog.Except for jack i don't think this romance has got anything good to offer.Some readers wrote that this book was almost as good as 'Mr. Perfect' but i disagree because i have read that one and loved it. this was was no where near it. But still you could read this one just for the sake of the romance which is funny and sweet."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"This is a perfect book for the beach. Not too taxing on the brain, and probably forgotten after the last page is turned. A fair mystery, a nice, if predictable, romance.Daisy Minor wants to shake up her life and meet a man. So she dyes her hair, buys a new wardrobe, and Voila she is a new woman. Unfortunately she witnessess a crime, and becomes the target of 'the bad guys'. Relying on the help of the Chief of Police, who just happens to be single and good looking, Daisy helps solve a crime and falls in love (guess who with?)Not as laugh out loud funny as Mr. Perfect, but I still enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Of all the Linda Howard books I've read. This is one of my top three."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. It's a quick read, the characters are interesting and funny. There's not a whole lot of suspense here, it's more of a romantic story. A great book for a day at the beach!"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"\\"Dying To Please\\" was the first book of Linda Howard that I had read. I bonded with her writing style and decided to pick another...\\"Open Season.\\" Althought the chartacter \\"Daisy\\" is unrealisticly naive for her age ... I still enjoyed this book. There is just enough suspense to keep you turning the page. It is a little off the wall that one day Daisy is a \\"virginal wallflower\\" and with a zap of magic she suddenly transpires into a beautiful woman with all this ... experience ... she must have been reading up on the subject while she worked in the library. Well, it is what it is ... \\"true fiction.\\" I went with the flow of the book and found myself smiling at the end. Finally, the book is light hearted as well as a quick read. I'm looking forward to reading some of her other books."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Although each of Linda Howard's books contain the same basic elements, her talented presentation keeps them from becoming boring. We have flawed but dimensional characters, witty repartee, and powerful sex. Yes, ma'am, I am entertained.\\"Open Season\\" tells the story of dowdy librarian Daisy Minor, who wakes up one morning to the knowledge her dream of being married and having a family is not going to happen unless she takes immediate and drastic action to change. She embarks on her personal improvement plan at the same time she is brought into reluctant (at first) contact with the new chief of police who delights in giving her a hard time.The \\"new\\" Daisy becomes a catalyst for danger and romance as she goes on the hunt for a suitable mate. Her plans are seemingly thwarted by the repeated appearances of Jack Russo, Chief of Police, and the growing realization that Daisy has seen something she shouldn't have and is in danger.While \\"Open Season\\" is not as rewarding a read as \\"Mr. Perfect\\", it was still a cut above the mainstream. The unexpected \\"union\\" in the very last pages was a pleasant surprise. Shhh, don't want to spoil the secret."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Linda Howard, at her worst, is better than most other single title romance authors. While OPEN SEASON is not one of her best, it was entertaining and contained several wonderful characters, including the gay? antiques dealer. The humor was top-notch, but the sex scenes suffered in comparison to those in KILL AND TELL and other Howard books. I found the last few scenes, involving two peripheral characters, disturbing and totally alien to anything I have read in other Howard novels. In spite of that,this is a great rainy day read-funny,charming and not too scary."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"After reading Open Season I read all of the previously written reviews. Only one review alluded to what I felt was a very important part of this book--the detailed information dispensed regarding &quot;date rape,&quot; the drugs utilized in this type of crime, and the common sense safeguards women can and should utilize to protect themselves. I agree with the majority of reviewers that Open Season is basically a &quot;fluff&quot; romance, not on a par with Mr. Perfect or some of Ms. Howard's previous novels; however, it is worth reading partly because it is a &quot;light&quot; read but more importantly for its educational material."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Quick lighthearted entertaining read. Witty dialogue made up for the less than suspenseful plot and lack of character development. I hope Ms Howard's next offering would be better...like After the Night and Mr Perfect. I wouldn't mind waiting a little longer for it. Nevertheless, I'm still a fan....she has yet to do a Sandra Brown on me."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I must say, this book was thoroughly enjoyable. Linda Howard has this incredible ability to make the reader understand the ins and outs of her characters. You find yourself knowing how they will act, and loving every moment of the brief period of their lives that you get to enjoy.There were many times when I found my self laughing out loud, and one time that I laughed so hard my wife just had to know what had me in stitches. When you start reading about the \\"Party Pack\\", don't eat or drink. If you have anything in your mouth at all, you'll make a mess. Trust me on this one.If you like books with romance, killers, and lots of laughs, don't pass this one up. It's rare that I add an author to my \\"must read\\" list, but Linda Howard is now on it, and this book is at the top."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I just don't believe that I read a two star book from Linda. After I read Mr. Perfect, After the Night and Dream Man, and I saw this book in the book store I almost had a fight with another costumer for the last one (just kidding), and when I started to read it I just couldn't believe what I was reading, if this book were written by other person I just would't finish it, but I said: give it a try and then I was in the middle of the book so I finished it.The main story of the book is hard enough to remember, this book goes out of story so many times, for example: it has a full chapter when Daisy went to make her hair and make up, so what with that, who cares! Another is when her new pet destroyed her new house so what! And many more.When I saw this book I thought that I would laugh a lot and have a nice time, so please Linda, make another book to take me this bad flavor of my mouth."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Has Linda Howard taken a sabbatical and someone else written this book using her name? This book is mediocre at best. It certainly is not up to her standards. This stands as a hastily written, rapidly produced product for profit and certainly not worth reading. Linda, if this is what you are going to start turning out, count me as a former reader."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"After reading the last several Linda Howard novels, I can only assume is that she was kidnapped about five years ago, and her publisher decided it was cheaper to hire a ghost writer than to pay the ransom the kidnappers demanded. All I can say is: Pay the ransom! The real Linda Howard wrote such wonderful romances for Silhouette and several early on for Pocket, but this &quot;ghost&quot; can't begin to match her emotional depth, plotting or characterization. Get her back before her reputation is ruined past redemption!"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"If you're a fan of Linda Howard's (and if you're not, you should be), you will find &quot;Open Season&quot; to be a satisfying read even though it doesn't offer anything new. If fact, I thought this book was VERY similar to Howard's &quot;Dream Man&quot; without the psychic elements. But hey, &quot;Dream Man&quot; was a great book, so a repeat isn't completely uncalled for.The core story is about a small-town librarian, Daisy Minor, who wakes up on her 34th birthday and realizes that her hair is boring, her clothes are boring, her job is boring, she's boring. Not to mention lonely. Daisy decides that if she doesn't want to spend her life alone, she needs to get busy, and the fastest way to get results is to do a complete make-over into a &quot;party&quot; girl. Sure enough, there is a beautiful, sexy woman under all her frowsiness. Before she even starts her transformation, she butts heads with the new police chief, Jack Russo, an apparent fish-out-of-water Yankee in this sleepy southern berg. He's big, he's intimidating, he's rude. He's also very sexy . As Daisy ventures out to strut her new stuff at the local bars, he becomes concerned that she's way too naive to realize when she's attracted the wrong kind of attention. Daisy wants him to get out of her way so she can continue her man hunt. Dane - I mean Jack - decides that he needs to stick close for her own protection. Then he decides that he just needs to stick close. Somewhere along the way there's a crime to solve and Daisy becomes a target for bad guys. Which means, of course, that Daisy and Jack need to have some hot love scenes.Howard's unique style and humor are evident throughout the book. Daisy's schemes to get the word out that she's available are hysterical, and you will never see colored condoms in the same light. Both of the lead characters are appealing, but Daisy is the more finely drafted of the two. Her ernest attempts to be a party girl are charming. I particularly appreciated that she isn't one of those ninny romantic heroines who has to go do something foolish that she's been warned not to do in order to prove how independent and spirited she is. In fact, when Jack thinks she's left a safe haven he's found for her, she lets him have it. Her response: &quot;I'm safe here; why would I leave? That's what always happens in movies; either the woman or the kid disobeys instructions and does exactly what they've been told not to do, thereby putting both themselves and everyone else in danger. I've always thought that if they were that stupid, then let them die before they have a chance to breed.&quot; Hallelujah!The mystery plot is good, but the romance is better. The secondary characters are well-developed, especially the bad guys. All in all, this is a quick read, but a good one."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Once I found out Open Season is about a librarian who has a make over and moves out of her mother's house I couldn't wait to read it since I'm a librarian.Linda Howard delivers another winner with Open Season, a cute, sexy, satisfying read that has more comedy than suspense. I guffawed at several passages (especially the scene involving a box of condoms). Linda Howard is one of the few romance writers who is an &quot;auto-buy&quot; for me. She never disappoints....Although, I'm rating this title four stars, because, I don't think Open Season ranks among the best she's written. I would have liked a little more characterization of the main characters. But Open Season's still darn good. I very much enjoy reading Ms. Howard's analysis and observations of nonverbal language that is part of her narrative voice. Running into those small gems are one of the joys of being a reader.Linda Howard is much like Susan Elizabeth Phillips on an ordinary day: reliably good. Always deft and always satisfying.The small town setting of Hillsboro, Alabama are reminiscent of Linda Howard's earlier After the Night and Jennifer Crusie's hilarious Tell Me Lies and The Cinderella Deal. Other Linda Howard titles that top my list are: Son of the Morning, the Mackenzie series, Diamond Bay, the short stories Lake of Dreams and Overload."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"As a Linda Howard fan, I can honestly say that Open Season was a dissapointment. After waiting about a year since Mr. Perfect, I was expecting more. Howard, in my opinion, is too talented to be writing &quot;cute&quot; or &quot;adorable&quot; romance/suspense novels with a formula feeling. Daisy Minor is a nice character, but a little too naive. Her transformation was well described, but her single/nightclub adventures were too quick. (I found her mother and aunt to be more interesting.) The romance between Daisy and Jack was too rushed. One minute Daisy is irritated by him and less than 18 hours later they're in bed. The sex scenes are lukewarm. It felt like a pseudo-replay of Mr Perfect, except Jaine was funnier and more feisty. The crime/criminals in the book were also very thin. It was an interesting idea but there did not seem to be time for detail. If the book was 400-500 pages, there might have been room to make the story interesting.The best feature in the story was the Party Pak. Linda Howard has written plenty of great books with a suspenseful story, likable heroines, enough sexual tension to give you a backache, and hot love scenes. That's what her fans expect, but I don't think she delivered this time."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"If you're looking for one of those heart-throbbing romances, typical of the old Linda Howard, you're going to be disappointed with this. Unfortunately, Ms. Howard has been slowly but surely drifting away from her gripping love stories and venturing more toward--well, simply telling a story. Yes, there's a romance here, but it's just a small part of the whole, instead of BEING the whole. I was left in awe when I read Mackenzie's Mountain, truly half in love with Zane when I finished Mackenzie's Pleasure, wistful by the power and strength of Kell Sabin from Diamond Bay . . . . Open Season, however, insomuch as the story was enjoyable, left me with little more than a closed book when I was finished reading. Sorry, Ms. Howard. In fact, I'm one of your biggest fans. But I miss the love in your love stories."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I've probably read every book Linda Howard has written. She's always been one of those authors that I automatically buy without reading about the plot or checking other people's opinion. This was a &quot;cute&quot; story, but it lacked in-depth character development and history. I think she spent the majority of her time trying to write funny or clever passages. I wasn't expecting 336 pages of cute. Actually, the first passage in the book (which is about a Mexican girl of 17 crossing the border illegally to start a new life in the US) is more of what I was expecting. I cared more about this girl than I did about the main character. That's not to say that cute and funny make for a bad book - but it's less than I expect from Linda Howard. If you look at some of her better books (Mackenzie's Mountain, Sara's Child, All the Queen's Men) you will find a lot more to the main characters than you will find in the characters in this book. This book is worth borrowing from someone or waiting for the paperback. It is not worth the hardback price."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I am an avid fan of Linda Howard and haunted the bookstore for this one to come out. When did she start to write such cutie stuff? Mr. Perfect was a four, but was a little too sweet for me. This book has gone over the sweet meter. I long for characters such as those in previous books. The characters in this book are too ordinary. Ms. Howard has also cut down on her love scenes and that was a disappointment. The two in the book are good, but the mystery plot overpowers the other storylines. The last two pages strike off on a weird tangent connecting two very peripheral characters. ...It didn't tie into the story at all. ..."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I read this book in just a few hours. It's an easy, flowing book. The story starts out just great, the humor is wonderful, I find that very refreshing in a romantic suspense. But somewhere along the way, this book falls flat. It does not have the depth of Ms. Howard's other works. It can not be compaired to DREAM MAN or KILL AND TELL to pick just two examples of her talent. She has written so many wonderful books that as a I reader I expect great things from her at all times. That may be expecting too much from any author, but for a 310 page, [price] book, I want more. This book would have been presented better as a \\"series\\" book. The suspense is minimal and the romance is not all that interesting. I enjoyed the transformation of Daisy and the humor most of all.I'm not saying readers won't enjoy this story, frankly I would have purchased it no matter what because I collect this author's work, I just don't feel it's as good as most of her other titles.I always look forward to a book by Ms. Howard and will continue to read her work, I just hope the next story gives me the kind of read I have come to expect from this author."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"For those of us who are sick of picking up romance novels that all follow the same basic plot, &quot;Open Season&quot; is a welcome change. Linda Howard combines a compelling love story with witty character dialogue, and a plot that is full of supense and intrigue. It is wonderful to read a book that offers an enjoyable romance and a mystery in which it is easy to become totally engrossed. This a wonderful read for romance and mystery readers alike. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Over the last five or so books, Linda Howard has become a master at combining suspense, romance, and humor. &quot;Open Season&quot; is no exception; it combines many of the elements that made &quot;Mr. Perfect&quot; such a wonderful book.The heroine of &quot;Open Season,&quot; Daisy Minor, is a tremendously charming character. Her honesty, forthrightness, sense of humor, and family reliance all make her an unusually strong and well-developed character. The reluctant hero, Jack, has the bone-deep strength combined with incredibly dangerous effectiveness that always make Linda Howard's heroes so incredibly appealing.The suspense/mystery in &quot;Open Season&quot; is well-done, as usual with Howard. It's interesting enough to provide tension but not so overwhelming as to detract from the characterization and relationship development.As in Howard's previous effort, &quot;Mr. Perfect,&quot; we get quite a few laugh-out loud moments, which add tremendously to the appeal.My only criticism is that the relationship between Jack and Daisy somehow lacks the intensity normally found in Howard's books. The relationship lacks both the &quot;immediate sensing of mate&quot; basis typical to Howard books and the &quot;gradual deepening of romance&quot; generally found in romance novels.&quot;Open Season&quot; is a tremendous demonstration of all that has made Howard a leader in the field of romantic suspense. The wonderful humor, great suspense, and intense sexuality combine to make this another masterful effort by Howard. It was a lot of fun to read!"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"After 34 years of being a good girl, virginal librarian Daisy decides to shuck that image and makes herself over as a siren on a quest to find a man. Daisy is so refreshing and naive that you cannot help but love her.Fresh from Chicago, new police chief Jack Russo is on a stake out checking into murder cases involving illegal immigrants in the next town over, and stumbles across Daisy in a total dive bar strutting her stuff. At first, he wants to protect her. Then he just wants her.I love the way that they initially meet, when he bucks propriety by trying to come to the employee entrance of the library, and ever a stickler for her job duties, Daisy sticks to her guns. Their interactions throughout the book are comical - you can tell it was a fun book to write.In her hilarious quest to notify the local male population that she's available, she does what any normal gal would do - buy an economy sized box of multi-colored (and flavored) condoms at the local drug store. Of course, Jack thwarts those attempts, by standing behind her in line and requesting that she hurry along, only to have no items to purchase. This results in town rumor mill assuming it's he who she's bedding down (thus no longer available to the local males).She manages to strike the eye of the bad guys, when she unwittingly witnesses a murder outside the club. And Jack jumps into protector mode as he investigates the crime.While there may not be all that much suspense in the book, particularly since the killer and ringleader are revealed early on, the comical adventures of the lusty librarian and chief are a treat."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I just read this book for the fifth time and it's still as good as the first time. I'm thinking to myself, \\"If only men were like this everybody would either stay married or be out rushing to get married\\". I'm just kidding. This author is my all time favorite, but I'm a pretty demanding reader so I don't like her to slack up even a little. She really delivered in this book. She didn't describe the lead male character like she use to in her earlier books but that's okay because the story line and the female character are what drives this book anyway. 99.9% of the time this author delivers. Enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"In this slow-starting mystery/romance, 34-year-old Daisy Minor is the stereotypical small-town librarian. She is plain, boring, and lives with both her aunt and mother. But Daisy wants more for herself; she wants marriage, a family, and a slightly more exciting life. But she also realizes that none of the former happen to 30+, mousy brown-haired librarians with stodgy wardrobes. Suddenly--with thoughts of a makeover--Daisy enlists the help and support of both of the women in her life...who in turn reach out to the gay and fashion-conscious Todd Lawrence. Soon, a gorgeous, blonde-haired bombshell is born. Daisy feels ready to take on the world to find the man of her dreams...and begins by hitting the hottest bar in her Alabama one-horse town solo. But how can she possibly \\"spread\\" the word of her availability? At every turn the horribly rude Chief Jack Russo seemed to lurk...thwarting her plans, each and every time. He even turns up at Daisy's nightclub debut....and that was the night that the tide turned. He kissed her, and she realized soon thereafter that perhaps she need not \\"spread\\" the word after all.All seems fine until one evening when the mayor himself calls Chief Russo to run a check on a license plate...and offers a bogus explanation for the request. The plates in question belongs to none other than Daisy herself, and the Chief smells a rat. Surveillance and the mayor's wife soon reveal a much darker plot than even the Chief had ever imagined. And it soon becomes quite clear that the only loose end remaining is Daisy herself.......With a serviceable plot and steamy sex scenes, if readers can move beyond the slow beginning and the sometimes unbelievably dated verbage of the main character, they are in for a treat. Does this tale send one on a hunt for all Linda Howard novels? Not really...but it does make one curious.DYB"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I've been slowly working my way through the Linda Howard oeuvre, and while I generally love her alpha male heros and frank sexual scenes, she is pretty formulaic in most of her stories. (Luckily, she has a very readable writing style that pulls you along.) But this is the first (only) time when Howard actually demonstrates that she has a sense of humor, and a good one at that! The heroine's transformation and her tentative romance are full of funny pitfalls and awkward moments, and I was charmed the entire way.Most reviews are right on about the suspense aspect being extraneous and half-hearted. It's criminal that this book was marketed that way, and readers/reviewers are justified in feeling victimized by the bait-n-switch. But if you know this ahead of time, and enjoy the romance aspect, the book actually proves to be one of Howard's better romances and Daisy one of her best heroines."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"You don't see many librarians in romantic fiction. I've read my fair share and I have seen teachers, psychologists, real estate agents, spies, singers, actresses, reporters, tour guides, bodyguards, and waitresses as romantic interests, but I can't think of one with a librarian as the love interest. So, hooray for Daisy Minor! Sure, she starts out looking like a stereotype, but from the beginning, even while she's living with her mom, you can see she has an independent streak and knows her job. I LOVED that the way she met Jack Russo was when he came to the library to get his password to the virtual library. Howard paid attention to what librarians do now, and her librarian didn't have a card-catalog loving, computer hating character, which is the popular image of librarians. And when Daisy Minor decides to cut loose she really lets go. She let her hair down well before she took her clothes off, so I didn't feel like the scene was one of those sterotypical \\"he wakens her to a new way of life\\" moments. Daisy is a problem solver, too. Even when Jack's paranoia takes over, Daisy makes her own decisions. She's not free of stereotypes: she \\"would never park in the fire lane\\" but she's got personality, and I enjoyed her as a character.Daisy aside, I have to give this four stars because there was a major mishap in logic. If the mayor was involved in criminal trade, why did he import a Chicago cop for his police chief? I know, suspend your disbelief, but this is really stretching it for me.Beyond that, there seemed to be some loose ends. Why the weird ending with Jennifer and Sykes, who are both minor characters and barely know each other? What was Todd involved in that he refused to talk about? Were these supposed to be setups for other books?This was my first Linda Howard book. I will definitely look at some of her other books, now that I've been introduced to her by a fine librarian."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I highly recommend reading this one.

I usually never read books like this but for some reason I just bought it, and I am very glad I did!

Very fun and interesting!"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Another successful endeavor for Linda Howard. Snappy dialog, endearing characters, and a good dose of humor.The story revolves around a stereotypical \\"old maid\\" librarian who wakes up on the morning of her 34th birthday and decides she needs to make some changes in her life (i.e.: a husband and children). She enlists the help of a friend and remakes herself into a blonde bombshell, then hits the nightclub scene in search of a potential mate. Everything is working like a charm until she starts a few barroom fights, witnesses a murder, and comes under the heavy-handed protection of the new Chief of Police. From then on the sparks fly, bullets wiz, and the laughter is almost non-stop."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I actually read this on the plane. It was a fast read. Entertaining but not intellectually stimulating. The characters in the small town were interesting and I enjoyed following their quirky romance. The plot was lacking in intensity and there wasn't much of a mystery. Bottom line: It kept me interested enough for me to try another of her books but not interested enough to pay full price."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I am a huge fan of Linda Howard and have avidly enjoyed all her books. I have to say, while I enjoyed OPEN SEASON, it does not get the rating that ALL THE QUEEN'S MEN and MR. PERFECT got from me. It seemed to go so fast and simple. I totally enjoyed the mystery element, I find romances more intriguing if there is a lot of mystery. And, unlike other reviewers, I thought there was a good balance between in the book. However, both sides felt choppy and rushed. I actually finished the book feeling cheated. Where was the rest of it?I think I might feel a little differently if I had waited for softcover, but Howard's last few books have been so great that I rushed to buy this one. I might think twice next time and just wait for soft cover. Ah well, we win some, we lose some. This one is a draw. I will still look forward to Ms. Howard's next book!"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"What a fun read! I had a ball reading this book, and didn't put it down until I'd finished. This is the story of Daisy Minor, librarian. When she wakes up on her 34th birthday, she comes to the realization that she is boring, her life is boring, her clothes are boring, and she wants to get married and have a family. Her mother and aunt are completely supportive of her sudden change in attitude, and enlist the help of a friend to help Daisy with her makeover.Deciding to hit the clubs, Daisy stumbles into more than she ever bargained for! Fortunately, the town sheriff rescues her when she accidentally starts a barroom brawl, and from then on he is always one step behind her. This sudden attention infuriates Daisy at first, but soon she finds she is extremely attracted to the sheriff, as he is in her.Intricately woven into Daisy's story is a story of illegal immigrant smuggling. When she accidentally witnesses the murder of one of the men involved in the smuggling, she is in danger of being murdered.This is a fun romp, full of good romance, a little mystery, and a little intrigue!"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Hillsboro, Alabama is a small sleepy town with a population of nine thousand people. It is a place where everybody knows their neighbors and doors are always unlocked. Daisy Minor has lived there all her life and is viewed by the town as a straight-laced spinster, who dresses down and acts prissy. Daisy is aware of the townsfolk&#8217;s opinion of her, but on her thirty-fourth birthdays, she decides she wants a life.She moves out of the house she shared with her mother and her aunt, gets a complete make over and hits the night club scene. Even before Daisy transformed herself into a good-looking woman, she caught the attention of Jack Russo, the town&#8217;s police chief. He finds the new Daisy adorable and goes all out in his pursuit of her. When she witnesses a murder and Jack fears the murderer will come after her, he puts a wall of protection around her and her family. When they can catch the killer, Jack intends to take his relationship with Daisy to the next level.OPEN SEASON is a humorous tale of a woman who wants a family of her own and does what&#8217;s needed to gain one. The situations she finds herself in are so hilarious readers will burst out laughing at odd moments. The suspense adds depth to the relationship between the lead characters yet demonstrates that not every book Linda Howard writes has to be intense to be quite good. OPEN SEASON can be summed up in one word: adorable."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I use to be a big LH fan when she first started out with the romance novels.

I recall finding &quot;Mr Perfect&quot; enjoyable but a bit annoying, though the specifics are long gone from my menory.&quot;Open Season&quot; mixes disparate elements as it tells a crossover mystery/romance story -- *extremely* disparate elements, as the story of small-town librarian Daisy Minor's midlife crisis and consequent pursuit of romance (which is mostly played broadly for humour) contrasts strongly with the second story element, the running (by a classic &quot;above suspicion&quot; type character) of an international white-slave ring in her small Alabama hometown.The dark elements are not enough to drag the romance story down from its basic frothy aims, but certainly add an element of mild suspense. ((I mean, if we believe Linda Hamilton is going to beat the Terminator in the end, no matter how bad it looks, we have to have faith Daisy and her new beau can outsmart a bunch of crooks that only has about one competent member.))Daisy's campaign to advertise her new lifestyle -- that is, available for romance -- is Very Funny Indeed, using as it does the way in which gossip and scandal flow in a small Southern town. (Having grown up in one such in South Carolina, i can attest to the feasibility of spreading rumours merely by shopping in the right places...)The romance is one of those &quot;opposites attract, disdain-him-at-first&quot; things, but not to extremes because there is too much going on for too much of that to fit.Daisy's visits to a local C&amp;W bar/dance hall are almost too long and detailed, for that matter, but are important tot he story and i wouldn't have missed the brawl -- and how it starts -- for the world.The biggest surprise in the whole book are the last two pages, which contrast and complement the rest of the book.((I must say, i am rather startled by the relatively-graphic sex scenes in some of today's romances; thirty-three years ago, when i was in the Navy, you had to go to sleezy little stores on side streets to find books with sexual sequences as graphic))"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Linda Howard's current novel, Open Season, is the story of Daisy, a small town librarian who is a bit dowdy. On her 34th birthday she transforms herself into a man magnet and goes on the prowl for husband. Not to impressed with the prospects she meets she decides to casually date Jack, the local chief of police, in the meantime. To her dismay she falls in love with him, while he is trying to protect her from a killer, after she inadvertently witnesses a murder. In this novel, Howard has spent a great deal of time on character development. Therefore one will like the characters. However, by doing so the story lacks Howard's usual suspense element and the psychological intrigue that makes the reader sit on the edge of their seat. One has to wonder if an editor requested that the psychological aspect be toned down, or if Howard was rushed in writing. My guess would be a combination of both. Halfway through the novel I was able to figure out who the killer was, whereas when reading some of Howard's other books, such as Mr. Perfect the killer wasn't as obvious. Nonetheless, it is still a wonderful tale for true romantics."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Really enjoyable and laugh out loud funny, and it was refreshing to have a character who's so innocent and naive. However, there were a few things that didn't match up; for instance, she's supposed to be a virgin, yet there's no hesitation before jumping into bed with Jack? I don't think so. She feels attracted to Jack for two days, and suddenly they're in bed together, which just seems totally out-of-character for Daisy and too big *or at least quick* of a morality change for me to accept. Also, although I have no personal experience in this area, I believe most women feel a slight pain and bleed a little during their \\"first time,\\" which there was no mention of here. In addition, the mystery is solved almost too easily, with absolutely no feeling of threat to anyone's life, so the suspense is really lacking; Howard does a much better job balancing the romance, suspense and humor inMr. Perfect. Finally, the part at the end with Sykes and Jennifer was just totally irrelevant and confusing; there was no point to it. However, all that being said, if you take it with a grain of salt and read it as a humor novel it does the job well; I seriously laughed out loud quite often and the characters were immensely likeable and easy to relate to. Pick it up if you likedMr. Perfector if you're looking for entertainment and laughs, but don't expect thrills and chills; I recommend Howard'sMr. Perfectif you're looking for all three or if you liked this one."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"One of my pet peeves is when the small blurb on the back of the book or on the dust jacket doesn't match the actual story. Nothing is more infuriating as knowing I've mislead in order to get a book sale. Open Season definitely lost points with me because of this deceptive manipulation.The actual back of the book reads, \\"The perennial good girl, Daisy transforms herself into a party girl extraordinaire -- dancing the night away at clubs, laughing and flirting with abandon -- and she's declared open season for man-hunting. But her free-spirited fun turns to shattering danger when she witnesses something she shouldn't -- and becomes the target of a killer. Now, before she can meet the one man who can share her life, first she may need him to save it.\\" Ok, sounds like a suspense book, right? Wrong!Open Season is really a romance book with very little suspense; maybe no suspense would be a better description. The story is definitely about Daisy Minor but not about her being the target of a killer. It's about Daisy's developing into a party girl and her trolling the nightclubs for a suitable husband so she can get married and start a family. Daisy doesn't encounter the murder until over halfway through the book. As for the \\"shattering danger\\" I never did find it, even when Daisy was carted off to another town to hide until the killer was caught!The real plot depicts Daisy waking up on her birthday bored with life and realizes she needs to make some drastic changes in order to snare a husband. She seeks the help of a local antiques dealer, who is supposedly gay, to make her a new woman. He helps her change her hairstyle, her clothing and teaches her to apply make up. Viola, a new woman has emerged. **Groan!** The many of subplots involving the antiques dealer, Daisy's mother (Evelyn), Aunt Jo, and the local mayor, are never developed past mere mentioning of small unimportant details which leave the reader wondering why they are mentioned at all. Or key factors were never given which leaves the reader very confused as to the actions of these characters.Enter the hero of the story, the small town police chief, Jack Russo. He's smitten with Daisy before the makeover and falls head over hells afterwards. It's the same plot used in many romance books these days and has been referred to as a 'makeover and get the guy romance'.One of the things I found grating on my nerves time and again were the attitudes of the characters. I often wondered in what decade this had been written because it reflected ideals from the 50's: Daisy's life isn't complete without husband and children; a male antiques deal must be gay; etc., etc.There was little character evolution and we're left up to our own to decide good, bad, or mediocre. The most development came when Daisy got a puppy named Midas - the reader was given full details of everything Midas chewed, ate, or the trouble he caused. It's too bad Howard didn't give equal time to the human characters in this book.Oh, and the epilogue was a joke! I expected a lot more from Linda Howard and am really thrilled that this wasn't the first book of hers that I read, or I might not have picked up another one. Because of the attempt at being a suspense thriller, this romance book falls far short of the intended goal and is average at best. I wouldn't even recommend it because of the other great books out there, but if you've read all of them, then pick up a copy as a last resort."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I didn't really get that excited when I picked up this book this afternoon.

I would like for Ms. Howard to read some of her old love stories to capture the feeling again.Whatever happened to characters such as Zane and Joe, as well as Duncan (and the characters from Shades of Twilight, Roanna and).

It's highly likely I will read something else of hers, since I enjoyed this one."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Honestly, I feel like Open Season wasn't Linda Howards best work, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.

I personally really enjoyed the love story between the two and the building tension was well done in my opinion."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"If you are familiar with Linda Howard's books, you know what a great writer she is. This is a really cute and funny story that had me going from page one and had me laughing out loud so hard by page 108 that I had to put it down for awhile. Great characters, a fun and funny, but maybe a little predictable story line, but great reading all the way. You know after the first third of the book what will happen, but it's still a good time getting there. Who can object to a happy ending?"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Loved it. Loved the romance, suspense, characters. Great book. One thing I really liked about this book is how it was not long and drawn out. Most writers seem to over do it when it comes to a books \\"who done it\\" by having another mishap or series of events come again and again and again just when you think it should come to an end. It makes the books seem so far fetched. Not this time."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Heard OPEN SEASON by Linda Howard, a romantic thriller about a small-town librarian who decides to enliven her boring life on her 34th birthday . . . she eventually winds up as thetarget of a killer, and thought the plot might sound a bit predictable, I found myself enjoying it--and wanting to see how the story would end . . . heightening my enjoyment of story was Kate Forbes' excellent narration . . . her handling of the male voices was especially well done."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Of all Linda Howard's books that I've read so far, Open Season is the most fun and enjoyable. I've always like her writing style. Witty, fun and fearless. This title is certainly a pick-me-up when I am feeling out of sorts.The book tells about a regular girl -daisy minor-, like us having a nice steady job as a librarian, when suddenly she realizes that her life is BORING!, and going nowhere.She determined to change that.Unintentionally, while she is searching for future husband, she became an eye witness to a crime, that dragged her in.The police officer paid no attention to her at first, but soon realize that behind the plain exterior of Ms. Daisy Minor, is a character that he could really enjoy spending time with.The conversation and remarks between the two main character are lively, spiced, and not at all boring. This is the book that will make your day."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"THE PAST FEW MONTHS I STARTED READING AND HAVENT BEEN ABLE TO STOP. I LITERALLY PICK UP A BOOK AND WITHIN 2 DAYS ITS FINISHED AND THEN PICK UP ANOTHER ONE. THIS BOOK WASNT SUSPENSEFUL OR TWISTED IN ANY WAY. JUST A NICE BOOK TO READ. IT WAS NICE STEPPING AWAY FROM SOME OF THE HARSH STUFF I'VE BEEN READING. READ THIS ON A RAINING DAY."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I'm sure you've already gotten the gist of what this book is about. And I just wanted to add my two cents and say that this was a great book. It's sweet, sexy and funny w/some suspense to tie it all together. I would not hesitate to reccomend this book to anyone! :)"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"This book reads like a modern-day Cinderella story, combining mystery with healthy doses of humour and witty exchanges. Daisy Minor wakes on the morning of her 34th birthday to the realisation that she's on the verge of becoming an old maid. After being a prim and proper librarian dressed in dowdy clothes for too long, she decides it's time to find herself a husband and start a family before it's too late. So she undergoes a makeover, dresses for attention and hits the local nightclub scene.Meanwhile, there seems to be a local trade in people smuggling being undertaken by the more enterprising criminals around town. Added to that, and possibly even related to it, is a sudden spree of women becoming victims of date-rape drugs. This becomes immediately relevant to the recently bloomed Daisy.Fortunately, although much to Daisy's great chagrin, she has captured the attention of the local police chief who takes it upon himself to act as Daisy's protector. Moments of hilarity ensue as she is embarrassed by his overt advances that he delights in - and so did I just quietly. The condom scenes where particular favourites of mine.I would class this as a thriller-lite novel with strong romantic comedy overtones. It is a particularly enjoyable book to read when you just want to sit back and relax whilst taking in some light entertainment. This one fits the bill to a tee."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"As a HUGE Linda Howard Fan, I have to say I was mildly disappointed in the somewhat lackluster story. The humor was OK, but it just didn't grab you. Daisy was UNreal; let's face it - no one THAT prim &amp; proper turns into a party girl after 34 years of being a prude. Jack Russo is believable, but I'm just not convinced they're a matched set. The underlying story of the illicit sex trade is tantalizing, but not much comes of that. The character Glenn Sikes is an enigma, however, and it is hinted that LH has some plans for him...."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I have read every one of Linda Howard's books and rarely have been disappointed in anything but there's always a first time. These characters were not developed, there was very little insight into why they acted as they did, no real plot development and an ending that was just plain flat. This one is going back to the store. I do not recommend a purchase."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Daisy Minor wakes up on her thirty-fourth birthday and realizes she is going nowhere fast. She lives at home with her mother and aunt. Her job consists of being the head librarian in a southern, one-horse town. It has been so long since her last date she doesn't even want to remember it. It's now or never, do something about her life or forever be stuck in the same situation.Daisy set out with a vengeance to completely remake herself. She wants a husband and family. Somewhere, some place, there has to be a man for her. Even though Daisy is a bright girl, she can't even figure how to correctly apply basic make up or dress like a woman under sixty. Her mother comes to the rescue and set her up with Todd, a gay man who used to be on Broadway and now owns an antique store. Todd recognizes potential and completely supervises Daisy's make over from makeup, hair, clothes, to her newly rented home. He encourages Daisy to hit the nightclubs and meet men.Life would be nice if everything went accordingly to Daisy's plan. Well, whoever said life was fair was lying. Daisy manages to attract the attention of Jack Russo, chief of police. He's big, all man, and a former member of the SWAT teams in Chicago and New York. While he seems to get pleasure out of stirring up Daisy, she gets nothing but irritation. That is until the sparks ignite.I gave Open Season a four. Don't get me wrong, the book is great, but it doesn't blend the romance and mystery as well as Ms. Howard's previous novel. You will laugh and love the main characters, Daisy and Jack. I will never be able to hear the words \\"mauve\\" and \\"puce\\" without thinking of this book again. There are a lot of comical moments that set this book apart from others. However, while there is suspense and a great \\"surround and capture the bad guys\\" scene, it is almost as if the suspense is added in at the last moment or in small dosages to continue the story line. This could have been a fabulous romance or a fascinating suspense novel, putting the two together just made it a great book.My biggest gripe about this book is it only took about three hours to read. Now I have to wait another six months or year for the next book by Ms. Howard. Ms. Howard, please start writing faster. I love your books and hated waiting for the next one!"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Linda Howard used to be my all-time favorite writer. Anyone who can write &quot;MacKenzie's Mountain,&quot; as well as her other fabulous books, is a talented, talented writer. However, like many romance writers, in the past few years she has shifted to mysteries, sometimes combined with romance. This combination worked A LOT better in &quot;Mr. Perfect&quot; than it did in &quot;Open Season.&quot; In her earlier novels, the tension between the eventual lovers was fun and made me call the book store daily to find when they had arrived. I, as a romance reader, feel as if Linda Howard has abandoned her loyal fans, but maybe she's all written out in the romance genre. One of my two biggest complaints about &quot;Open Season&quot; was the total lack of tension between the two lovers. I really didn't care whether they got together. The book lacked something I can't put my finger on--a little spice (and I'm not talking about sex). It was bland. My most important complaint, though, was the final couple of pages. Not only does Linda Howard let the major criminal who imports foreign girls (all virgins, some very, very young) into sexual slavery get away with it, she even has him show up to &quot;cure&quot; the sexual trauma of the wife of his partner! And we, as the readers, are supposed to be touched by this disgusting, arrogant sleaziness! Linda: what ever could you have been thinking?"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I would recommend any book Linda Howard has written over this one. She's long been one of my favorite authors, but this was just -- dull."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"This is the 3rd Linda Howard book I've read and this was the worst yet. Daisy is unbelievable. Are we to believe that she's so boring, plain, and unsophisticated and YET SHE SLEEPS WITH JACK IN A HEARTBEAT? Wasn't she supposed to be \\"virginal?\\" (An interesting twist would have been for Jack to have walked away, saying \\"see ya later.\\") Her prim and proper attitude just got on my last nerves. And the plot....so, so predictable from the first time Jack steps into the library! I did enjoy the criminal element to the story and wish there had been more of that. I'm just tired of all of these romance-suspense-humor books where the main characters have virtually NO FLAWS. The sex is always \\"perfect\\" (can no one ever have a bad day? NOT have a fantastic orgasm? Be impotent?), their lives are perfect--no one ever has a gambling problem or money problems. I mean, how about a slice of real life? And Jack and Daisy don't even know each other, but they're getting married? And...let me not forget his irritating stalking/overprotective/sexist behavior! Oh, he just got on my last nerves. Maybe it's the genre of these books...the \\"damsel in distress\\" syndrome always having to be rescued by \\"the man of her dreams.\\" I want something more real thrown in."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I usually love Linda Howard. But, she has slowly started going what I call the &quot;Sandra Brown&quot; way and this book, like Brown's recent books, definately shortchanges her fans. Instead of continuing to write the fun, sexy, charming &quot;romances&quot; that made her (and Ms. Brown) popular, Howard has begun writing hardcover &quot;books.&quot; Howard now definately spends way, way too much time setting and describing scenes. (For instance, in this book, she spends literally a page describing her heroine's walk across a crowded bar and almost another page describing a playful puppy). This overdone prose comes at the expense of dialogue. Her books also are way too crowded with secondary characters and development of all of these characters shortchange the romance of the two main characters. (Her books are not getting any longer, after all. She is just cramming all this stuff into her books and in return, something has to go. In this book it was any development of the romance between the hero and heroine.) In short, I just did not get the &quot;feel&quot; I traditionally get from a Linda Howard romance and I truly believe that this is because she is trying too hard to be a bestselling &quot;author&quot; rather than just a romance writer who writes entertaining and fun romances for the masses."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"The story was simple and very predictable. It was easy reading and fairly entertaining but Linda Howard is capable for more. This seems like a half-hearted, half-baked and tired story that churned out just for the sake of launching a new book. The author could do more to develop the character and add more plot twists. I will feel sad that if there is no difference between Linda Howard's books and those fluffy teenage romance."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"While I did not think that this was one of Linda Howard's best books, it was still an enjoyable read. Her last several books have not been among the best that I think that she has written (excluding A Game of Chance) but I have read them and enjoyed them. This story lacked the trademark Linda Howard romance/suspense element, as have the last couple. I felt that she wrapped up this book a bit too abruptly and too neatly. I look forward to a book about Todd, his character is way too intriguing NOT to have his own story. ).As I read about Daisy's transformation, I kept glancing to the photo of Linda Howard herself on the back cover--from her newly blond, chin-length hairdo, the delicate pink on her fingernails, the fire-engine red on her toes, to the ankle braclet. Was Linda trying to make herself into Daisy, or is Daisy a part of her???? I hope that Linda Howard will continue to write, but I hope that she re-reads some of her earlier works to get a fresh grasp on the romance/suspense element that her fans have come to love, and that sadly has been missing. Keep up the writing!"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"If this had been my first LH novel, it probably would have been my last!! She must have had half a brain when she wrote this. NO dialogue, NO plot and NO suspense. Buy this book used if possible, because you will be upset if you paid full price."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"This book is &quot;classic Linda Howard&quot; to a point, but I scored it only 4 stars, because I feel the book wrapped up too neatly and quickly.Also, the lead male character was too cookie-cutter beefcake. The female lead was very nicely developed and original, but you felt (if you are a Howard fan and have read all her books) that you could interchange her male lead with any of her other males like Mr. Perfect's Sam or Mackenzie's Wolf or Joe or Chance or....If you are a Linda Howard fan you will want this book; it is a keeper. I just wish the problems hadn't been so conveniently and too-neatly wrapped up and the male lead so cookie-cutter."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Linda Howard did another fantastic job bringing the reader close with the characters. Not only did the writer have me glued to every page, she had me rolling with laughter, and grinning like a high school girl over her first crush. 34 year old Daisy Minor wants a husband and a family. The way she goes to get men to notice her has you cheering for her boldness and laughing at some of her stunts. And Jack Russo is the perfect man to push all those buttons that have you both wanting to smack him and kiss him. Their romance is a perfect blend of everything. It was so nice to read a book that had a bit of everything in it. Took me only a day to read and I never wanted it to end. Mr. Perfect was my favorite of Linda Howards, but now I just don't know. Give this one a read, you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"When I read what the book was about, I didn't think it would be up to Ms. Howard's usual writing. Was I ever wrong -- this just proves not to judge a book by its cover, in this case its dust cover. Once again Ms. Howard writes a good, steamy, romatic thriller."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Daisy Minor, 34-year old librarian in the small town of Hillsboro, Alabama, is bored with her chaste, unexciting life. She hasn&#65533;t had a date in years, and is still living with her mother and aunt. She decides that if she&#65533;s ever going to meet a man and start a family, she needs to make some major changes in her appearance and lifestyle. She starts by looking for a home to rent and finds a small house in town, although not the best neighborhood. Then she gets her hair restyled and becomes a sassy blonde, buys some alluring new outfits and goes out dancing. She accidentally sets off a brawl in the bar, and is dragged away from danger by Jack Russo, the manly, tough-talking big city cop who has become the town&#65533;s new chief of police.Daisy seems to feel nothing but irritation whenever she is near Chief Russo, but he keeps popping up when she least expects him and sparks fly whenever they&#65533;re together. He rescued her again after her second visit to the dance hall, when she witnessed some men dragging someone out to his truck. Chief Russo soon determines that Daisy is in danger because she had witnessed a murder (although she didn&#65533;t know it at the time). He whisks her to the safety of a motel, where she succumbs to the passion that has been building between them.The murderous plot involves smuggling of young girls who are sold to the sex-slave trade, and Daisy is able to help reveal the murderers by identifying the men she had seen in the dance hall parking lot. Daisy and Jack are both placed in some dangerous situations, but the ending is rather predictable. Evil murderers are foiled, girl gets boy, and lives happily ever after. The murder plot is rather contrived and not particularly interesting, but the romance is fun and provocative."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was a fast paced read. The banter between the characters was truly enjoyable. Along with fun secondary characters, and a good storyline, this is definitely a story that is worth the reader's time. I could have done without the last page and a half, which deals with nothing having to do with the main characters. It almost leaves a bad taste in your mouth after having read such a fun story. Does the author really want us to feel any compassion for such a sleaze, or even care about him in the least? Maybe I missed something. But, that's neither here nor there. The story was great fun.Also Recomended:All Julie Garwood, Amanda Quick, Gaelen Foley, Liz Carlyle. &quot;The Flame and the Flower&quot; and sequels by Woodiwiss. Nora Roberts, especially \\"Honest Illusions.\\" And new author, Lauren Bach."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"This book was a light, enjoyable read. It wasn't Linda Howard at her best, but even her worst efforts are better than the best efforts of many others. I was somewhat annoyed with Daisy's naivete, which wasn't believable at 34 years of age, but the condom scene had me roaring with laughter. If you want Linda Howard at her best, Son of the Morning is it, with After the Night, Heart of Fire, and the whole MacKenzie Mountain series close behind."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"This book was a bit different than most of Linda Howard's books. It was still basically a romance, but it was very funny (laughing out loud funny!) and didn't seem to concentrate on an extraneous plot as much as some of her other books. I loved the book and will definitely keep it and read it again. BUT, the second half of the epilogue makes you flip back through the pages and try to figure out what you missed and why this jerkwad badguy/hitman is now being portrayed as this wonderful human being who is going to help &quot;save&quot; someone from their horrible past. Give me a break! I loaned the book to a friend but told her not to bother reading the last two pages of the book."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I am an avid reader of Linda Howard's books. Each time a new book comes out, I'm online ordering or off to the nearest bookstore to purchase it. Ms. Howard has enormous writing talent, as shown with her previous books. Open Season, however, was not &quot;her usual style&quot;. I anticipated reading the book into the early hours of a weekend night. Instead, I put it down after reading 1/3 through and have yet to pick it up to finish it. There were humorous moments in the book and Daisy is quite a character. However, the book did not have a smooth flow to it and the story was not as gripping as for example, Son of the Morning, which I think is one of her very best books."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"This book started out great, the transformation of the lead character from mousy and boring to sleek and glamorous was as interesting premise as always, but towards the middle the story kind of tapered off. The romance and dialogue between the two main characters seemed both rushed and a little trite. As for the main man, he never seems to really be developed and the length of time spent on describing the dog is just too much for. The ending however, both intrigued and confused me. It was definitely two loose ends that I think could have been explained much better, but just imagine the explanation!Normally, Linda Howard is my absolute favorite author, and although I enjoyed this book, it just didn't seem up to par for her."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Linda Howard does it again, &quot;Open Season&quot; takes into this life of Daisy as she relaized she is not living her life, and if she ever wants to have a husbands and kids she need to do something quickly. The town mayor is pefectly written, we are not kept in suspence about who the bad guys are they are given to us upfront, so we can concentrate on Daisy and Jack growing relationship. Jack is a strong and sexy cop from the east(a Yankee) who does not fit Daisy plan for a husband, but Jack quickly show this fiesty librarian that he is definatly the man for her.Not one of Linda Howard best book, but she is the best at blending romance and mystery, your are never distracted from the romance as you move to mystery of the story. Very well written."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"This book was one tired little puppy (pun intended). Usually her books are very gripping. I especially like when she adds paranormal elements. Nothing like that going on here. Reminds me of Jayne Ann Krentz or Sandra Brown when they start cranking out books instead of writing stories where you care about the characters."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"One thing I can say about Linda Howard's books and I have read them all is that her characters are wonderful and smart, in this book especially the heroine was especially smart, the characters are funny and the story plot interesting which keeps you entertained from cover to cover. If you have not read this book you should and once you do you will want to read all Linda's books and believe me you will love every one of them. Jack is the macho cop who falls for Daisy the heroine, she is trying to remake herself so she can get married (she a Librarian) she does this in a very funny way, I don't want to give all the good stuff away but the part about the comdoms was great and where the hero shot the bad guy was wonderful, so folks enjoy.Rebecca"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I read this in a day! I wasn't sure about the plot - lib. lady turns bad girl but Linda sure can pull just about anything off. It's a great book when I'm laughing out loud about something I'm reading. I very much enjoyed the whole book!"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Daisy Minor, spinster librarian of Hillsboro, Alabama, awakens on her thirty-fourth birthday and decides that she needs to change her image and find a man to marry. Tired of her frumpy clothes and drab hair, she seeks the help of her friend Todd to aid in her transformation. With her newly blond hair and classically stylish clothes, Daisy takes on the nightclub scene. Jack Russo, former NYC cop and Hillsboro Chief of Police, notices Daisy at the Buffalo Club and helps her out of a tight spot. Jack and Daisy find themselves attracted to one another, but Daisy is at first reluctant to continue a relationship with Jack for fear that he isn't the relationship type.Jack finds himself in the role of protector for Daisy, as he becomes suspicious when too much attention seems to be paid to his little librarian. The reasons for his suspicions become clear when he discovers that Daisy saw something that she shouldn't have and was definitely in the wrong place at the wrong time.What a wonderful suspenseful novel! The twists and turns will keep the reader hooked, and the romance will keep the pages turning. Daisy is such a likeable heroine, the perfect combination of innocence and intelligence, and a wonderful match for hardened cop Jack Russo. Linda Howard has penned a sure-fire winner."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"This book was truly lacking in some essential Linda Howard elements that made it nothing short of boring. Regardless, I still found myself turning page after page, hoping for something but found I had absolutely no emotional investment in anything that is going on. The romance is quick and light, there are some funny moments, but the suspense, or lack thereof, is more sympathetic towards the villains.On Daisy Minor's 34th birthday, she has an epiphany. She wants the American dream; husband, children, home. The problem is she lives with her mother, is a stereotypical dowdy librarian, with frumpy clothes and has absolutely no prospects for a boyfriend because she's simply not attractive. Daisy proceeds to go through a complete makeover process, dies her hair, buys new clothes and makeup and gets her own apartment to begin her manhunt. While at a bar, Daisy unknowingly witnesses a murder and in turn becomes the hunted. Jack Russo is the chief of police in Daisy's town and he enjoys getting Daisy riled up. After her transformation, he simply can't get enough of her and they start an affair in very short order. While spending time with Daisy and learning about her friends and life, he realizes that not everyone is whom they appear to be and discovers that she is being used as bait in an investigation as well as being hunted by murderers.Simply put, this book is so out of the norm, because Daisy never has a clue that she's being used or hunted so there's absolutely no suspense tied to it. Jack is always two steps ahead of the game and Daisy is never actually in any danger. Although intelligent, she doesn't get to use her wits to escape, figure out who's out to get her or anything else that makes Linda Howard's women so brave, strong and exciting. If anything, the book is really about how Jack accidentally stumbles into a sex trade ring and stops it without so much as breaking a sweat. The transformation Daisy goes through seems so extreme, right down to dying her hair from brown to blond seems so superficial in her efforts to be attractive, that it's hard to reconcile that someone loves her for being her. If you're a Linda Howard fan like me, you'll read it because there's almost nothing left to read, but if not, skip this one."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I liked the story, but found the characters at times lacking, the story predictable, the names bazaar and well, weird. There were holes in the story where I could see a plot twist, yet there wasn't one. It felt like a really good first draft of a novel, that maybe her editor didn't have time to do a thorough read through of. This is my first Linda Howard novel - so forgive me if this is an exception to the rule about her work."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I have to admit to liking Open Season a great deal more than Mr. Perfect. Although this novel also required me to suspend disbelief to some extent, the plot contrivances weren't nearly as difficult to swallow. I did have trouble with the fact that it took Daisy 34 years to have her epiphany and finally decide that she wanted more. The entire 'make over' and new image was a bit unbelievable, since she was also able to quite easily overcome a lifetime of values and prissiness, but my enjoyment of the book allowed for overlooking some of the story's shortcomings.Often the humor in Howard's books seems forced, but I found this one truly funny. Daisy was an engaging character, despite my reservations about her sudden about-face regarding her personal life.My chief complaint about the book was its lack of suspense. Because Howard chose the device of allowing us to see the villians throughout, there were no surprises for the reader, so the story wasn't a page turner in that sense. That's due to the fact that the villians never seemed larger than life, or a true threat to Daisy. Having Sykes (one of the bad guys) walk into the police station to give up the other villians was anti-climatic in the extreme, since he had no new information to offer the reader. We already knew the identities of the other inept villians.I'm also noticing a tendency Howard is developing of including less and less plot and more and more character introspection, which I find rather tedious. I thought more of those pages could have been used to flesh out the plot. I never really bought the character of Todd and his purpose in the story, other than as a device to get Daisy into bars.I was quite puzzled with the ending of the book. I still can't figure out why Howard chose to end the story with Sykes and the mayor's wife. Because of it, the novel ended on a rather jarring note for me.If you are primarily a fan of Howard's romance stories, this book is going to meet your expectations. I did enjoy the romance between Daisy and Jack. If, however, you like more suspenseful romance books, this story is going to disappoint."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"This story is about small town gossip,adultry,relationships,crimes & other secrets. Daisy Minor is the main character of the book.She begins as the plain-Jane city librarian who is bored with her life and decides to spread her wings.

Daisy meets with more than she bargained for while out\\"painting\\" the town.She witnessed a crime in progress causing the villians to want to kill Daisey to keep her quite.All ends well.Daisy's happy & the law is happy.Great book!

It has everything to keep the reading going. Action, suspense, Romance and humor. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. This is one of the best books I have read in a long time."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"On her thirty-fourth birthday, Daisy Minor has had enough. She's tired of being boring, ready to dance, date, fall in love, and get married. Of course she has no idea how to do any of those things, but she's ready for a makeover. She won't be a good girl any more, and knows she can't be a bad girl. What she can be, though, is a party girl--and she does intend to party.Chief of police Jack Russo has noticed Daisy before, but when she turns into the blonde bombshell, he does more than notice. Especially since Daisy doesn't seem to have a clue how to behave in the dangerous world she lives in. Date rape and worse are possible even in small-town Alabama, and Daisy seems too innocent to survive. Of course taking care of Daisy is a pleasure in itself, even if she does get mad that he's getting in the way of her having a good time and finding the right man. One thing they both know, Jack can't be the right man.With a suspense subplot involving kidnapped foreign women brought to America for sexual exploitation and murder, author Linda Howard has created a delightful blend of romance and plot. Someone in their small town will stop at nothing to protect their illegal enterprise, and Daisy finds herself in the crosshairs.OPEN SEASON is a page-turning read. Jack and Daisy are believable and their romance seems human and gentle while maintaining a strong sexual attraction. I especially liked Howard's secondary characters including the slimy mayor Temple Nolan and especially the plotting criminal Glenn Sykes. With Sykes, in particular, Howard provides a fine (and difficult) balance between pure evil and a fully sympathetic character."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Let's see where do I begin, Okay we'll go for the girlie stuff,Once again, she hit, I've had enough experiences w/makeup to relate. I frankley love her shopping &quot;scenes&quot; and her characters opinion in what they have bought. Now I've noticed she emphasises on safety issues and how certain things work, she does a good job with this, anyone who has ever been exposed to Female safety issuses recognizes what she is doing, she is feeding info to her readers, Not just in this book, but in others as well, Very Smart Mrs. Howard! Now I liked the interaction between the hero &amp; heroine, but not so much between the &quot;evil dooers&quot; they bored me. Her ending had my eyebrows raised, not in shock, but in interest at her little twist. The READ tended to get stale in areas but Mrs. Howard, Always bounces back! She has interesting people with personality, in unusual circumstances. You Want a good twisty, mind-bending mystery? Go to Stephen King. You want a good predictable drama? Danielle Steele is your girl. You want good romantic suspences with fun characters, that you can relax with? Howards your writer.

When I tried to back out of the sale, this was minutes after it got sent to me, the form Amazon has said I had to tell them why I was backing out. The problem was the space for telling them would not allow me to write anything in it. After 30 minutes of fooling with it, I just quit. When I ordered the book it was late at night. I could not contact Amazon to help me with the problem. The next day would be too late.

The heroine a librarian wanted to get married and felt she was not pretty enough to attract a man in a small town so she needed a makeover and I think to much was spent on that, the hero was a cop who wanted to get out of the fast pace of big cities and remembered this small town from his childhood, when you get past the makeover the book gets interesting and the one part I did love was when the heroine stayed where she was told to stay I thought that part was great, normally the heroine rushes in where fools tend to go, this one was smart. In summary once you get past the first part or 50 or so pages the book was great, interesting and funny just like you expect Linda's books to be.Rebecca"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"This is not the type of writing I am used to from Linda Howard. The storyline was uninteresting as were the characters. A desperate attempt to keep us interested is made when a puppy is introduced into the story &amp; we have to read about his antics. Please! I agree with the reviewer from Dallas that it's hard to believe someone who wrote a book like Son of the Morning could come up with this boring waste. I'd rather Ms. Howard wait until her writer's block is gone before handing her loyal readers this kind of garbage. Sorry, but I'm really upset that I bought this book &amp; I expect much, much better."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I am a big LH fan, but this one I have mixed emotions about. I really liked the storyline and I really liked most of the characters. I really couldn't stand Daisy though! She was really annoying to me. She definitely became less annoying as she lightened up a little, but it was still there!"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Linda et al:I find the &quot;Linda Howard&quot; style of writing to be much like eating Dove Promises... you cant stop at eating just one piece! The truth be known, I am addicted! And with most (if not all) of Linda's books, you can't read her books chapter by chapter; you read the whole thing in one sitting. That is the kind of book that I could only dream of getting published myself.Unfortunately, this book (even though it is a nice vacation from the grind) seems like it was rushed to print. I put down this latest book 3 times(Which for me is not normal with any of Linda's work).On the plus or minus side I saw a few interesting things happening here: 1- Daisy seemed almost self projection to a degree (not that I know anything about the author, but I got that distinct feeling in the book... maybe the hair color?) 2- the humor (although scream out loud time if you have ever lived in a small town) seemed to be segmented only to a limited section of the book. 3-the love scenes, although mostly consistent with the previous books, seem to vary from the romance genre to a forced detail of what was going on. Even as it was &quot;detail&quot; specific, it was not true to the character development that had happened.My two cents: it's a bread and butter book.But it's really easy to be a critic when others achieve something you haven't done."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"This book is a total disappointment. The synopsis on the book jacket was more interesting than the actual book. I have read a large number of Ms. Howard's books, and for the most part enjoyed them, but this book was a total snooze. This is one book that I wanted to return to the store after I had read only 10 pages, but I kept going hoping it would get better--it didn't. The book jacket implies that there is going be a great mystery and romance, you get neither one. If you still want to read this book, wait for the paperback, save yourself some money!"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I'm sorry to write this review. I have enjoyed much of Linda Howard's writing but I just found this book too predictable and quite frankly boring. Daisy's persona just bothered me to no end. She was just too naive for me. There was no thrill of the chase with her and Jack. The romance just happened and she just happened to be the eyewitness of a crime and low and behold, her new lover is the Chief of Police coming to save the day. It just lacked substance. It was almost as if Linda Howard didn't have any idea for a story and just deceided that this one would have to do. Too predictable and lacking any luster!I'm really bummed out that I wasted my time on this one and I don't write this lightly."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Howard is a master at her craft! There is no one out there writing at the level that she is. Good for her and congrats on another great read!"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"This was an OK book - the writing is excellent but the storyline is a little weak and ends too neatly and predictably. The character development of Daisy the librarian is great but her romantic (and sexual)relationship with the police chief is not well developed. I liked the book mainly because it was well written despite problems with the story so I'll give Linda Howard another chance with another of her novels."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"While I enjoyed the romance, the sinister atmosphere and suspense was built up for nothing because the heroine was never in any real danger at all. The ending was just horrible. Why was it even necessary? Overall, the story was good but not extraordinary and you really could wait for it in paperback. I recommend reading her other novels if your new and want to read her: After the Night, Son of the Morning and her series books like MacKenzie's Mountain and MacKenzies Mission.My grade for this book would be a C+"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Linda Howard is one of my favorite authors and I eagerly look forward to her books. I was very disappointed in this book. When I finished I was left with a feeling of &quot;that's it?&quot;.The development of the characters was very quick and sketchy. The phrases were so similar to other recent books that I wondered what which Howard book was I reading.Don't waste your money on the hardback - wait for the paperback to come out if you're looking for a quick, no involvement read."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Open Season appears to be a failed attempt at a lighter romantic tone.

And, that's a compliment. What happened, Linda?"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I haven't read that many books by Linda Howard, so perhaps my standards for her writing are not as high as someone who's read everything she's written, but I enjoyed this novel more than I did Mr. Perfect (which is not to say that I didn't enjoy Mr. P. as well). I think the development of the relationship between the protagonists was better, and Howard has a lot of wicked fun with her characters. Her sly wit is a delight to read and she throws in enough mystery and suspense to keep it interesting. She does an excellent job with the secondary characters as well, and I liked that she tied up a few story lines at the end. All in all, certainly worth the time to read it."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I thought this book was great. It had lots of humor, mystery and romance in it. I really did not want to put it down. What were people thinking when they read this book. It was purely great reading. I am sure there are a lot of Daisy's out there. Women who have lived a drab life and will not change. This book should give those people the will to change their lives and come out into the limelight--Enjoy life. Way back when, in fact many years ago, I lived like this. But then I realized there was a life out there and I went for it. Gee, am I glad that I did. I have been very happy since. Forget all the other ratings you have seen here. This book is simply fantastic. You won't regret reading it. I am not sorry that I spent money for a hardbound on this one."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Lighter fare for Linda Howard. The cynical sheriff and the naive librarian. Funny, sexy, and sweet. A total beach read.Best of all--funny!! Laughed out loud in several places. Daisy is a trip. The scene when she was buying condoms!! I loved watching her come into her own in the small busy-body Southern town. I loved her puppy dog, too, and even her family. Of course, I loved Jack's protective and amusing interactions with Daisy. The book could have been longer, with even more of that.The mystery itself was only moderately intriguing. The crime--murder and sex trafficking--was a downer. Those parts were not funny or sweet at all. I didn't care for the ending, when one of the villains knocks on a certain door.A few sexy, earthy love scenes.This book reminds me of the Stephanie Plum series, especially One For The Money."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"In Open Season, Ms. Howard reveals the often hysterical side of life for 'old maid' Daisy, still living at home with her mother and Aunt Jo, who just turned 34. Daisy has a BIG problem, in that she has realized she is unattractive to men, clueless about fashion and make-up, and yet she longs for a husband and family. Additional frustration -- she has no idea how to realistically and successfully conquer all of this. She has the notion of visiting the local small-town beauty shop (which ominously seems to be the only one around, with hints of primarily catering to the 'teased and lacquered helmet head' crowd). Her mother and Aunt Jo are horrified, and determined to try to steer her away from such a potentially disastrous decision. Her mother and the witty, acerbic Aunt Jo at least get Daisy to postpone anything drastic, and Daisy decides to take the 'do-it-yourself' approach in one small step as an attempt to show them she can manage just fine ...The Chief of Police, an alpha male from 'Up North', has already noticed Daisy, even in her current, unfashionable state, but she is disdainful of his Yankee abruptness and what she perceives as rude behavior. Her own preconceived ideas about the Chief are very off-base, and he is rather determined to aggravate her just because her reaction is so entertaining to him.Meanwhile, despite her ignorance on the subject, Daisy is very over-confident in her ability to at least begin her complete transformation. She figures it can't be too hard to put together some cosmetics and decide how to achieve her 'new look'. After all, she reasons, she IS a librarian, and her ability to read and follow directions is obviously equal to that of anyone else... The hilarious description of her untutored attempt to master blush, lipstick and especially mascara, along with the reactions of her mother and aunt, and the resulting experience of REALLY getting a professional make-over are equally entertaining.The ways in which Daisy decides to make her 'availability' known to men, and the resulting misunderstandings are a comedy of errors. The 'condom scene' alone is worth buying the book! Of course, that brash Yankee is just what Daisy needs, and he is smart enough to know she is just what he is looking for.A great, entertaining romance, with just enough suspense and a little danger to spice things up!"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Reviewed for [&#8230;] (9 out of 10 on the blog)I did not expect to love this book so much. It has a combination of many elements I generally do not like in a story - such as a supremely conservative small town setting (alcohol isn't even legal there), and an &uuml;ber-conservative heroine. However Linda Howard surprised me with her brilliant book, \`Mr Perfect', and so I decided to give \`Open Season' a chance.First off, this book is hilarious. I sat there grinning like an idiot for much of it, and laughing out loud more than once. Poor sheltered Daisy has reached her mid-thirties and still can't make a move in the town without everyone interfering. She tries to find a house of her own and discovers nobody will rent to her until she has her mother's permission. Her realisation of just how pathetic everyone seems to think she is is a massive wakeup call.Then when Daisy tries to buy a packet of condoms - in what is perhaps the funniest scene I have ever read - she ends up in huge trouble from the shop assistant, and with the whole town finding out about it in a matter of hours. The hero - Jack - happens to turn up in the middle of all the drama, and just as he ended up crying with laughter about the whole situation, I did too.Howard's romantic suspense is a little different to many other authors' work. It is slow-building, setting up characters and locations before the suspense plot arrives on the scene. It borrows as much from other subgenres such as contemporary romance, chick lit and women's fiction and they all weave together expertly. Howard's writing style is engaging; it seems she can make me interested in reading about anything!There was so much potential for stereotyping in this story. In fact I practically expected it. Daisy is a small town woman who's thirty-four, a mousy librarian, and aware her life needs a makeover if she's ever going to find a husband. She just wants the kind of life that seems to come to others so easily. She felt like a real person to me. Though she had so many clich&eacute;s attached to her character, she struggled with ridding herself of them and tried so hard to get the things she wanted. Watching her slowly, tentatively mould herself into a new and improved version while still keeping her heart and soul was great to read. She's perhaps the most nave protagonist I have ever read - everything she knows about the world, from how to use makeup to how to converse with men, she only knows about from reading about it - but she's willing to go out there and try things for herself. Her life was in a terrible place and yet she decides she's the only one who can change that. I loved her even as I thought she was crazy.For his part, Jack was an excellent counter to Daisy. Gruff, not local, happy to swear in public and happy to embarrass her into letting down her guards, he was a wonderful and flawed hero. Daisy's initial reactions to him were priceless; her innocent shock at him when \\"he said the F word!\\" was fantastic. He's a man with a messy past, but I loved that he decided on a relationship with Daisy and simply went for it.Howard skilfully takes us into different characters' heads. One moment she's introducing a man we think is a wonderful person; he suffers through his wife's infidelity and dotes on his children. It's from his point of view, and he thinks he's pretty great. The next we discover he's a villain in the piece. In his mind he's able to justify everything he does. It's incredibly well-written and not at all contrived.This was simply an all-around good book.VERDICT:This is an excellent read. Every aspect is equally as interesting: the romance, the suspense, the secondary characters and the all-around character development. While not my favourite book in the genre - and perhaps not quite as good as Howard's \`Mr Perfect' - it is a very worthwhile way to spend a few hours."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"This is one of the best books I have read. I have read it three times and will most likely read it again very soon. Mr Perfect was another one that was good to.

What more could you ask for in a great book."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I think Open Season is a great book. It had this Romantic yet thriling. It had this lovley emotion. It is this typical love story but spiced up with reality."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I have always enjoyed Linda Howard's books and I thought it was incredible that in this book she could take subjects like rape and murder and weave such a humorous story that I laughed till I cried. Her portrayal of the stodgy old-maid who suddenly realizes life is passing her by was terrific and both Daisy and Jack were people I would like to get to know. I loved this book so much that I was a little amazed when I read negative reviews but then if everyone liked the same thing, everyone in the world would own a black Ford truck!"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"This is was amusing to me.It kept me laughing for hours!

At the beginning of the story Daisy is a mousy and unassuming person who does little to attract the opposite sex. She lives with her mother and her aunt and has not been on a date in years. She wakes up on her 34th birthday determined to make a change. She decides to move out, get a make over, get a new wardrobe and start going to singles bars and honky tonks.Enter Jack Russo....strong, hunky former Chicago SWAT tough guy with a heart of gold. He is intrigued by Daisy before the make over and pursues her after. They have an amusing courtship which lands them between the sheets quickly. Boy does LH know how to write her sex scenes.The only problem here is that Daisy witnesses a murder and Jack has to protect her from the bad guys.

I was preoccupied with that, so it took 2 chapters for me to really get into the story. When I did, I couldn't put it down. Then it gets to the part where the plot and the prologue fit together, and the book gets interesting. The characters are endearing and well developed.

This was a great weekend read!"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"This book woulda been great if it were not like the FOURTH (fifth?) detective-thriller novel, authored by Ms. Howard, that I've personally read thus far. And to be frank, among all, the only detective story I truly enjoyed was \\"Dream Man\\". I have not yet read \\"Dying to Please\\", will try though.The plot was also moving a tad too fast, in my personal opinion, there was not much of a courtship going on there. The hero & heroine had known each other for less than a week or two & they were pouncing on each other & had decided on marriage plus kids so soon afterwards. I mean, less than a month for a lifetime's decision/commitment! This also rings true in \\"Mr. Perfect\\". I mean, why the rush? Yeah, there was a certain depth present in the relationship... but you coulda done a better job, ya'know what I mean?Now don't get me wrong, I *adore* Linda Howard, but I would appreciate a breath of fresh air for a change. Ms. Howard is a creative writer coupled w/ a vivid imagination & an acute sense of humor, I'm sure she is more than capable of cooking up a story that involves *anything* BUT male leads portraying detectives/police officers in the near future. Ms. Howard, perhaps you could try paranormal for your next project? You did it in \\"Son of the Morning\\", you can do it again! But try dishing in more on courtship & intimacy than just hot sex... just a personal suggestion.Other than that, if you are a first-timer w/ Linda Howard, this book should be enough to keep you cravin' for more of her work (but if you happen not to enjoy this story, don't give up on her! C'mon, no one's perfect. There are many others of her work that can literally sweep you off your feet. Let's just say that the good ones outweigh the bad). I especially enjoyed the simple yet profound intimacy the characters shared after sex, playing around & poking fun of each other in bed, that never fails to bring a heart-warming smile to my face. It places a vital emphasis on the fact that it's not just about the sex between a couple - though that cannot be discounted - it's also what comes next that truly matters."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I thought OPEN SEASON was a great story. OPEN SEASON was my first Linda Howard book (I just finished DREAM MAN). Personally, I think she has a wonderful sense of humor and makes it obvious in her books. I thought OPEN SEASON was witty and clever and just...incredibly sexy. I really don't read much but I'm beginning to, as long as I have a book that holds my interest, and OPEN SEASON held it.I personally liked OPEN SEASON more than DREAM MAN because OPEN SEASON (to me) was funnier. It was just hilarious. I laughed throughout the entire book.I am very eager to read more Linda Howard books (MR. PERFECT, which I think is excellent, is the one I'm reading now)."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I loved this book and it was wonderful reading on my vacation. I could not put it down and as soon as I finished it, I went out to get another by the same author."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"Well, a lot of people seem to be a bit disappointed in LH's Open Season. Since it is LH, I can't give her anything less than a four because I LOVE her books. It's not as bad as some of the reviews lead you to believe - and it's not as good as a lot of her other books. My only problem with the book was the hero. His initial description/introduction didn't exactly grab me. Usually LH's heros are to die for from the beginning until the end. However, he grew on me and the story had a lot of humor and action. A big plus - no psycho killer. Let's face it. Just about every book you pick up has a psycho killer in it. No it's not as good as Mr. Perfect, but it's worth your time. Once agin LH . . .a western, PLEASE."},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I somehow managed to get through this book - only because I hate not finishing something I have started. But the book, which started out to be mildly entertaining, turned silly and dull rather quickly. The romance between Daisy and Jack was a little improbable, but it didn't bother me. I just found that there wasn't much plot to hold my interest.The ending too was unbelievable and senseless. Without revealing too much, the book seems to suggest that someone who had been a murderer throughout the book would somehow prove to be the &quot;savior&quot; of one of the other characters at the end! Outrageously ridiculous! And it actually made me angry.I think this will be my first and last Linda Howard novel. (Actually, I vaguely remember starting Mr. Perfect and reading a little before stopping and getting bored. I guess she really isn't my cup of tea, is she?)"},{"Title":"Open Season","review":"I picked up this book because it was a recommended title and the author is from my home state of Alabama. I really enjoyed the book because it addresses the anxiety that all older single women go through from time to time, trying to find a good man. Howard explores not only the man-woman relationship, but also the interaction between friends and family. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a light, funny read."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"card-container"},q=["disabled"],D={key:0},M={key:1};function j(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",H,[(e(!0),t(g,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),y(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",M,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",D,"See more"))],8,q)):p("",!0)])}const E=d(x,[["render",j],["__scopeId","data-v-bb88fc84"]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/11.md","filePath":"people/11.md"}'),P={name:"people/11.md"},B=Object.assign(P,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(E)]))}});export{F as __pageData,B as default};
