But how much do they know about the single most important structure in the history of the Windy City? In engagingly brisk prose, Patrick T. Reardon unfolds the fascinating story about how Chicago s elevated Loop was built, gave its name to the downtown, helped unify the city, saved the city s economy, and was itself saved from destruction in the 1970s. This unique volume combines urban history, biography, engineering, architecture, transportation, culture, and politics to explore the elevated Loop s impact on the city s development and economy and on the way Chicagoans see themselves. The Loop rooted Chicago s downtown in a way unknown in other cities, and it protected that area and the city itself from the full effects of suburbanization during the second half of the twentieth century. Masses of data underlie new insights into what has made Chicago s downtown, and the city as a whole, tick. The Loop features a cast of colorful Chicagoans, such as legendary lawyer Clarence Darrow, poet Edgar Lee Masters, mayor Richard J. Daley, and the notorious Gray Wolves of the Chicago City Council. Charles T. Yerkes, an often-demonized figure, is shown as a visionary urban planner, and engineer John Alexander Low Waddell, a world-renowned bridge creator, is introduced to Chicagoans as the designer of their urban railway. This fascinating exploration of how one human-built structure reshaped the social and economic landscape of Chicago is the definitive book on Chicago s elevated Loop.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tqkJEAAAQBAJ&dq=Chicago+Loop&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rebels resurgent: Fredericksburg to Chancellorsville (The Civil War)","description":"Discusses the battles of Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville and events surrounding it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7Bq9QgAACAAJ&dq=Rebels+resurgent:+Fredericksburg+to+Chancellorsville+(The+Civil+War)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Barry & 'the Boys' : The CIA, the Mob and America's Secret History","description":"Are you living the life you've always wanted?

The nation's family caregivers provide the lion's share of long-term care for our older adult population.

Metcalf and Thomas R. Metcalf, has become a classic in the field since it was first published in 2001. As a fresh interpretation of Indian history from the Mughals to the present, it has informed students across the world. In the third edition of the book, a final chapter charts the dramatic developments of the last twenty years, from 1990 through the Congress electoral victory of 2009, to the rise of the Indian high-tech industry in a country still troubled by poverty and political unrest. The narrative focuses on the fundamentally political theme of the imaginative and institutional structures that have successively sustained and transformed India, first under British colonial rule and then, after 1947, as an independent country. Woven into the larger political narrative is an account of India's social and economic development, and its rich cultural life. Throughout, the authors argue that despite a powerful historiographical tradition to the contrary, no enduring meaning can be given to categories such as 'caste', 'Hindu', 'Muslim', or even 'India'.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pX4CmQEACAAJ&dq=A+Concise+History+of+India+(Cambridge+Concise+Histories)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Does the Bible contradict itself?: A discussion of alleged contradictions in the Bible","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=95ZOAQAAMAAJ&dq=Does+the+Bible+contradict+itself%3F:+A+discussion+of+alleged+contradictions+in+the+Bible&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Everybody's Favorite Piano Pieces","description":"(Music Sales America).

Publishers Weekly (starred review) One was queen for a thousand days; one for over forty years. Both were passionate, headstrong women, loved and hated by Henry VIII. Yet until the discovery of the secret diary, Anne Boleyn and her daughter, Elizabeth I, had never really met . . . Anne was the second of Henry s six wives, doomed to be beloved, betrayed, and beheaded. When Henry fell madly in love with her upon her return from an education at the lascivious French court, he was already a married man. While his passion for Anne was great enough to rock the foundation of England and of all Christendom, in the end he forsook her for another love, schemed against her, and ultimately had her sentenced to death. But unbeknownst to the king, Anne had kept a diary. At the beginning of Elizabeth s reign, it is pressed into her hands. In reading it, the young queen discovers a great deal about her much-maligned mother: Anne s fierce determination, her hard-won knowledge about being a woman in a world ruled by despotic men, and her deep-seated love for the infant daughter taken from her shortly after her birth. In the journal s pages, Elizabeth finds an echo of her own dramatic life as a passionate young woman at the center of England s powerful male establishment, and with the knowledge gained from them, makes a resolution that will change the course of history . . .  Maxwell is one of the most popular and one of the best historical novelists currently mining the rich vein of Tudor history.

Roosevelt. The book details his security and protection measures for the President, the close-calls from those attempting to harm FDR, and his worldwide travels, including meetings of Roosevelt with Churchill, Stalin, and other world leaders. From the dust jacket: Mike Reilly guarded, for four years, the number one Nazi target: FDR. This is the story of that stewardship, which ranged from buying White House groceries to standing behind a curtain with his gun trained on the middle button of a diplomat s uniform. Reilly never left the President s side. His protection methods had to be fast and frequently unorthodox. His behind-the-scenes story of those methods, of the hair-trigger emergencies, of the world-famous people he met; above all, of FDR is even faster and even more unorthodox. It was on December 7th, 1941, that Mike Reilly took over the top Secret Service spot of guarding the President. From that day on it was his business to protect the President from assassination which might come via guns, daggers, bombs, poison, fire, or the well-known blunt instrument. In order to get an armored car, for example which the Constitution does not provide for Mike had to borrow one from the Treasury Department. It was Al Capone s originally and it served until one of the big automobile companies made one specially and leased it to the President for one dollar a year.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CH-7DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Endangered Relations","description":"HIV and AIDS are having a profound impact on contemporary life in Thailand, generating complex issues with far-reaching implications for both the Thai people and on a global level. AIDS has become an increasingly prominent symbol of modernity in Thailand, yet ways of dealing with AIDS and HIV draw on time-honoured understandings of fate and misfortune, disease and contagion, gender and pollution. Endangered Relations provides a crucial analysis of how public health has attempted to control the threat of HIV infection, and how this has combined with local understandings of identity and sexuality; it sets in place a broad range of personal and social responses to the ongoing epidemic. An illuminating study of the way in which Thai social relations, and in particular Thai sexualities, shape the history of HIV and AIDS in Thailand, Endangered Relations offers a unique perspective on the complicated ways that disease is negotiated in cultural, political, and human terms.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mAxmhWqajLoC&dq=Endangered+Relations&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lift & Look Science Mini-Books and Manipulatives (Grades K-2)","description":"From the award-winning and bestselling creators of Drawn Together comes the fantastic tale of a magical elevator that will lift your spirits--and press all the right buttons!

However, the author's forecasting toll is again the only one that has proved its value in addressing future market probabilities. The result is social science at its best. If even half of the author's forecasts come to pass, the world of finance just a few years hence will be immeasurably different from what it is today. Using the same precise approach that he employed a month after the 1982 low at Dow 777 to forecast a great bull market that would carry the Dow Industrial Average to near 4000, Robert Prechter now calls for slow motion economic earthquake that will register 11 on the financial Richter scale. The Great Assert Mania of recent years is in its final euphoric months, he says, and the next event will be a collapse of historic proportion. If you are already well versed in the Wave Principle and prepared for the change that is coming, then ignore this book. If you are not, then devour it cover from cover. Be prepared for a shift in the tectonic plates that make up your mind's notions about financial causality. Above all, get ready for a violent shaking of your faith in conventional economic wisdom.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xvLpnGKVNHEC&dq=At+the+Crest+of+the+Tidal+Wave:+A+Forecast+for+the+Great+Bear+Market&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Last of the Bandit Riders ...

This period has been marked by a volume of new empirical data and advances in theoretical and analytical issues related to DNA. Comparative DNA sequencing, facilitated by the amplification of DNA via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), has become the tool of choice for molecular systematics. As a result, large portions of the Molecular Systematics of Plants have become outdated. Molecular Systematics of Plants II summarizes these recent achievements in plant molecular systematics. Like its predecessor, this completely revised work illustrates the potential of DNA markers for addressing a wide variety of phylogenetic and evolutionary questions. The volume provides guidance in choosing appropriate techniques, as well as appropriate genes for sequencing, for given levels of systematic inquiry. More than a review of techniques and previous work, Molecular Systematics of Plants II provides a stimulus for developing future research in this rapidly evolving field. Molecular Systematics of Plants II is not only written for systematists (faculty, graduate students, and researchers), but also for evolutionary biologists, botanists, and paleobotanists interested in reviewing current theory and practice in plant molecular systematics.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xwfTBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Science of Sherlock Holmes: From Baskerville Hall to the Valley of Fear, the Real Forensics Behind the Great Detective's Greatest Cases","description":"Praise for The Science of Sherlock Holmes \\"Holmes is, first, a great detective, but he has also proven to be a great scientist, whether dabbling with poisons, tobacco ash, or tire marks.

Peace: A World History is the first study to explore the full spectrum of peace and peacemaking from prehistoric to contemporary times in a single volume aimed at improving their prospects. By focusing on key periods, events, people, ideas and texts, Antony Adolf shows how the inspiring possibilities and pragmatic limits of peace and peacemaking were shaped by their cultural contexts and, in turn, shaped local and global histories. Diplomatic, pacifist, legal, transformative non-violent and anti-war movements are just a few prominent examples. Proposed and performed in socio-economic, political, religious, philosophical and other ways, Adolf's presentation of the diversity of peace and peacemaking challenges the notions that peace is solely the absence of war, that this negation is the only task of peacemakers, and that history is exclusively written by military victors.  Without the victories of peacemakers and the resourcefulness of the peaceful,  he contends,  there would be no history to write.  This book is essential reading for students, scholars, policy-shapers, activists and general readers involved with how present forms of peace and peacemaking have been influenced by those of the past, and how future forms can benefit by taking these into account.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=J1kh_7BmkoMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Climbing Free: My Life in the Vertical World","description":"The memoirs of the woman rock climber who was the first person to accomplish a \\"free ascent\\" of the Nose on Yosemite's El Capitan describe her early days as a Hollywood stunt artist, friendships with other climbers, near-fatal eighty-foot fall, and personal strategies.

However all religions, in some manner or another, have urged their adherents to return to a simple way of being. Some have declared child-like behavior to be a high form of holiness. So is religion pathological or not? Or better yet, how and when does religious regression support psychological growth, and when does it not?\\" \\"The Recovery of Self is a pioneering study of regression in religious experience. It maintains that certain kinds of regression offer opportunities to confront unresolved childhood processes and repair them. Just as an artist may be put in touch with his or her primal self during the creative process, so a religious seeker can journey backward into primitive modes of being and recover there a sense of original unity which, when carried into the present, can be redemptive and transforming.\\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

In his sober moments Jack aspires to become Ireland's best private investigator, not to mention its first Irish history, full of betrayal and espionage, discourages any profession so closely related to informing. But in truth Jack is teetering on the brink of his life's sharpest edges, his memories of the past cutting deep into his soul and his prospects for the future nonexistent. Nonexistent, that is, until a dazzling woman walks into the bar with a strange request and a rumor about Jack's talent for finding things. Odds are he won't be able to climb off his barstool long enough to get involved with his radiant new client, but when he surprises himself by getting hired, Jack has little idea of what he's getting into. Stark, violent, sharp, and funny, The Guards is an exceptional novel, one that leaves you stunned and breathless, flipping back to the beginning in a mad dash to find Jack Taylor and enter his world all over again. It's an unforgettable story that's gritty, absorbing, and saturated with the rough-edged rhythms of the Galway streets. Praised by authors and critics around the globe, The Guards heralds the arrival of an essential new novelist in contemporary crime fiction. Ken Bruen's The Guards is a 2004 Edgar Award Nominee for Best Novel.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tVWUZy4XON4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"REC:ord","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BEuOzgEACAAJ&dq=REC:ord&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Radio-TV Newswriting: A Workbook","description":"Radio-TV news must be written in a simple, direct manner so a newscaster can read the copy easily and communicate effectively in a way that will help listeners and viewers understand complex issues and events the first time they hear about them.

From Sunday Mass to Monday mayhem: Can the central act of Catholic worship transform our daily lives? In the United States, only 25% of self-proclaimed Catholics attend Mass on a weekly basis. Many Catholics believe that far more people would attend if only the homilies were better, or the music were more inspiring, or . . . the list goes on. But best-selling authors Fr. Dominic Grassi and Joe Paprocki are convinced that the real problem lies not in the Mass itself but in a lack of understanding of how the Mass prepares each person to live day in and day out as a baptized Catholic Christian. In Living the Mass, Grassi and Paprocki show how each part of the Mass relates to our baptismal call, closing the chasm between Sunday Mass and daily life. This newly revised edition takes into account the changes in the new Roman Missal, yet rather than isolating those texts or commenting on them, the authors have integrated the changes seamlessly into the book. This assimilation ensures that readers stay focused on the core message of the book how the Mass as a whole changes us rather than become sidetracked by the Missal s new texts. Ideal for the countless Catholics who attend Mass simply out of habit, for the many who haven t been to Mass in a while, or for anyone seeking to join the Catholic Church, Living the Mass compellingly demonstrates how the one hour spent at Mass on Sunday can truly transform the other 167 hours of the week.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jGqnp_D9an0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Modern Furniture Projects (Best of Fine Woodworking)","description":"Designed for individuals with advanced woodworking skills, this volume offers plans for modern furniture projects.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yHjRwAEACAAJ&dq=Modern+Furniture+Projects+(Best+of+Fine+Woodworking)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT Chemistry","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lkfZjwEACAAJ&dq=Examkrackers+MCAT+Chemistry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Improving Care for the End of Life: A Sourcebook for Health Care Managers and Clinicians","description":"Improving Care for the End of Life provides expert guidance on how to make significant improvements now, at all levels of the health care system from the bedside and the hospital to the health care policy and legislative arenas by using the rapid-cycle breakthrough approach to change.

Veterinarian Samantha Lewis and her team are dedicated to providing a sanctuary for unwanted, abused, and abandoned dogs in New York City. But every day it gets harder to operate her no-kill shelter. Sam is already at her breaking point when she learns of an unidentified, dangerous virus spreading through their neighborhood. The medical community can only determine that animals are the carriers. Amid growing panic and a demand for immediate answers, suspicion abruptly falls on dogs as the source. Soon the governor is calling in the National Guard to enforce a quarantine--no dog may leave the area. Samantha knows from her own painful history that, despite the lack of real evidence against the dogs, a quarantine may only be the beginning. As questions about the source of the virus mount and clash with the pressure for a politically expedient resolution, Sam is forced to make life-altering choices. She finds allies in a motley crew of New Yorkers--a local priest, a troubled teen, a smart-mouthed former psychologist, and a cop desperate to do the right thing--all looking for sanctuary from their own personal demons. But the person Sam needs the most to unravel the mystery of the virus and save the dogs is the last one she'd ever want to call on--because contacting him will mean confronting the traumatic past she has fought so hard to escape.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=v6mDCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Romanian: A Complete Course for Beginners (Teach Yourself) (Romany Edition)","description":"Are you looking for a complete course in Romanian which takes you effortlessly from beginner to confident speaker?

If its purpose is to convey facts, findings, or instructions, it need be read only once for its content to be clear. If its purpose is to entertain or to provoke thought, it makes readers want to come back for more. Revised and updated, this guide covers four essential aspects of good writing: ? Individual words - spelling variations, hyphenation, frequently confused homonyms, frequently misused words and phrases, irregular plurals and negatives, and uses of capitalization and type style to add special meanings ? Punctuation - the role of each mark in achieving clarity and affecting tone, and demonstration of how misuses can lead to ambiguity ? Syntax and structure - agreement of subject and verb, parallel construction, modifiers, tenses, pronouns, active versus passive voice, and more ? Style - advice on the less hard-and-fast areas of clarity and tone, including sentence length and order, conciseness, simplification, reading level, jargon and cliche  s, and subtlety Filled with self-test exercises and whimsical literary quotations, Grammatically Correct steers clear of academic stuffiness, focusing instead on practical strategies and intuitive explanations. Discussions are designed to get to the heart of a concept and provide a sufficient sense of when and how to use it, along with examples that show what ambiguities or misinterpretations might result if the rules are not followed. In cases where there is more than one acceptable way to do something, the approach is not to prescribe one over another but simply to describe the options. Readers of this book will never break the rules of language again - unintentionally.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aFL9DwAAQBAJ&dq=Grammatically+Correct&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Knowledge Is Power: The Diffusion of Information in Early America, 1700-1865","description":"Brown here explores America's first communications revolution--the revolution that made printed goods and public oratory widely available and, by means of the steamboat, railroad and telegraph, sharply accelerated the pace at which information travelled. He describes the day-to-day experiences of dozens of men and women, and in the process illuminates the social dimensions of this profound, far-reaching transformation. Brown begins in Massachusetts and Virginia in the early 18th century, when public information was the precious possession of the wealthy, learned, and powerful, who used it to reinforce political order and cultural unity. Employing diaries and letters to trace how information moved through society during seven generations, he explains that by the Civil War era, cultural unity had become a thing of the past. Assisted by advanced technology and an expanding economy, Americans had created a pluralistic information marketplace in which all forms of public communication--print, oratory, and public meetings--were competing for the attention of free men and women. Knowledge is Power provides fresh insights into the foundations of American pluralism and deepens our perspective on the character of public communications in the United States.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6lxsAyjNSxYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Seven Blessings: A Novel","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Le Corbusier : Complete Works (Oeuvre Complete) in Eight Volumes (French, English and German Edition)","description":"This exceptional Complete Works edition documents the enormous spectrum in the oeuvre of one of the most influential architects of the 20th Century.

The true origins of her birth, her fairy-tale discovery in Hollywood, and her career struggles at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer are revealed for the first time. Garson combined an everywoman quality with grace, charm, and refinement. She won the Academy Award in 1941 for her role in Mrs. Miniver , and for the next decade she reigned as the queen of MGM. Co-star Christopher Plummer remembered, \\"\\"Here was a siren who had depth, strength, dignity, and humor who could inspire great trust, suggest deep intellect and whose misty languorous eyes melted your heart away!\\"\\" Garson earned a total of seven Academy Award nominations for Best Actress, and fourteen of her films premiered at Radio City Music Hall, playing for a total of eighty-four weeks--a record never equaled by any other actress. She was a central figure in the golden age of the studios, working with legendary performers Clark Gable, Marlon Brando, Elizabeth Taylor, Errol Flynn, Joan Crawford, Robert Mitchum, Debbie Reynolds, and Walter Pidgeon. Garson's experiences offer a fascinating glimpse at the studio system in the years when stars were closely linked to a particular studio and moguls such as L.B. Mayer broke or made careers. With the benefit of exclusive access to studio production files, personal letters and diaries, and the cooperation of her family, Troyan explores the triumphs and tragedies of her personal life, a story more colorful than any role she played on screen.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_IW__K6uOroC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Touch and Feel: Home (Touch & Feel)","description":"Child development specialists have shown that children learn best when they acquire knowledge through multiple senses.

J. Kennedy Poetry Prize)","description":"In the opening poem of The Surface of last Scattering, the poet asks \\"How shape a full-bodied intelligent speaking for an open-hearted listening?\\" In pursuit of the possibilities engendered by this question, Gray Jacobik writes meditative lyrics, essay-poems and prose-poems as grounded in the mind as in the body, poems that assume, and reward, an open-hearted listening. Ascribing to no one school of poetics, and no one style, Jacobik is unafraid of either spare language or a language of high color. She uses a range of resources from verisimilitude to abstraction to write poems that are at once instruments of knowing and passionate songs. Emily I spent my birthday with a woman who might have been myself, thirty years ago, myself without the early tragedies.

Chocolate may be the most universally loved (and craved) flavoring, and Everything Chocolate is the definitive guide to any sweet treat you can imagine featuring it, for any time of day. Wake up with streusel-topped Chocolate-Walnut Muffins that are easy to make or professional-grade Chocolate Croissants when weekend time allows. Pack lunches with pleasing Milk Chocolate Revel Bars or serve Magic Chocolate Flan Cake or Chocolate Pavlova with Berries and Whipped Cream after dinner. Much of why we fall for chocolate is because it brings back memories of candy bar snacks and sneaking just-baked chocolate chip cookies while they're still warm (we have the best recipe). We channel the nostalgia in recipes like Chocolate Fluff Cookies and Frozen Snickers Ice Cream Cake. But chocolate is also a grown-up favorite for black-tie desserts--think low, lush slices like Blood Orange Chocolate Tart or ganache-enrobed Chocolate-Pecan Torte (we'll teach you how to get a perfectly smooth coating). The full range of chocolate recipes is here, avoiding the pitfalls of unbalanced chocolate flavor (too bitter or too sweet) or dry, crumbly baked goods (chocolate contains starch and we've learned how to mind it). Become a home chocolatier by learning all about chocolate nomenclature, how to shop for the best-tasting cocoa powder, when you should use chocolate bars versus chips, decorating dazzling desserts with chocolate, and how to make candies and cookies with shiny, snappy chocolate coatings with our shortcut to tempering.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0I2cDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Your First Sailboat : How to Find and Sail the Right Boat for You","description":"The Comprehensive Sailing Start-Up Resource Can a keelboat tip over?

Did fear mongering allow the US government to convince the American public that conducting huge, expensive wars in Afghanistan and Iraq was a necessary counter to defeat fabricated culprits in the Middle East? Was this all a plot to induce a financial boom that robbed the middle class of its wealth and brought the world to its knees in 2008? Examining the key players within America s government, as well as the states that supported and carried out the attacks, Death of a Nation attempts to reveal that 9/11 was falsely portrayed by the Bush administration, and in fact carried out by elements within the United States government and military to further their own geopolitical and financial interests. Death of a Nation provides a searing indictment of the role now played by America in global affairs and warns that, with a broken society and body politic, the world is seeing the rise of one of the most overtly fascist nations since the Second World War creating profoundly disturbing implications for the future of humanity. A generation is coming of age that doesn t remember 9/11 happening, and knows of no world but this. We can t allow this to be the new normal.

Out of the heart of China into the mountains of Central Asia, across northern Afghanistan and the plains of Iran and into Kurdish Turkey, Colin Thubron covers some seven thousand miles in eight months. Making his way by local bus, truck, car, donkey cart and camel, he travels from the tomb of the Yellow Emperor, the mythic progenitor of the Chinese people, to the ancient port of Antioch in perhaps the most difficult and ambitious journey he has undertaken in forty years of travel. The Silk Road is a huge network of arteries splitting and converging across the breadth of Asia. To travel it is to trace the passage not only of trade and armies but also of ideas, religions and inventions. But alongside this rich and astonishing past, Shadow of the Silk Road is also about Asia today: a continent of upheaval. One of the trademarks of Colin Thubron's travel writing is the beauty of his prose; another is his gift for talking to people and getting them to talk to him. Shadow of the Silk Road encounters Islamic countries in many forms. It is about changes in China, transformed since the Cultural Revolution. It is about false nationalisms and the world's discontented margins, where the true boundaries are not political borders but the frontiers of tribe, ethnicity, language and religion. It is a magnificent and important account of an ancient world in modern ferment.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oz4SawhQX6wC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tell a tale of Iowa","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SiDmPAAACAAJ&dq=Tell+a+tale+of+Iowa&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Treasured Polish Songs with English Translations","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vYWfAAAAMAAJ&dq=Treasured+Polish+Songs+with+English+Translations&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Infernal Devices Signed 1ST Edition","description":"All three books in the #1 New York Times bestselling Infernal Devices trilogy are now together in one boxed set!

Illustrated with more than two hundred historical photographs, newspaper clippings, and advertisements, it traces the history of Houston movie theatres from their early twentieth-century beginnings in vaudeville and nickelodeon houses to the opulent downtown theatres built in the 1920s (the Majestic, Metropolitan, Kirby, and Loew's State). It also captures the excitement of the neighborhood theatres of the 1930s and 1940s, including the Alabama, Tower, and River Oaks; the theatres of the 1950s and early 1960s, including the Windsor and its Cinerama roadshows; and the multicinemas and megaplexes that have come to dominate the movie scene since the late 1960s. While preserving the glories of Houston's lost movie palaces only a few of these historic theatres still survive Cinema Houston also vividly re-creates the moviegoing experience, chronicling midnight movie madness, summer nights at the drive-in, and, of course, all those tasty snacks at the concession stand. Sure to appeal to a wide audience, from movie fans to devotees of Houston's architectural history, Cinema Houston captures the bygone era of the city's movie houses, from the lowbrow to the sublime, the hi-tech sound of 70mm Dolby and THX to the crackle of a drive-in speaker on a cool spring evening.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=R6XDCyvuGSkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Latin Lovers: True Stories of Latin Men in Love","description":"In this two-volume work, hundreds of alphabetically arranged entries survey contemporary lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, and queer American literature and its social contexts. ?

But most of all, we think about family, friends, and the bounty of our country. Edward Bleier s The Thanksgiving Ceremony introduces a brand-new tradition for the Thanksgiving table, offering a wonderful way for all Americans to give thanks and rejoice in the sense of togetherness and community this special holiday brings. The heart of the book is a participatory ceremony designed to be read aloud around the table. It recounts the story of the early settlers and the challenges they, and all subsequent immigrant generations, faced. The ceremony provides roles for guests of all ages and takes about twenty minutes. There is also a brief history of Thanksgiving, as well as a wide array of poems, hymns, songs, prayers, and readings that enable families to create and customize their own ceremony, including pieces by Maya Angelou, Irving Berlin, Woodie Guthrie, and Emily Dickinson. As William Safire writes in his foreword,  Getting together for a grand dinner party may be glorious fun, but a holiday should have a focus  one that reminds us why we celebrate it. This long-overdue book offers that focus in a short, elegant format that any gathering of family and friends can participate in, and enjoy, for many years to come.

Threat and violence assessment and management is an essential process in reducing violence and its consequences. The ongoing challenge for those assessors, particularly in common workplace environments (e.g., educational settings, public agency settings, and business settings), is applying the applicable behavioral science research in a practical and effective manner to maximize safety. The book begins by demonstrating the threat and violence assessment process from the point of the initial call and proceeds through the steps that quantify the situation and determine the appropriate response.

In those years bird hunting was a social activity as well as a field sport. My Health Is Better in November, first published by the University of South Carolina Press in 1947, has remained popular primarily because Bobcock's stories describe the camaraderie of the hunt, bringing it to life. Readers can imagine themselves in the field, watching the dogs on point near an overgrown fence row. In recent decades hunting has become a more solitary pursuit, leaving many longing for the good old days. In these pages you will find that lost fellowship along with a bit of humor that will delight and amuse even those who have never shouldered a gun or cast a fly.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ROzeDwAAQBAJ&dq=My+health+is+better+in+November:+Thirty-five+stories+of+hunting+and+fishing+in+the+South&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Painting Waterfowl with J.D.

The narrative is guided by unifying themes. First, medical anthropology is actively engaged in helping to address pressing health problems around the globe through research, intervention, and policy-related initiatives. Second, illness and disease cannot be fully understood or effectively addressed by treating them solely as biological in nature; rather, health problems involve complex biosocial processes and resolving them requires attention to range of factors including systems of belief, structures of social relationship, and environmental conditions. Third, through an examination of health inequalities on the one hand and environmental degradation and environment-related illness on the other, the book underlines the need for going beyond cultural or even ecological models of health toward a comprehensive medical anthropology. The authors show that a medical anthropology that integrates biological, cultural, and social factors to truly understand the origin of ill health will contribute to more effective and equitable health care systems.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Jde4yZM8d58C&dq=Donovan%27s+Brain+(Pop+Library+SF,+G560)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Daughter of the Mountains.","description":"Momo undertakes a dangerous journey from the mountains of Tibet to the city of Calcutta, in search of her stolen dog Pempa.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pWmozgEACAAJ&dq=Daughter+of+the+Mountains.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Monkey Wrench (Tyler Ser.)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZmoZAAAAMAAJ&dq=Monkey+Wrench+(Tyler+Ser.)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Calico Incident: A Ghostly Tale","description":"In the year of 1988 Johnny M.

Fourteen of the ship's 43 crewmen died in the crash. The Shenandoah was America's first rigid dirigible. It was longer than two football fields and powered by five 300-horsepower Packard engines. Ripped apart by strong winds over rural Ohio, the buoyant nose of the ship circled helplessly in the storm for nearly an hour, finally coming to rest 12 miles away where six crewmen staggered out dazed but alive. Thousands of curiosity-seekers swarmed the crash sites, trampling crops, flattening fences and stripping the carcass of the great ship almost bare. Army troops were called in to maintain control. The crash made front-page news around the world. But as the years have passed, this historic event has all but faded from our collective memory. Now - this tragic story is told anew, with over 100 photographs and illustrations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dQrpqJfOzPsC&dq=The+giant+airships+(The+Epic+of+flight+%3B+6)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Macromedia Dreamweaver MX: Training from the Source","description":"Explains how to use the Web authoring program to create and manage Web sites, format text with HTML, and use Cascading Style Sheets, templates, tables, and forms to develop an interactive Web page.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ImP8PdQxa1cC&dq=Macromedia+Dreamweaver+MX:+Training+from+the+Source&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Revolution at the Checkout Counter: The Explosion of the Bar Code (Wertheim Publications in Industrial Relations)","description":"At the core of this book is the interplay between technological and business innovation and social practice. Although the bene?ts of 50 years of rapid advances in digital telecommunications and computing technology have not bene?ted everyone equally, they have nevertheless transformed almost every aspectofthewaywelive.Oneareawheretechnologyhashada clearimpactis in the way we conduct business. The rate of change that brings about mod- nity has been considerably strengthened by technological advances applied to product manufacturing, distribution, ?nancing, and management, which arguably form the substrate for globalization and consumerism. It is thus no surprise that businesses closely monitor advances in techn- ogy and invest considerable resources in exploring possible new applications and market opportunities. Yet, consumers  acceptance of new ways of buying and selling depends as much on business and technology as on our society s culture and the culture of the material environment that de?nes our values, sensibilities, and thus our commitments. Moreover, the rate of technological innovation is such that to the c- sumer, technology implementation is fully opaque.Nonetheless, opportunities to carry out commerce in novel ways also introduce risk to established - cial structures, conventions, and institutions. In modernity, risk management is one of the core functions of society and to be successful in this, societies depend on their trust of experts. Experts take risks on behalf of society and are responsible for evaluating the full extent of a particular set of hazards including those associated with a particular technology.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tyEJaLbr7kAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dreaming Beyond Death: A Guide to Pre-Death Dreams and Visions","description":"Drawing from a rich understanding of dreaming in culture, history, psychology, and modern dream study, Kelly Bulkeley and Patricia Bulkley's Dreaming Beyond Death explicitly addresses three common aspects of pre-death dreams and offers interpretations that will aid both dying persons and their caregivers.

Appearing to play the roles of benign mentor and eager disciple, they can also be seen as bitter rivals: America's foremost literary statesman, protective of his reputation, and an ambitious and sometimes refractory protege. The truth, Joel Porte maintains, is that Emerson and Thoreau were complementary literary geniuses, mutually inspiring and inspired. In this book of essays, Porte focuses on Emerson and Thoreau as writers. He traces their individual achievements and their points of intersection, arguing that both men, starting from a shared belief in the importance of self-culture, produced a body of writing that helped move a decidedly provincial New England readership into the broader arena of international culture.

This new version of the database has been developed using the widely-used and highly-regarded FOLIO VIEWS environment. This offers unparalleled searching strengths by a variety of textual means, which the user can select and modify. It is also possible to bookmark or append entries and to customise the data set according to the user's own research or experience. Also new for this version is the incorporation of HDS' PSI structure searching software, which is integral to the product. Every chemical included has an associated structure, and by using the PSI software it is now possible to search the data-set for other entries which have the same or similar reactive groups, or structures which the user may suspect of being the cause of a particular hazardous reactive trait. This is obviously an especially valuable facility where a given chemical is not included in the database or indeed the literature, but similar compounds or chemicals may be located and evaluated. The majority of the data is devoted to specific information on the stability of the listed compounds, or the reactivity of mixtures of two or more of them under various circumstances. Each compound is identified by an IUPAC-based name, the CAS registry number, its empirical formula and its structure; all of which may be made the subject of search criteria. Each description of an incident or violent reaction gives reference to the original literature. Each chemical is classified on the basis of similarities in structure or reactivity, and these groups are also included. The group entries contain a complete listing of all the compounds, which have their own unique entries and are assigned to that group, to assist cross referral to similar compounds. Naturally these are all hot-linked, and there is also a set of general hazard topic entries.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bKi_ngEACAAJ&dq=Bretherick%27s+Reactive+Chemical+Hazards+Database+-+Version+3.0&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Glorious Quest of Chief Washakie","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UL0NAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Glorious+Quest+of+Chief+Washakie&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Huntington Beach (CA) (Images of America)","description":"Incorporated in 1909, Huntington Beach remained a sleepy seaside town until the city's legendary oil boom in the 1920s. Wells sprang up overnight, and in less than a month, the city's population more than doubled. As the area developed culturally through the decades, the once tiny farming community increased its size with 25 miles of annexations to become one of Southern California's major tourist destinations. Pictured here in nearly 200 vintage photographs is the evolution of this small seaside village into a classic, Southern California beach city, known as Surf City to nearly a million tourists a year. Showcased here are images acquired from city records, including shots of the famous Huntington Beach Pier as it evolved over the century, rare amateur photos of one of the largest gushers in city history, vintage beach scenes, rarely seen historic aerial views, images of the turn of the century \\"Tent City,\\" the infamous flood of 1938, and nostalgic shots of the Saltwater Plunge.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-Y4gdYLDD5wC&dq=Huntington+Beach+(CA)+(Images+of+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gift of Grace: Little Inspirations that Invite God's Blessings","description":"Contains a collection of prayers, meditations, affirmations, and stories that explore the seven virtues and the love of God.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eD0_vgAACAAJ&dq=Gift+of+Grace:+Little+Inspirations+that+Invite+God%27s+Blessings&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Buddhist Woman Missionary in Hawaii","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NuwQAQAAIAAJ&dq=Memoirs+of+a+Buddhist+Woman+Missionary+in+Hawaii&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Nine Tailors;: Changes rung on an old theme in two short touches and two full peals","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-_ZmswEACAAJ&dq=The+Nine+Tailors%3B:+Changes+rung+on+an+old+theme+in+two+short+touches+and+two+full+peals&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Crow Island journal","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=v-RpewAACAAJ&dq=The+Crow+Island+journal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"50 Science Activities for your Kindergarten Classroom","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IZyoswEACAAJ&dq=50+Science+Activities+for+your+Kindergarten+Classroom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brookland: A Novel","description":"A New York Times Book Review Notable Book of the Year A Los Angeles Times Book Review Favorite Book of the Year Since her girlhood, Prudence Winship has gazed across the tidal straits from her home in Brooklyn to the city of Manhattan and yearned to bridge the distance. Now, established as the owner of the enormously successful gin distillery she inherited from her father, she can begin to realize her dream. Set in eighteenth-century Brooklyn, this is the story of a determined and intelligent woman who is consumed by a vision of a bridge: a gargantuan construction of timber and masonry she devises to cross the East River in a single, magnificent span. With the help of the local surveyor, Benjamin Horsfield, and her sisters the high-spirited, obstreperous Tem, who works with her in the distillery, and the silent, uncanny Pearl she fires the imaginations of the people of Brooklyn and New York by promising them a bridge that will meet their most pressing practical needs while being one of the most ambitious public works ever attempted. Prue's own life and the life of the bridge become inextricably bound together as the costs of the bridge, both financial and human, rise beyond her direst expectations. Brookland confirms Emily Barton's reputation as one of the finest writers of her generation, whose work is \\"blessedly post-ironic, engaging and heartfelt\\" (Thomas Pynchon).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=F9WcEdN8018C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Forever Street","description":"From its founding in 1873 until the coming of the Nazis in 1938, a Viennese Jewish family bravely endures and flourishes in their beloved home on the street called Turk Place","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q8gfAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Forever+Street&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How the Bible Became the Bible","description":"In Western culture, the Bible is monolithic.

She felt instinctively that the little girl in the red coat--the only spot of color in the film--was her. When she had lived in the Krakow ghetto during the Second World War she had worn a strawberry-red coat given to her by her grandmother. Unlike the girl in Spielbeg's film, however, Roma survived the war. Startled by this eerie conjunction of art and reality, Ligocka determined to write the story of her own life, to find out what had become of the little girl, and to measure who she now was. From a harrowing childhood under the Nazis, described with a simplicity and innocence that lends it even greater power, through the trials of living in Communist Poland, to a career in the theater and film (an artistic struggle paralleling that of her cousin, Roman Polanski), Ligocka traces her struggle for self-defiition and happiness.

When the Mongols pushed out of China in their conquests to the west, suddenly the Europeans were faced with a veritable threat. In 1241, Mongols had killed more than 100,000 knights and soldiers in Russia, Poland and Hungary. In addition, the invaders laid waste to the land like no other force in history. Pope Gregory IX, understanding too well the threat of doom, was helpless because Europe knew nothing about those invaders; worse, there was no standing army to meet the challenge. The Pope put together a team of missionaries to go to China with the secret mission of gathering appropriate intelligence to bring back. Friar Giovanni Carpini did exactly that. He went to China, gathered the information, wrote them down in Latin, and presented them to the Pope. His extensive report, however, was never published.

Written over the course of James s career and ranging from the deliciously tart comedy of the early  An International Episode  to the surreal and haunted corridors of  The Jolly Corner,  and including  Washington Square,  the poignant novella considered by many (though not, as it happens, by the author himself) to be one of James s finest achievements, the nine fictions gathered here reflect James s varied talents and interests as well as the deep and abiding preoccupations of his imagination. And throughout the book, as T ib n s fascinating introduction demonstrates, we see James struggling to make sense of a city in whose rapidly changing outlines he discerned both much that he remembered and held dear as well as everything about America and its future that he dreaded most. Stories included: The Story of a Masterpiece A Most Extraordinary Case Crawford s Consistency An International Episode The Impressions of a Cousin The Jolly Corner Washington Square Crapy Cornelia A Round of Visits","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=A7xKJHuOMRsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Living in Cuba","description":"A colorful survey of the unique and varied architecture and culture of Cuba offers more than four hundred photographs of the well-preserved styles of Cuban buildings and interiors, with examples ranging from colonial to art deco.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=936iQyuLlAcC&dq=Living+in+Cuba&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Synthesizing Aspirin (Molecular Laboratory Program in Chemistry)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9sBrPQAACAAJ&dq=Synthesizing+Aspirin+(Molecular+Laboratory+Program+in+Chemistry)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"PC Hardware: The Complete Reference","description":"this book includes a review of PC hardware basics, a troublelshooting methodology primer, and a vast component reference that will help both novice and intermediate readers solve hardware and OS technical problems as well as upgrade computers. 40-page visual Troubleshooting Flowchart section helps readers isolate likely causes to common problems and helps narrow their search for the cause of their systemks problem.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0kxHzwEACAAJ&dq=PC+Hardware:+The+Complete+Reference&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Glossary of Semiotics (Paragon House Glossary for Research, Reading, & Writing)","description":"Explains terms and concepts in philosophy, anthropology, literature, cultural studies, cinema, and women's studies, and identifies important individuals in the field","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hIoYAAAAIAAJ&dq=Glossary+of+Semiotics+(Paragon+House+Glossary+for+Research,+Reading,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Java Developers Guide To Eclipse 2ND Edition","description":"Explains how to customize the Java integrated development environment, covering navigation, terminology, extension, the plug-in architecture, and frameworks.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6Ob1ANNVcXcC&dq=Java+Developers+Guide+To+Eclipse+2ND+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A House for Hermit Crab (World of Eric Carle)","description":"Hermit Crab seeks the perfect home and learns to appreciate change in this Ready-to-Read edition of Eric Carle s beloved story.

Based on the copious notes of Indologist, linguist, and art historian Heinrich Zimmer, and edited by Joseph Campbell, this book is organized into three sections.  The Highest Good  looks at Eastern and Western thought and their convergence;  The Philosophies of Time  discusses the philosophies of success, pleasure, and duty; and  The Philosophies of Eternity  presents the fundamental concepts of Buddhism, Brahmanism, Jainism, Sankhya and yoga, and Tantra. This work examines such areas as the Buddhist Tantras, Buddhist Genesis, the Tantric presentation of divinity, the preparation of disciples and the meaning of initiation, and the symbolism of the mandala-palace Tantric ritual and twilight language.

Doing so has reassured us all that underlying every new computer capability, no matter how miraculously fast or complex, are human thought processes and logic. But cutting-edge computer scientists are coming to see that electronic circuits really are alien, that the difference between the human mind and computer capability is not merely one of degree (how fast), but of kind(how). The author suggests that computers  think  best when their  thoughts  are allowed to emerge from the interplay of millions of tiny operations all interacting with each other in parallel. Why then, if computers bring to the table such very different strengths and weaknesses, are we still trying to program them to think like humans? A work that ranges widely over the history of ideas from Galileo to Newton to Darwin yet is just as comfortable in the cutting-edge world of parallel processing that is at this very moment yielding a new form of intelligence, After Thought describes why the real computer age is just beginning.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=B47eswEACAAJ&dq=After+Thought:+The+Computer+Challenge+To+Human+Intelligence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Psychology & the Promethean Will (1936)","description":"How does memory work?

Liuzza s Broadview edition of Beowulf was published at almost exactly the same time as Seamus Heaney s; in reviewing the two together in July 2000 for The New York Review of Books, Frank Kermode concluded that both translations were superior to their predecessors, and that it was impossible to choose between the two:  the less celebrated translator can be matched with the famous one,  he wrote, and  Liuzza s book is in some respects more useful than Heaney s.  Ever since, the Liuzza Beowulf has remained among the top sellers on the Broadview list. With this volume readers will now be able to enjoy a much broader selection of Old English poetry in translations by Liuzza. As the collection demonstrates, the range and diversity of the works that have survived is extraordinary from heartbreaking sorrow to wide-eyed wonder, from the wisdom of old age to the hot blood of battle, and to the deepest and most poignant loneliness. There is breathless storytelling and ponderous cataloguing; there is fervent religious devotion and playful teasing. The poems translated here are meant to provide a sense of some of this range and diversity; in doing so they also offer significant portions of three of the important manuscripts of Old English poetry the Vercelli Book, the Junius Manuscript, and the Exeter Book.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QeoKAwAAQBAJ&dq=An+Old+English+Anthology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Military Insignia of the 20th Century: A Comprehensive A-Z Guide to the Badges, Patches and Embellishments of the World's Armed Forces","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VIjfAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Illustrated+Encyclopedia+of+Military+Insignia+of+the+20th+Century:+A+Comprehensive+A-Z+Guide+to+the+Badges,+Patches+and+Embellishments+of+the+World%27s+Armed+Forces&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dragonseye (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","description":"In Anne McCaffrey s New York Times bestselling Dragonseye, join Weyrleaders, Holders, and Craftmasters in the creation of the legendary Star Stones and the teaching ballads of Pern!

Cross, Jr., presents the diversity and texture that have always been the hallmark of Black psychology. Shades of Black explodes the myth that self-hatred is the dominant theme in Black identity. With a thorough review of social scientific literature on Negro identity conducted between 1936 and 1967, Cross demonstrates that important themes of mental health and adaptive strength have been frequently overlooked by scholars, both Black and White, obsessed with proving Black pathology. He examines the Black Power Movement and critics who credit this era with a comprehensive change in Black self-esteem. Allowing for a considerable gain in group identity among Black people during this period, Cross shows how, before this, working and middle class, and even many poor Black families were able to offer their progeny a legacy of mental health and personal strength that sustained them in their struggles for political and cultural consensus. Author note: William E. Cross, Jr., is a psychologist and Associate Professor in the Africana Studies and Research Center of Cornell University.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U6JcPgAACAAJ&dq=Shades+of+Black:+Diversity+in+African+American+Identity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"RISING PHOENIX","description":"From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Vince Flynn's Mitch Rapp Series Special Agent Mark Beamon is a maverick.

In the twenty-five hundred years since the death of the \\"Great Physician\\", his disciples have continued to expand upon his teachings and to develop sophisticated psychotherapeutic methodologies. Yet, only recently has Western medicine begun to take its first tentative steps toward recognizing and embracing the therapeutic potential of Buddhism. In a book that will do much to advance the fusion of two great psychotherapeutic traditions, psychotherapist David Brazier offers mental health practitioners in the West a fresh perspective on Buddhist psychology and demonstrates how Zen Buddhist techniques can be integrated successfully into their clinical practices. Writing from the perspective of a Western psychotherapist, Dr. Brazier successfully demystifies Buddhist psychology for fellow practitioners. He carefully explains the conceptual foundations of Buddhist thought, and with the help of numerous case studies, he clearly demonstrates their clinical applications.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_13YAAAAMAAJ&dq=ZEN+THERAPY+Transcending+the+Sorrows+of+the+Human+Mind&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vegetables and Fruits (The Time-Life Encyclopedia of Gardening)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gO8htAEACAAJ&dq=Vegetables+and+Fruits+(The+Time-Life+Encyclopedia+of+Gardening)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Friends at Thrush Green (Thrush Green Series #10)","description":"Miss Watson and Miss Fogerty, two of Thrush Green's former schoolteachers, who had retired to Barton-on-Sea, return to the village of Thrush Green for a visit.

Yet, the battlefield situation remained tense. Shocked by the intensity and massive scale of the North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong s Tet Offensive, allied commanders kept waiting for the other shoe to drop in the aftermath of the lunar New Year s nationwide attacks against South Vietnam s urban centers. Just days before the opening of the peace talks, that other shoe finally dropped. While they had no chance of securing victory on the battlefield with their second wave of urban attacks, the communists expected to wreak substantial psychological damage, making apparent to the American public, if not to the U.S. military high command, the folly of fighting a foe that was seemingly immune to combat losses. The second wave of attacks became known as the Mini-Tet Offensive. The name was a misnomer as far as the intensity of the combat was concerned. Although the communists concentrated on fewer targets than they had during Tet, Mini-Tet was the costliest two-week period of the Vietnam War in terms of American casualties. Saigon was the Mini-Tet s primary target. In addition to penetrating the Cholon section of the capital, the enemy attacked the capital city s southern suburbs of District 8. In response, four battalions from the 9th Infantry Division were dispatched from their Mekong Delta battlefields to clear out the invaders. What resulted was a brutal house-to-house street fight. Tenacious Viet Cong guerrillas dug in like termites, building bunkers inside and between houses, and knocking holes in adjoining walls so snipers could steal unseen from one building to another. There was no provision for retreat; the Viet Cong were on a suicide mission. On the other side were equally tenacious American infantrymen who had to adapt themselves to city fighting after previously operating in the rice paddies of the Delta. The battle for southern Saigon lasted a week; the U.S. Army s only prolonged urban combat of the entire Vietnam War. The battle ended in a Pyrrhic victory for the soldiers of 9th Infantry Division. They had fought with raw courage, earning numerous decorations, including four Distinguished Service Crosses, in the course of pushing the Viet Cong out of District 8. However, in fighting that eerily foreshadows American combat in Iraqi cities, the engaged battalions destroyed the neighborhoods they liberated. This destruction, and the attendant civilian casualties, resulted in an official investigation of the 9th Infantry Division for its sledgehammer application of artillery and air strikes within the capital of South Vietnam.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wdK6wAEACAAJ&dq=House+to+House:+Playing+the+Enemy%27s+Game+in+Saigon,+May+1968&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ghosts of Gettysburg V: Spirits Apparitions and Haunted Places of the Battlefield, Vol. 5","description":"A treasury of 125 ghost stories from the Keystone State, gathered by two of the state's best-known authors on the subject.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=edvc6mUjj_UC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Noun Phrase in the Generative Perspective (Studies in Generative Grammar)","description":"The goal of this book is twofold. On the one hand we want to offer a discussion of some of the more important properties of the nominal projection, on the other hand we want to provide the reader with tools for syntactic analysis which apply to the structure of DP but which are also relevant for other domains of syntax. In order to achieve this dual goal we will discuss phenomena which are related to the nominal projection in relation to other syntactic phenomena (e.g. pro drop will be related to N-ellipsis, the classification of pronouns will be applied to the syntax of possessive pronouns, N-movement will be compared to V-movement, the syntax of the genitive construction will be related to that of predicate inversion etc.). In the various chapters we will show how recent theoretical proposals (distributed morphology, anti-symmetry, checking theory) can cast light on aspects of the syntax of the NP. When necessary, we will provide a brief introduction of these theoretical proposals. We will also indicate problems with these analyses, whether they be inherent to the theories as such (e.g. what is the trigger for movement in antisymmetric approaches) or to the particular instantiations. The book cannot and will not provide the definitive analysis of the syntax of noun phrases. We consider that this would not be possible, given the current flux in generative syntax, with many new theoretical proposals being developed and explored, but the book aims at giving the reader the tools with which to conduct research and to evaluate proposals in the literature. In the discussion of various issues, we will apply the framework that is most adequate to deal with problems at hand. We will therefore not necessarily use the same approach throughout the discussion. Though proposals in the literature will be referred to when relevant, we cannot attempt to provide a critical survey of the literature. We feel that such a survey would be guided too strongly by theoretical choices, which would not be compatible with the pedagogical purposes this book has. The book is comparative in its approach, and data from different languages will be examined, including English, German, Dutch (West-Flemish), Greek, Romance, Semitic, Slavic, Albanian, Hungarian, Gungbe.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=njc_EoeePKIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christ-Like","description":"This first novel introduces Mikey Alvarez.

Based on five years of research in the field (including berry-picking and traveling with migrants back and forth from Oaxaca up the West Coast), Holmes, an anthropologist and MD in the mold of Paul Farmer and Didier Fassin, uncovers how market forces, anti-immigrant sentiment, and racism undermine health and health care. Holmes' material is visceral and powerful?for instance, he trekked with his informants illegally through the desert border into Arizona, where they were apprehended and jailed by the Border Patrol. After he was released from jail (and his companions were deported back to Mexico), Holmes interviewed Border Patrol agents, local residents, and armed vigilantes in the borderlands. He lived with indigenous Mexican families in the mountains of Oaxaca and in farm labor camps in the United States, planted and harvested corn, picked strawberries, accompanied sick workers to clinics and hospitals, participated in healing rituals, and mourned at funerals for friends. The result is a \\"thick description\\" that conveys the full measure of struggle, suffering, and resilience of these farmworkers. Fresh Fruit, Broken Bodies weds the theoretical analysis of the anthropologist with the intimacy of the journalist to provide a compelling examination of structural and symbolic violence, medicalization, and the clinical gaze as they affect the experiences and perceptions of a vertical slice of indigenous Mexican migrant farmworkers, farm owners, doctors, and nurses. This reflexive, embodied anthropology deepens our theoretical understanding of the ways in which socially structured suffering comes to be perceived as normal and natural in society and in health care, especially through imputations of ethnic body difference. In the vehement debates on immigration reform and health reform, this book provides the necessary stories of real people and insights into our food system and health care system for us to move forward to fair policies and solutions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wbMwDwAAQBAJ&dq=Broken+Bodies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Reference Grammar of Thai (Reference Grammars)","description":"Suitable for students and teachers of the Thai language, this book offers information on advanced sentence structure.

Working from the rational actor tradition, it builds a middle ground between orthodox political theory and the economic analysis of politics. Standard economic models of politics emphasise the design of the institutional devices of democracy as operated by essentially self-interested individuals. This book departs from that model by focusing on democratic desires alongside democratic devices, stressing that important aspects of democracy depend on the motivation of democrats and the interplay between devices and desires. Individuals are taken to be not only rational, but also somewhat moral. The authors argue that this approach provides access to aspects of the debate on democratic institutions that are beyond the narrowly economic model. They apply their analysis to voting, elections, representation, political departments and the separation and division of powers, providing a wide-ranging discussion of the design of democratic institutions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qR2-Mw4zrn0C&dq=Democratic+Devices+and+Desires+(Theories+of+Institutional+Design)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cognition","description":"A mechanistic theory of the representation and use of semantic knowledge that uses distributed connectionist networks as a starting point for a psychological theory of semantic cognition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AmB33Uz2MVAC&dq=Cognition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kaying And Chay,A Hmong Odyssey","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6XRGAAAACAAJ&dq=Kaying+And+Chay,A+Hmong+Odyssey&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"NORTH CAROLINA WATERFALLS: WHERE TO FIND THEM, HOW TO PHOTOGRAPH THEM.","description":"250 of the best waterfalls found in North Carolina with full descriptions, comprehensive directions, and four-color photographs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9rgCrgEACAAJ&dq=NORTH+CAROLINA+WATERFALLS:+WHERE+TO+FIND+THEM,+HOW+TO+PHOTOGRAPH+THEM.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Earn What You're Worth: Leveraging Your Goals and Talents to Land Your Dream Job","description":"An insider's guide to help readers negotiate raises and higher salaries How to Earn What You're Worth takes the stress and uncertainty out of the compensation negotiation process.

This book is a brilliant and evocative study of the fundamental concepts of the Catholic Faith, from its tenets, its historical development and the role of the Church in world society. For many on the outside, Catholicism, according to Dr. Adam, represents a daunting and somewhat foreign confused mass of conflicting forces that has somehow survived the tests of time. Catholicism is simultaneously new yet quite old; holy yet corrupt; hierarchical yet personal; dogmatic yet utilitarian, and so on. How can someone outside the Church get a good grasp on the essence of Catholicism when it is so vast and seemingly complex? Those attempting to grasp the very heart and spirit of Catholicism should read Karl Adam s book, which is a most elegant and concise exploration of the faith and an attempt to address these ambiguities. What are the fundamental attributes of the Catholic Church? What is the source from which it has drawn vigor and life through its two thousand years of life on earth? What are the secret sources of its incredible vitality in the world today? The author answers these and many other questions about the nature and structure of the Church. He examines the essential nature of the Catholic Church from the basic premise that it was expressly founded by Christ, traces its historical development and analyzes its actual functioning through the ages.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kAQqDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The art of colonial flower arranging","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t6fCAQAACAAJ&dq=The+art+of+colonial+flower+arranging&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mind and the Way: Buddhist Reflections on Life","description":"What would life be like if each one of us chose compassion over anger, loving-kindness over hatred, awareness over ignorance?

That proud past began in the 1840s, when Dutch and German settlers first made their way to the area. The town was named for Henry Lansing, who came to the area in 1846 with his brothers, John and George. Through the medium of historic photographs, this book captures the evolution of the people of Lansing, from the late-1800s to the present day. These pages bring to life the people, events, communities, and industries that helped to shape and transform Lansing. With nearly 200 vintage images, Lansing, Illinois, includes photographs of the Indiana Avenue School, the Brickyards, the Ford Airport, and early businesses and business owners. It is hard to imagine Ridge Road, now a bustling center of commerce, as a dirt road scattered with general stores, taverns, and blacksmith shops. This book will take you back to Lansing's simpler days to give the reader a glimpse of why this community has maintained its appeal and held generations of families here in this warm and friendly place.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1upAOhTrHbIC&dq=Lansing+(IL)+(Images+of+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Nights of August","description":"With a dying man's words, the end of the world began on the last day of July 2004. On June 11, 2004, six priceless antiques were stolen while on display at the Brown University Museum. The pieces were distributed on the black market to dealers and collectors throughout New England. One piece, known only as The Book of Gazeba, holds the key to a mystery as old as time itself. Dating back more than two thousand years, the five separate and distinct works composing the book are believed to have been dictated by Satan and intended to frame a response and alternative to the teachings of Jesus Christ. Only when brought together and read as one could the Book of Gazeba's awesome powers be unleashed. The Nights of August is the story of The Book of Gazeba, written by Satan, scattered by the hand of God, and found in the summer of 2004. It's also the story of a handful of men and women who at first refused to believe and later refused to bow.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zsg8Ipg6MScC&dq=The+Nights+of+August&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Russian Journal","description":"Steinbeck and Capa s account of their journey through Cold War Russia is a classic piece of reportage and travel writing. A Penguin Classic Just after the Iron Curtain fell on Eastern Europe, Pulitzer Prize-winning author John Steinbeck and acclaimed war photographer Robert Capa ventured into the Soviet Union to report for the New York Herald Tribune. This rare opportunity took the famous travelers not only to Moscow and Stalingrad  now Volgograd  but through the countryside of the Ukraine and the Caucasus. Hailed by the New York Times as \\"superb\\" when it first appeared in 1948, A Russian Journal is the distillation of their journey and remains a remarkable memoir and unique historical document. What they saw and movingly recorded in words and on film was what Steinbeck called \\"the great other side there   the private life of the Russian people.\\" Unlike other Western reporting about Russia at the time, A Russian Journal is free of ideological obsessions. Rather, Steinbeck and Capa recorded the grim realities of factory workers, government clerks, and peasants, as they emerged from the rubble of World War II represented here in Capa s stirring photographs alongside Steinbeck s masterful prose. Through it all, we are given intimate glimpses of two artists at the height of their powers, answering their need to document human struggle. This edition features an introduction by Steinbeck scholar Susan Shillinglaw. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IP4I40F4PP4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Protein Purification: Principles and Practice","description":"New textbooks at all levels of chemistry appear with great regularity. Some fields such as basic biochemistry, organic re action mechanisms, and chemical thermodynamics are weil represented by many excellent texts, and new or revised editions are published sufficiently often to keep up with progress in research. However, some areas of chemistry, especially many of those taught at the graduate level, suffer from a real lack of up-to-date textbooks. The most serious needs occur in fields that are rapidly changing. Textbooks in these subjects usually have to be written by scientists actually involved in the research that is advancing the field. It is not often easy to persuade such individuals to set time aside to help spread the knowledge they have accumulated. Our goal, in this series, is to pinpoint areas of chemistry where recent progress has outpaced what is covered in any available textbooks, and then seek out and persuade experts in these fields to produce relatively concise but instruc tive introductions to their fields. These should serve the needs of one semester or one quarter graduate courses in chemistry and biochemistry. In so me cases the availability of texts in active research areas should help stimulate the creation of new courses.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=V6zhBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Ear at His Heart","description":"From the acclaimed novelist Kureishi comes a remarkable memoir about the India-Pakistan divide, a hidden manuscript, and a father and a son.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Z1NeAAAACAAJ&dq=My+Ear+at+His+Heart&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On the Safe Side: Your Complete Reference to Childproofing for Infants and Toddlers","description":"This book can help you save your child's life before he even gets into trouble.

Since the first edition of this book was published in 1999, the idea that there is a single gene pathway or single drug will provide a cure for cancer has given way to the general view that dietary/environmental factors impact the progression of genetic and cellular changes in common forms of cancer. This broad concept can now be investigated within a basic and clinical research context for specific types of cancer. This book attempts to cover the current available knowledge in this new field of nutritional oncology written by invited experts. This book attempts to provide not only the theoretical and research basis for nutritional oncology, but will offer the medical oncologist and other members of multidisciplinary groups treating cancer patients practical information on nutrition assessment and nutritional regimens, including micronutrient and phytochemical supplementation. The editors hope that this volume will stimulate increased research, education and patient application of the principles of nutritional oncology. NEW TO THIS EDITION: * Covers hot new topics of nutrigenomics and nutrigenetics in cancer cell growth * Includes new chapters on metabolic networks in cancer cell growth, nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics * Presents substantially revised chapters on breast cancer and nutrition, prostate cancer and nutrition, and colon cancer and nutrition * Includes new illustrations throughout the text, especially in the breast cancer chapter * Includes integrated insights into the unanswered questions and clearly defined objectives of research in nutritional oncology * Offers practical guidelines for clinicians advising malnourished cancer patients and cancer survivors on diet, nutrition, and lifestyle * Provides information on the role of bioactive substances, dietary supplements, phytochemicals and botanicals in cancer prevention and treatment","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RjVIrQ7aBFQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Tosa diary,","description":"The Tosa Diary reveals the life of a traveler in tenth-century Japan whose journey lasted 55 days on a ship from Tosa, where Ki no Tsurayuki served as governor, to Kyoto.

These concise essays on key artistic terms are written with wit and common sense by veteran art historian and critic Robert Atkins, who also provides a year-by-year timeline of world and art-world events from 1945 to the present. Some 80 images, most in full colour, illustrate iconic works of the movements discussed, making ArtSpeak a visual as well as a textual reference. The new terms in this edition of \\"ArtSpeak\\" include not only recent movements, such as the Leipzig School and San Francisco's Mission School, but also past movements that have attained a new critical prominence, such as Japan's Mono-ha group and Brazilian Neoconcretism. Also discussed are the growing constellation of new media and intermedia practices, the social and economic structures of the art world, and the theoretical concepts that interest artists and critics today. Particular attention is given to the key terms of contemporary Chinese art--from Rustic Realism to Political Pop--reflecting China's growing importance on the global scene. Long established as an indispensable reference for art-world neophytes and seasoned professionals alike, \\"ArtSpeak\\" will continue to attract a broad and appreciative audience in this attractive new edition.

Hinkle s comprehensive, chronological study of the origin, evolution, and function of the fleurs de lis covers the 200-year period beginning near the end of the 13th century with the emergence of France as a European power and ending at the close of hostilities between England and France in the late 15th century. His interdisciplinary study focuses on literature, history, and art history but also includes numismatics and sigillography. Hinkle first investigates the precursor to the fleurs de lis, the stylized lily of the early Capetian rulers. The initial literary reference to the later heraldic lily appeared shortly after 1285, with subsequent years witnessing further poetic glorification of the symbol. By 1316, the poetry of the period and of Geoffroy de Paris began to celebrate the three lilies on the royal escutcheon as a symbol of the Trinity. Concurrently, the death of a Capetian monarch without a male heir led to both the proclamation that no woman could succeed to the French throne and the appointment of the dead king s brother as Philip V. A second succession problem occurred in 1328 when the nearest male relative was Edward III of England. The French estates selected Philip VI, founder of the Valois line. To resolve the problem of succession, the pope proposed a crusade led by both Edward III and Philip VI. Preparations for this crusade led to Philippe de Vitri s poem of the 1330s: Le chapel des trois fleurs de lis. Although the crusade was later canceled, the poem signaled the beginnings of French nationalism symbolized by the three heraldic flowers. Two later poems from the 1330s celebrate the divine creation of the fleurs de lis. Hinkle tells a complex story lucidly. Examining the significance of the visual image of the fleurs de lis, he shows how the lilies evolved into emblems of God s favor, directed not only to the kings of France. The English also eagerly adopted the symbolism of the fleurs de lis for their young king, Henry VI, and that, too, is a fascinating part of the story.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LekkAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Fleurs+de+Lis+of+the+Kings+of+France,+1258-148&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Biblical Philosophy of History","description":"For the orthodox Christian who grounds his philosophy of history on the doctrine of creation, the mainspring of history is God. Time rests on the foundation of eternity, on eternal decree of God. Time and history therefore have meaning because they were created in terms of God's perfect and totally comprehensive plan. The humanist faces a meaningless world in which he must strive to create and establish meaning. The Christian accepts a world which is totally meaningful and in which every event moves in terms of God's purpose; he submits to God's meaning and finds his life therein. This is an excellent introduction to Rushdoony. Once the reader sees Rushdoony's emphasis on God's sovereignty over all of time and creation, he will understand his application of this presupposition in various spheres of life and thought.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t6dfDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Down to Earth: Australian Landscapes","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vAFOtAEACAAJ&dq=Down+to+Earth:+Australian+Landscapes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wild Animals (Touch and Feel)","description":"\\"From a koala's woolly fur to an elephant's leathery ear, there are several fun textures to explore in this book that you read and touch!\\"--Back cover.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hQrjzAEACAAJ&dq=Wild+Animals+(Touch+and+Feel)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The crown of Mexico; Maximilian and his Empress Carlota","description":"A detailed and sympathetic portrait of Ferdinand Maximilian Joseph and his Belgium consort.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=d6NVAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+crown+of+Mexico%3B+Maximilian+and+his+Empress+Carlota&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Silver dollar fortune-telling","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8j-sGwAACAAJ&dq=Silver+dollar+fortune-telling&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One Big Happy: Should I Spit on Him?","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=09sIAAAACAAJ&dq=One+Big+Happy:+Should+I+Spit+on+Him%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Low-Density Parity-Check Codes (Research Monograph)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6yBowgEACAAJ&dq=Low-Density+Parity-Check+Codes+(Research+Monograph)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Unearthing Passions (Indigo: Sensuous Love Stories)","description":"Perfectly coiffed and carefully controlled Atlanta architect Kai Ellis' career, like her life, is just the way she wants it - focused and serious.

Core factors that characterized it-political stability, ideological openness, and rapid economic growth-are unraveling. Since the 1990s, Beijing's leaders have firmly rejected any fundamental reform of their authoritarian one-party political system, and on the surface, their efforts have been a success. But as Carl Minzner shows, a closer look at China's reform era reveals a different truth. Over the past three decades, a frozen political system has fueled both the rise of entrenched interests within the Communist Party itself, and the systematic underdevelopment of institutions of governance among state and society at large. Economic cleavages have widened. Social unrest has worsened. Ideological polarization has deepened. Now, to address these looming problems, China's leaders are progressively cannibalizing institutional norms and practices that have formed the bedrock of the regime's stability in the reform era. End of an Era explains how China arrived at this dangerous turning point, and outlines the potential outcomes that could result.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Gu9IDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Life We Are Given: A Long-term Program for Realizing the Potential of Body, Mind, Heart, and Soul","description":"The author of The Future of the Body and the author of Mastery team up to present a proven method for reaching the next stage of human development.

Is it possible, through conscious choice, to participate in the next step of human evolution? Two of the most distinguished theorists and teachers of human transformation believe the answer to these questions is yes. In this inspiring and practical book, George Leonard and Michael Murphy offer a comprehensive program of Integral Transformative Practice (ITP) based on a two-year experimental class that grew out of their lifework. Drawing upon some seventy years of combined experience in the study of human potential, along with the significant findings of their recent experiment, they present step-by-step instructions for joining body, mind, heart, and soul in an evolutionary adventure that has powerful personal and social implications. Their message will be especially refreshing to those who have become disillusioned by promises of immediate gratification, instant learning, and effortless enlightenment.

Unfortunately, we in the West cannot say the same about our knowledge of Japan. We tend to see Japan through a veil of exoticism, as a land of ancient customs and exquisite arts; or we view it as a powerful contributor to the global economy, the source of cutting-edge electronics and innovative management techniques. To go beyond these clich s, we must begin to see how apparently contradictory aspects of modern Japanese culture spring from the country's evolution through more than two millennia of history. This richly detailed yet concise encyclopedia is a guide to the full range of Japanese history and civilization, from the dawn of its prehistory to today, providing clear and accessible information on society and institutions, commerce and industry, sciences, sports, and politics, with particular emphasis on religion, material culture, and the arts. The volume is enhanced by maps and illustrations, along with a detailed chronology of more than 2,000 years of Japanese history and a comprehensive bibliography. Cross-references and an index help the reader trace themes from one article to the next. Japan Encyclopedia will be an indispensable one-volume reference for students, scholars, travelers, journalists, and anyone who wishes to learn more about the past and present of this great world civilization.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&dq=Japan+Encyclopedia+(Harvard+University+Press+Reference+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Morphology of New Testament Greek","description":"This book presents every inflectional pattern in the Greek New Testament, explaining the pattern in terms of a formula, showing how principles of phonetic change alter the application of the formula, and giving every word which follows each inflectional pattern.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bSJ8QgAACAAJ&dq=A+Morphology+of+New+Testament+Greek&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From Hinton To Hamlet : Building Bridges Between Young Adult Literature And The Classics","description":"Uses thematic groupings built around recent young adult literature as bridges to the classics.

He served as a translator of the Sioux past whose audience has proved not to be limited by space or time. Through his writings, Black Elk, Eagle Elk, and other old men who were of that last generation of Sioux to have participated in the old buffalo-hunting life and disorienting period of strife with the U.S. army found a literary voice. What they said chronicles a dramatic transition in the life of the Plains Indians; the record of their thoughts, interpreted by Neihardt, is a legacy preserved for the future. It transcends the specifics of this one tragic case of cultural misunderstanding and conflict and speaks to universal human concerns. It is a story worth contemplating both for itself and for the lessons it teaches all humanity.\\"-Raymond J. DeMallie, editor of The Sixth Grandfather: Black Elk's Teachings Given to John G.

The Emperor Julian followed Iamblichus's teachings to guide the restoration of traditional pagan cults in his campaign against Christianity. Although Julian was unsuccessful, Iamblichus's ideas persisted well into the Middle Ages and beyond. His vision of a hierarchical cosmos united by divine ritual became the dominant worldview for the entire medieval world. Even Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote that he expected a reading of Iamblichus to cause a \\"revival in the churches\\". But modern scholars have dismissed him, seeing theurgy as ritual magic or \\"manipulation of the gods\\".

Her story s value resides not only in the viewpoint of a young girl who comes of age in the shadow of the derricks but also in the currency of her creator s sensitivity to the natural world and environmental issues. Originally a 1941 Houghton-Mifflin Literary Fellowship Book, Quincie Bolliver is an extraordinary study in character, place, and the community of women weak and strong. From the moment the wise, lonesome Quincie and her stubborn, charming father, Curtin, arrive in Good Union, Texas, where the boom has passed and Judith Paradise s boarding house stands as a tattered monument to bygone prosperity, King engages the reader in the passions and struggles of the small town s inhabitants. As beautiful and natural as its commanding realism, Quincie Bolliver is not only a remarkable first novel, but one that should stand for all time. Her grief was wide, touching the still trees, the wet coats of the grazing cattle, the lonely posts of the power line, the soft feathers of the heron. Her pity was for all things: for the leaf set spinning by the rain, for the drops of rain that fell and were lost, for the darkening sky itself, and for the tender earth that must lie forever open to the sky, racked to preserve the running heel-and toe-print of all who chose to pass.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DrxEAEdJhicC&dq=Quincie+Bolliver+(Double+Mountain+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Are You a Conservative or a Liberal?","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Theology of the Gospel of Matthew (New Testament Theology)","description":"Introduces, retells and analyses the Gospel of Matthew.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cKl5M_MQMoYC&dq=The+Theology+of+the+Gospel+of+Matthew+(New+Testament+Theology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Our Lady of Guadalupe in a Box: A Novena Prayer Kit (Book, Statue, & Pin)","description":"A Novena Prayer Kit to be cherished by all, this is a celebration of the most beloved image of the Virgin Mary, her message of love & compassion, & her universal promise to protect all of mankind.

The specific techniques Boorstein describes serve as guideposts for other psychotherapists and clinicians, for laypeople interested in psychological healing, and for spiritual leaders and seekers. Boorstein's message to mental-health practitioners is clear: Transpersonal therapists should make use of the valuable traditional techniques that have proved useful, and traditional therapists should explore the enormous impact spiritual issues have on our lives. \\"Dr. Boorstein has developed a simple yet elegant approach to transpersonal psychotherapy....He develops an understandable transpersonal intervention criteria using Vipassana meditation, Buddhist theory, and A Course in Miracles\\". -- Michael S.

But his aging father wants to exhume the body to rule out foul play. De Beers's frantic wife and teenage twins hire Nina to stop the disinterment. What gets unearthed are secrets that raise new questions about Anna Hallowell's death, an indictment against one twin for murder, and a damning piece of evidence that can convict the boy . . . unless Nina obstructs justice by hiding it.

So has her talent for clever dialogue and pointed social commentary with a light touch. \\"Ms. Baker is the best thing to happen to modern science fiction since Connie Willis or Dan Simmons. She mixes adventure, history and societal concerns in just the right amount, creating an action-packed but thoughtful read,\\" says The Dallas Morning News. The Anvil of the World is her first fantasy novel, a journey across a landscape filled with bizarre creatures, human and otherwise. It is the tale of Smith, of the large extended family of Smiths, of the Children of the Sun. They are a race given to blood feuds, and Smith was formerly an extremely successful assassin. Now he has wearied of his work and is trying to retire in another country, to live an honest life in obscurity in spite of all those who have sworn to kill him. His problems begin when he agrees to be the master of a caravan from the inland city of Troon to the seaside city of Salesh. The caravan is dogged by murder, magic, and the brooding image of the Master of the Mountain, a powerful demon, looking down from his mountain kingdom upon the greenlands and the travelers passing below. In Salesh, Smith becomes an innkeeper, but on the journey he befriended the young Lord Ermenwyr, a decadent demonic half-breed. Each time Ermenwyr turns up, he brings new trouble with him. The outgrowth of stories Baker has been writing since childhood, as engaging as Tolkien and yet nothing like him, Smith's adventure is certainly the only fantasy on record with a white-uniformed nurse, gourmet cuisine, one hundred and forty-four glass butterflies, and a steamboat. This is a book filled with intrigue, romance, sudden violence, and moments of emotional impact, a cast of charming characters, and echoes of the fantasy tradition that runs from Lord Dunsany and Fritz Leiber to Jack Vance and Roger Zelazny.

Dick was originally published in 1953 and we are now republishing it with a brand new introductory biography. 'Mr. Spaceship' is a short story about a war with an alien civilisation. Philip Kindred Dick was born on December 16 1928, in Chicago, Illinois. Dick and his family moved to the Bay Area of San Francisco when he was young, and later on to Washington DC following his parents divorce. Dick attended Elementary school and then a Quaker school before the family moved back to California. It was around this time that Dick began to take an active interest in the science fiction genre, reading his first magazine 'Stirring Science Stories', at age twelve. Dick married five times between 1959 and 1973, and had three children. He sold his first story in 1951 and from that point on he wrote full-time, selling his first novel in 1955. In addition to 44 published novels, Dick wrote an estimated 121 short stories, most of which appeared in science fiction magazines during his lifetime. In addition to 44 published novels, Dick wrote an estimated 121 short stories, most of which appeared in science fiction magazines during his lifetime.

The American black church, according to Fauset and other contemporary researchers, provided the one place where blacks could experiment without hindrance in activities such as business, politics, social reform, and social expression. With detailed primary accounts of these early spiritual movements and their beliefs and practices, Black Gods of the Metropolis reveals the fascinating origins of such significant modern African American religious groups as the Nation of Islam as well as the role of lesser known and even forgotten churches in the history of the black community. In her new foreword, historian Barbara Dianne Savage discusses the relationship between black intellectuals and black religion, in particular the relationship between black social scientists and black religious practices during Fauset's time. She then explores the complexities of that relationship and its impact on the intellectual and political history of African American religion in general.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0kwsAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Corvette (Drive.

What if our homes could tell the stories of others who lived there before us? Set in a small village near Paris, The Balcony follows the inhabitants of a single estate-including a manor and a servants' cottage-over the course of several generations, from the Belle  poque to the present day, introducing us to a fascinating cast of characters. A young American au pair develops a crush on her brilliant employer. An ex-courtesan shocks the servants, a Jewish couple in hiding from the Gestapo attract the curiosity of the neighbors, and a housewife begins an affair while renovating her downstairs. Rich and poor, young and old, powerful and persecuted, all of these people are seeking something: meaning, love, a new beginning, or merely survival. Throughout, cross-generational connections and troubled legacies haunt the same spaces, so that the rose garden, the forest pond, and the balcony off the manor's third floor bedroom become silent witnesses to a century of human drama. In her debut, Jane Delury writes with masterful economy and profound wisdom about growing up, growing old, marriage, infidelity, motherhood - in other words, about life - weaving a gorgeous tapestry of relationships, life-altering choices, and fleeting moments across the frame of the twentieth century. A sumptuous narrative of place that burrows deep into individual lives to reveal hidden regrets, resentments, and desires, The Balcony is brimming with compassion, natural beauty, and unmistakable humanity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yK8qDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reckless Rites: Purim and the Legacy of Jewish Violence (Jews, Christians, and Muslims from the Ancient to the Modern World)","description":"Historical accounts of Jewish violence--particularly against Christians--have long been explosive material. Some historians have distorted these records for anti-Semitic purposes. Others have discounted, dismissed, or simply ignored the evidence, often for apologetic purposes. In Reckless Rites, Elliott Horowitz takes a new and forthright look at both the history of Jewish violence since late antiquity and the ways in which generations of historians have grappled with that history. In the process, he has written the most wide-ranging book on Jewish violence in any language, and the first to fully acknowledge and address the actual anti-Christian practices that became part of the playful, theatrical violence of the Jewish festival of Purim. He has also examined the different ways in which the book of Esther, upon which the festival is based, was used by Jews and Christians over the centuries--whether as an ancient mirror of modern tribulations or as the scriptural basis for anti-Semitic claims regarding the bloodthirstiness of the Jews. Reckless Rites reassesses the historical interpretation of Jewish violence--from the alleged massacre of thousands of Christians in seventh-century Jerusalem to later medieval attacks on Christian symbols such as the crucifix, transgressions that were often committed in full knowledge that their likely consequence would be death. A book that calls for major changes in the way that Jewish history is written and conceptualized, Reckless Rites will be essential reading for scholars and students of history, religion, and Jewish-Christian relations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fG5dDwAAQBAJ&dq=Reckless+Rites:+Purim+and+the+Legacy+of+Jewish+Violence+(Jews,+Christians,+and+Muslims+from+the+Ancient+to+the+Modern+World)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Getting Started with Adobe InDesign CS2 Personal Seminar","description":"DVD : Terry White gives you an in-depth look at the new features of Adobe InDesign CS2.

The first traces the history of the German language from its origins in Indo-European through the pre-documentary Germanic period and the Middle Ages to the present day. In the second part the development of the German vocabulary is described, including word formation, borrowing, and change in meaning; and the book concludes with a section on changes in sounds, grammatical forms, and syntax. Emphasis is placed on the development of the standard literary language in its historical and social context, while such topics as dialects and the relationship of German to other Germanic and European languages are treated very briefly as the need arises. The inclusion of maps, some specimen passages of German its early stages, suggestions for further reading after each chapter, and an extensive classified bibliography also contribute to making this a useful introduction to the subject and a reliable foundation for more advanced work.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eY7FBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Commodore's story","description":"The changes which brought the city of Miami of today are delightfully described in this book of personal reminiscences, written by one of Florida s earliest settlers in collaboration with his life-long friend, Vincent Gilpin.

Wright burst onto the SF scene with the Golden Age trilogy. His next project was the ambitious fantasy sequence, The Last Guardians of Everness. Wright's new fantasy is a tale about five orphans raised in a strict British boarding school who begin to discover that they may not be human beings. The students at the school do not age, while the world around them does. The children begin to make sinister discoveries about themselves. Amelia is apparently a fourth-dimensional being; Victor is a synthetic man who can control the molecular arrangement of matter around him; Vanity can find secret passageways through solid walls where none had previously been; Colin is a psychic; Quentin is a warlock. Each power comes from a different paradigm or view of the inexplicable universe: and they should not be able to co-exist under the same laws of nature. Why is it that they can? The orphans have been kidnapped from their true parents, robbed of their powers, and raised in ignorance by super-beings no more human than they are: pagan gods or fairy-queens, Cyclopes, sea-monsters, witches, or things even stranger than this. The children must experiment with, and learn to control, their strange abilities in order to escape their captors.

Some quilts are rather crude and strictly utilitarian, consisting of top, lining, and batting merely tacked in some way to hold the layers together. From the beginning, though, there were women who made their quilts as attractive as they could within the limitations of available materials. Quiltmaking, a very useful, practical, necessary activity, could also become a vehicle for artistic self-expression. Huntsville resident Martha Mitchell, a self-taught painter who worked in oils for years as a hobby, became increasingly well-known for the fine quilts she produced. Mitchell s quilting form is firmly rooted in the folk tradition. As a child in Kentucky, she learned the basic skills of quiltmaking from her mother. In the years that followed, she completed more than one hundred handmade quilts, working with traditional folk patterns, but also exercising her own creativity in modifications that often result in a more complex and sophisticated art. Martha Mitchell of Possum Walk Road is Melvin Rosser Mason s story of Martha Mitchell and her art. On page after page Mason runs text and illustrative material, with a profusion of color plates and details that particularize the art of one of the nation s finest quiltmakers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DHoMAAAACAAJ&dq=Martha+Mitchell+of+Possum+Walk+Road:+Texas+Quiltmaker&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Make Up, Don't Break Up: Finding and Keeping Love for Singles and Couples","description":"A couple's guide to preserving relationships reveals what men and women have in common regarding intimacy, why women should make the first move emotionally, and how it is possible to talk a relationship into the ground.

As a naturalistic account of the mechanisms that condition human desire and of the unintended stabilizing social consequences of self-interested action, it has since been recognized as one the eighteenth century's most significant works of social theory. More sharply focused on Mandeville's social theory than any previous collection of his writings, this abridged and modernized edition includes the most pertinent sections of The Fable, a selection from Mandeville's An Enquiry into the Origin of Honor, and essential background reading from two of Mandeville's most important sources: Pierre Bayle and the Jansenist Pierre Nicole. E. J. Hundert's Introduction places Mandeville in a number of central eighteenth-century debates - particularly that of the nature and morality of commercial modernity - and underscores the degree to which Mandeville's reconception of egoism as a positive social force stood as a central problem, not only for his immediate English contemporaries, but for such philosophers as Hume, Rousseau, and Kant.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yVvBn5_yvdgC&dq=The+Fable+of+the+Bees:+And+Other+Writings&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"15 Easy Jazz, Blues & Funk Etudes: E-Flat Instruments (Instrumental Series)","description":"Written for a wide variety of musicians, 15 Easy Jazz, Blues & Funk Etudes will appeal to both aspiring players and to more experienced musicians.

Women were \\"entering the work force in swelling numbers, seeking new opportunities, and shaping new definitions of themselves.\\" It was near the end of this tumultuous decade that Gilman's very popular book emerged.

From its beginnings below the first cataract of the Nile to its long and legendary magnificence at the Nile Delta, ancient Egypt grew ever more prosperous and powerful, first as two kingdoms, then as one. A Short History of Ancient Egypt provides a concise, authoritative, and richly illustrated overview of ancient Egypt from its rise from the marshes to its submission to Rome. T. G. H. James describes how, in about 3100 B.C., the Egyptians first forged a unified administration and established a dynasty of kings. He follows the development of Egypt's greatest achievements: the organization of a national irrigation system, learning to write, and the construction of cities and tombs out of mud brick. As their art became more distinctive and expressive and their beliefs were shaped into religion, Greek philosophers came to Egypt to study. Tourists came to gape. At first, James explains, the chief adversaries of Egyptians were themselves. Civil strife could arise from floods or famines, or from ambitious factions of the royal family. But in time, the bounty of Egyptian agriculture, the grandeur of Egyptian art and buildings, and the ostentation of Egyptian wealth excited the envy and aggression of other nations. Although Egypt fought to retain its independence, it succumbed at last under the conquests of Persia, Greece, and Rome.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qTraz2MVFukC&dq=A+short+history+of+ancient+times&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Writer's Digest Handbook of Magazine Article Writing","description":"Information on the how-to's of: Titles/leads/cover & query letters/interviewing/revision.

Bush years--amid the twin catastrophes of the Iraq insurgency and Hurricane Katrina--Landfall brings Thomas Mallon's cavalcade of contemporary American politics, which began with Watergate and continue with Finale, to a vivid and emotional climax. The president at the novel's center possesses a personality whose high-speed alternations between charm and petulance, resoluteness and self-pity, continually energize and mystify the panoply of characters around him. They include his acerbic, crafty mother, former First Lady Barbara Bush; his desperately correct and eager-to-please secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice; the gnomic and manipulative Donald Rumsfeld; foreign leaders from Tony Blair to Vladimir Putin; and the caustic one-woman chorus of Ann Richards, Bush's predecessor as governor of Texas.

Your goal is to reduce the hazardous and ugly fats that surround your abdomen and organs, deep within your belly that put you at risk for degenerative diseases such as heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes, sleep apnea, cancer, gout, osteoarthritis and others. There is no quick fix to fat loss, only prevention, as obesity is a lifestyle disease. It took you years of poor eating habits and a sedentary lifestyle to make you fat. Fat loss is therefore not an event, a program (dieting) nor merely a number you see on the weighing scale or your BMI. A pair of  loose pants  is a better indicator of fat loss. In essence, if you lost weight without reducing your waist circumference, you haven't done much for yourself. To escape from the obesity trap, counting calories, dieting or cutting fat out of your diet or starvation will not help. Instead, to lose fat, you need to know how the body stores and burns fat. You need to incorporate certain lifestyle changes to mobilize your hormones to co-operate with the body to burn fat to overcome your body s resistance to permanent fat loss. That is what this book is all about.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wL2vBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mrs Pringle","description":"The latest addition to the Fairacre series introduces the inimitable Mrs. Pringle, whose stormy personality dominates the village where so many adventures unfold.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=791Q7lYHsI0C&dq=Mrs+Pringle&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MCSE Exchange 2000 Administration Exam Cram Personal Test Center (Exam: 70-224)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WU6eAAAACAAJ&dq=MCSE+Exchange+2000+Administration+Exam+Cram+Personal+Test+Center+(Exam:+70-224)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Plum Thicket","description":"Janice Holt Giles had a life before her marriage and writing career in Kentucky. Born in Altus, Arkansas, Giles spent many childhood summers visiting her grandparents there. After the success of her historical novel The Kentuckians in 1953, she planned to write a second frontier romance. But a visit to Altus caused her imagination to drift from Kentucky in 1780 to western Arkansas in 1913. At age forty-eight -- the same age as Giles at the writing of the novel -- the heroine Katie Rogers recalls her first visit alone to her grandparent's home in Stanwick, Arkansas. Eight-year-old Katie spends her summer climbing the huge mulberry tree and walking with her wise grandfather, a veteran of bloody Shiloh. She is fascinated, not frightened, by the grave of an unknown child in the nearby plum thicket. Throughout the visit Katie helps Aunt Maggie plan her wedding and looks forward to the three-day Confederate Reunion. But the Reunion -- and the summer -- end violently, as guilt, repression, and miscegenation are unearthed. \\"That summer was the end of a whole way of life,\\" Katie realizes, for she can never again dwell in the paradise of childhood. In Katie Rogers, Giles voiced her own lament for \\"the beautiful and the unrecoverable past.\\" To her publisher Giles wrote, \\"Out of my forty-odd years of living, much of whatever wisdom I have acquired has been distilled into this book.\\" This new edition of The Plum Thicket gives Giles's many fans a powerful, moving glimpse into the mind and heart of this beloved author. Janice Holt Giles (1905-1979), author of nineteen books, lived and wrote near Knifley, Kentucky, for thirty-four years. Her biography is told in Janice Holt Giles: A Writer's Life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Cs0ucyrb2fgC&dq=Plum+Thicket&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rome","description":"The idea that with the decline of the Roman Empire Europe entered into some immense ?dark age? has long been viewed as inadequate by many historians. How could a world still so profoundly shaped by Rome and which encompassed such remarkable societies as the Byzantine, Carolingian and Ottonian empires, be anything other than central to the development of European history? How could a world of so many peoples, whether expanding, moving or stable, of Goths, Franks, Vandals, Byzantines, Arabs, Anglo-Saxons, Vikings, whose genetic and linguistic inheritors we all are, not lie at the heart of how we understand ourselves? The Inheritance of Rome is a work of remarkable scope and ambition. Drawing on a wealth of new material, it is a book which will transform its many readers? ideas about the crucible in which Europe would in the end be created. From the collapse of the Roman imperial system to the establishment of the new European dynastic states, perhaps this book?s most striking achievement is to make sense of an immensely long period of time, experienced by many generations of Europeans, and which, while it certainly included catastrophic invasions and turbulence, also contained long periods of continuity and achievement. From Ireland to Constantinople, from the Baltic to the Mediterranean, this is a genuinely Europe-wide history of a new kind, with something surprising or arresting on every page.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vJkRITjMcMQC&dq=Rome&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The King's English","description":"The author provides anecdotes of her life as an independent bookstore owner, from her dinner party with Isabel Allende, to relationships with customers and struggles to stay open in the face of competition from chain bookstores.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CzEdHndV4BIC&dq=The+King%27s+English&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THRESHOLD","description":"'A wild, sleazy, drug-filled odyssey ...

Now, stranded between reckless youth and middle age, between exaltation and despair, his travels have acquired a de facto purpose: the immemorial quest for transcendent meaning. On a lurid pilgrimage for cheap thrills and universal truth, Doyle's narrator takes us from the menacing peripheries of Paris to the drug-fuelled clubland of Berlin, from art festivals to sun-kissed islands, through metaphysical awakenings in Asia and the brink of destruction in Europe, into the shattering revelations brought on by the psychedelic DMT. A dazzling, intimate, and profound celebration of art and ageing, sex and desire, the limits of thought and the extremes of sensation, Threshold confirms Doyle as one of the most original writers in contemporary literature.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t_PCDwAAQBAJ&dq=THRESHOLD&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Approaches to Treatment of Aphasia (Clinical Competence Series)","description":"Written by leading experts, Approaches to the Treatment of Aphasia presents detailed case studies that describe interventions developed and practiced by well-known clinicians.

Over the course of the book, Ernaux grows up to become the uncompromising observer now familiar to the world, while her father matures into old age with a staid appreciation for life as it is and for a daughter he cautiously, even reluctantly admires.

Herbert Rowen's biography embraces all aspects of De Witt's political, intellectual, and personal life, including his role as a mathematician admired by Newton, an \\"unphilosophical Cartesian,\\" and a political thinker. The author describes De Witt's youth, Dutch society of his day, and his central part in the domestic and foreign politics of the Dutch Republic from 1651 to 1672. He puts De Witt's relation to the House of Orange in a new light, more subtle than in the traditional history. He also examines in detail De Witt's system of government as councilor pensionary of Holland. Originally published in 1978.

Here, the late Dudjom Rinpoche provides his authoritative commentary on the role of ethics and morality in Buddhist practice, outlining in detail the meaning and scope of the vows, and giving practical advice on maintaining the vows as supportive tools in the journey toward enlightenment.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pYc1BgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Quotable Sandman: Memorable Lines from the Acclaimed Series (Sandman (Graphic Novels))","description":"Featuring memorable and quotable lines from the creator who elevated comics to a literary form, this book features full colour illustrations by some of the biggest names in comics and fantasy art.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FZ5lPQAACAAJ&dq=The+Quotable+Sandman:+Memorable+Lines+from+the+Acclaimed+Series+(Sandman+(Graphic+Novels))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Editing Sky","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t-BCOAAACAAJ&dq=Editing+Sky&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dead End Kids: Gang Girls and the Boys They Know","description":"Dead End Kids exposes both the depravity and the humanity in gang life through the eyes of a teenaged girl named Cara, a member of a Kansas City gang.

Guerra No!: Chicano Protest and Patriotism during the Viet Nam War Era","description":"\\"A fascinating and beautifully argued interpretation of how the American war in Southeast Asia affected Chicano communities. The author provides the most complete and well-documented study to date of this important chapter in U.S. history and its impact on an ethnic group with long-standing traditions of military service, assimilation, and resistance to injustice. Oropeza's book is what students of the Chicano Movement, especially the Mexican American role in antiwar activities during the Vietnam War period, have been waiting for.\\" George Mariscal, author of Aztl n and Viet Nam: Chicano and Chicana Experiences of the War \\"?Raza S ! ?Guerra No! is a superb first book. Maintaining a balance between national context and the activism in the every day, Lorena Oropeza seeks to understand and contextualize antiwar activism among a generation of Mexican American youth. Bolstered with an array of archival sources and oral interviews, she carefully delineates the nature of political organizing among Mexican Americans across the Southwest. To her credit, Oropeza avoids a narrative of solidarity as she interrogates the internal messiness and contradictions of movement politics and the result is a finely nuanced interpretation of Chicano youth rebellion, one rooted firmly in  the politics of confrontation.  I highly recommend it!\\" Vicki L. Ruiz, University of California, Irvine \\"With this important study, Lorena Oropeza grapples with some of the central questions in the history of ethnic Mexicans in the United States. Although the central thrust of the work is an exploration of the evolution, political trajectory, and eventual implosion of the Chicano mobilization against war in Viet Nam, the study is ultimately a meditation on much larger questions involving Mexican American's political and cultural orientations, loyalties, and sense of status and place in American society. In these unsettled times, Oropeza's analysis of the relationship between war, citizenship, and masculinity should also contribute a much-needed reassessment of these important issues in contemporary American and Mexican life.\\" David G.

In Diary of a Country Therapist, Dr. Marcia Hill chronicles more than a decade of her thoughts and feelings about practicing therapy in rural Vermont. The author reveals her empathy for her clients, her frustration in money matters, and her anger at the maltreatment of women. This book focuses not on the specifics of her clients' cases, but on the trials, successes, and fulfillment of working in this emotionally challenging profession.  What a strange line of work this is, where the ability to feel is such a primary tool. Who would think that one's heart could be harnessed and used intentionally as a resource? It's such a paradox. My feeling response is what it is; it cannot be commanded or faked. Yet it is not a matter of giving in to emotion, but one of using feeling purposefully, like a scalpel. It's an experience of simultaneous yielding and restraint. The job of the professional empath is like that of an artist or poet: to take raw experience, direct emotional response, and somehow make it a vehicle for change and enlightenment.  From liberating breakthroughs to personal anguish, Diary of a Country Therapist is witness to a decade of changes, both in Marcia Hill's practice and in her personal life. With the advent of managed health care, she struggles to give her clients the best care she can. She talks about many of the clients she met over the years what therapies worked and which didn't, her discomfort when she interacted with her clients in and around her small country town, and the valuable lessons she learned about life from her sessions with them.  If therapists are exposed to what is most tragic in life, we are also privy to what is most inspiring. We have the benefit of experiencing many lives. If my work has offered me the opportunity to learn wisdom and compassion, my wish is that through these essays I may pass some of that gift along to you.  Diary of a Country Therapist is the honest scrutiny of a psychotherapist's life from her own heart and soul. While this text will be enlightening for mental health professionals of all kinds, its accessible, jargon-free style makes it an excellent selection for nonprofessionals who want insight into the mind of a practicing therapist.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FhisAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Love Jonesing","description":"Passion.

To answer that question, this volume focuses on polyphony as an index of modernity. In the Principle of Hope, Ernst Bloch showed that each moment in time is potentially fractured: people living in the same country can effectively live in different centuries - some making their alliances with the past and others betting on the future - but all of them, at least technically, enclosed in the temporal moment. But can a claim of modernity also mean something more ambitious? Can an artist, by accident or design, escape the limits of his or her own time, and somehow precociously embody the outlook of a subsequent age? This book sees polyphony as a bridge providing a terminology and a stylistic practice by which the period barrier between Medieval and Early Modern can be breached.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XvwbzgEACAAJ&dq=Polyphony,+Volume+1&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Histoire des idees politiques (Precis Dalloz) (French Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Hm4tAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Master the Art of Selling","description":"After failing during the first six months of his career in sales, Tom Hopkins discovered and applied the very best sales techniques, then earned more than one million dollars in just three years.

Few authors in any literature can rival Bandhopadhyaya's understanding of the child mind. He writes of Opu and Bruga and their friends, at home or out at play with a natural realism unmarred by adult condescension. The social environment is all-embracing: qork and holidays, religious festivals, daily worship and the grim rites of death. The reader senses the reality of family ties, the power of the supernatural in ordinary things, the relations between the castes and between rich and poor. In creating this picture of rural Bengal, Bandopadhyay has introduced us to an area of life which so far has been a closed book to foreign visitors to India, and which scholars know little about. The translation which faithfully reflects the changing moods of the original as well as its many variations of style, is the work of T.W. Clark and Tarapada Mukherji, both teachers of Bengali at the School of Oriental and African Studies in the University of London.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SoxjAAAAMAAJ&dq=Pather+panchali&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Race and Manifest Destiny: The Origins of American Racial Anglo-Saxonism","description":"American myths about national character tend to overshadow the historical realities. Mr. Horsman's book is the first study to examine the origins of racialism in America and to show that the belief in white American superiority was firmly ensconced in the nation's ideology by 1850. The author deftly chronicles the beginnings and growth of an ideology stressing race, basic stock, and attributes in the blood. He traces how this ideology shifted from the more benign views of the Founding Fathers, which embraced ideas of progress and the spread of republican institutions for all. He finds linkages between the new, racialist ideology in America and the rising European ideas of Anglo-Saxon, Teutonic, and scientific ideologies of the early nineteenth century. Most importantly, however, Horsman demonstrates that it was the merging of the Anglo-Saxon rhetoric with the experience of Americans conquering a continent that created a racialist philosophy. Two generations before the new immigrants began arriving in the late nineteenth century, Americans, in contact with blacks, Indians, and Mexicans, became vociferous racialists. In sum, even before the Civil War, Americans had decided that peoples of large parts of this continent were incapable of creating or sharing in efficient, prosperous, democratic governments, and that American Anglo-Saxons could achieve unprecedented prosperity and power by the outward thrust of their racialism and commercial penetration of other lands. The comparatively benevolent view of the Founders of the Republic had turned into the quite malevolent ideology that other peoples could not be regenerated through the spread of free institutions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lzgbP40wcjgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Valve-gears for steam-engines","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tRBLAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Return to Oz: A Novel","description":"Dorothy returns to Oz during a storm only to find that the magical kingdom has been conquered by the evil Nome King and Mombi the Witch, and she sets out with the Scarecrow, Tin Man, Cowardly Lion, and other new friends to find the rightful ruler","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KZdTW32a4FwC&dq=Return+to+Oz:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Warhorn","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IBrxHAAACAAJ&dq=Warhorn&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rodoslovnaia tiurkov, kirgizov, kazakhov i khanskikh dinastii (Russian Edition)","description":"Offers a reconstruction of the social, cultural and legal history of the Middle Horde Kazakh steppe in the 19th century using largely untapped archival records from Kazakhstan and Russia and contemporary reports.

In A Playdate with Death, she s back in top form taming tantrums, battling boredom, chasing clues  No one ever said motherhood was a walk in the park, but Juliet Applebaum is doing her best. She s been showing up (more or less) on time to pick up her daughter from preschool. She s trying (in vain) to discourage her two-and-a-half-year-old son s interest in firearms. And in between planning playdates and playing dress up, she s even managed to fit in some much-needed kid-free time, working out with a personal trainer at the local health club. It s going well. She s losing weight. She s even happy until her trainer commits suicide. A charming, cheerful aspiring actor, Bobby Katz seemed to have it all and Juliet just can t believe he died at his own hand. She suspects that there s a much more sinister explanation and that it may lie with Bobby s parents, who never told him he was adopted. Or with his grieving fiancee, a recovering addict who just fell off the wagon. Or with his birth mother, a woman he had recently started to look for who had gone to great lengths to ensure that she would never be found.

Karan, who glanced upon his love, Saumya, for the first time when he was only eleven years old. The very moment he saw her, he fell head over heels in love with her. But, as much as he loved Saumya, she hated him with equal measure. To impress the girl he adored, he not only changed himself but dedicated his entire life to her. And finally one day, they fell deeply and madly in love with one another. But as they say, good time doesn't last forever. Their love fell prey to the machinations of a selfish love, and the relationship they had nurtured together for years, trembled and fell apart in seconds.

But with Rhonda Byrne s film,  The Secret  which was promoted extensively by Oprah Winfrey, the Law of Attraction has reached whole new heights of popularity.

In his hymn to New York's renovated Museum of Modern Art, he notes that its \\"formalist outlook tends . . . to lead to a false sense of orthodoxy.\\" Yet these reviews, which rigorously apply his own formalist standards of what constitutes modern art, miss out on much of what is vital and meaningful in today's highly variegated art scene. Kramer is appalled by political art, most of which, he argues, lacks artistic merit; he doubts whether any great art can be political. In surveying the '80s' rebirth of realism, he reassures us that many new realists are not antimodernist or antiabstractionist. One piece agonizes over whether Saul Steinberg should be considered an artist. A somewhat condescending essay on Max Ernst sets him above the \\"muddled narcissism\\" said to mar many other surrealists. Other subjects range from Rodin to Walker Evans; selections were culled from the New York Times, New Criterion (which Kramer edits), Commentary and elsewhere.\\"--Publishers Weekly via amazon.com.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2sdtFIfb1TEC&dq=Revenge+of+the+Philistines:+Art+and+Culture,+1972-1984.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Love in Disguise (Candlelight Regency #548)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The great philanthropists and the problem of \\"donor intent\\" (Studies in philanthropy)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9Ig8PwAACAAJ&dq=The+great+philanthropists+and+the+problem+of+%22donor+intent%22+(Studies+in+philanthropy)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fire-Dwellers","description":"Stacey Cameron, on the cusp of her forties, feels it's time for a change.

It is an essential element in the listener's analysis of the speaker's physical, psychological and social characteristics. Differences in voice quality reflect different habitual adjustments, or settings, of the vocal apparatus. Individual consonant and vowel segments can be thought of as momentary actions superimposed on these settings and voice quality, as the characteristic sound of a speaker's voice, thus pervades and to a certain extent determines the phonetic character of these linguistic segments. This volume sets out a phonetic description of voice quality, which has largely been neglected in other studies. Dr Laver's integrative approach is a major advance in general phonetic theory and his standardisation of descriptive terminology for the voice will be welcomed by those working in the fields of speech therapy, speech pathology, social psychology and communications engineering, as well as by students and specialists in speech science, phonetics and phonology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=doiBtQEACAAJ&dq=The+Phonetic+Description+of+Voice+Quality+(Cambridge+Studies+in+Linguistics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Soaring Eagle","description":"A gold locket holds a secret for a young widow and a Lakota warrior.

And in the heart of every committed Christian there is the longing for personal revival to know the quality and depths of spiritual reality, and the presence of God in one's personal life. This was the deepest desire of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones, one of the great 20th-century Bible expositors. It was also the purpose behind this series of messages which were first given on the 100th anniversary of the Great Revival which started in Wales, and swept across England and throughout the United States and to the far corners of the world. As Dr. Lloyd-Jones recognized, it is a rare time in the history of the church when there is a great outpouring of the Holy Spirit  and a time of special interest of every Christian who longs for revival today. As Dr. J. I. Packer writes in his foreword, Dr. Lloyd-Jones believed in \\"the necessity of revival that is, a quickening divine visitation as the only vent that can avert ultimate spiritual disaster. The thrustful urgency of the sermons in this book testifies to the depth of his conviction that without revival in the church there is really no hope for the Western world at all.\\" Dr. Lloyd-Jones deftly draws principles from the lives of Old and New Testament characters as well as expounding some of the great prayers of the Bible. Clearly and forcefully, he presents a masterful exposition of the circumstances accompanying revival in the past, why each generation needs it, and how it will come about today. We must come to the sovereign God, forsake our sin, and wait upon Him for this special, essential outpouring.

So begins the famous opening chapter of Moby-Dick; or, The Whale. Young sailor Ishmael is hired as a crew member of a whaler named Pequod, captained by a man named Ahab. In between lengthy chapters on whale biology and descriptions of the crew and the whaling trade, readers are slowly introduced to a captivating tale. Ahab is out for revenge on the great white whale that stole his leg, leaving him with a whale-bone prosthesis and a withering hatred for the beast. Known as Moby Dick, the whale is infamous for his encounters and escapes with whale ships, and Ahab offers a gold coin, nailed to the Pequod's mast, as a reward for whoever sights him first. Beginning on a cold Christmas morning, the crew embarks on a journey to find the whale and make their fortunes. An exciting staple of American literature, Moby-Dick is a must-read for anyone interested in the classics. Herman Melville was inspired to write Moby Dick by the 1821 biographical account Narrative of the Most Extraordinary and Distressing Shipwreck of the Whale-ship Essex (Cosimo Classics, 2015), which in turn inspired the 2000 novel and 2015 movie, In the Heart of the Sea. HERMAN MELVILLE (1819-1891) was an American novelist. Born in New York, Melville lived and worked in the city for many years before moving with his family to Massachusetts, where he enjoyed a short friendship with author Nathaniel Hawthorne. Many of Melville's books are inspired by his own experiences; he sailed on merchant and whaling ships, spent time on the Marquesas Islands with natives, and spent time in England, Egypt, and Palestine. Melville even wrote poetry reflecting on the American Civil War. He eventually retired in New York City, where he was buried in the Bronx, relatively unknown. Melville was the author of 19 books of fiction, nonfiction, and poetry, including *Typee* (1846), Moby-Dick (1851), \\"Bartelby the Scrivener\\" (1853), \\"Benito Cerino\\" (1855), Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War (1866), and Billy Budd, Sailor (1891, unfinished).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RFpSDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tekken 4 (Prima's Official Strategy Guide)","description":"Title Selling Points Sales Ranking: *** - Detailed descriptions, stats, and tips for all characters - Introductions and strategies for new fighters including Christy Monteiro, Craig Marduk, and Steve Fox - Complete moves and combos lists for all fighters - All game modes covered - All time-released characters and hidden modes revealed - Critical strategies for every possible match - Tips on new moves like side-stepping, wall combos and juggles, and position swapping throws","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uG3kjYUyJh4C&dq=Tekken+4+(Prima%27s+Official+Strategy+Guide)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bokobikes","description":"When Ploo bumps into a bokonut tree, a series of events happen including a bokonut landing in Hatz' hands and an idea popping into his head.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=awMUAAAACAAJ&dq=Bokobikes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Power of Babel","description":"There are approximately six thousand languages on Earth today, each a descendant of the tongue first spoken by Homo sapiens some 150,000 years ago. While laying out how languages mix and mutate over time, linguistics professor John McWhorter reminds us of the variety within the species that speaks them, and argues that, contrary to popular perception, language is not immutable and hidebound, but a living, dynamic entity that adapts itself to an ever-changing human environment. Full of humor and imaginative insight, The Power of Babel draws its illustrative examples from languages around the world, including pidgins, Creoles, and nonstandard dialects.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=f96h2aLNNxsC&dq=Power+of+Babel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Moods: A novel","description":"The Happiness Project meets So Sad Today in this \\"hilariously witty, unflinchingly honest\\" book from Words of Women founder Lauren Martin, as she contemplates the nature of negative emotions -- and the insights that helped her to take control of her life (Bobbi Brown). Five years ago, Lauren Martin was sure something was wrong with her. She had a good job in New York, an apartment in Brooklyn, a boyfriend, yet every day she wrestled with feelings of inferiority, anxiety and irritability. It wasn't until a chance encounter with a (charming, successful) stranger who revealed that she also felt these things, that Lauren set out to better understand the hold that these moods had on her, how she could change them, and began to blog about the wisdom she uncovered. It quickly exploded into an international online community of women who felt like she did: lost, depressed, moody, and desirous of change. Inspired by her audience to press even deeper, The Book of Moodsshares Lauren's journey to infuse her life with a sense of peace and stability. With observations that will resonate and inspire, she dives into the universal triggers every woman faces -- whether it's a comment from your mother, the relentless grind at your job, days when you wish the mirror had a Valencia filter, or all of the above. Blending cutting-edge science, timeless philosophy, witty anecdotes and effective forms of self-care, Martin has written a powerful, intimate, and incredibly relatable chronicle of transformation, proving that you really can turn your worst moods into your best life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NGfbDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Young Justice: Sins of Youth","description":"Sins of Youth' part 1 of 12!

Drawing on his long-term fieldwork in one of the special schools set up to receive these children, this book is the first to challenge these ideas.

America's humorists brighten the electoral scene, reminding us that we needn't always look at presidential campaigns with a solemn air. Thanks to the satiric insights of America's wits, we are able to keep a sense of perspective about the candidates, particularly when their follies and foibles are most intolerable. It is the presidential campaign humor created by America's comedians, humorists, journalists, editorial cartoonists, and the candidates themselves that writer Gerald Gardner celebrates in Campaign Comedy. He reviews the humor, from the caustic to the comedic, that most recently targeted Bill Clinton, George Bush, and Ross Perot in the explosive 1992 election. He also focuses, in a campaign-by-campaign format, on the humor generated by the presidential campaigns ranging back to the epochal struggle between John Kennedy and Richard Nixon in 1960. Candidates including Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, and Lyndon Johnson, and the men they defeated are also the subject of the hilarious or vicious wit that is chronicled here. Campaign Comedy is brimming with relevant and pithy humor from Johnny Carson, Jay Leno, Art Buchwald, Mark Russell, Bob Hope, Mort Sahl, Garry Trudeau, and the closet wits who supplied the presidential candidates with the \\"spontaneous humor\\" that they employed during their campaigns. Gardner also highlights the campaign humor of television's most famous political shows, \\"That Was the Week That Was,\\" \\"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,\\" and \\"Saturday Night Live.\\" Gerald Gardner provides a delightful reminder that humor is a basic form of communication through which the media, the humorists, and the candidates convey their skepticism, anger, and differences. He makes it clear why humor is the most essential element in a democracy and why it is the one ingredient that no totalitarian society seems to possess.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5ywp7SoAo4EC&dq=Gerald+Gardner%27s+The+Watergate+Follies:+Who%27s+in+charge+here%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Queer Press Guide","description":"\\"The book contains listings of the Queer Press from every continent apart from Antarctica; the most comprehensive listing of the Queer Press in the United States and Canada ever to appear in print; the names of the key personnel at each publication; details of phone and fax numbers, and e-mail and website addresses; circulation figures (together with whether they are audited or not); minimum pay scales to writers and photographers; hands-on advice from Publishers and Editors about what they are looking for; and advice on how to Self-Syndicate your work.\\"--Jacket.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=F_jZAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Queer+Press+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Budget Complete Bible-KJV","description":"The KJV Softcover Gift & Award Bible beautifully presents the celebrated King James Version and delivers quality and afforrdability.

A tribe of Native Americans had made her their weroanza a word that meant \\"big chief\\". The news was received with great joy, both by the Queen and her favorite, Sir Walter Ralegh. His first American expedition had brought back a captive, Manteo, who caused a sensation in Elizabethan London. In 1587, Manteo was returned to his homeland as Lord and Governor, with more than one hundred English men, women, and children, to establish the settlement of Roanoke, Virginia. But in 1590, a supply ship arrived at the colony to discover that the settlers had vanished. For almost twenty years the fate of Ralegh's colonists was to remain a mystery. When a new wave of settlers sailed to America to found Jamestown, their efforts to locate the lost colony of Roanoke were frustrated by the mighty chieftain, Powhatan, father of Pocahontas, who vowed to drive the English out of America. Only when it was too late did the settlers discover the incredible news that Ralegh's colonists had survived in the forests for almost two decades before being slaughtered in cold blood by henchmen. While Manteo, Sir Walter Ralegh's \\"savage,\\" had played a pivotal role in establishing the first English settlement in America, he had also unwittingly contributed to one of the earliest chapters in the decimation of the Native American population. The mystery of what happened to the Roanoke colonists, who seemed to vanish without a trace, lies at the heart of this well-researched work of narrative history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hZJNj4S_X-MC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nave.

Forty years ago a small cadre of dedicated researchers began actively investigating cases, interviewing witnesses, and exchanging data through a small, informal network of international contacts. Today this low-profile network, or \\"invisible college,\\" has grown into a larger, multi-nation volunteer research effort joined by many individuals. But the questions first raised 40 years ago remain current-and unanswered. \\"I believe that a powerful force has influenced the human race in the past and is again influencing it now. Does this force represent alien intervention, or does it originate entirely within human consciousness? This is the question that forms the basis of the work of the Invisible College of UFO researchers.\\" -- Jacques Vallee \\"THE INVISIBLE COLLEGE is unlike any other UFO book ever written. Dr. Vallee questions what everybody else takes for granted, doubts what everybody believes, drenches us with data that doesn't 'fit' any of the theories of either the True Believers or the die-hard non-believers and then offers a hypothesis on his own.\\" -- Robert Anton Wilson \\"An important book-not only are UFOs and psychic events inextricably linked, as Dr. Vallee so nicely points out, but neither can be understood without an appreciation of the role of myth, tradition, and belief system. Must reading for the serious student of contemporary events.\\" -- Edgar Mitchell \\"Certainly one of the most interesting, thought-provoking books so far written on UFOs.\\" -- Colin Wilson Dr. Jacques Vallee began his professional life as an astronomer at the Paris Observatory in 1961. While on the staff of the French Space Committee, he witnessed the destruction of the tracking tapes of unknown objects orbiting the earth, initiating a lifelong interest in the UFO phenomenon. Vallee arrived in the U.S. in 1962 and worked in astronomy at the University of Texas at Austin before receiving a Ph.D. in computer science from Northwestern University in 1967. There he became a close associate of J. Allen Hynek, then scientific consultant for the U.S. Air Force on Project Blue Book-the result was The Invisible College.

These patients often present diagnostic dilemmas, get a variety of diagnoses, and frequently prove difficult-to-treat. They may have syndromes that are reminiscent of the post-traumatic sequelae in adults, such as physiological hyperactivity, a sense of loss of control, passivity alternating with uncontrolled violence, and sleep disturbances including nightmares. Investigating the impact of the traumatic event in connection with the development of the disorder is essential to an effective treatment approach. Psychological Trauma provides a basis for understanding human response to trauma. The consequences of specific traumas have usually been described as separate entities. This is the first book to examine human response to trauma as a whole. In this thorough study of the biologic, psychodynamic and social consequences of trauma, separate chapters explore: * The impact of separation from the parental figure on a child's development, including cognitive and neurological disturbances* The psychobiology of traumatic response* Traumatic antecedents of borderline personality disorder* The effect of trauma on the family unit* Amnesia and dissociation as response to trauma* A stress management approach that can be incorporated into the treatment of patients","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Dp2gi8t8zLEC&dq=Psychological+Trauma&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Keaton","description":"\\"A comprehensive account of the life and work of Buster Keaton\\"--","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Sq5hEAAAQBAJ&dq=Keaton&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dream Parlor","description":"In a futuristic society on the verge of global oppression, Elijah Barrett, a man torn between destiny and assimilation, rises to challenge The System.

Well assimilated within the white population, Jews had been diffident about voicing support of black civil rights. When violence erupted and Jewish voices began crying out for action, the Klan scapegoated Jews in a campaign of terror. Jack Nelson, himself a Mississippian and in the 1960s Atlanta bureau chief for the Los Angeles Times, had lost no time in coming home to write page-one reports on the civil rights struggle. In Terror in the Night he re-creates the chilling experiences of investigating the Klan's campaign against the Jews. He reports on the bombing of a Jackson synagogue, the dynamiting of a rabbi's house, and the Klan's marking select Mississippi Jews for execution. He reports how law enforcement's clandestine investigations, bankrolled by Mississippi Jews, helped bag the terrorists in a nearly disastrous shootout.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oJlZAAAAYAAJ&dq=Terror+in+the+Night:+The+Klan%27s+Campaign+Against+the+Jews&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Love You Because","description":"About this item A Reasons Why I Love You style hardcover notebook and keepsake gift for couples. 5x8 size with 50 unlined heart framed pages to write exactly what you feel.

Schneider draws on her rich and nuanced ethnographic studies of Philadelphia, Milwaukee, and Kenosha, Wisconsin to clarify the role of social capital for both individuals and institutions. She shows that the social relationships and patterns of trust that enable people to gain access to resources like government services, organization funding, and jobs are crucial in helping families achieve their goals. Schneider examines the complex ways in which social capital functions in conjunction with economic, human, and cultural capital, and explores social capital dynamics among government, nonprofits, and congregations that together provide the welfare support system. Social Capital and Welfare Reform is compulsory reading for researchers and students in social work, sociology, anthropology, public policy, education, community psychology, social psychiatry, and non-profit and public administration as well as policy makers interested in welfare reform, poverty, and nonprofits.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=B51B33Fk3T8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Network Models in Optimization and Their Applications in Practice","description":"Unique in that it focuses on formulation and case studies ratherthan solutions procedures covering applications for pure,generalized and integer networks, equivalent formulations plussuccessful techniques of network models.

It is fair to say that Tom Mathews s relations with his father, a veteran of World War II s fabled 10th Mountain Division, were terrible. He came back from the war to a young son he d barely met and proceeded to bully and browbeat him for his own good, he thought. In the course of puzzling out almost fifty years of intermittent conflict, Mathews came to understand that their problems were not simply personal, they were generational and widely shared by millions of other baby boomer sons. And so, to write this powerful book, which traces the kinetic effect of the war on the men who fought it, their sons, and their grandsons, Mathews has uncovered nine other dramatic and telling father-son tales of veterans in some ways missing in action and how internal war wounds shaped their lives as fathers. These include a combat infantryman whose life was saved by the fabled Audie Murphy, and a black member of the storied Tuskegee Airmen corps. In a moving final chapter, he and his father return together to Italy to revisit scenes from the war and attempt, at long last, to forge their own separate peace. In a very real sense, Our Fathers  War tells the secret history of World War II and its echoes down the years and generations. In the course of doing so, it offers a portrait of evolving styles of American manhood that many, many fathers and sons have been needing and awaiting.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=c1KPx8fXGPwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Miss Happiness and Miss Flower","description":"A beautifully illustrated cover edition of Rumer Godden's classic story about friendship and family, Miss Happiness and Miss Flower.

A poignant, bittersweet homage to love that overpowers reason, to the resilience of the human spirit, and to the worldweary beauty and majesty of Venice, Across the River and into the Trees stands as Hemingway's statement of defiance in response to the great dehumanizing atrocities of the Second World War. Hemingway's last full-length novel published in his lifetime, it moved John O'Hara in The New York Times Book Review to call him  the most important author since Shakespeare.

Given the impact of the global credit crunch, it has become even more essential to be able to distinguish between short-term and longer-term trends at a time when panic selling and 'fire-sale' purchases are common.Forecasting Financial Markets details the three dimensions essential to achieve successful trading, including an ability to understand the forces at work in logical terms, recognize (and neutralize) any emotional responses to market fluctuations, and design an investment process or trading system that generates objective 'buy' or 'sell' signals.Taking the author's latest research into account, this important book provides you with an in-depth assessment of the phenomenon of cycles, patterns of economic and financial activity, and how to use cycles as a forecasting tool - including the author's forecasts for when the global economy will emerge from its current downturn.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xWtZuAAACAAJ&dq=Forecasting+Financial+Markets:+The+Psychology+of+Successful+Investing+(Third+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bollywood Cinema: Temples of Desire","description":"India is home to Bollywood - the largest film industry in the world. Movie theaters are said to be the \\"temples of modern India,\\" with Bombay producing nearly 800 films per year that are viewed by roughly 11 million people per day. In Bollywood Cinema, Vijay Mishra argues that Indian film production and reception is shaped by the desire for national community and a pan-Indian popular culture. Seeking to understand Bollywood according to its own narrative and aesthetic principles and in relation to a global film industry, he views Indian cinema through the dual methodologies of postcolonial studies and film theory. Mishra discusses classics such as Mother India (1957) and Devdas (1935) and recent films including Ram Lakhan (1989) and Khalnayak (1993), linking their form and content to broader issues of national identity, epic tradition, popular culture, history, and the implications of diaspora.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=v1zcvGwVckgC&dq=Bollywood+Cinema:+Temples+of+Desire&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"God Help Me!","description":" If you want to know who you are and why you're here, start praying every day.

On the other hand, if God is who he says he is, and if he communicates with us through prayer, as Scripture and the saints and plenty of ordinary people say he does, then clearly you're missing out on something huge. Jim Beckman will not only introduce you to the wisdom and teaching of the Church regarding prayer, he will also provide tools that will help you achieve real intimacy with God. Nothing can replace that relationship with God, and nothing can get you there except the mysterious, unfolding experience of daily prayer.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=481SPgAACAAJ&dq=God+Help+Me!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Why Do Cats Meow?

To the thicket of questions surrounding spirituality, this book brings a clear vision and a thoughtful approach that will help us find our way to the very heart of it.

Most Pennsylvania Turnpike travelers are unaware that its construction was inspired by the route of the never completed South Pennsylvania Railroad. In the 1930s, men of great vision conceived, planned, and built the nation's first long-distance superhighway using the abandoned railroad's partially finished tunnels as its foundation. Originally predicted to be a financial failure, the project was a tremendous success, and the turnpike came to be known as the World's Greatest Highway. Over the years, the Pennsylvania Turnpike was expanded and improved, laying the groundwork for the nation's Interstate Highway System. The Pennsylvania Turnpike draws from the extensive photograph collection in the Pennsylvania State Archives. Many were taken by photographers hired by both the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission and its contractors, and most have never been published previously.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=u1RxXNSOd-cC&dq=Images+of+America:+The+Pennsylvania+Turnpike&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THe Kung Fu Exercise Book, Health Secrets of Ancient China","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N857AAAACAAJ&dq=THe+Kung+Fu+Exercise+Book,+Health+Secrets+of+Ancient+China&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tuck para siempre","description":"\\"Problemente el mejor trabajo de nuestro mejor novelista para ni?os.\\"  Harper's \\"Un libro escribito bellamente y con respeto, que no se puede interrumpir ni olvidar.\\"  Jean Stafford, The New Yorker \\"Condenada a o bendecida con vida eterna despu s de beber el agua de un manantial encantado, la familia Tuck deambula tratando de vivir lo mas inadvertida y c modamente posible.

Bloodsport is the story of how the mania for corporate deals and mergers all began. The riveting tale of how power lawyers Joe Flom and Marty Lipton, major Wall Street players Felix Rohatyn and Bruce Wasserstein, prominent jurists, and shrewd ideologues in academic garb provided the intellectual firepower, creativity, and energy that drove the corporate elite into a less cozy, Hobbesian world. With total dollar volume in the trillions, the zeal for the deal continues unabated to this day. Underpinning this explosion in mergers and acquisitions including hostile takeovers are four questions that radically disrupted corporate ownership in the 1970s, whose force remains undiminished: Are shareholders the sole  owners  of corporations and the legitimate source of power? Should control be exercised by autonomous CEOs or is their assumption of power illegitimate and inefficient? Is the primary purpose of the corporation to generate jobs and create prosperity for the masses and the nation? Or is it simply to maximize the wealth of shareholders? This battle of ideas became the  bloodsport  of American business. It set in motion the deal-making culture that led to the financialization of the economy and it is the backstory to ongoing debates over competitiveness, job losses, inequality, stratospheric executive pay, and who  owns  America's corporations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4M3SDQAAQBAJ&dq=Bloodsport&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tangram Puzzles: 500 Tricky Shapes to Confound & Astound/ Includes Deluxe Wood Tangrams","description":"Gives the history of the ancient Chinese game of tangrams and shows how to arrange seven shapes into a variety of figures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JpqqddTzNBcC&dq=Tangram+Puzzles:+500+Tricky+Shapes+to+Confound&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tales of Ancient Egypt (Puffin Classics)","description":"Michael Rosen, Professor of Children's Literature at Goldsmiths, University of London, and bestselling author, poet and broadcaster, introduces these great myths and legends of Ancient Egypt.

When famously shy Charley Carey becomes obsessed with Japanese manga and anime, Peter is not only delighted for his son, but entranced himself. Thus, with a father sharing his twelve-year-old s exotic comic books, begins a journey that will lead them both to Tokyo, where a strange Japanese boy will become both their guide and judge. The visitors quickly plunge deep into the lanes of Shitimachi   into the  weird stuff  of modern Japan   meeting manga artists and anime directors,  visualists  who painstakingly impersonate cartoons, and solitary  otakus  who lead a computerized existence. What emerges from these encounters is a pithy, far-ranging study of history and culture both high and low   from samurai to salaryman, from kabuki theatre to the post-war robot craze. Peter Carey s observations are provocative, even though his hosts often point out, politely, that he is wrong about Japan. In adventures that are comic, surprising, and ultimately moving, father and son cope with and learn from each other in a place far from home.  No Real Japan,  said Charley.  You ve got to promise.

While some of these plants are only encountered in ethnic food markets or during travels to foreign lands, many are now finding their way onto supermarket shelves. Top 100 Exotic Food Plants provides comprehensive coverage of tropical and semitropical food plants, reviewing scientific and technological information as well as their culinary uses. Wide-ranging in scope, this volume s coverage includes plants that produce fruits, vegetables, spices, culinary herbs, nuts, and extracts. A user-friendly format enables readers to easily locate information on botanical and agricultural aspects, economic and social importance, food uses, storage, preparation, and potential toxicity. The book also contains an introductory chapter that reviews important historical, economic, geopolitical, health, environmental, and ethical considerations associated with exotic food plants. Thoroughly referenced with more than 2000 literature citations, this book is enhanced by more than 200 drawings, many chosen from historical art of extraordinary quality. This timely volume also highlights previously obscure edible plants that have recently become prominent as a result of sensationalistic media reports stemming from their inherently entertaining or socially controversial natures. Some of these plants include the acai berry, kava, hemp, and opium poppy. A scholarly yet accessible presentation, the book is filled with numerous memorable, fascinating, and humorous facts, making it an entertaining and stimulating read that will appeal to a broad audience.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Au3RBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Assyrian sculpture","description":"For almost three centuries, until 612 B.C., the small kingdom of Assyria dominated the Middle East, its empire at one point extending from Iran to Egypt. The story of those years--the triumphs of the Assyrian kings in war and peace, their exploits in the hunting field, and the gods who watched over them--were recorded in stone on the walls of a succession of royal palaces. These sculptures, offering eyewitness views of a long-lost civilization, were not rediscovered until the nineteenth century. The finest collection, transported with great difficulty to Europe, is now preserved at the British Museum. This book describes how the sculptures were found and what they meant to those who created them. It is both a richly illustrated history of Assyrian sculpture in general and a guide to the outstanding collections of the British Museum. For this Second Edition of Assyrian Sculpture, in a new format, the author has updated the text and bibliography.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2HvqAAAAMAAJ&dq=Assyrian+sculpture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Search for the Stone of Destiny","description":"This title is now a major Hollywood film starring Robert Carlyle and Billy Boyd. Ian Robertson Hamilton was an unknown law student at Glasgow University until Christmas Eve 1950. On that night, assisted by Alan Stewart, Gavin Vernon and Kay Matheson, he took the Stone of Destiny from beneath the Coronation Chair in Westminster Abbey and in doing so became a Scottish national hero. In England, however, the act had the opposite effect and a manhunt for the 'vulgar vandals' was started to satisfy the outrage of the English establishment and bring them to justice. In the end, the Stone was given up, but the gang were not charged. This solitary act set Hamilton on a path for the rest of his life from which he has not diverged. Although, it is now nearly sixty years since that fateful night, it is the actual events surrounding the taking of the Stone which hold people spellbound when Hamilton recounts them.In this book, Ian Hamilton has set down the chain of events which led to his decision to go to London, remove the Stone and a minute-by-minute account of the act and the aftermath. But this is not simply a retelling of a stunt that made nationwide news, it is a book about how a nation's conscience was stirred by a symbolic act that changed lives of many.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cdO8BQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Search+for+the+Stone+of+Destiny&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A topology for comparing and contrasting sorting algorithms (Technical report)","description":"The natural mission of Computational Science is to tackle all sorts of human problems and to work out intelligent automata aimed at alleviating the b- den of working out suitable tools for solving complex problems.

Here, the carrier actions supporting these operations are told in detail. Through Admiral Samuel Morison's eloquence, the half-forgotten, far-off names of these Philippine battles come to life again, as he tells of the preliminary bombardments, the assaults over the beaches, and the land fighting for the islands and Manila, as well as of the countermeasures taken against the fanatical air attacks of the Japanese. Here too is Admiral Halsey's famous raid of Task Force 38 in the South China Sea, ranging from Formosa to Indochina. Of particular interest to sailors and landsmen alike is the chapter on the frightful typhoon of 18 December, 1944, in which three U.S. ships went down and over eight hundred lives were lost. Additional chapters tell the story of the three amphibious assaults on Borneo by Australian troops covered by the U.S. Navy; of submarine operations in the southwest Pacific in 1945; and of Captain Milton Miles's amazing U.S. Naval Group, China, which carried out cloak-and-dagger operations on the mainland for years and fought the last naval battle of the war with sailing junks.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SKsXzgEACAAJ&dq=The+Liberation+of+the+Philippines:+Luzon,+Mindanao,+the+Visayas+1944-1945+(+History+of+the+United+States+Naval+Operations+in+World+War+II,+Vol.+XIII.)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mr. Balfour's Poodle: Peers Versus People","description":"Full study of the conflict between the House of Lord and Asquith between 1909 and 1911.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=podAAAAAIAAJ&dq=Mr.+Balfour%27s+Poodle:+Peers+Versus+People&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tannisho: A Shin Buddhist Classic","description":"Tannisho sets out to refute deviations from the True Pure Land school teachings.

The whole lot, including my maid-servant, went in for every week-end to the village, and it was always a matter of anxiety to know whether they would ever return. -from Chapter XII Western anthropology's first in-depth look at an isolated culture is also a daring adventure story of around-the-world travel. In February 1913, archaeologist Katherine Routledge set sail on a custom-built yacht-with a small crew and the support of British Association for the Advancement of Science, the British Museum, and the Royal Geographical Society-for Easter Island, where she embarked up the first effort to catalogue the island's mysterious statues, interview the natives, and document their culture, folklore, and traditions. Her scholarship is impeccable-this 1919 work is still considered foundational-but her lively writing and her practical perspective make this a delightful read that thrill armchair travelers and amateur ethnographers alike.

This ground-breaking book offers translations of four sacred texts of the Dzogchen tradition: Secret Instruction in a Garland of Vision, The Flight of the Garuda, Emptying the Depths of Hell, and the Wish-Granting Prayer of Kuntu Zangpo. With an informative introduction by the translator, Flight of the Garuda is an invaluable resource for both practice and scholarship. Flight of the Garuda conveys the heart advice of one of the most beloved nonsectarian masters of Tibet. Ordained as a Gelug monk, the itinerant yogi Shabkar was renowned for his teachings on Dzogchen, the heart practice of the Nyingma lineage. He wandered the countryside of Tibet and Nepal, turning many minds toward the Dharma through his ability to communicate the essence of the teachings in a poetic and crystal-clear way. Buddhists of all stripes, including practitioners of Zen and Vipassana, will find ample sustenance within the pages of this book, and be thrilled by the lyrical insights conveyed in Shabkar's words. Along with the song by Shabkar, translator Keith Dowman includes several other seminal Dzogchen texts. Dzogchen practice brings us into direct communion with the subtlemost nature of our experience, the unity of samsara in nirvana as experienced within our own consciousness. Within the Nyingma school, it is held higher than even the practices of tantra for bringing the meditator face to face with the nature of reality.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hDc6AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tashar: City of Mystery (Book One)","description":"The Huffington Post calls Tears of Pearl author Tasha Alexander \\"one to watch and read\\" and her new Lady Emily mystery set in Venice proves it!

Norman Stone traces the country's roots from the traditional representative councils of land-owning nobles to the Magyar nationalists of the nineteenth century and the first wars of independence. Hungary's history since 1918 has not been a happy one. Economic collapse and hyperinflation in the post-war years led to fascist dictatorships and then Nazi occupation. Optimism at the end of the Second World War ended when the Iron Curtain descended, and Soviet tanks crushed the last hopes for independence in 1956 along with the peaceful protests in Budapest. Even after the fall of the Berlin Wall, consistent economic growth has remained elusive.

At one time a marginal field of study in the social sciences, terrorism is now very much in center stage. The 1970s terrorist attacks by the PLO, the Provisional Irish Republican Army, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the Japanese Red Army, the Unabomber, Aum Shinrikyo, Timothy McVeigh, the World Trade Center attacks, the assault on a school in Russia, and suicide bombers have all made the term terrorism an all-too-common part of our vocabulary.This edition of Political Terrorism was originally published in the 1980s, well before some of the horrific events noted above. This monumental collection of definitions, conceptual frameworks, paradigmatic formulations, and bibliographic sources is being reissued in paperback now as a resource for the expanding community of researchers on the subject of terrorism. This is a carefully constructed guide to one of the most urgent issues of the world today.When the first edition was originally published, Choice noted, This extremely useful reference tool should be part of any serious social science collection.

However, by the turn of the 21st century, the one-person, one-car approach to transportation has resulted in severe automobile traffic congestion in major metropolitan areas. Federal, state and local governments have taken major steps to reinvent passenger rail as a viable transportation alternative. Whether high-speed trains, commuter trains or light rail electric streetcars, 19th-century technology has been reintroduced to create a more balanced transportation network. Because sprawl city planning discourages viable mass transit, politicians and city planners have had to deal with the difficulty of recreating their regional transportation infrastructure. Transit-oriented developments have influenced new city planning efforts which emphasized rail transit over automobile use. Recalling the history behind modern rail transit, some cities have restored historic electric streetcars to diversify their rail transit system. More than a vehicle for commuters, historic railways attract tourists and add distinction to the communities they serve.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QWDNAAAACAAJ&dq=Passenger+Rail:+The+Transportation+Alternative&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Girl Coming in for a Landing","description":"A collection of over one hundred poems recounting the ups and downs of one adolescent girl's school year.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VD8NAAAACAAJ&dq=Girl+Coming+in+for+a+Landing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mythic Path: Discovering the Guiding Stories of Your Past -- Creating a Vision for Your Future","description":"Beneath our conscious minds, our personal mythology directs our actions and organizes your experiences.

The movement began with the heart of the poor and humble Hungarian mystic and Third-Order Carmelite, Elizabeth Kindelmann (1913-1985), when she heard the voices of Jesus and Mary through interior locutions between the years 1961 and 1983. The result is this Spiritual Diary, written at the request of Our Lord Jesus, which has received the Imprimatur of the Church and gifted the world untold blessings for our critical times.Jesus said to Kindelmann, \\"My Mother is Noah's Ark,\\" and Mary told her, \\"I assure you, my little one, that I have never before given into your hands such a powerful force of grace, the burning flame of the love of my heart. Ever since the Word became Flesh, I have not undertaken a greater movement than the Flame of Love of my heart who rushes to you. Until now, nothing could blind Satan as much. And it is up to you not to reject it, for this rejection would simply spell disaster.\\"The Flame of Love movement is an official Church association of the faithful, enjoying the heartfelt approval of His Eminence Cardinal P ter Erd?, Primate of Hungary, Archbishop of Eszertom-Budapest, and the approval of various bishops in whose dioceses it flourishes, as well as a 2013 apostolic blessing from Pope Francis.God is seeking to build up a holy army of souls in order help us to fight the battle ahead that leads to sure victory for those firm in faith. In this remarkable Spiritual Diary, you follow the life and divine conversations of one of the greatest mystics of the 20th century, learn of the prayers and weekly prayer schedule that effectively blind Satan, and of the divine promises Our Lord wishes to give to us through the intercession of His Mother's Immaculate Heart.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dD-mzQEACAAJ&dq=The+flame+of+love+of+the+Immaculate+Heart+of+Mary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Technology","description":"Technology is a process and a body of knowledge as much as a collection of artifacts. Biology is no different and we are just beginning to comprehend the challenges inherent in the next stage of biology as a human technology. It is this critical moment, with its wide-ranging implications, that Robert Carlson considers in Biology Is Technology. He offers a uniquely informed perspective on the endeavors that contribute to current progress in this area the science of biological systems and the technology used to manipulate them. In a number of case studies, Carlson demonstrates that the development of new mathematical, computational, and laboratory tools will facilitate the engineering of biological artifacts up to and including organisms and ecosystems. Exploring how this will happen, with reference to past technological advances, he explains how objects are constructed virtually, tested using sophisticated mathematical models, and finally constructed in the real world. Such rapid increases in the power, availability, and application of biotechnology raise obvious questions about who gets to use it, and to what end. Carlson s thoughtful analysis offers rare insight into our choices about how to develop biological technologies and how these choices will determine the pace and effectiveness of innovation as a public good.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NGTbnaXOKD8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vibrational Healing Through the Chakras: With Light, Color, Sound, Crystals, and Aromatherapy","description":"Every life form is made up of vibrations that coincide with the harmonic frequency to which all life is attuned.

Now, acclaimed productivity and quality experts Carla O'Dell and Jack Grayson explain for the first time how applying the ideas of Knowledge Management can help employers identify their own internal best practices and share this intellectual capital throughout their organizations. Knowledge Management (KM) is a conscious strategy of getting the right information to the right people at the right time so they can take action and create value. Basing KM on three major studies of best practices at one hundred companies, the authors demonstrate how managers can utilize a visual process model to actually transfer best practices from one business unit of the organization to another. Rich with case studies, concrete examples, and revealing anecdotes from companies including Texas Instruments, Amoco, Buckman, Chevron, Sequent Computer, the World Bank, and USAA, this valuable guide reveals how knowledge treasure chests can be unlocked to reduce product development cycle time, implement more cost-efficient operations, or create a loyal customer base. Finally, O'Dell and Grayson present three \\"value propositions\\" built around customers, products, and operations that could result in staggering payoffs as they did at the companies cited above. No amount of knowledge or insight can keep a company ahead if it is not properly distributed where it's needed. Entirely accessible and immensely readable, If Only We Knew What We Know is a much-needed companion for business leaders everywhere.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Re1lWxr57qsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beautiful Wooden Gifts You Can Make in a Weekend","description":"Provides detailed plans and step-by-step instructions for 20 unique objects.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-OWA_ovaUD4C&dq=Beautiful+Wooden+Gifts+You+Can+Make+in+a+Weekend&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thucydides (Family Classical Library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=M6zzzAEACAAJ&dq=Thucydides+(Family+Classical+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ancient Whispers from Chaldea","description":"The book is considered the astrological upgrade for the new millennium.

Looking back over the past one hundred years, the contributors to this in-depth survey consider the diverse range of artists who have been influenced by the region's compelling union of water and land, peaks and valleys, and fog and sunlight. Paintings, sculpture, graphic arts, photography, landscape architecture, earthworks, conceptual art, and designs in city planning and architecture are all represented. The diversity reflects not just the glories of nature but also an exploration of what constitutes \\"landscape\\" in its broadest, most complete sense. Among the more than two hundred works of art are those by well-known artists and designers such as Bernard Maybeck, Diego Rivera, Dorothea Lange, Ansel Adams, Richard Diebenkorn, Joan Brown, Lawrence Halprin, and Christo. Lesser-known artists are here as well, resulting in an exceptional array of approaches to the natural environment. The essays also explore key themes in the Bay Area's landscape art tradition, including the ethnic perspectives that have played an essential role in the region's art. The inexhaustible ability of the land to stimulate different personal meanings is made clear in this volume, and the effect yields a deeper understanding of how art can shape our lives in ways both spiritual and practical, how the landscape without constantly merges with the landscape within.

The proof that black holes do exist, and an analysis of their properties, would have a significance going far beyond astrophysics. Indeed, what is involved is not just the discovery of yet another even if extremely remarkable, astro physical object, but a test of the correctness of our understanding of the properties of space and time in extremely strong gravitational fields. Theoretical research into the properties of black holes, and into the possible corol laries of the hypothesis that they exist, has been carried out with special vigor since the beginning of the 1970's. In addition to those specific features of black holes that are important for the interpretation of their possible astrophysical manifestations, the theory has revealed a number of unexpected characteristics of physical interactions involving black holes. By the middle of the 1980's a fairly detailed understanding had been achieved of the properties of the black holes, their possible astrophysical manifestations, and the specifics of the various physical processes involved. Even though a completely reliable detection of a black hole had not yet been made at that time, several objects among those scrutinized by astrophysicists were considered as strong candidates to be confirmed as being black holes.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HEHwCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Garden Tree: An Illustrated Guide to Choosing, Planting and Caring for 500 Garden Trees","description":"This text contains information on 500 garden trees.

The Seminole, who are described in this book as of a high grade in physique and intelligence, may well be descendants of these heroes. The status of these Indians is peculiar in that their contact with civilization has hitherto been regulated, to an extent not known elsewhere, by their own volition, and has not been imposed upon them.

Ted Conover works for nearly a year as a prison guard. Susan Orlean follows orchid fanciers to reveal an obsessive subculture few knew existed. Adrian Nicole LeBlanc spends nearly a decade reporting on a family in the South Bronx. And like their muckraking early twentieth-century precursors, they are drawn to the most pressing issues of the day: Alex Kotlowitz, Leon Dash, and William Finnegan to race and class; Ron Rosenbaum to the problem of evil; Michael Lewis to boom-and-bust economies; Richard Ben Cramer to the nitty gritty of politics. How do they do it? In these interviews, they reveal the techniques and inspirations behind their acclaimed works, from their felt-tip pens, tape recorders, long car rides, and assumed identities; to their intimate understanding of the way a truly great story unfolds.

The volume does fine justice to the notion that we experience time as already shaped by religion, politics, and culture. Whether its contributions cover religious or political figures, philosophers or poets, mystics or physicists, they show  sometimes explicitly, sometimes more discreetly  how difficult it is to deal with time in a pure, unmediated form.

Of the 350 Teton Sioux Indians there, two-thirds were women and children. When the smoke cleared, 84 men and 62 women and children lay dead, their bodies scattered along a stretch of more than a mile where they had been trying to flee. Of some 500 soldiers and scouts, about 30 were dead some, probably, from their own crossfire. Wounded Knee has excited contradictory accounts and heated emotions. To answer whether it was a battle or a massacre, Rex Alan Smith goes further into the historical records and cultural traditions of the combatants than anyone has gone before. His work results in what Alvin Josephy Jr., editor of American Heritage, calls \\"the most definitive and unbiased\\" account of all, Moon of Popping Trees.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=acZ-c7qgp-YC&dq=Moon+of+Popping+Trees&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lolita, Vol. 3","description":"A quarterly magazine and book hybrid that's a combination fashion magazine, culture guide, and art book, the \\"Gothic & Lolita Bible\\" defines the Japanese Lolita style.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-OLwOwAACAAJ&dq=Lolita,+Vol.+3&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Maze Me: Poems for Girls","description":"A collection of seventy-two poems written especially for girls ages twelve and up by the much-honored and beloved poet Naomi Shihab Nye. \\"A lovely, rich collection that promises to be a lasting companion for young writers.\\" School Library Journal (starred review) First love, friendship, school, family, community, having a crush, loving your mother and hating your mother, sense of self, body image, hopes and dreams . . . these seventy-two poems by Naomi Shihab Nye written expressly for this collection will speak to girls of all ages.

Psycho-Cybernetics is a term coined by Dr. Maxwell Maltz, which means,  steering your mind to a productive, useful goal so you can reach the greatest port in the world, peace of mind.  Since its first publication in 1960, Maltz s landmark bestseller has inspired and enhanced the lives of more than 30 million readers. In this updated edition, with a new introduction and editorial commentary by Matt Furey, president of the Psycho-Cybernetics Foundation, the original text has been annotated and amplified to make Maltz s message even more relevant for the contemporary reader.  Before the mind can work efficiently, we must develop our perception of the outcomes we expect to reach. Maxwell Maltz calls this Psycho-Cybernetics; when the mind has a defined target it can focus and direct and refocus and redirect until it reaches its intended goal.   Tony Robbins (from Unlimited Power) Maltz was the first researcher and author to explain how the self-image (a term he popularized) has complete control over an individual s ability to achieve (or fail to achieve) any goal. And he developed techniques for improving and managing self-image visualization, mental rehearsal, relaxation which have informed and inspired countless motivational gurus, sports psychologists, and self-help practitioners for more than fifty years. The teachings of Psycho-Cybernetics are timeless because they are based on solid science and provide a prescription for thinking and acting that lead to quantifiable results.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hJpPEAAAQBAJ&dq=Psycho-Cybernetics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Revolution in The Valley: The Insanely Great Story of How the Mac Was Made","description":"Describes the development of the Apple Macintosh through a variety of anecdotes, photographs, and sketches.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VQQCtFT1CGIC&dq=Revolution+in+The+Valley:+The+Insanely+Great+Story+of+How+the+Mac+Was+Made&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Order of the Arrow Handbook","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xjFFAAAAYAAJ&dq=Order+of+the+Arrow+Handbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fighting for the Rain Forest: War, Youth, & Resources in Sierra Leone (African Issues Series)","description":"Fighting for the Rain Forest' explores the roots of the civil war in Sierra Leone and its manifestations in the forests amongst the country's youth.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=f7LtAAAAMAAJ&dq=Fighting+for+the+Rain+Forest:+War,+Youth,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dream Room","description":"A revolutionary memoir about domestic abuse by the award-winning author of Her Body and Other Parties In the Dream House is Carmen Maria Machado s engrossing and wildly innovative account of a relationship gone bad, and a bold dissection of the mechanisms and cultural representations of psychological abuse. Tracing the full arc of a harrowing relationship with a charismatic but volatile woman, Machado struggles to make sense of how what happened to her shaped the person she was becoming. And it s that struggle that gives the book its original structure: each chapter is driven by its own narrative trope the haunted house, erotica, the bildungsroman through which Machado holds the events up to the light and examines them from different angles. She looks back at her religious adolescence, unpacks the stereotype of lesbian relationships as safe and utopian, and widens the view with essayistic explorations of the history and reality of abuse in queer relationships. Machado s dire narrative is leavened with her characteristic wit, playfulness, and openness to inquiry. She casts a critical eye over legal proceedings, fairy tales, Star Trek, and Disney villains, as well as iconic works of film and fiction. The result is a wrenching, riveting book that explodes our ideas about what a memoir can do and be.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t7ifDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Two So Small","description":"With the possibility of a \\"Big Lebowski\\" sequel on the horizon, Dudeism continues to grow as the Number One religion based on a Jeff Bridges movie, we welcome the second in a series of books for children to answer the simple question \\"Do You Abide?\\" Little Finnegan is back, and this time he learns what it takes to ABIDE, and how easy it really is.

It focuses on the lives of Saints Brendan, Columba, and Columbanus, who lived active and effective lives in the cause of the early Church. Brendan, one of the founding fathers of Christianity in Ireland, was known in legend as a voyager and was thought to have reached the Western Hemisphere long before the Vikings. Columba took Celtic Christianity to Scotland and helped to re-establish it in Wales and in the North and West of England. Columbanus was the great Irish missionary to continental Europe, where he and his followers helped to convert the heathen invaders from the East. When Rome, in the person of St. Augustine, Pope Gregory's apostle to the Angles, penetrated again to England, a showdown between Roman and Celtic Christianity was inevitable. The dramatic confrontation occurred at the Council of Whitby in 664. Rome, with its organization and authority, won, and Celtic Catholicism went into eclipse. But some of its influence persisted all over Europe, and it had a large share in shaping the culture that ultimately emerged from the dark ages. This book's fascination is the picture that it gives of the movements of peoples, the shaping of new countries, and the development of ideas during those too-little-known centuries.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ujssAQAAMAAJ&dq=Early+Celtic+Christianity+(Celtic+Interest)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Discernment: Acquiring the Heart of God","description":"So much about our contemporary living can distract and disorient us, making it difficult to grow in the spiritual life, or even to cling to one?s beliefs and practices with an inner conviction that fills the heart. Enter the true art of discernment: more than simply a tool for making decisions or a method for mastering God?s will, discernment is a process by which we learn how to remain in Christ, taking on his stance toward life, allowing him to inspire and direct our everyday choices. Precisely because it is an art of communication between persons, discernment cannot be reduced to a psychological technique for running our spiritual lives; rather, it is rooted in relationship. Jesuit priest Marko Ivan Rupnik blends the wisdom of ancient church fathers collected in the volumes of the Philokalia with the keen insights of Renaissance giant, Ignatius of Loyola, liberally sprinkled with present day examples. The result is a book of spirituality both eminently practical and lyrically enticing.Includes:Discernment as relationship with God Discernment and prayer Understanding temptation How to surrender to Christ Practicing discernment Discerning one?s vocation Community discernment","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9zVrAAAACAAJ&dq=Discernment:+Acquiring+the+Heart+of+God&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Playboy In Pursuit (Australian Playboys)","description":"Val Seymour appeared to be the ruthless rogue, yet he was also charming, intelligent, and...sensitive.

Rising from the ashes of punk and the smoldering embers of the disco inferno, they effectively straddled the boundaries between critical and commercial success as few other groups did, with music you could deconstruct and dance to at the same time. Culture critic David Bowman tells the fascinating story of how this brain trust of talented musicians turned pop music on its head. From the band s inception at the Rhode Island School of Design to their first big gig opening for the Ramones at CBGB, from their prominence in the worlds of art and fashion to the clash of egos and ideals that left them angry, jealous, and ready to call it quits, Bowman closely chronicles the rise and fall of a stunningly original and gloriously dysfunctional rock 'n' roll band that stayed together longer than anyone thought possible, and left a legacy that influences artists to this day.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2u_KlwEACAAJ&dq=This+Must+Be+the+Place:+The+Adventures+of+Talking+Heads+in+the+Twentieth+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Radio Live! Television Live!: Those Golden Days When Horses Were Coconuts","description":"During the \\"golden age\\" of live radio and television, writers, performers, and producers created their programs in an environment far different from the studios of today. With live programming, anything could happen, and often did. Robert L. Mott, a veteran writer and Emmy-nominated sound effects creator of the live era, recreates the days when television and radio programs were performed live. He includes personal reminiscences as well as a forthright look behind the microphones: horses' hooves were played by coconuts, African-American women were played by white males, and television actors might ad lib an entire program that didn't go as planned. Celebrities like Red Skelton and Jackie Gleason, as well as the unsung heroes in the sound booth and backstage, step up to the mike here. Behind-the-scenes photographs are also included in this account of the exciting--but not always glamorous--world that was \\"live on the air.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pgsiquRp_GsC&dq=Radio+Live!+Television+Live!:+Those+Golden+Days+When+Horses+Were+Coconuts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Second Confession","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hLobAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Second+Confession&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Colorado Temptation","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WGQBPgAACAAJ&dq=Colorado+Temptation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Taken: Inside the Alien-Human Abduction Agenda","description":"After several years of being out of print and becoming a bit of a collectors item; TAKEN, the startling accounts of alien abduction as documented by the late Karla Turner, has been refreshed and reissued faithfully with the sole input and authorization from husband Elton Turner.

Perry. While conventional wisdom asserts that residential racial and economic integration holds great promise for reducing inequality in the United States, Americans are demonstrably not very good at living with difference. Perry's analysis of the multiethnic, mixed-income Milwaukee community of Riverwest, where residents maintain relative stability without insisting on conformity, advances our understanding of why and how neighborhoods matter. In response to the myriad urban quantitative assessments, Perry examines the impacts of neighborhood diversity using more than three years of ethnographic fieldwork and interviews. Her in-depth examination of life \\"on the block\\" expands our understanding of the mechanisms by which neighborhoods shape the perceptions, behaviors, and opportunities of those who live in them. Perry challenges researchers' assumptions about what \\"good\\" communities look like and what well-regulated communities want.

They argue that such crises have been used to support political objectives of state expansion and control in the uplands. They have also been used to justify the alternative directions advocated by an array of NGOs. In official and alternative discourses of economic development, the peoples living in Thailand's hill country are typically cast as either guardians or destroyers of forest resources, often depending on their ethnicity. Political and historical factors have created a simplistic, misleading, and often scientifically inaccurate environmental narrative: Hmong farmers, for example, are thought to exhibit environmentally destructive practices, whereas the Karen are seen as linked to and protective of their ancestral home. Forsyth and Walker reveal a much more complex relationship of hill farmers to the land, to other ethnic groups, and to the state. They conclude that current explanations fail to address the real causes of environmental problems and unnecessarily restrict the livelihoods of local people. The authors' critical assessment of simplistic environmental narratives, as well as their suggestions for finding solutions, will be valuable in international policy discussions about environmental issues in rapidly developing countries. Moreover, their redefinition of northern Thailand's environmental problems, and their analysis of how political influences have reinforced inappropriate policies, demonstrate new ways of analyzing how environmental science and knowledge are important arenas for political control. This book makes valuable contributions to Thai studies and more generally to the fields of environmental science, ecology, geography, anthropology, and political science, as well as to policy making and resource management in the developing world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7kqU1SauD2kC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"This Day (Regular Edition): A Wesleyan Way of Prayer (How Is It With Your Soul?)","description":"Dr. Laurence Stookey of Wesley Seminary has created this resource to serve as a daily prayer book for the home and personal use.

Harper Lee Hailed by the Washington Post Book World as  a sort of Catcher in the Rye out West,  Richard Bradford s Red Sky at Morning is the classic coming-of-age story set during World War II about the enduring spirit of youth and the values in life that count. In the summer of 1944, Frank Arnold, a wealthy shipbuilder in Mobile, Alabama, receives his volunteer commission in the U.S. Navy and moves his wife, Ann, and seventeen-year-old son, Josh, to the family s summer home in the village of Corazon Sagrado, high in the New Mexico mountains. A true daughter of the Confederacy, Ann finds it impossible to cope with the quality of life in the largely Hispanic village and, in the company of Jimbob Buel an insufferable, South-proud, professional houseguest takes to bridge and sherry. Josh, on the other hand, becomes an integral member of the Sagrado community, forging friendships with his new classmates, with the town s disreputable resident artist, and with Amadeo and Excilda Montoya, the couple hired by his father to care for their house. Josh narrates the story of his fateful year in Sagrado and, with irresistibly deadpan, irreverent humor, describes the events and people who influence his progress to maturity. Unhindered by his mother's disdain for these \\"tacky, dusty little Westerners,\\" Josh comes into his own and into a young man's finely formed understanding of duty, responsibility, and love.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2mu2AgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alex Homer's Professional ASP 3.0 Web Techniques","description":"Starting to build a Web site is simple enough - the hardware is cheap, the software is easy to install, and the market of potential visitors is huge.

Its theological perspectives and historical profiles of early man are unique. It is important not because it is old-other collections antedate it by many years-but because it completely transcends the primitive mythology of the ancient world. Reading and studying Genesis are not burdensome tasks. Its themes are varied and its personal portraits unparalleled. It immediately tackles on of man's most basic questions: What is the origin of all things? Its answer is as credible as it is captivating. From the origin of man the writer shifts attention to the fall of man and the human dilemma. The problem of evil is rarely discussed in such a manner by other ancient writers. From this point the writer concentrates on the spiritual, moral, and practical consequences of sin. Great catastrophes, such as the flood and the confusion of tongues at Babel, demonstrate God's response to human rebellion. Where in the annals of history can we find more imaginative and frank portraits than those of Abraham and his descendants? Abraham's moments of great triumph and ecstasy are not reported to the exclusion of his hours of humility and disgrace; this balanced description is quite distinct from the idealism of ancient Near Eastern historiography. The detailed descriptions of Abraham's failures, therefore, constitute a remarkable proof for the inspiration of this book. The sensitive reader cannot help but be struck by this book's great contrasting emphases: on one hand majestic, cosmological truth; on the other hand personal, intimate, and individualistic narratives of a man, a wife, and their family. While theological abstractions are common, they do not exclude personal warmth and historical objectivity. There are also great contrasts between personalities; the most significant is between God and Satan, and based on this contrast is the one between good and evil and their practical effects. The book of Genesis, therefore, is of utmost value to the scientist, the historian, and the theologian: to the scientist for its cosmology, to the historian for its early history of Israel, and to the theologian for its basic philosophical implications. But one must approach the book properly; only then can one hope to understand it, not to mention the rest of the Bible and Jesus Himself . Jesus told his hostile contemporaries that \\"had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me. But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?\\" (John 5:46,47)","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fUJGDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wings of Gauze: Women of Color and the Experience of Health and Illness","description":"An anthology on health and illness as experienced by women of color in the US.

Multicides have traditionally been categorized as double, triple, mass, serial and spree  while, mass and serial have been further divided into subcategories. Spree killing, which involves the killing of at least three persons at two or more locations due to a precipitating incident that fuels the urge to kill, remains a poorly defined concept. In the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) eliminated this term from its multicide nomenclature in 2005, but the authors examination of 159 incidents involving 186 spree killers from 26 countries shows that not only is there enough diversity among spree killers to form classifications similar to those devised for mass and serial but also that subtypes offer distinct utility for identification, tracking, and warning potential targets. Spree Killers outline the designation of spree killer specifically and thoroughly. In addition to looking at existing literature, specific cases, and the behavioral patterns, it offers a fully worked up profile for the typology. The behaviors and motives for spree killers align in six categories, which are detailed in full. The book provides unique insight for police, forensic, and investigative personnel into what to look for to respond to, and in some cases identify and stopping certain types of spree killings.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=B5K3DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oranges for Orange Juice Learn to Read, Social Studies (Social Studies Learn to Read)","description":"Repetitive, predictable story lines and illustrations that match the text provide maximum support to the emergent reader.

Both novel in its approach and information, this book's central theme revolves around the rise of an indigenous form of capitalism existing as early as the 1600s. Making Big Money in 1600 examines the reemergence of the economic sector and its complex influences on social conditions during this time. By examining the life and work of Isma'il Abu Taqiyya, Hanna traces the relationship between economic activities and culture. As we are introduced to Abu Taqiyya we learn how he negotiates partnership with other merchants, arranges for the handling of goods, and negotiates loans for colleagues. Hanna reveals his home life, his wives, children, and concubines, his relations with his family and friends, and how these relations evolved and were affected by the changing social and economic conditions-a perspective rarely discussed in works before the modern period.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hr1LP3WU8UkC&dq=Making+Big+Money+in+1600:+The+Life+and+Times+of+Isma%27Il+Abu+Taqiyya,+Egyptian+Merchant+(Middle+East+Studies+Beyond+Dominant+Paradigms)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"National Security Law 2nd Edition","description":"This unique new concise treatise provides a highly accessible but also comprehensive and timely supplement for students studying National Security Law.

Horrified by the misuse of magic they had witnessed during the First War of the Races, the Druids at Paranor devoted themselves to the study of the old sciences, from the period before the collapse of civilization a thousand years before. Only the Bremen and a few trusted associates still studied the arcane arts. And for his persistence, Bremen found himself outcast, avoided by all but the few free-thinkers among the Druids. But his removal from Paranor was not altogether a terrible thing, for Bremen learned that dark forces were on the move from the Northlands. That seemingly invincible armies of trolls were fast conquering all that lay to their south. That the scouts for the army--and its principal assassins--were Skull Bearers, disfigured and transformed Druids who had fallen prey to the seductions of the magic arts. And that at the heart of the evil tide was an archmage and former Druid named Brona! Using the special skills he had acquired through his own study of Magic, Bremen was able to penetrate the huge camp of the Troll army and learn many of its secrets. And he immediately understood that if the peoples of the Four Lands were to escape eternal subjugation they would need to unite. But, even united, they would need a weapon, something so powerful that the evil magic of Brona, the Warlock Lord, would fail before its might...","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eBq_sufonjwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dictionary of Differences","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LA-oswEACAAJ&dq=Dictionary+of+Differences&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tuberculosis: the Greatest Story Never Told","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=R8eqygAACAAJ&dq=Tuberculosis:+the+Greatest+Story+Never+Told&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Balm in Gilead: Healing for the Repentent Heart","description":"This unique Bible study guide is designed to lead readers into a deeper experience of God s life-changing love through a cleansing interlude of repentance.

The record becomes devastatingly clear: the fighting in the West was the cruelest and most useless of the whole affair, and if men of vision had been in Washington in the 1850s it might have been avoided.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8y4yLq1CF40C&dq=Civil+War+on+the+Western+Border+1854-1865&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Legion, The: Foundations","description":"Superboy joins the Legionaires who protect the United Planets in the thirty-first century, but questions arise as to his real identity and mission.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BnMGAAAACAAJ&dq=Legion,+The:+Foundations&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Joey Moses","description":"Volume 3 covers Genesis chapter 41 to the end and the first 11 chapters of the book of Exodus.

This book investigates the ways in which activists, scholars, and communities are resisting the expansion of copyright and patent law in the information age. Debora J. Halbert explores how an alternative framework for understanding intellectual property - including about how we ought to think about the issues, the development of social movements around specific issues, and civil disobedience - has developed. Each chapter in the book discusses how resistance is developing in relation to a particular copyright or patent issue such as: access to patented medication access to copyrighted information and music via the Internet the patenting of genetic material. This controversial book examines the ways in which the idea of intellectual property is being re-thought by the victims of an over-expansive legal system. It will appeal to students and researchers from a range of disciplines, from law and political science to computer science, with an interest in intellectual property.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Qa53ogwFdTIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Song of the Scaffold","description":"This is a classic novelette set in the time of the French Revolution, an epoch that vividly demonstrated man's capacity for both heroism and brutality. It is an intense and compelling drama based on the true story of the Carmelite nuns at Compeigne beheaded during the last few days of the Revolution, but also encompassing the Paris mob, the Reign of Terror, women revolutionists, etc., climaxing in the heroic martyrdom of sixteen Carmelites. This story unfolds around Blanche de la Force, who enters the Carmelite convent amid the horror of the French Revolution. Blanche is so timorous that she seems unsuited to the rigors of religious life even at the best of times - and badly misplaced as the Reign of Terror begins to stain France with the blood of martyrs. Sister Marie, one of the leading nuns in the convent, receives with joy the death threats of the revolutionaries: the sisters are going to be awarded the crown of Christian martyrdom! Sister Marie prepares the other nuns for this fearsome sacrifice, all the while harboring doubts about Blanches ability and willingness to join them in dying for Christ. Blanches life thereafter and the story of the nuns take several unexpected twists, leaving you not only with the inspiring, true witness of their martyrdom, but also with a penetrating insight into the nature of holiness. As our world is engulfed anew in terror and hatred for the Christian faith, The Song at the Scaffold will inspire us with a renewed and fervent love for God.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0WnmuYk4pAoC&dq=The+Song+of+the+Scaffold&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Girl to Girl: Sports and You: Sports and You","description":"Offers real advice from real girls on how to get along with teammates, balance school and sports, deal with overbearing parents and coaches, and much more.

In the context of the dramatic socio-economic restructuring processes, changes in urban governance and physical transformation of the city following the Fall of the Wall, the  new  Berlin was not only being built physically, but staged for visitors and Berliners and marketed to the world through events and image campaigns which featured the iconic architecture of large-scale urban redevelopment sites. Public-private partnerships were set up specifically to market the  new Berlin  to potential investors, tourists, Germans and the Berliners themselves. The book analyzes the images of the city and the narrative of urban change, which were produced over two decades. In the 1990s three key sites were turned into icons of the  new Berlin : the new Postdamer Platz, the new government quarter, and the redeveloped historical core of the Friedrichstadt. Eventually, the entire inner city was  staged  through a series of events which turned construction sites into tourist attractions. New sites and spaces gradually became part of the 2000s place marketing imagery and narrative, as urban leaders sought to promote the  creative city . By combining urban political economy and cultural approaches from the disciplines of urban politics, geography, sociology and planning, the book contributes to a better understanding of the interplay between the symbolic  politics of representation  through place marketing and the politics of urban development and place making in contemporary urban governance.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OiUJNDNOFLoC&dq=New+Berlin,+The&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"More Things You Need To Be Told","description":"Are good manners relevant in this day and age?
