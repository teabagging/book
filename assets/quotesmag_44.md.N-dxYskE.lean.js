The voices are good - but not all of them.On the downside however, as an audio engineer myself, I have to say that &quot;Mind's Eye&quot; should hire someone else to remaster their records. Sound quality is not as good as I thought it would be.On the opposition there is the BBCs all time classic version with excellent voices and wonderfull performances by the actors, based on an equaly wonderfull adaptation of Tolkiens story. If you only compare the two &quot;Gandalfs&quot; you will see what I mean. Mind's Eye version seems to be the kids version while BBC's the adult's one.

It looked like a nice set. Black bindings and the synopsis mentioned illustrations that would certainly add to my enjoyement.

I picked up Fellowship of the Ring, and I made my way through it, determined to read it. Tolkien has a wonderful imagination, but the plot is a bit redundant and the writing is hard to understand at points. I have read other works far more advanced, so my lack of understanding is not from being uneducated. It just doesn't flow. My two stars were for his imagination, because I respect anyone who takes a chance with the creation of another world. Bottom line: While he has an imagination, this is a book you might have to struggle with because of it's mediocre writing."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I was given this book by a friend to read, and received nothing of what I expected. No doubt that Tolkiens stories have reached world popularity; however I found it to be tediously dull, and alarmingly unmoving. Tolkien was indeed one of the countries finest authors, but to say that he is the best is taking it out of context. Simpley because Tolkien was the first successful fantasy novelist, does not mean he was the best. I can understand why people would take his books as almost a religion, but I could barely trudge through the first 100 pages. I account this to my own preferences. I value character development very highly, and of which there seemed scarce to none in Lord of the Rings. Tolkien I feel focused more on places; the then and where. Understand, that I desprately wished to enjoy this book, as I hoped to learn from the master, since I hope to someday strick my own mark in fantasy writing. Because I personally did not enjoy Tolkiens writing does not mean that I do not hold him in the highest regard and respects. Fantasy has achieved much thanks to the imagination and genuinity of J.R.R.

Granted, this was a good set of books, but Calm Down people!It starts out VERY well. I'll say this. The first book goes along fairly quickly with a sufficient amount of action and a great re-introduction of Gandalf. (The way he goes in and out of the story and dissapear on &quot;mysterious&quot; business stays true to his character.) The 2cd book was alright, but started losing me when they so deeply into politics and King-hood. I just didnt see how that was so critical to the whole plot. Yes, its worth writing about but i think they Tolkien drags the whole war out a bit much. I got impatient to find out what was going on with the characters he started me out with, and didnt care much about the Riders of Rohan or the old sickly king, Eowyn and all. I wanted to know where Frodo was! And the third book...well....i didnt bother with the first part of it, i just skipped on to Frodo and Sams adventures with Gollum and in the Heart of Mordor. These are the scenes which made the book for me. :) Sams protectivness just touched my heart, and Frodo turns out to be braver than even his uncle Bilbo.When he and Frodo were about to die, i swear, the moment between those two....Naw, i wont spoil it for young readers who havent got it yet.My biggest complaint was that after the whole ordeal was over, and the book should be ending, Tolkien drags it out into 5 or 6 more chapters that i simply thought were unnessesary.Anyway, be prepared to have alot of free time if your going to start this Trilogy.

The books, well, they are classics, but I can't seem to get more than 10 pages read at a time.Its not that I don;t worship the work this guy has done, but when I read the books, the exiting adventure that captures my immagination and creativity, and brings me into a new world, is litterly butchered by the ridiculous ammount of pointless details, that end up closing my eyes.In a scene this book will...-capture you into a cool new setting-give you atleast 40 descriptions that make no sense to explain what it looks like.-give you about 40 more, as the first sentence of dialouge begins.-Then, it scripts some moderately interesting dialouge, and then kills it again, with descriptions that are, again, unnesecary.-as if this isn't enough, the exitement is killed by the fact that you can;t tell whats happening, you start confusing descriptions with the story, and get mixed up with the dialouge, and then are again, lost, when he drags in the second wave of descriptions. I mean, where is the fun? I would like it if someone would rewrite this with the same dialouge and plot, but change the descriptions into interesting details of the surroundings, that catch your interest rather than make you sleep with your eyes open.The movie is better."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I'll start by saying that I am a huge fan of Fantasy novels, but this 'crux' of Fantasy literature really disappointed me.This book has a lot of faults. To begin with, it goes against the first basic rule of writing a book: show don't tell. As you start the novel, it tells everything and nothing has been shown. Tolkein has just narrated almost everything, starting from the history to the setting, and this gives the novel a feeling as if a child has written it.Secondly, the book is just too slow. I mean you just start the 1st chapter and you doze off after a couple of pages. The pace might have been fine for the 50's but it's just too slow for the double Os!I don't know why other people liked the plot so much, but I think the plot was really really weak. The causality in the story is almost non-existant and that is what makes the difference between a jumble of short stories joined loosely together and a good novel.Lastly, the characters could have been much developed with more life in them than mere puppets bound to do the author's bidding. The chracters are much more Archetyped than they should have been.Overall, I think that it has gotten more attention than it deserved, perhaps because of the movies, and that people are liking it because of some trend or the like."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Admirers of Tolkien's work marvel at the man's capacity to create a vast imaginative world. He could certainly do that - whether he could say anything even remotely interesting with it is another matter. Tolkien appeals to the young and immature because his world is enormous, detailed, and clearly ordered, unlike our own, which is only enormous and detailed. So it's a very pleasant escape from reality, but in the end it's nothing but a padded playground for the childish. I blush to remember that there was a time when I'd learned to write in Elvish. This skill has not served me in later life. This fella wrote one good children's book and a tiresome three-volume novel for delayed adolescents; the flood of derivative and gossamer-thin drivel that has come out since his death is something I hope he would have been ashamed of."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I bought this set and had it sent to an inmate in a correctional facility in Florida.

It goes without saying that Tolkien has done a great work creating Middle Earth, a world of fantasy, but huge number of characters in the book seem to be one of pitfalls for the book (in my opinion), the characters in the book do not have very interesting or deeper personalities, in my eyes, they are very straightforward.

I'm very impressed with the quality of the cover, the paper, the text, and the printing, but the pull-out map of Middle Earth stinks.The map appears to be a quick, low-quality scan of the same map that comes with the older red harcover edition. Some might not notice it, but when I first looked at it, I noticed a bit of chunkiness in some of the hand-drawn lines, and some of the smaller place-names looked fuzzy. It seems absurd that the book's most important visual would be of such low quality when the rest of the book is so beautiful. Honestly, I could have made a better copy of the map with my scanner at home.It's disappointing that this otherwise fantastic edition has such a blemish, especially when the reproduction of the map could have easily been so much cleaner."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is an extraordinary performance. I've read LOTR cover to cover many times, but through Mr. Ingles reading I discovered a new richness previously missed. All those tough historical names and long songs come to life.

When they were over, my first thought was to play them again!Unfortunately, the quality of some of the 64 CD's was less than perfect. Many had skips due to small scuffs caused by the harsh cardboard sleeves. One unscuffed disc was very poor in recording quality - almost unplayable. Of course, it was the very last disk of the story! After moving it between (5) CD players I found one that would, with some serious audio problems, play it so I could hear &quot;The Grey Havens&quot; chapter.Nevertheless, I enjoyed this thoroughly. In fact, I would pay twice the price for a higher quality CD."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"For the last 10 years, reading the Lord of the Rings each fall and winter has been a much cherished tradition of mine. This winter was different, because I read the LotR on my kindle for the first time (and also as the first book on my kindle).As I love the book itself (in the paper version of the LotR), I must stress, that this review is only about the kindleversion of this great book, not about the piece of literature itself, as it was written by J.R.R. Tolkien!First, I have to say that reading on the kindle is a very nice experience. I forget that I am handling a technical device and get immersed in the story, just as I would with the paper version.Second, it is much more convenient to read the LotR on the kindle, since one doesn't have to hold a heavy (and in my case falling apart) book in hands. I am actually reading the LotR faster on the kindle than on paper, since flipping a page on the kindle does not mean any change in holding, as with a book! With regards to \\"feel and touch of the paper\\", I am missing nothing here, as the paper, as well as the kindle, are to me just the carriers of the story. I want to experience neither the paper, nor the kindle, but only the story they contain!However, it is much easier in the paper version to just look up the appendix or the maps. This is almost impossible with the kindle version. One does not get any feel for the structure of the LotR and its appendices on the kindle, and one can absolutely forget about reading the maps, as they are impossibly small on the small screen.The reason, however, why I really cannot recommend this kindle edition of the LotR is, that it contains an astonishing amount of errors. I cannot forgive it when &Eacute;omer is spelled \\"&eacute;mer\\" or \\"&eacute;omer\\" and if H&aacute;ma is one time just \\"H!\\". What means \\"high-'hearted\\" or \\"lors\\"? \\"ham mering\\" and \\"counten ance\\" are further examples of very poor proof reading and since I have read this book on paper now around 10 times, I must say that these new mistakes in electronic form astound and anger me! If this was software, I would want a free upgrade to the error-free version...I do not recommend the kindle-version of the Lord of the Rings to a novice! If you are one like me, who knows the book anyway almost by heart, this kindle edition might be a convenient way to re-read the book, but you might need strong nerves!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This full-cast abridgement of THE LORD OF THE RINGS is The Mind's Eye version produced for National Public Radio in 1979, several years before the much-superior BBC version with Ian Holm. The eleven-hour-plus dramatization deserves recognition as a sincere, pioneering attempt to bring J. R. R. Tolkien's epic fantasy to imaginative life for a young American audience in a way that the animated films of the period could not. The production was very well-received at the time and appreciated as a folk-culture event.Radio drama has been a rarity in the United States since the early 1950's whereas it has always thrived in the United Kingdom. (There had been an early British radio broadcast of LotR of which Tolkien, who disliked dramatic forms in general, disapproved.) While the subsequent 1981 BBC masterwork is a lavish, technically dazzling production sporting internationally acclaimed actors, the humble Mind's Eye version, utilizing a small cast of local-theatre players, is a low-budget, no-frills affair. Most of the voices are wrong and pronunciation awkward, but everyone makes an enthusiastic effort, which is the main reason that the marathon show remains so endearing despite its uneven quality.The scriptwriter had his task cut out for him, considering that it no doubt was a labor of love which had to be done quickly for little or no money. According to the conventions of the radio drama format, the adaptation emphasizes dialogue over description, and while the merest sketch of the novel, the script is generally an effective condensation, highlighted by the inclusion of the beloved Tom Bombadil episode.Bernard Mayes plays a splendid Gandalf and his fine, robust performance anchors the show.Gale Chugg (a notable cartoon voice) gives a spirited and straightforward account of the narration and doubles as a delightfully creepy Gollum.Other voices do not fare so well, but weaknesses among the supporting cast would mean little if the protagonists were not so drastically miscast. Samwise (Lou Bliss) is energetic and cheeky but sounds like a contemporary Noo Yawk street kid; while Frodo (James Arrington) starts out with an appropriate clear-speaking earnestness, only to become a monotonous, whining drone when crushed by the terrible burden of the evil One Ring. This means that THE RETURN OF THE KING, which places an inordinate burden of its own on these actors, is rendered a painfully draggy conclusion to the epic narrative.The overall result would not seem so mediocre if so much better had not since come from Ian Holm, Martin Shaw, Rob Inglis and of course the Peter Jackson films. For all its gross imperfection, The Mind's Eye ambitous LORD OF THE RINGS maintains a nostalgic charm for listeners who can be forgiving of the primitive circumstances of the little production. As such it is well worth a listen to all but the most cringing of \\"purists\\".Although Tolkien fans will want both, this version might be more appropriate for family listening than the more challenging BBC recording and would serve as an excellent way to introduce children to Tolkien's magic world."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This book is a disapointing buy. First of all it is _NOT_ leather bound, but made with cheap artificial leather. Further its printing is of bad quality made on cheap paper. Overall it is a attemot to make easy money out of the passion towards the great masterpiece of Tolkien. Shame on Houghton Mifflin!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Though Tolkien was not the first or most critically-acclaimed fantasy writer, he remains the most beloved and influential, even though the book is decades old. With the advent of the epic movie trilogy based on this book, new waves of readers are discovering the unique power of the \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" It has quietly created the fantasy genre as we know it, and helped spawn such entertainment phenomena as \\"Star Wars.\\"Following up on events in \\"The Hobbit,\\" \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" stars the quiet, good-natured hobbit Frodo Baggins, who has inherited a golden Ring that allows its user to become invisible. But his friend, Gandalf the wizard, informs Frodo that he has learned something: The Ring is really the Ring of Power, a tiny invulnerable token that the demonic Dark Lord Sauron has poured his essence and power into. And if Sauron can regain the Ring, he will be able to conquer Middle-Earth. Aghast, Frodo joins a fellowship of Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, Men and a wizard, to go to the one place where the Ring can be destroyed.\\"The Two Towers\\" begins directly after \\"Fellowship,\\" after Frodo Baggins flees with his friend Sam, and his cousins Merry and Pippin are kidnapped by orcs of the renegade wizard Saruman. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli begin a frenetic search for the hobbits, and receive unexpected help from unlikely allies. Meanwhile, the Ring weighs more heavily on Frodo, as he is forced to get help from one of the people he most despised.\\"Return of the King\\" brings the trilogy to an action-packed, slam-bang and ultimately poignant finale. Sam barely rescues Frodo from Sauron's orcs, and the two resume their journey to Mount Doom. As Aragorn leads the desperate battle against Sauron's armies, Frodo falls increasingly under the seductive spell of the Ring.\\"Lord of the Rings\\" is indeed a powerful book, speaking to virtually everyone. J.R.R. Tolkien drew from legends and myths, ranging from the ancient Norse mythology to more recent legends, mingled with his love of the British country folk and his Roman Catholic beliefs. Though there are no direct linkages or lessons in the trilogy, Tolkien drew on his experiences in World War I, the ravaged battlefields, and the mechanization of the countryside for the most moving passages of the book. His beliefs beliefs are equally misty but present: they fueled the ethics of the good guys, the fall of formerly-good wizard Saruman, and the themes of temptation, redemption, evil and good that run through every character.Frodo Baggins is an everyman hero, who dreams of adventure but begins to treasure the simple, boring life that he had once he is deprived of it. His deteriotation is saddening, all the more so because he is aware of how he is influenced by the Ring. Sam Gamgee is his loyal gardener, a shy young hobbit who grows in confidence and courage over the course of the trilogy. Gandalf is the quintessential wizard -- crabby, kindly, powerful, with a hidden unique streak that elevates him over the usual Obi-Wan Kenobi wizards. Merry and Pippin start out as a chirpy boy and a well-meaning flake, but are matured and made more multi-dimensional by their harrowing experiences. Aragorn is noble, kind, kingly, and intelligent, but with darker streaks in his personality that make him ultimately human. Legolas the elf and Gimli the dwarf initially grate on each other, but overcome their prejudices to become close friends.Tolkien's writing is evocative and descriptive, though not to extremes; Mordor, for example, is best described through the way that Sam and Frodo react to it. The dialogue ranges from absolutely hilarious to solemn and biblical, or to some combination of the two. And the pacing is gradual but necessary; if you don't have a good attention span, then you won't be able to handle this story.Even after all the years, \\"Lord\\" still rules the fantasy genre and has become an integral part of modern literature. It's an epic for all ages, and no one book has even come close to equalling it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"UPDATE: After this review went online the publisher corrected the error, so I'm happy to see Tolkien's name as author. I'll leave the review in place to encourage other readers -- these things can make a difference. But I'm glad to give The Lord of the Rings the five stars it deserves.***As a lifelong Tolkien fan it pains me to give less than five stars to my favorite book of all time. But I bought it on Kindle, have a couple of major errors in the Kindle edition, and am apparently unable to get an updated version when the publisher corrects it without getting a refund and reordering the whole thing. That deserves panning regardless of the quality of the writing.Yesterday I downloaded the Kindle edition of The Lord of the Rings -- all three titles in one file -- and while the text appears to be correct, the author is listed in the page headers and the library on my iPad Kindle app not as J.R.R. Tolkien but as Dandi Daley Mackall.In addition, some of the internal hyperlinks seem to jump to the wrong places. But I haven't explored that problem enough to really complain about it yet.I left a note at the Kindle support forums and a respondent there said to go to the Kindle support contact forms. I did that and got an email back saying I had to call someone on the phone. I just spent half an hour on the phone going back and forth with great confusion on the other end. They told me I should get a refund and then re-order the book, then re-download it. I did. I got the exact same file with the wrong author listed.Kindle support ultimately concluded that the Kindle document provided by the publisher had the errors, so there was nothing Amazon could do about it. They suggested I write a review on the product page; so here I am. I encouraged them to contact the publisher, and they said they would try but seemed to be working to figure out how to go about doing that. I asked if I would get an updated version when and if Harper Collins corrects the file, and the Kindle rep said no: I would get no notification at all, and once I decide I want the corrected version I must get a refund and then reorder it and re-download it.The text appears to be correct, so I'm reading this beloved book on my Kindle app and am glad to do so. But with every page I look up and see the wrong author listed, and that drives me nuts. The inability to update the file when the publisher finally corrects it is worse still.I hope Harper Collins corrects their mistake, and I hope Amazon figures out some way to let its customers enjoy the correction when it happens."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I can't say anything about Tolkien's masterful fantasy classic that hasn't already been said better, so this review only speaks to the product, not the content. If you're looking to buy a new edition of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, this \\"film art\\" hardcover boxed set is absolutely wonderful.Most importantly, the text is identical to the standard Houghton Mifflin hardcover edition published in 1988. Many people aren't aware that numerous cheap reprints have been made over the years, often riddled with misspellings and text errors. This set was obviously composed by people who knew and loved Tolkien's texts and took care to render them correctly. The books themselves are also a joy to hold and read; the paper is a thick, lovely, high quality bond, printed in an elegant, easily readable font.Each front cover features a different scene from the movies (and books, obviously): Fellowship of the Ring shows a wonderful view of Hobbiton, The Two Towers has a conversation between Gandalf and Saruman in Orthanc before things got ugly, and Return of the King features the Rohirrim galloping off to war. The box cover has another striking picture of the Rohan army, holding aloft a forest of green banners with the white horse of &Eacute;orl. There are no photographs inside the books themselves.The back cover also has four small insets with pictures of the characters, starting in order from volume one: Boromir, Galadriel, Gandalf, Frodo; volume two: Gimli, Sam, Saruman, Aragorn; and volume three: Legolas, Th&eacute;oden, &Eacute;omer, and &Eacute;owyn. In addition, each book has Tolkien's original map of Middle Earth as a huge fold-out piece in the back (including the zoomed-in version with a more detailed view of Gondor and environs in Return of the King), printed in red and black.The boxed set is a tasteful and elegant tie-in between the books and the films. Unlike those cheesy light-up Burger King goblets (and don't get me started on the battery operated One Ring or orc-head beer mugs), I'm actually proud to display these in my home.

It is true that the cover is not real leather; if that is your sole reason for buying this book, then skip it of course. But it is a beautiful edition. The chapter titles and page numbers at the top and bottom of the pages are printed in red ink, which sets them off from the black ink of the text. The inside covers (front and back) are a red and black marbled design on thick sturdy paper. The large fold-out map fit perfectly within the last few pages, and again is printed in black and red ink, making it easy to distinguish topographical features in black from place names and labels in red.

It's the best book I've ever readed. This edition, illustrated by Alan Lee, just came to crown my collection. If you want emotion, beauty and speak like an Elf... this is your book. Amazing."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Though Tolkien was not the first or most critically-acclaimed fantasy writer, he remains the most beloved and influential, even though \\"Lord of the Rings\\" is decades old. Now with the epic movie trilogy based on this book, new waves of readers are discovering the unique power of the \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" It has quietly created the fantasy genre as we know it, set the tone for most fantasy ever since, topped many \\"best book\\" polls, and helped spawn such entertainment phenomena as \\"Star Wars.\\"Following up on events in \\"The Hobbit,\\" \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" stars the quiet, good-natured hobbit Frodo Baggins, who has inherited a golden Ring that allows its user to become invisible. But his friend, Gandalf the wizard, informs Frodo that the Ring is really the Ring of Power, a tiny invulnerable token that the demonic Dark Lord Sauron has poured his essence and power into. And if Sauron can regain the Ring, he will be able to conquer Middle-Earth. Aghast, Frodo joins a fellowship of Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, Men and a wizard, to go to the one place where the Ring can be destroyed: Mount Doom.\\"The Two Towers\\" begins directly after \\"Fellowship,\\" after Frodo Baggins flees with his friend Sam into Mordor, with no one to protect them. His cousins Merry and Pippin are kidnapped by orcs from the renegade wizard Saruman. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli begin a frenetic search for the hobbits, and receive unexpected help from unlikely allies. Meanwhile, the Ring weighs more heavily on Frodo, as he is forced to get help from one of the people he most despised: the Ring's slave Gollum.\\"Return of the King\\" brings the trilogy to an action-packed, slam-bang and ultimately poignant finale. Sam barely rescues Frodo from Sauron's orcs, and the two resume their journey to Mount Doom, barely escaping Sauron's forces. As Aragorn leads the desperate battle against Sauron's armies at the city of Minas Tirith, Frodo falls increasingly under the seductive spell of the Ring.\\"Lord of the Rings\\" is indeed a powerful book, speaking to virtually everyone who has read it. J.R.R. Tolkien drew from legends and myths, ranging from the ancient Norse mythology to more recent legends, mingled with his love of the British country folk and his Roman Catholic beliefs. Though there are no direct linkages or lessons in the trilogy, Tolkien probably drew on his experiences in World War I for the ravaged battlefields and breakneck action sequences. His beliefs are equally misty but present: they fueled the ethics of the good guys, the fall of formerly-good wizard Saruman, and the themes of temptation, redemption, evil and good that run through every character.Frodo Baggins is an everyman hero, who dreams of adventure but begins to treasure the simple, boring life that he had once he is deprived of it. His deteriotation is saddening, all the more so because he is aware of it. Sam Gamgee is his loyal gardener, a shy young hobbit who grows in confidence and courage. Gandalf is the quintessential wizard -- crabby, kindly, powerful, with a hidden unique streak that elevates him over the usual. Merry and Pippin start out a bit flaky, but are matured by their harrowing experiences. Aragorn is noble, kind, kingly, and intelligent, but with darker streaks in his personality that make him ultimately human. Legolas the elf and Gimli the dwarf initially grate on each other, but overcome their prejudices to become close friends.Tolkien's writing is evocative and descriptive, though not to extremes; Mordor, for example, is best described through the way that Sam and Frodo react to it. The dialogue can range from goofy and hilarious to solemn and archaic, or to some combination of the two. And the pacing is gradual but necessary -- readers with short attention spans won't be able to handle this story. If they can handle sprawling, epic tales, then probably they can.Even after all the years, J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" still rules the fantasy genre and has become an integral part of modern literature. It's an epic for all ages, and few books have even come close to equalling it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"For anyone who is a true fan of Professor Tolkien's works, this is a must-have book.

I started reading fantasy a year ago and seeing all of the movies just released the book was the next step. After reading the Fellowship portion I couldn't believe how much was left out in the movie (let alone changed for pacing).The amount of detail is almost as if reading a history book (with great interest, not boring). If you are looking for a fast read this isn't for you. If you enjoy lots of detail and even enjoy reading a well-written history book I recommend this for you. Don't let the prelude scare you it's a bit much at first but once the first chapter begins be prepared to enter middle earth for a very long time!!!!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Here's a little 'history' of the publishing: when Tolkien wrote 'Lord of the Rings', he wrote it as one book, wanted it read as one book, published as one book. 2 out of 3 isn't bad. Back in the day (1954-55) it was costly to print it as one book, so it got split into 3 (Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, Return of the King). Many years later, you go to the book shop and it like wall-to-wall with different varities of this book. I highly recommend getting the 'single voulme'. One book is easier to keep track of and store rather than three. Plus, it's how Tolkien WANTED it to be published. Now that he has passed away (Sept 2, 1973), as a reader, it's kind to respect his wishes. I don't want to spoil the book, other than you should The Hobbit first to really KNOW the WHOLE story, though you don't have to. Both The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings are excellent books. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring tells the story of the Hobbit Frodo Baggins and of how he discovers that the invisibility ring handed down to him by his uncle Bilbo is in fact the One Ring of Power, the most dangerous of artifacts, forged by the evil lord Sauron to ensnare all the peoples of Middle-Earth and bent them to his will. It has to be destroyed! Following Gandalf the old Wizard's advice, Frodo leaves his quiet Hobbit hole in the Shire and with three of his friends, makes for Rivendell to seek the Elves' counsel. There he volunteers to be the Ring-Bearer, the one who must destroy the Ring by casting into the very fire in which it was forged, in the furnaces of Mount Doom. With eight companions, he sets off on a most perilous quest, over mountains and under them, on rivers and through forests beautiful beyond words, to the heart of Mordor.The adventure goes on in The Two Towers. The Fellowship has just been broken, and as the Hobbits Merry and Pippin are captured by Orcs to be brought to the traitor wizard Saruman, now the ally of Sauron, Frodo and his friend Sam are slowly making their way through desolate plains and treacherous bogs, to Mordor. Soon they realize that Gollum, a nasty creature who once possessed the Ring, is following them. Captured, and still under the irresistible lure of the Ring, the twisted wretch agrees to become their guide to the forsaken land. Meanwhile Aragorn the Heir of Kings, Legolas the Elf and Gimli the Dwarf are running across the grassy plains of Rohan, the domain of the Rohirrim horse masters, to rescue Merry and Pippin and later help Th&eacute;oden, King of Rohan, defend his people against Saruman's army in the battle of Helm's Deep.In The Return of the King, as Frodo and Sam are ineluctably treading closer to the heart of danger, putting the goal of their quest in jeopardy every day a little bit more as Frodo's mind threatens to give in to the power of the Ring, Aragorn and his companions must defend the beautiful white city of Minas Tirith, capital of Gondor, in a hopeless struggle against Sauron's reckless army of berserkers.How does one go about writing a review of such a masterpiece, now that The Lord of the Rings is not only the second most read book of the twentieth century (after the Bible), but also a blockbuster movie trilogy? How does one do it justice? One just can't. That's it, I admit defeat. I simply lack superlatives to describe the tidal waves of emotions that overwhelm me each time I read this book. So I'll just say this: read it. And re-read it. And again.The Lord of the Rings is timeless, atemporal. Even though Tolkien himself was notoriously not fond of allegories, I can't help seeing that, in these dark and sad days of our time, it stands as a beacon, a bright message of peace, telling us that even when evil and fear threatens to drown us all, there's still hope... May it be tomorrow's Bible."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This was a very good buy, and it arrived at my doorstep in a reasonable amount of time.

The maps are fantastic, though like other reviewers have said they do rip quite easily. But, that doesn't distract from the greatness of the volume.

Extremely pleased!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This book is one of the most amazing books I have ever have had the pleasure to read. This is a story of Good V Evil, to put it simply. A fellowship is created to destroy the one ring to rule them all. They're mission is to head to Mt. Doom so that they can vanquish Sauron. Sauron's plan is to dominate middle earth through terror deceit and betrayal.The other races of middle earth have to band together to defeat the most evil being that has his eye set on complete domination. Frodo and his gang have to traverse through strange lands and are tested often through not only combat, but also with trust and friendship.There are periods of the book that are difficult to read just because of Tolkien's writing style. It is not one of those books that you can quickly read. It will take constant attempts to make it through the portions of the book that do not have heavy dialogue or intense action.I recommend that you try not to compare it to the movies as you will probably just stop reading and watch the movies in order to \\"get to the end\\".

Bought for my mother who has 3 children who read this decades ago and now she is catching up! Since she has the same edition we can follow her page by page."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I first read Tolkien when I was skiing in the Rocky Mountains. A copy of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was lying around the cabin where we were staying, and I innocently picked it up. Some twenty years later, I am still can't put down any of Tolkien's writings. And in the &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; Tolkien distills his already phenomenal talents, imagination and learning into its most potent form.But what is the power of the trilogy? There are stories that are more action-packed, more prolix in their descriptions and (with the notable example of Robert Jordan) much longer. But Tolkien has created a peculiarly bewitching book, with a blend of his love of mythology and folklore, his vast learning in the area of languages and the skill at writing he honed through being a part of the academic world at Oxford University. Tolkien participated in a group at Oxford called \\"The Inklings\\" who included several people including C.S. Lewis, Charles Williams and (by honorable mention) Dorothy L. Sayers. From the reading of several of their works, they had a particular concern for the \\"Mythopoeic\\" aspects of literature.Recently when dabbling in some of the collected works of C.G.Jung, I was struck by how much his ideas of the collective unconscious tapped into the same vein of inspiration that is so present in Lewis and Williams, and above all in Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" I went back and re-read my \\"Lord of the Rings\\" after reading Jung. The experience was astonishingly vivid. Figures with terrible primeval power seemed to stalk from Jung through Tolkien into my imagination. It made our conscious world of rational cause and effect into a pale shadow beside the images Tolkien has conjured out of the dark misty world of the unconscious.Like most epic myths, the characters are in some way secondary to the vividness of the story. While Tolkien's characters are human (or a reasonable variation thereof), they are also representatives of elemental ideas. Strider/Aragorn is more than a mere heir of Kings, he is the essence of Kingship. Gandalf, more than just the leader of the Fellowship of the Ring, is the very archetype of the wise old man who leads people to mature self-knowledge. Frodo Baggins (the protagonist and hero of the trilogy) moves inexorably from being a part of the mundane world into the realm of being a hero in the mythopoeic world. As Frodo changes, the \\"viewpoint\\" of the story changes - from being Frodo's own personal viewpoint to being that of him observed by his servant Sam Gamgee. Frodo, through his actions, moves from history into myth, from prose into poetry, from flesh into spirit.The \\"Lord of the Ring's\\" epic power springs from its ability to connect with deep human intuitions or beliefs or attitudes about the nature of life, of good and evil, and of time and eternity. Vivid and flashing, the images move directly from the written page into our own unconscious. To those with whom Tolkien connects, the response is visceral and overwhelming - and something that can't quite be explained by the rational mind. I suppose to someone, with whom Tolkien doesn't connect, this is all vaguely unsettling and a bit mystifying. To someone who was expecting a standard sword and sorcery confection, Tolkien must appear ponderous, heavy and leaden.In summary, for everyone with the slightest interest in mythology or folklore, Tolkien's work can not be missed. Go elsewhere if all you want is a quick-read escapist confection of swords and wizards."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This review is just about the Centennial Edition.

How can you describe the events contained herein without stooping to hackneyed and trite phrases? It's the classic hero's journey, descending into the underworld and returning wounded with the means to save the land from its peril. It's the story of a little man who finds the fate of the world in his hands, and of how he and his servant lay down their lives in service of the Good, and prevail against all odds. There, see how trite it all sounds? But there is a power in this work that can raise your neck hair and make you fear the Shadow that falls even now across half of Middle-Earth, the orc-talk and filth and disregard for beauty that was crashing across Europe while this book was being formed. Even though my evil sympathies are with Saruman rather than Gandalf, I cheered when the Nazgul fell (my cousin married a Nazgul and he used to beat her). One Ring to rule them all, and I mean ALL."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"When I got my Kindle, the first book I wanted was LOTR. It is one of my absolute favorite books, and it is a thrill to be able to take the full tome with me wherever I go and still have room for Shakespeare, Twain, and thousands of others!While I am enjoying re-reading LOTR on my device, I cannot let slide the embarrassing number of typos present in the text. It's especially shameful after taking the time to read the notes on the text wherein the publishers expound on how hard they worked to free this edition (taken apparently from the 50th Anniversary edition) from defect. A couple of examples: East Farthing once becomes Eastfar thing, Eomer once becomes E, and Baradur once becomes Baraduen.Now, I should state that the occasional typo over the course of such a large book does not take away from my overall enjoyment of the story, but it does somewhat diminish my involvement by forcing me to re-read passages in order to understand what was meant to have been said.So, I recommend this Kindle edition with reservations. It's the only way you'll have this great work to put in your pocket, but it is a flawed jewel in this edition."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"What's so great about the Kindle Edition:1.

It's a real joy to carry my slender Kindle instead of the huge LOTR books, which are big even in paperback.There is nothing more I could write that would add to what has been written about this outstanding trilogy. Many rightfully claim it is the best set of books ever written, and I'm inclined to agree; it certainly is the best fantasy/mythology ever written. Getting this in a Kindle version is a huge win for readers!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is a beautiful, 1-volume copy of the LOTR books. A good size and good heft (not a small copy that is too hard to read)."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is a marvelous dramatization of the Lord of the Rings. Overall, a much, much better adaptation of the book than the visually gorgeous but otherwise very disappointing movie trilogy. The acting here is mostly superb, and dialogues are almost always straight from Tolkien's pages. The renditions of Frodo, Gandalf, and above all Sam are truly great. Aragorn would also be very convincing, if it weren't for the actor's voice, who has a funny way to pronounce the letter \\"s\\"! Anyway, this is a trifle, and the overall rendition is great. Here you will not find any of the silly and gratuitous adaptations that somehow spoiled the three movies. In particular, Merry and Pippin are not presented as two half-witted comical characters, but they are presented in all their complexity. And you won't have Liv Tyler playing the stupid and intolerably ethereal role created for her by Hollywood. And you won't have to endure the unbelievably stupid scene were Gollum convince Frodo to \\"abandon\\" Sam, or the (sadly) legendary sequence where Frodo, after losing the ring (and his finger inside it...) FIGHTS WITH GOLLUM ON THE BRINK OF THE PRECIPICE, AND OF COURSE IT LOOKS LIKE THEY BOTH FALL, AND OF COURSE ONLY GOLLUM FALLS, AND OF COURSE SAM RESCUES FRODO GRABBING FRODO'S HAND JUST ONE SECOND BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. The BBC production does necessarily cuts much (no Bombadil, no Ghan-Buri-Ghan, for example), but what is left is 95% pure Tolkien, and 5% transition between narratives. Peter Jackson and his pals should have looked here for the book's adaptation.I have already listened to the full box twice, and I will surely do it again. If you enjoyed the book, and you would like to \\"hear it\\" come alive, especially if you have been disappointed by the gratuitous concessions to Hollywood misery imposed by Peter Jackson and his pals, you should definitely purchase this box. Especially because another alternative, the UNABRIDGED version of the book, is not so good, as the reader's voice is very ill-suited to the epic tone of the trilogy. I know there are also partial renditions of the book read by Tolkien himself, but I do not know those."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I pity the handful of reviewers below who believe they have &quot;outgrown&quot; Middle Earth. No doubt they are like those readers who have outgrown Dickens or Wordsworth or any other great writer who retains a child-like (*not* childish -- a very different thing) sense of wonder.I have just finished reading The Lord of the Rings for perhaps the sixth or seventh time since first encountering it at the age of 12. At 40, it moves me as much as ever, but in different ways. I now appreciate the deep sadness behind the adventure far more than I did as a boy, when I didn't understand that all that is most precious to us does indeed pass away, and that we can only hope to find our own Grey Havens at the end of a long and perilous journey.I want to add just one thing to the many excellent comments below: I believe that what is in many ways the whole key to Tolkien's creation is the juxtiposition of the Shire with the epic world beyond its borders. The Shire represents everything that is solid and stable and rich about so-called &quot;ordinary&quot; domestic life. But part of its richness depends on the possibilties for grand adventure that lie beyond its borders. The fire in the well-tended hearth at Bag End burns all the more brightly because of the shadows of the Old Forest, and the deep night of Moria, and the looming darkness of Barad-dur. There is more hobbit than hero in almost all of us, but the essence of Tolkien's genius is displayed when he reminds us that there is a hero hiding somewhere deep within even the most timid hobbit.Ultimately, the only real test of literature is whether it lasts. And the works that last are those that speak to the deepest fears, desires, hopes, and imaginative needs of the reader. To the skeptic and cynic who dismisses Tolkien, no better reply can be given than the hundreds of reviews below, that illustrate how this book has meant more to countless readers than perhaps any other work of imagination written in the last 50 years. That is the true test of greatness -- and by that test The Lord of the Rings is a truly great book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I bought this a few years ago and the picture is nothing compared to the real thing.

As a storyteller, however, I am uncertain as to how skilled he was. Oh yes, the plot is excellent for one of the early fantasies, and the world he created so thoroughly designed. But one of the biggest turn-offs to me was the lengthy introduction. A good author should not have to explain the elements of his fantasy realm in an introduction. We should be able to find out about hobbits and the leaves they smoke in the normal content of the novels. Any author worth their moldy gym socks knows that they must introduce information slowly, interspersing it throughout the book. Each tidbit should make you want to find out more about the world. What you should NOT do is dump a load of info into the reader's lap before they have even met the characters or have a reason to care about their world.Tolkien's flowery, descriptive language also gets in the way a lot. It's beautiful, yes, but interesting? No. It also lengthens the books by quite a bit, resulting in a compounded telephone-book sized trilogy. One would think that the story would wind down after the climax (which I will not reveal to you, if you should happen to ignore my advice and buy the books). It doesn't. It continues to ramble onwards for at least 75 more pages. By this point, I had given up. Lord of the Rings was not what it was cracked up to be.Those looking for a good fantasy, turn to more modern sources. Authors like Vivian Vande Velde (Heir Apparent), J.K. Rowling (Harry Potter), Brian Jacques (Redwall), and Tamora Pierce (The Immortals Quartet) will be able to give you the thrill you so deserve."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I am a big fan of fantasy books and roleplaying games. For years people have been telling me that I MUST read Lord of the Rings. I have always had doubts, for two reasons. First, I saw the old cartoon movies, which put me to sleep. Second, I hate Halflings/Hobbits. My reasoning is simple: I find the idea of short, chubby, jolly people that love to eat, sing, and sleep to be unheroic. Yet somehow, this series wants to make them heroic.Well, the movie is coming out, and many people say this book is great, so I picked it up.So far, it is everything I feared it would be.I have read 130 pages filled with hobbit lameness, and the total cumulation of actual events could have easily been written in 20 pages, with a decent level of description and atmosphere. There is at least one superfluos poem or song every 3 pages that usually begins with \\"O!\\", and has a minimum of 5 more exclamation points throughout. I hate cheesy poetry about mundane acts, and I hate it when people overuse exclamation points. I must also criticize Tolkein's use of misspellings as \\"flavor\\". If he wants to make up new words, and explain them using footnotes at the bottom of the page, that is great. I feel it adds flavor, and shows that the world differs from our own. Simply misspelling \\"wagon\\" doesn't cut it, and by his own admission, irritated the hell out of his edditors (Look! Flavor! O!).I desperately want to drench this book in oil, light it on fire, and throw it into oncoming traffic. The problem is, I will then be criticised with \\"you haven't read the whole book, you are judging it on such a small portion of it\\". Well, it is one thing to put a book down after the first chapter, or the first 10 pages. I figure that within 130 pages, I know if I aminterested in where the book is going. The idea of the hobbits wandering into the evil forest and being saved by some godlike being in their first \\"adventure\\" reminds me much of High School D&D.; \\"Everything has to be amazing and spectacular, lets make them meet the eternal spirit of the earth on the first adventure! Lets have them stumble into an unescapable doom, and not allow their own wiles to get them out! Instead, let's introduce my new all powerful NPC to save their butts! O!\\" The only difference is that my friend Mike and I would have made an NPC that was a badass of some sort (I'm not saying that makes it better, it is just the only difference), instead of a fruitcake that sang songs about picking lillies off of the wallpaper. Oh, and did I mention that he is short, jolly, and likes to eat?I am torn. I don't know if I want to force myself through several more hours of suffering in order to give it another chance, or just toss the thing and assume that the movie will take that 130 pages and condense it into the 5 minutes it deserves. I certainly will be happy not to see any \\"O!\\"s in the movie."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I love the quiet sinister beggining - up until bree this book is good.

I don't know how someone who wrote something as good as &quot;The Hobbit&quot; could produce this junk. I think what happened was he had a bunch of notes left over, and wanted to cash in by writing a sequel, so he threw all the details he had onto a shallow plot, but sense it was to complicated to be called &quot;dumbed-down&quot; like most money-making sequels noone could attack it. And it was so complicated people have been trying to convince others for decades that they're intellegent because they can understand this book, but since noone understands it, noone can test them to see if they really do or not.

However, these books were more like a double dose of NyQuil. I can't believe I wasted 12 hours listening to these. There are far too many characters and the books jump from sub-plot to sub-plot so often that they never established my interest in any one thread. There was no action or suspense. I didn't see the movie but can imagine that it may have been more interesting with the help of the visual effects. This story seems to be perfect for a movie....it needs some kind of help.

They are supposed to be good I think, and the guy in the tower is supposed to be bad. But as they all seem to have an equal penchant for fighting, and since we never get much insight into the tower-guy's personality or designs, it is hard to discern between them. Reading this book, I kept asking myself: Why couldn't the \\"good\\" just invite the tower-guy over for tea instead, maybe they could have become the best of friends?It is not that I dislike long novels.

LotR's position in the world of fantasy has never been challenged. The story is simply too great. Situated in a whole new world, with its own background, its own legends, history and culture, Tolkien tells about the escalation of the battle between good and evil. What started out as the simple discovery of the powers of an ancient artifact, owned by the unlikely heroes of the story, Bilbo and Frodo Baggins, hobbits, finally results in an all-consuming war between the peoples of middle-earth.What made the story so rich, is that it's a legend containing other legends. While reading it you can't help but be overwhelmed by the complexity of middle-earth's history. While modern fantasy-stories tend to be superficial tales set in a stereotypical environment, presenting stereotypical heroes and bad-guys, LotR keeps a sense of historical realism.On the other hand, the story is quite old-fashioned in a way. Good is good and bad is bad. There's hardly any character development: heroes stay heroes, bad guys stay bad guys. There's no gray area. There's no real romance, besides the &quot;hero meets royal girl and both instantly feel true love&quot;-thing. The story itself is pretty straight-forward, and although the journey and battle are long, as a reader you never doubt a happy ending will follow. Humor is pretty scarce, which sometimes gives the story a dry flavour.But even with these minor points of criticism in mind, LotR is still by far the best fiction I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This book is considered the number one book of the twentieth century, and after reading it I can see why.

Tolkien's genius lies in many places, not the least of which is in creating the most complete fantasy world I have ever heard of. It has its own history, mythology, and languages, and as you read the story you get the feeling that Middle-Earth actually exists. But Tolkien's true gift lies in the way in which he writes of human emotions, ironically by not using human characters. When one reads the story, one feels a greater connection to hobbits or elves then to men. And the character depth and complexety is unrivaled. Very few characters in the story have simplistic characterizations (i.e. are perfectly good or terribly bad). This is incredibly difficult to do, and it is very rare to find the author who can attempt this level of depth successfully. I sincerely doubt that I will ever read a book to match this one's greatness in my lifetime."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This book is my favorite, and I'm only a teen!

This book will forever be remembered by the countless millions who have read it as the book which has led them to believe in hope, and in the belief that good will ultimately triumph over evil. A world which has been so lovingly crafted, that the a little detail, seemingly unimportant in the Hobbit, leads to the events unfolding in this masterpiece. Set in Middle Earth where Elves have dominance, this book sees the Dark Lord, Sauron gaining strength - and sees the Humans and their allies making a last desperate stand against the greatest evil ever written about in a book. Tolkien has woven a world so rich in detail, lovingly crafted with a beautiful history to match - which is unsurpassed until today. Tolkien weaves his story with such seamless power, so realistically, you\`ll be wishing you were there, wielding a sword next to Aragorn or drinking Ent Wash with Treebeard in the shade of Mirkwood.

The only thing I can say against this book is the gloomy cover, (I read the special edition so I didn't have to worry about that) but I suppose the book was kind of gloomy. I think they should have drawn Loth Lorean. NOTE: I think I that I may have spelt Lorean wrong, but I am not sure. Also I have been reviewing books all over amazon.com and giving myself fake names. Especially Diane Duanes wonderfull collection. Please check those out too."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"There's nothing wrong in principle with writing a long book about a magical world that doesn't exist. Fantasy writers like JRR show us alternative worlds that, at their best, can make us see our own world afresh. That is what art is supposed to do, and that's why we love it.Unfortunately, since I've been old enough to drive I've found it hard to get a lot of value out of Middle Earth. When I was ten I thought the elves were way cool. It was nice to know that there were genuinely good folks around. Now I want to know what makes them so good. Apparently, they just are. What if you, dear reader, happened to be born an orc? What would you have to do to be accepted in polite society? How would you get on at dinner parties? Could you and I be friends? I don't think so. Orcs aren't like real-estate agents or Frenchmen, essentially well-meaning people whose deeds may be worse than their hearts. Orcs are bad twenty-four seven. It's what they do. Needless to say, there'll be no Marshall Plan for Mordor after the War of the Ring. Mordor was never the land of Bach and Beethoven, a cradle of learning and civilization that just happened to be tragically seduced by megalomaniac twerp. Nope, Mordor is bad through-and-through. There's no point in nurturing democracy or a post-War economic miracle. It'd be a waste of time. Me, I find a world of Goethe-reading concentration-camp guards vastly more terrifying - and way more interesting - than a world threatened by nasty orcs and ring-wraiths.What about our heroes? Frodo and Sam are hobbits. They are homely by instinct and like food and drink, but they prove hardy and brave on adventures. Gimli is a dwarf. He is gruff but lovable, and likes caves and stonework. Legolas is an elf. He is beautiful and good, and likes trees. Aragorn is the heir of Isildur. He is grim and noble, but kindly. And so on. That's all you need to know about these guys, and that's all you're going to find out. The narrative seems to come down to will-they-or-won't-they. If they don't, that's bad news for Middle Earth. But it's not clear what's at stake for the rest of us.What about the writing? Don't get me wrong, no one likes a good epic or heroic narrative more than me, and if that means archaizing language, so be it. But it's hard not to giggle when the characters start to get their word order mixed up or use words like \`fell' and \`fain' and \`ere'. Maybe if the diction were consistent it would sound less silly, but the register often changes without warning from Quite Sensible (when plebeian races like hobbits are talking) to Frightfully Lofty (usually when important and powerful folks are talking with each other). Somewhere in the vast appendices at the end Tolkien claims he's faithfully representing the changes in register and formality that occur in Middle Earth languages. I guess that's OK, but it still sounds silly. All the more so when the narrator himself unaccountably parrots the ham-fisted diction of his characters. (\`And she answered as one that likes not what is said.')I hesitate to diss the great man for two reasons. First, Tolkien-bashing is a favourite sport of black-skivvy-wearing literary hipsters. It's a way of showing you belong with other arty nobbers, and it's annoying. Second, there's no denying the man's achievement. To create a world as vast and coherent as Middle Earth virtually ex nihilo is a spectacular feat of the imagination. The sense of wonder that Middle Earth, with its magicky atmosphere and breathtaking landscapes, inspired in me as a kid has never quite left me. These days I find it all rather dull and long-winded, but if you find yourself as captivated as I used to be, then good luck to you. Happy reading."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I've read the book, listened to the tapes by the BBC, and seen the first movie.

Certainly, it is fantasy, but I should like its protagonists to have to exercise some ethical judgment.

This would be a mistake; it is one of the finest stories in literature, and well worth its reputation.Granted, it is not to everyone's taste; nothing is. Some may find it overly wordy or pretentious; this reviewer finds some of Tolkien's other works (notably his postumously published works, such as &quot;The Silmarilien&quot; and the &quot;Books of Lost Tales&quot;) to fit that description, and granted, this book occasionally comes closer to that than its companion volume, &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, which is told in a much more accessible, lighthearted style. (Others may not care for the heroic-fantasy genre at all; there's no accounting for taste.) This book, however, is intended to be a more serious tale, and its style reflects that. But it only rarely takes itself over-seriously, (at least until one finishes the actual story and reads the appendices, if one indeed bothers doing so) and is a story of much grander scope and accomplishment than &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.This book is nothing less than THE seminal modern heroic fantasy story; everything that has come after it owes much to its influence. Just as there were vampire stories before Bram Stoker's &quot;Dracula&quot;, there was heroic fantasy before Tolkien. And as there are modern vampire stories that diverge greatly from the concepts in &quot;Dracula&quot;, so there are modern heroic fantasies that similarly diverge from the concepts in &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;. Yet just as &quot;Dracula&quot; is unquestionably a major influence on all vampire fiction that has come after, so with &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; and heroic fantasy. If any author of heroic fantasy has not read this book (unlikely in and of itself) they still could not escape its influence, because WHATEVER stories they may have read that influenced their writings are guaranteed to have been influenced by Tolkien and this book. It is simply unavoidable.This is an absolute must-read for anyone with any interest at all in the heroic fantasy genre.

Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy to be the single most creative thing to come out of a human being's mind, ever. It is more than a masterpiece. If you read one novel in your entire life, let it be this one. It has everything: Legends and monsters, kings and princesses, friendship, love, hate, gentle humor, huge battles, small heartbreaks, captures, escapes, life, death, heroes, heroines, a truly great villian and one ring to tie them all together.As I see it, there are three kinds of great books: First, the kind that enables you to visualize the people and places you are reading about, secondly, the kind that are so vivid you feel like you are watching a movie, and thirdly, the rarest and most special kind, where you are THERE, watching things happen to people you know and care about. \\"Lord of the Rings\\" is such a book.Due to the huge popularity of Peter Jackson's films, most of you already know the plot, so I won't bother with that.

(It's also a lot cheaper but that's another issue.) Also, it's easier to navigate the book using the index at the back if you use a paperback. I've found it useful to dip in and out of the text with the help of the index. Not many novels have an index and this one happens to have one, thus making the paperback very convenient.Don't bother buying the three-separate-books version unless you don't find it necessary to use the index. If you use the index a lot, three separate books will drive you nuts.Tolkien's own complaint about the book is that it's too short (see foreword to the second edition). I agree. No doubt the story would have been far more exciting with twice the length and three times the number of characters. A longer book perhaps would have made the appearances of dragons possible. There are no dragons in this story, as it stands. (Dragons do exist in Tolkien's mythology, but you'll only find them in The Silmarillion and The Hobbit.)The Silmarillion suffers from having too many characters and from being too short a book. LoTR suffers from having too few characters and also from being too short. Combining the two into one book would have been a splendid idea. Perhaps that's why Tolkien was so unhappy about not being able to publish both books together. The trouble was that he kept making changes to The Silmarillion - he could not settle down to any version. He kept changing his mind.If alive today, Tolkien would still be revising his all his books. But then we might have had another full-length sequel (or prequel) to LoTR! A pity!As far as messages to &quot;take home&quot;, I don't know for sure. Tolkien did not intend his book to be a fable. But I suppose Tolkien wants to tell us that under certain circumstances even very insignificant people (e.g., the hobbits) can do extraordinary things, and that even your enemy (e.g., Gollum) can change your fate for the better. In other words, life is full of surprises."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Hobbit and Lord of the rings have been in print for (40, 63) years and have seen a production run of more than 100 million copies. Perhaps only the bible and the phonebook are more popular than these books. Tolkien, a professor mythology at Cambridge, created a world with its own maps and mythology and history and characters, and after about 20 years of creating this mythology he began to write his books. His books are filled with marvelous new creatures (Balrogs, Ring-Wraiths, Ents, Orcs, etc.) and Tolkein's level of \\"vivid imagination per page\\" is usurpassed. The plot lines concern good, evil, courage, deductive reasoning, and the necessity and ability of even the smallest person to influence the course of historyThe 4 volumes (including the childrens book, \\"The Hobbit\\"), inspired in 1974 the most popular fantasy-role playing game of all time, \\"Dungeons and Dragons\\", and just about every successful role playing game there ever was, including the wildly successful computer games \\"EverQuest\\" and \\"Ultima Online\\". This set of stories has inspired nearly 100 other books that analyze or augment Tolkien's work. So this one book set has created two separate industries over the years. Only the Bible can claim to have created more industries than that.The three books concern the plight of Frodo, nephew of Bilbo, who comes into possession of the Ring of Power, a magical ring that will corrupt the wearer if used too much. Frodo resolves to destroy the ring by casting it into a volcano called mount doom, and so begins a quest of 500 miles on foot into the evil realm of Mordor, to face the evil wizard Sauron, who is lord of Mordor and keeper of Mount Doom, and who is arising from the dead, and wants control of the ring in order take over Middle Earth.

I would give anything to read this book brand new and if my review can help anyone to read this book I feel it has been well worth my time to write it.

PLease read it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This series, as a whole, is excellent. In all aspects, it is a masterpeice, a flawless work of art. Indeed, it is flawless, but, in the view of others, definetely not perfect, and I shall explain why:There are many who will get quickly bored by Tolkien's writing style, as it is explicit in detail and, for people who have already read lots of other fantasy, will not introduce them to anything new.But keep in mind, it is every fantasy writer's duty to read this whole series (Including the Hobbit!), as Tolkien is the guy who created and established the fantasy genre into the world, although a lot of the content in his works is based upon historical myths, such as the very existence of dragons in his books.So some people won't like it, but that is not reason enough to give it any less than five stars, and so I repeat my final profound proclamation regarding this series: Now here's a great series. . .Deathsmith"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I've been an avid fan of J. R. R. Tolkien for a long time. I was first enchanted by The Hobbit as a young boy, then awed by The Lord of the Rings as a teenager, and more recently enriched as an adult by the Silmarillion and other works related closely to it. Tolkien's majestic Lord of the Rings, with its lavish description and timeless characters, stirs the blood and keeps in mind the value of character, courage, valor, and friendship. And I am continually reminded of the enormous impact that the very smallest or seemingly insignificant of things (such as a ring) or that the most unlikely of people (such as a hobbit) might have on the world.For the truly discerning collector, this edition may appear to be substandard or cheaply made. I do agree on some points - I would have preferred something more weighty and made of higher quality material. But for me, this edition isn't to be read. I have two well-loved paperback sets for the joyful task of re-reading this series. As a collector's item, I find this a worthwhile investment. Better, fancier or more vintage pieces will definitely come with a higher price tag.I've worked at building a menagerie of Tolkien collectables, and that assembly is only getting larger as I find the time and finances. This piece, although in direct contrast to the early edition prints for which I normally search, is impressive. It is a handsome return to the original concept for the series, being in its intended 6 volume plus appendices format. It was that element which made it necessary for me. This is an fine show piece for any Tolkien collector who desires a nice mix of the best of the old and the new."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is one excellent adventure story across beautiful and devestating terrain, where the main characters are mystical folk called Hobbits, a dwarf, an elf, a wizard and a couple of men. This book is brillinatly imaginative and well written. The cavalcade of different creatures and lands is fun and inticing. The old battle of good vs evil is full of fight and morality. The story never slows, despite its detail and it remains one of the most renound science fiction classics of all time. This book thoroughly deserves such acclaim.The only gripe I have is with this particular &quot;3 books in one&quot; paperback edition. Unfortunately the books first 700 odd pages came off the spine in bunches as I progressed through. I would suggest buying the 3 books seperately or if you want all in one, maybe the hardcover is the way to go."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I can't really explain the immense enjoyment that i got from reading the Lord of the Rings. I was reading during a very rough time, and it was a great help for me to get my mind off things. Tolkein's stories are fascinating, and i can't use any big words like most people here, but all i can say is that this novel is held close to my heart, and i imagine showing my children and grandchildren the wonders held in this book, when i have them. The only thing i have to say about the 7 set black books is that for me, a school student, it was very easy to travel with. But, the box that they come in broke after a month. I would not buy this set unless you planned on leaving the box at home in it's own place. The books are lovely only for the use of traveling with them and the book doesn't seem so overwhelmingly long with it broken up smaller, so it all depends on you really. If you don't buy this set, at least buy some kind of set, I'd rather live with this set then nothing, for this is the greatest book i have and probably will ever read. I was so sad for days after i finished the last page, and i couldn't figure out why. I thought and thought, and it was because i had finished it, it was that good. I had made a routine of reading it during class, after tests, even during PE. I couldn't keep my eyes off of it. You really get attached to Gandalf, and Frodo, even little Pippin grew on me. Please consider buying some kind of set of this book, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"It is, in my opinion, one of the greatest books ever written.

If you havent read this book, make sure you do at least before the movie comes out."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"When Tolkien created Middle Earth, he created a new mythology that people would read long after his death. The Lord of the Rings is an inspiration for many modern day writers as well as readers. The culters brought out in the book seem real. The characters are rich. The story is classic. No one can go through life without ever experiencing such a wonderful story.The story is about a hobbit, Frodo, who is given the ONE RING that can destroy all of Middle Earth if it is put into the hands of its maker, the Dark Lord Sauron. Now, this simple innocent fellow, who lives in a part of the land where nothing bad ever happens, must travel out into the dark and evil realm of Middle Earth to throw the ring into the fires where it was created. The past converges with the present in order to save the future of their world. The epic war of the ring has begun, and the Halfling must fulfill his quest or all would be lost.If you haven't read the book, there is no time to waste.

I don't think that there could ever be enough said about someone how does all that. And these aren't some books, this book, not only inspired every single fantasy writer to the day, but this and The Hobbit invented fantasy. I mean, what else do you want.

There is no point in not reading it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Lord of the Rings. If you have not heard of it by now you should buy this.

Life gets a new heroic point of view. This book is inspiration for art, for friendship, for all life. A masterpiece. The first chapters could be better (a little bit faster), but the whole book is excellent: don't give up in the first 50 pages, just keep reading. But don't read only this, the world is big, and there are many authors, from Shakespeare to Cervantes, from Borges to Ende, Chesterton, Tolstoi. Tolkien is not in these cheap fantasy author's level. Keep it in mind."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The audio version of The Lord of the Rings, published by Soundelux, is the truest way to hear this story. My kids and I were thrilled with the wooden crate the cassettes are sold in. I had watched the movies based on J.R.R. Tolkien's books as a young girl and loved them. This recording is even better than the movies. It allows the listener to really become a part of the story. My children and I listened to the cassettes on a road trip/vacation this summer and they couldn't get enough! The music, voices and story itself mesmerized my two youngsters so greatly, they didn't want to get out of the car when we arrived at our day's destination.

J.R.R. Tolkien's trilogy is a masterpiece of all fiction writing. Telling the treacherous and dangerous adventure of the hobbit Frodo Baggins, this book deserves all the acclamations of literature. It is filled with suspense and you will not put it down until you are done (unless you make the highly common decision of reading it again).This trilogy is absolutely fantastic. It tells the story of Frodo Baggins whose mission is to cast the &quot;One Ring&quot; into the scorching fires of Mordor, and hence destroy the source of all evil. Filled with many characters of unique description, and lands of picturesque beauty and treacherous evil, you will be compelled to follow the journey of Frodo Baggins as he tackles all sorts of evil.J.R.R. Tolkien is the best. He is the most superb author of all of l! iterature. His deftly defined novels are the masterpieces of clearly intelligent work.

Tolkien has given us a world filled with a rich history of languages, stories, and songs -- so much of a history, you almost feel as if Middle-earth had actually existed. Tolkien also gives us what he has termed &quot;eucatasrophe,&quot; the denial of a &quot;universal final defeat,&quot; a fleeting glimpse of joy that &quot;rends indeed the very web of the story, and let's a gleam come through.

My recommended reading age is 13+ years old, and I recommend reading \\"The Hobbit\\" first.When I was 15 years old in high school, I had to read \\"The Hobbit\\" for an English class. After reading that book, the teacher then let us borrow \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". Before I had started \\"The Return of the King\\", I had bought my own set of books. After I had read both books, I actually liked \\"The Hobbit\\" better than \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" at first - because the \\"The Hobbit\\" was brighter: a fun, grand adventure with more humor, whereas \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" was darker: a serious, grim life and death struggle for world survival. But by the time I was about 16, the historical significance of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" began to appeal more to me. This is especially true if you read Appendices A and B of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", and also read the \\"The Silmarillion\\". You begin to understand the rich history of Tolkien's Middle-Earth/ Beleriand creation. How the \\"The Silmarillion\\" brings out the significant events of the First and Second Ages, while the events in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" are the culmination of the Third Age...each Age lasting thousands of years and ending with an immensely significant event.It was 25 years before I read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" again, but Bilbo, Frodo, Sam, Gandalf, Aragorn, Galadriel, Legolas, Gimli, and many more had become household names! I had matured over those years, and my tastes changed. I was no longer a big fantasy/science-fiction reader: instead I was reading military history. I didn't expect to still love \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" the way I did as a teenager. I was happily wrong! This is still an exciting book, but I discovered what I really love...it is allegory-type stories. J. R. R. Tolkien himself has said that \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is not allegory, because he hated allegory where he felt the author is dictating to the reader what is in their story...and that any other interpretation is incorrect. Tolkien wanted a reader to apply their own experiences and tastes to influence what they were reading. OK, but in real history one can still get allegory if their own experiences and tastes allow it. How many can learn about World War II and not apply the basic allegorical interpretation that good triumphs over evil? I've heard of, and can understand, several allegorical interpretations of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". Frodo is like Jesus Christ: bearing the greatest of burdens for world salvation while being tempted to stray from his purpose, and the weight of the ring is similar to Christ's cross . The One Ring is like the atomic bomb: the ultimate weapon that corrupts whoever uses it, despite even good intentions, into a power-hungry creature of evil. There's an ecological message with the Ents trying to protect trees; and also the natural beauty of various places throughout Middle-Earth, while evil beings try to destroy it all (including the use of mechanical and polluting progress). I also get out of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" a sense of a military mission: that Frodo &amp; Sam are behind enemy lines on a mission that could end a war, and that Frodo realizes that getting back home or even staying alive doesn't matter - just completion of the mission...that's also sacrifice, perseverance, &amp; camaraderie so prevalent in the military history I've read. There's prejudice with years of animosity between elves and dwarves, and how small, kind gestures can begin to erase all those blighted years...also, how people or races can put aside differences to solve a common problem. There's the recognition of the small, common people (citizen soldiers) that perform the greatest, toughest, and most necessary duty in any war. There's world peace in peril and that something needs to be done before it's too late. There's avoiding the easier way out, and facing one's problems and seeing them through to a conclusion despite severe hardships.I feel that Tolkien saw a little bit of himself in many of the good races of his world. The hobbits are like Tolkien because they love food, company, and talking about family. The ents are like Tolkien because of their unbounded love of trees. Gandalf the wizard is like Tolkien because of his exceptional intelligence and purpose of guiding others along the right path. Some men are like Tolkien because of their inner strength and gallantry, while other men show weakness by succumbing to evil...very realistic. But I believe he saw the beauty and enchantment of the elves in his wife, and why he loved both most dearly: that's why on their gravestone Luthien appears after his wife's name, and Beren appears after his name. The dwarves don't seem to resemble Tolkien, but they are present in much folklore, which is linked to his personal love of medieval languages.\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is a masterpiece in my opinion, and it's size (over 1000 pages in any printed format) is pretty daunting, but give it a shot! It'll be time well spent. And get ready for adventure, terror, excitement, love, treachery, devotion, monumental historic events, unforgettable battles, military strategy, exotic languages &amp; culture, etc. See what you get out of the book! I think most people will enjoy it and/or be moved by it. And who knows, maybe it'll become your favorite book too!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I hadn't picked up this book until I was in 6th grade. Before then, I was mindlessly infatuated with the Harry Potter series, which I regret now. I remember I was in the movie theaters and one of the previews was for \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\\", and all I could think was that it was really a rather strange looking movie. The boys in my grade were all beginning to read the LOTR series and I was wondering what all the fuss was about. So I bought the books and before long I fell in love with them. They were the most fascinating, amazing books I have ever read in my life, and they were pretty much the only books that have ever touched me. In fact at the end of ROTK, I cried the whole night, mostly because I felt like my journey through Middle Earth and the time with its inhabitants had ended. Tolkien did an amazing job at engaging his readers and indeed by the end I felt like I had shared in all of the characters hardships as well as their joys. I am now 13 and still love Lord of the Rings and was able to relive all the magic and glory in Peter Jackson's amazing movies. Yet, I was a bit disappointed in ROTK because they never really elaborated on many of my favorite parts of the book. But all in all the LOTR trilogy were the best movies ever made.

(And he is) After reading the book, I was talking about nothing else for about a week, which was a shock to my parents who thought Harry Potter was bad enough. The Lord of the Rings trilogy is breath-taking, with it's songs and poems and it's battle scenes. But the most facinating thing is the fact that Tolkien created a whole new mythlogy, which isn't very common in fantasy writers. The languages he created (Elvish and Dwarvish) took alot of dedication, and the fact that he kept on making books about the history of Middle-Earth was shocking.

If I had known that this hardback edition contained so many typographic errors, I would have saved my money without doubt.The Lord of the Rings is a great and challenging book but this &quot;renowned&quot; edition has been a letdown for me and does not do justice to this literary classic.Publishers, edit a new reprinted and revised edition please."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I first read this great book 20 years ago and have re read it dozens of times. Each time it brings new wonders and emotions, the endless depth allows each re reading to be fresh and new. It is a wonderful tale, the greatest fiction I have read; and I include in the comparison list, works by Shakespeare, Dickens, Tolstoy, Dante, Homer, Donaldson, Le Guin and many others!) Tolkein is one of the greatest authors of all time, up there with the aforementioned greats.The modern day fantasy genre owes all to Tolkien, Jordan, Eddings, Brooks and the others are but pale shadows to this masterful original, even though good on on their own. As Tolkien himself stated, if you don't like this work, no reason to feel guilty - the kind of works you probably would admires would be anathema to me, Tolkien and millions of fans.It has great beauty in action and prose, great horrors, despair, indomitable courage, corruption, nobility, love, romance, pride, terrifying villains and monsters, pitiful characters, admirable characters, courageous heroes, cowardly villains, lands of incredible beauty and horror, epic journeys, stupendous battles, and above all, an overwhelming sense of reality. It takes you from the depths of despair to the pinnacle of joy, but as Tolkien readily admitted (strange as it may seem to many) it is too short.The novel is a fantasy, but in not escapist in reality, only to those with little comprehension. The themes are timeless and inspiring. The emotions it conveys cover the whole gamut of the human condition in a way that has not been equalled since or previously. Superficially it is an antiquest to desroty a great evil, but the astounding background detail lends a complete reality to the works that no one has ever achieved.In reality, the book was not Tolkien's main life's work, rather a response to a request for a Hobbit sequel, and to understand Tolkein's masterful creation, you will need to read the other novels, but beware, they are harder to read than average modern reader is willing to put up with. If you can put the effort in, you'll be rewarded, but only if you want to explore the huge background tapestry that underlies the LOR and that lends it such credibility.The films have been incredible, and do justice to the book, but the books are still superior and I mean no insult to the heroic work of the film director and his crew."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is the best book I've ever read!

I bet you haven't. Well, you might want to hear this.J.R.R. Tolkin's book takes place in Middle Earth, a place full of elves, trolls, and hobbits. The main character is a bright, middle aged hobbit named Frodo. Frodo turns out to be the keeper of one of the most powerful things in the world: the One Ring. Frodo, his loyal servant, his two hobbit friends, Gandelf the wizard, two men, Legolas the elf, and Gimili the dwarf set out on a dangerous adventure to destroy the ring.The theme is defiantly adventure or friendship, because it is full of adventure and to succeed the nine I listed above must have a strong, unbending friendship. They had to work together for every challenge.In my opinion, this book is one of the best books I've read. It draws you in to J.R.R. Tolkin's world. If you haven't read it, I suggest you do."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"There are some books that change the genre that produces them, and there are others that are foundational to that genre, coming to define it. You can usually tell the latter by the number of times other authors repeat the same basic formula. For fantasy, there are really two such works: Robert E. Howard's \\"Conan\\" and J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" The irony, of course, is that those who mimic such works rarely, if ever, rise to the level of the original-- in fantasy, the other great works of the genre are things like Ursula LeGuin's \\"The Earthsea Trilogy,\\" which are built on different foundations.The genius of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" isn't really characterization. The characters are mostly walking stereotypes and are clearly subordinate to the plot, which is the archetypal epic quest: dwarves are short and tough, elves old and wise, wizards with long beards and staves, etc. But it should be noted that \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is what created many of these stereotypes, and so it can be forgiven for them in a way that other, derivative works cannot, even if we must acknowledge that Tolkien was not a master of creating characters or developing them through story. No, the genius of these novels is the world of Middle-Earth itself, complete with rich history, mythology, and languages. There is a visual sense to this world that is made all the richer by details such as the elven script and the long history that underlies the story. Middle-Earth is mythbuilding of the highest order, and if you want to understand the genre of fantasy, this is a must-read."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Great edition of the book,Too bad the item was damaged during (or before) shipping.The box was broken and one book has been dropped on its back wich is still visible.Returning the item was not an option because i got it for christmas and could not wait for three weks or more.grtz,"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"We are very pleased with the 50th Anniversary Edition.

Here is a story that will break your heart.&quot;What else can be said on the matter? Not much. The Lord of the Rings is a truly beautiful book; the epitome of fantasy, and perhaps of all literature. It has everything: adventure, romance, suspence, horror, and any other genre one could possibly imagine. If our century is remembered for nothing else wonderful and good, we still have The Lord of the Rings to our credit.And reading it in a beautiful red-leather edition doesn't hurt."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Of the many fantasy novels I have read in my time, I still cannot deny the fact that there is no book more wonderful than the Lord of the Rings. It is a timeless classic that I find myself reading again and again.What really sets this book apart from others in the fantasy genre are subtle yet crucial to making this book a classic. First, because of Tolkien's educational background at Oxford, and talent with old, forgotten languages, he created names and languages that really strike a chord in the reader. The elven languages were a stroke of genious, that linguists still continue to ponder over today. Names for people and locations also resonate in our minds in a unique way as if they were really had existed. Those who are familiar with Old or Middle English will particularly understand this point.More ingenious though is the deep meaning behind the books. The Ring of Power, being a symbol of absolute power, corrupts the minds of all it touches. The wise and strong are particularly vulnerable to its dark touch, even if they intend to use it for good (as Boromir had hoped to do). Like many other aspects of the trilogy, Tolkien clearly intended to reveal many aspects of our lives through this book, and he did so masterfully.As for this particular hardback edition, I enjoy it immensely. It truly feels like a tome from a forgotten time, and fits the mood of the story well. For the true Tolkien fan, I would definitely recommend purchasing this edition. May you enjoy many long hours reading it. :)"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The book is amazingly wonderful. I enjoyed every second of it and can not put it down.

Tolkien takes you for a wild ride through Middle Earth. The Lord of the Rings trilogy is truly a work of art. Not only does Tolkien write and incredible story, he does so inventing incredible characters, species, languages and lands. Tolkien is mesmerizing!The story begins and is told about Frodo Baggins, a hobbit of sorts. Well no the story actually begins back in the book called The Hobbit and the story is about Frodo's uncle Bilbo. You see Bilbo went on and adventure, one that took him to far off lands and to great treasures and excitement. Bilbo, as said before, returned with many great treasures, the greatest of those was unknown to most, but it was most preciousss of all. The most preciousss was a ring.This trilogy is about that One Ring...but this is not any ring, for many rings have been made, and many were magical rings with mysterious powers. This ring however is special. For this ring was forged by the intense furnace of hatred and evil. And used for death, destruction and domination of all kind.\\"One ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in darkness bind them\\"The One however laid unknown to all for many years. Bilbo the keeper and possesor of the ring has become restless for the road and for adventure, so he leaves his treasures and his preciousss for his nephew Frodo. But unfortunatley for Frodo the evil that created the ring, yes the master of that ring, has awoken and now craves it as a flower craves the sun in the dead of winter.And so the quest begins to destroy the One Ring. As he travels bad fortune follows the young hobbit, for in order to destroy the One Ring, Frodo must first transport it safely into the very depths of Morodor, the domain of the Dark Master, avoiding the evil that is controlled by Him. Yet as he joins a group dedicated to the safe transport of the One Ring, he finds that the One Ring draws evil to it. He must not only fight the evil creatures of Middle earth but also the evil inside his each of his companions.

Finally, on a long road trip, I made myself finish the first two books, and when I hit the third book, I got the reward!_The Return of the King_ is worth every plodding moment in the first two installments, IMHO. Though the story has been slow up until this point, suddenly it breaks into nonstop adrenaline-laced action with the battle of Minas Tirith, and heartbreaking suspense as Frodo and Sam travel the last agonizing stretch to Orodruin. And none of this would make any sense without the first two books' buildup.

Then again, don't be overwhelmed. The reason they are so great is because it is entirely up to you, the reader, to get out of them what you will.I read the novels for 1 thing: escape. I love to escape to my total familiarity with it (I've read it more or less every year since second grade); I love to escape to the awe inspiring storyteller (chronicler or historian is perhaps better) that Tolkien is, and thus the reality of this unreal world; and I love to escape to the honorable and strong characteristics espoused. Frodo is exceptional, surpassed only by Sam in terms of moral fibre. All of the &quot;good guys&quot; have incredible strength of character (a term so often batted around nowadays as a by-word for adhering to societal mores).The characters in these books are us, as we should be. It is not a utopia except in the sense that good triumphs, and the characters are good. They are human (or hobbit, elf, dwarf, even pony) and they simply act as a good human should act. This, more than anything else (yes, even the breadth of vision), make this one of my all time favorite works of art. It is a perfect way of teaching by example, and the example to me is a wonderful way to escape the things we want to forget.Read it.

And feel in the deepest recesses of our souls. I am a music freak. But it is a rara avis indeed that can touch me forever: that one album that I pick up to change my moods that can thoroughly permeate and lift my spirits. When it comes to books, the power and intensity of Tolkien's masterwerk is unique. Compared to the (sometimes talented) contemporary writers who unsuccessfully try to fill his shoes, Tolkien's sense of character and pacing is first rate. Throughout the book, there is such a feeling of longing. By the end, despite Frodo's success, the world has changed forever; the magical elves will be gone forever. Gandalf's role is complete. There are no winners and losers. In that war, men may have won the day, but at the price of losing most of the world's magical past. Every time I read Sam's last words &quot;Well, I'm back&quot; as he returns home to Rosie and their children after saying goodbye to his friends at the Grey Havens, a shiver goes down my spine. So ends a truly magical book that can be read on so many levels. For the superb story, for its parallels to historical events, or to analyze the complex characters.

There is so much determination, will, and love enveloped in these pages. Frodo has no hope left for his journey, but he tells Sam he will die trying. There is not one person in the world I can think of with that much courage and good inside themselves that will automattically do the right thing, even if their life is at stake. The love Sam shows Frodo, the malice Gollum has within himself, and the purity of the elven people makes me wish I was there in lothlorien with the fellowship. Tolkien created a whole new world for us to enjoy that is as vivid as the one we are in now. To have such a mind that is capable of having this vision, let alone being able to express it so passionately with words is beyond my comprehension. These characters are developed with care to perfection. Anyone who does not like this book needs to reevaluate their definition of a good book, because this is the perfect example.

If you're used to a junk food diet of contemporary easy-to-read thrillers, you'll find &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; tough going. This is no bag of high-cholesterol potato chips to be consumed in five minutes - this is a sack of solid food to be enjoyed over several evenings! Unlike the brief attractions offered by a 100-meter sprint, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; offers the scenic adventures of a 100-mile walk. Don't misunderstand this to mean that this journey is boring. Most 100-meter sprint type novels provide only momentary and fleeting pleasure, whereas the marathon journey of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; provides an enduring and challenging journey, with a multitude of memorable pleasures.Whose journey is it? At the face of it, it is a journey undertaken by the hobbit Frodo and his companions. Frodo possesses a most powerful ring, and the only way to prevent this ring from ever falling into the hands of the powers of evil is to destroy it - in the very heart of the kingdom of evil. &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; describes the epic journey of the ring-bearer Frodo and his companions as they journey into the heart of enemy territory to do battle with the powers of evil. If they successfully accomplish their quest, they will assure the conquest of evil by good.But it is not just Frodo who makes this marathon journey. Tolkien has an uncanny ability to ensnare the reader, so that you will find yourself not just a spectator, but a participant in the marathon mission undertaken by Frodo and friends. As you travel the journey with the ring-bearer Frodo and his company, they will become more than mere travelling companions. They will become your friends. You will feel you know them, and you will grow to love them - their joys will excite you, their sorrows will hurt you, their conquests will delight you, their failures will grief you. And it will pain you to say goodbye to them all at the end.Like the journey itself, however, participating in the journey by reading the trilogy can be tough going. At times the travelling through the words is slow and tough going. But at other times the pages fly by fast and furious with high paced action. And precisely this makes the epic journey through the treasured pages of Tolkien so rewarding. As a reader, you find yourself sharing in a very fantastic and yet very real journey, one which encompasses all of real life's emotions and experiences: sorrow as well as joy, inactivity as well as action, pain as well as pleasure. While reading, you partake in the emotions and experiences of fantasy characters - hobbits, dwarves, elves, and the like - because these emotions and experiences are distinctly recognizable - morally these characters are so much like ourselves, and we recognize aspects of ourselves in them.What's more, in the course of this long journey, you will be presented with breath-taking scenery. Tolkien has a remarkable ability to describe scenery with colour, character and clarity, so that you will visualize every tree, rock and road. By the time you are done, the setting of Middle-Earth will be as real as any place you've visited. As such, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is not just about a story and a journey, it is about a place. This place, you will discover, is immense and grand, because Tolkien has created cultures, histories, and languages. The vast scope of the journey and place in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; makes it a truly epic novel.In fact, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; has all the qualities of an epic - an immense scope, combined with a heroic and grand style. Tolkien constantly displays a mastery of the English language - the word usage at times gloriously grand, at times passionately poetic, at times wonderfully descriptive, but always amazing. Together, the vast scope and elevated style combine to create a truly epic masterpiece, so that the three volumes of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; read like three acts of tremendously immense play, with a global cast of characters, and a worldwide stage. And as you read, you are never quite sure whether this play is going to be a tragedy or triumph, as the powers of good seek to overcome the powers of evil.This struggle between good and evil that actually makes &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; a deeply religious book. Tolkien was a devout Catholic, and although he adamantly maintained that it was written for pure entertainment and had no deeper meaning, he could not avoid being influenced by his religious background, as is evidenced by his sharp view on morality, where good and evil are viewed as moral absolutes. The epic struggle between good and evil occurs on a wider scale than in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, and this gives the &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; a much more serious tone, arising out of deeply rooted religious convictions. Yet the struggle of good against evil never becomes a simplistic or shallow. As in real life, Tolkien's characters have weaknesses and flaws, and are affected by their experiences - some on the side of good even being corrupted by evil. And this makes the epic struggle for truth, freedom, justice and goodness all the more stimulating as your return to real life. One cannot be unaffected by the commitment and undying devotion towards the cause of good, the undying devotion, even when it requires unselfish sacrifices to be made in the process. In this sense, those who share Tolkien's underlying Christian values will especially enjoy the epic journey he has created.But there are more ways in which Tolkien's religious insights implicitly shine through. Biblical imagery is discernable throughout, especially the king's final victory and eternal reign of peace and joy, and banishment of evil is reminiscent of the victory of Christ over the dragon in Revelation. For readers of Scripture, the images of light and happiness, the tree of life, and an eternal kingdom, will be strikingly familiar and recognizable.But you do not have to be a Christian to enjoy &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot; There is nothing overtly religious about this trilogy, since the universe Tolkien creates and describes is a universe without God, where chance and fate are acknowledged as crucial players of the game, and where the conquest of evil is accomplished by the power of one's own will. This is probably exactly what we should expect from a Catholic writer.If you have never read &quot;The Lord of Rings&quot;, you should read it if only for the fact that it is widely acclaimed as the greatest fantasy classic, equaled by none. Few have read it and failed to be affected by. If you have not yet read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, a most distinct pleasure and experience awaits you. If you have already read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, you likely have already been touched by it, and yet the captivation of the reading experience is far from over. That's the beauty of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; - the epic scale of this book is so grand, that it begs to be read again and again. When you've read it once, you have the feeling that you have only just scratched the surface of something truly great. Like an amusement park with too many attractions to see in one day, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; leaves you in constant wonder, and when you are done, you pledge to return again soon. It is this enduring quality of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; that makes it a truly great read, a memorable and monumental marathon journey often to be repeated."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Just a little correction to some of the reviews that where published.

A review of the book itself, at this point, is totally superfluous. What could be said that hasn't already been said. If you have read this book, as many times as most of us have, you will know what I mean. If you haven't, this is your chance. TAKE IT! NOW!I would not agree that I would buy it \\"For any price\\".

Instead, I'm reviewing this particular edition (50th anniversary).First off, I feel obligated to correct a mistake of certain other reviewers. This edition IS bound in leather as advertised. The reviewer(s) were probably confused because the binding is very thin (very handsome) black leather, as opposed to the thick, bulky binding one usually thinks of. That established, this is the finest edition of this work I've ever seen published. The aforementioned binding is beautiful, with two-tone foil engraving, with a matching box. The paper is edged in real gold, and it comes with two very large fold-out maps, as well as an attached silk ribbon bookmark and a three page color insert. The book is handsomely printed in red and black.Most important to me, the publishers, along with Tolkien's son Christopher, have gone through the text exhaustively correcting all the errors that have crept into the work via it's many reprintings. There are also two new forwards.In summation, if you've been a fan for years, and want a book that can take pride of place on your bookshelf, this is the edition for you. If you are looking for an edition to give to your kid or some such, buy the paperback."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Must have for LOTR fans. Quality craftsmanship.

All fantasies now refer to these beings as if they were commonplace in that far away land. In a sense, all fantasies since this masterpiece have been set in Middle Earth.In my mind, there are now only two wizards of consequence in the world: Merlin and Gandalf.I first discovered &quot;The Lord Of The Rings&quot; when I was 13, already lost in the world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

The packaging is a joke compared to the Harry Potter series.Overall value 2 stars, this is a spendy set and I was expecting more.The reviews here are mixed up and as a regular Amazon customer I found this shopping experience one of my worst.

I have an older edition so I will comment mostly on the book itself and not on the edition.The Lord of the Rings is arguably the greatest fantsay work ever created. It may be that later works by other authors are larger or more complex but Tolkein had created the mold and it remained unbroken for more than sixty years.An adventure that starts quite simply, LOTR quickly becomes a great story with the most interesting thing that most people can find in a book - Characters that start simply and evolve to become the main turning stones of great events.Everything good in fantasy exists in LOTR - frightening monsters, cruel enemies, dark lore and great magic, fearless heroes and low schemers, noble armies and grubby monstrous enemies. Most importantly, heroic deeds.There is one catch, however. The trip to Mordor. I know it is a very important part of the book but when Frodo and Sam trudge across the barren lands towards and in Morder - this is a part I always found boring and repetitve. Nothing happens there! (Except Shelob, of course).So, except for those 100 pages or so, you still get more than 1000 pages of great fantasy.This is a must read for fantasy fans everywhere."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This edition is one of the best I've read.

It's simple but nice. Quality is reasonable. iDelivery time was so fast!!! Very recommendable. Thanks for all"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This was my second attempt to buy a decent unabridged recording of LotRs, and this time, using Amazon, was a complete success. I had tried Ebay previously and had wound up opening the box and discovering I'd actually bought the series on cassette tapes. I had no idea cassette tapes were even offered on the market anymore, so I obviously missed an important little detail in the product description, which was my fault. Two of the tapes then self-destructed the first time through. You can't listen to the whole Lord of the Rings trilogy within a seller's seven day grace period (and lead a normal life), so I was stuck with an expensive defective product. And the manufacturer, Recorded Books, I then learned, would not replace individual tapes purchased from a third party. I tried afterward to purchase a replacement set directly through Recorded Books Inc., but their brand new website in conjunction with another company would not let me navigate to a page for purchasing a copy at that time. I tried Amazon after that because my previous unrelated purchases had all gone extremely smoothly. This purchase also was. I have finally completed listening to all of the cd's of LotRs bought through Amazon, and am as happy with the purchase as I am cautious with taking special care of each of the cd's from the series.As for the product itself - this is by far the best audio version of The Lord of the Rings. I own an abridged production commonly available, by the way, and unless you are about 6 years old, you probably won't enjoy the cringe-worthy over-dramatization. And if you are fond of the book, you won't like the editing decisions in an abridged version either.The best readers and productions, I think, do not intrude on and overwhelm a story; they let the story seem to speak through them. Rob Engles does that in this production of LotRs and in his The Hobbit, which you should also buy - actually, personally, I think his The Hobbit is even better than his Lord of the Rings. Just be sure to buy the cd's and not casstte tapes, buy from a reputable seller on Amazon or directly from Recorded Books, and take especially good care of all of the cd's once you get them."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Lord of the Rings is simply the greatest work in the English language written by someone not named Shakespeare."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"What can i say about the book? it is awesome and remains awesome, i love the quality. i do have an issue with amazon distribution.

The 2002 edition.When this arrived, the box was HEAVY. It really does weigh 10 pounds like the description says it should.The box set is beautifully made and the books fit well in the box. The books themselves are built like school textbooks; they'll survive a beating. With proper care though, they should last forever.People have complained about glossy pages and large print. I found neither of these to be true. The pages aren't matte, but they're not glossy like a photo. Think about the paper in a print magazine in terms of page gloss, but with heavier weight paper like you'd expect from a hardcover book. The print is also not bigger than normal, but its big enough to make reading require less eye strain to focus.In reference to the title of my review, several people complained about the \\"lack of art\\" in the book. If you're in the market to buy a book of artwork by Alan Lee, buy an actually art book, not a hardcover novel. You can't buy a compact car and complain about the lack of legroom, so to speak.

But I think it's better the way it is, and it's also a reflection of writing style from 50 years ago, to some degree.

One that will never become outdated or will ever be surpassed."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Lord of the rings is,without a doubt,one of the finest jewels in modern literature of all kinds and streams;Tolkien's fine descriptive and innovative storytelling style gives the fantasy stream a seldom seen in the medieval retro-futuristic style of fantasy literature in wich the lord of the rings evolves. One thing that sets this book up on top of every other fantasy book is the approach that Tolkien takes(or gives)to the Europeian mithology subject carefully and masterfully handled in every page and dialog of the books. Clearly explified is the matter of or suggestion of thuder and lighting...It's a thunder because it's sounds and phonetics are so darn strong that deaf ears to &quot;other&quot; given names before Tolkien, and the lighting is clearly noticed and seen in the sometimes fast and sometimes slow,but shiny, poetry and descriptive action paced narrative beautifully shown troughout the story.

It is a wonderful adventure story, full of heroism, fear, romance, hope, sadness and so many other elements. When you consider that Tolkien not only told a wonderful tale, but invented the entire histories of several races of creatures complete with languages, and created an entire universe, the impact of this work is heightened."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"What can I say about LOTR that hasn't already been said? The words of praise would sound like most of the other reviews here, though a bit less gushy, perhaps. ;-) Though the book does drag in places, and Tolkien's dialogue is a bit awkward at times, the tale of Frodo and Sam made this book memorable the first time I read it at age 11 -- many years ago -- and was what compelled me to keep reading.That being said, let me address what I consider a weakness (gasp!) in Tolkien's work: his view of &quot;Elvishness&quot; as superior to this flawed and &quot;fallen&quot; world. It is this worldview, I have concluded, which underlies the way he chose to end the book.No, I won't give it away! Suffice to say that I did NOT like the ending the first time I read it, and numerous rereadings and indepth analysis from an adult, philosophical perspective have only reinforced my disagreement with Frodo's choice at the end of the book.I have been told by other Tolkien fans that this was a wonderful and blessed and beautiful ending, far better than if Frodo had not chosen what he did. Bullroar. This world, for all its flaws, is holy, not &quot;fallen,&quot; and I firmly believe that we don't need to seek Elvish perfection &quot;somewhere else&quot; to find blessedness, even when we are deeply wounded (which includes most of the human race at some point in our lifetimes). So ultimately, my criticism of Tolkien is a fundamental ideological disagreement.None of this should be taken to detract from the fact that Tolkien wrote a compelling and moving story. My advice, though, is to read it and THINK about what you are reading, not just mindlessly imbibe it as Unquestionable Wisdom.Come to think of it, that's good advice for anything you read -- including this Humble Review."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Tolkien's tale of a brave hobbit and the battle for a world oppressed is not just a simple story.

It combines beautifully descripted landscapes describing like only Tolkien could, the forces of nature and how they interact to show us its power. But this book is not only about nature, it's a story of life, with an overwelming argument that would keep the reader (at least it kept me) in a &quot;strange&quot; mood towards life itself. Simply is one of the books that leaves something to the reader. I would say that i have not stopped thinking about it since i read it. So, if you have time for an extraordinary story of charming, rage, romance, war, friendship and loyalty; this is your book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Read the Lord of the Rings and it will change your life. This is still the best fantasy book ever written. Please read it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"If you are old, and maybe dying, I have just one thing to say to you: YOU CAN'T DIE BEFORE YOU HAVE READ THIS BOOK! HURRY!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"By now everyone realizes that Lord of the Rings is one of the most fantastic stories ever told. I originally wanted to rush through the book to the end only to find that I was very sad that it was all over in \\"just\\" 1008 pages.This particular edition/printing hardback is great. The pages are completely white with a high quality feel to them, whereas the paperback version of this book was quick to have the binding crease and the paper was more of a dingy look to it that is common in many cheaper books. I feel that if you get Lord of the Rings, you're going to be handling it a lot to get through 1000 pages of it, which will make the other paperback editions look quite terrible after you've finished reading it.That is not the case with this edition since it is well bounded and the pages are easy on the eyes.Finally, I rarely see people mention it, but I don't think Tolkein is not for the younger readers simply due to the vocabulary. Be prepared to buy a nice dictionary with this book. Anyone that claims to have read this book without using the dictionary a few times hasn't read this book.Great book. Great binding. Great bargin. Great edition with excellent appendix to explain certain elements of the book...."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is the best book ever made. This is the actual adventure of the fellowsip of the ring in which they set out om a perilous quest to destroy the Ring of power which belongs to sauron the dark lord. Tolkiens words are so amazing that they make you feel like you are actually in middlearth trapped in a cave with monsters, or on top of Mt. Doom fighting for the ring of power and for the world!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Tolkien's gifts are inspirational for artists. His poems are unique. Perhaps the only comparison is Defenders of the Holy Grail, which has many songs during the Crusader march. This book is lavish. The danger is you let someone else's image become your own."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I'm a 20 yr old college student and am very picky about what I read. That said, this book has everything you would want in a fantasy book. This was the first ever fantasy genre book I've read and the only other types of fantasy I knew about were King Arther, Merlin etc. I decided to pick it up right after I saw the first &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot; movie and have not been disappointed. At first I hesitated to even buy it fearing that it would ruin the rest of the 2 movies for me removing any surprise. I was glad I did read it though since the movie leaves out a lot of details. Go pick it up and don't be intimidated by the number of pages. Also, the first chapter or two are a bit slow and but don't quit, you'll be rewarded afterwards."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"J.R.R. Tolkein was not the best writer, and yet his words captivated the soul, he did run on in his sentences, but be honest, does anyone notice it unless they are trying to play the devils advocate. Honestly this is one of my favorite books, although the very first edition of the book from back in the 70's is a bit hard to understand, it is still a great book. It has action, and will keep you enthrilled untill the very end, this edition of The Lord of The Rings sells for 75 dollars at retail, so finding it at 52 dollars is a real releif for me. I may seem like a person trying to be a fanatik, but to tell you the truth, even though in the begining of this book it is hard for you to stay awake, but in the end it starts to captivate your mind and ensnare you into the story, making it a wonderful book to read, I would recommmend this book to any person, be the person 10, or 80, you are never too old to read a book, and if you have a good vocabulary, never too young, but even against its bad features, this book lives up to its legends, that is why so many people love this book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Remember reading books as a child? Some books had that magical, innocent quality. Well, Tolkien somehow captured that spirit in a book written for adults. As the book progresses, you realize that Tolkien understands the universal powers of Truth and Beauty."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"There is something about this story that makes me think of it as the best story I ever read. I like the immensity of it. It is nothing short of a Biblical struggle between good and evil. And yet it isn't just a \\"shoot-em-up\\" because the heroes have chosen to destroy power, not to wield it.The title character, the Lord of the Rings, is a hideous creature named Sauron who is the most powerful living thing in \\"Middle Earth\\". He has concentrated much of his power into a magic ring, which has been lost many centuries, but the ring has finally been found by a small \\"hobbit\\". If Sauron recovers it, his awesome power will be multiplied and he will be unstoppable. He will rule the world in Hitler fashion.The heroes of the free world are the wizard Gandalf, mankind's most valiant Aragorn, powerful and magical elf leaders Elrond and Galadriel, and little hobbit Frodo Baggins who holds the One Ring of power.The writer's style is often Biblical, but sometimes it is geared to a young readership, playful. Pippin Took and Tom Bombadil are characters that seem drawn to appeal to children.To me, every character is a gift to be treasured."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I love all the books that J.R.R. Tolkien but this has always been my favorite he has always wrote adventurous and different stories from any other fantisy tale.A wonderful read! You won't be able to put it down until you are finished."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Lord of the rings is an interesting and exciting classic. It's about a ring that was handed to this one guy, Frodo Baggins. The ring has appeared again. The ring with dark powers. Now, dark forces are trying to find the ring, and where ever the ring is, the dark forces can sence it. Frodo Baggins, leading his group of friends are trying to save the world by destroying the ring. But the only way to destroy the ring would be to cast it into the Cracks of Doom. Will they succeed?Will they be able to even get through the middle earth... alive?The Lord of the rings is a sequal to the Hobbit, so i would suggests all LOR(Lord of the Rings)readers to read the Hobbit before starting this book.It would also be helpful to make a chart of the characters since it's a long book with many characters in it.The Lord of the Rings is definately a wonderful book. It's the only book that is able to be compared with Harry Potter books, just that they are two major different kind of books. LOR is more for all ages.A word for people who haven't read the book:U're just missing out!!!Better start soon!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is the most beautiful edition of this work. Tolkien has always been my favorite author since I first read his works as a teenager. The intense dedication to create a complete world, with history and even languages amazes me each time I read it. And I've read it several times. This will be the second copy of the Collector's Edition I have purchased. It's the perfect gift for a Tolkien fan, new or old. It's terribly lovely and I simply adore it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I am in the midst of listening to this presentation for the second time and I am loving it even more than the first. It is a wonderful way to escape during the morning commute.Rob Inglis gives an extraordinary performance - acting all characters in distinctly different voices; his singing voice is quite pleasant, and his mastery on the languages (including elvish) is remarkable. I feel, while listening to him speak, as though I am listening to actors in a movie. The tone and energy is appropriate for every scene; the narration draws you in as though you were on the journey with all of the Company.For those that would otherwise never have the time to sit and read the entire trilogy, I highly recommend this addition. Think of it as a bedtime story for adults."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"If you are a fan of Tolkein's timeless story of integrity, determination and humility, GET THIS BOOK. The Alan Lee illustrations are easily the best I've ever seen. That is to say, of all the Middle Earth illustrations I've seen, these most closely match both Tolkein's word pictures and my own imagination. Tolkein's writing will forever stand as one of the great benchmarks of economy, color, story line and craft. Alan Lee's illustrations are the perfect compliment."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"It always distresses me to see LOTR describe as one of a genre, even the best of, or the progenitor of a genre. It isn't true. The appetite for similar works that Tolkien inspires always results in disappointment. Nothing comes close, and the reason is simple: unparalleled depth. The multiple decades that went into the invention of his world, its languages and mythology will never be matched. This is a story plucked from that world, and not a cheap backdrop invented to satisfy the genre. The depth is so real, it is felt on every page, and for all the other works, there is simply no 'there' there."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"How can you go wrong? This is the Lord of the Epics. A classic tale of Good versus Evil. The Lord of the Rings is THE essential Fantasy lovers read. A Classic!

A Timeless Classic encased in it's original splendid glory!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Well, where did you think I got my nick? As a lover of the great fantasy novels (the Alice books, Lewis' Narnia chronicles, et al), I come always, inevitably, back to The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Silmarillion -- the triptych of fantasy, without which none of what followed would be possible. (Simply look at Terry Brooks' Sword of Shannara to see what I mean. It parallels Tolkien in so many ways, it would be plagiarism if it wasn't so obviously a homage.) In thinking about the Rings saga while working on this review, I find so many things that delight and enlighten -- Tolkien's wonderful, memorable characters, his inventive Elven and Dwarvish languages, not to mention his even more inventive use of the English lamguage, his impeccably mythic story...I could go on, and I think I will! Continuing in the mythic vein for a moment, think about such creatures as the deadly, horrific barrow-wights, unseen in the story save for one clutching arm; Tom Bombadil, full of jollity and song, yet somehow wistful and a little sad at the same time; the hrm-ing, hooming, completely delightful Ents, pining for their lost wives -- that is what I mean by impeccably mythic. They all sound like stories you heard a hundred times when you were a child, as familiar as King Arthur, as spooky as Jack running from the Giant, as full of life and light, and sadness and darkness, as every adventure Dorothy ever had in Oz. Somehow, Tolkien tapped directly into what critic Burt Hatlen called the &quot;myth-pool&quot; with the Rings saga; his words and wonders are as intimate to us, in the archetypal sense, as our own blood and nerves. As an example, look at two key moments in The Fellowship of the Ring, where Frodo is rendered unconscious, first at the lair of the barrow-wights, then again at the high hill where his company is accosted by the ring-wraiths. In both instances, Frodo is nearly slain, and falls forward, his sword broken beneath him, calling to mind Arthur, fallen in his final battle, Achilles at Troy, or even a Biblical martyr, though that may be stretching a point. When we learn later that the Elven-king who cut the Ring-hand from Sauron's arm also fell slain with his sword broken beneath him, we know that not only is Tolkien paying close attention to detail, he understands full well that certain myths have a habit of running in cycles, and what happened to one Ring-Bearer will almost certainly happen to the next one. This is but one example of Tolkien's amazing work, which has such breadth and scope that I cannot fully convey its perfection in this short space, much as I would like to try. I will only say that if you have not read Lord of the Rings, you must; if you have read it but did not enjoy it, then there is no sense of wonder in your heart -- and may Shelob and Gollum cast you into the Cracks of Doom. (Yeah, I know it sounds silly, but it was better than the Marsh of the Dead!) And, as a simple matter of curiosity, is there anyone out there anticipating the new movie version as much as I? (At least we know it can't be worse than Ralph Bakshi's!) Remain in Light -- Phrodoe."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Alan Lee's illustrations put down on paper the images of The Lord of the Rings I had made in my head. A shadowy world in the twilight of the 3rd Age; glory and terror brimming around the edges; moonlight, shadow, mist; everything. He did justice to Aragorn, making him a manly wanderer, but not brawny; to Gandalf, not a comic-book wizard; to Legolas and the elves, manlike but not men; to Galadriel--gorgeous and young, but also ancient and wise, not buxom and commen. Gollum, Fangorn, Tinuviel, Rivendell, I could go on forever. Knowing how horrible it can be to see the real people from the book disgraced by unsympathetic illustrations, this book was wonderful to find! About the Centennial edition of The Lord of the Rings, the one illustrated by Lee: it's a very nice book, nicely bound, has a red ribbon marker, gold embossed title (with tengwar) on cover. I would reccommend putting the dust jacket into one of those plastic covers to keep it nice and keep the golden edging from rubbing off. I only wish it was in three volumes and not one, because I hate to put all that stress on the binding. I have a cheep paperback set to read, I just treasure my Lee one!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"An amazing piece of literature. Like nothing I have ever read. Tolkien is a true original, and everyone else is a horribly fake imitator.

Tolkien spins is unparalleled in English literature. A truly amazing set of books!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Lord of the Rings is a novel that should not be described to someone, instead it should be read by everyone. Never before has a novel like this gripped me with surging power. It doesn't feel like a fantasy, the characters feel real and three dimensional. The amount of detail in the paragraghs are amazing. Tolkien was very creative in presenting the novel with a complete history of Middle-Earth, especially of the Third Age described in the Appendices. I would tell Tolkien and fantasy skeptics to just go and read it, and have their bias washed away. The novel has everything that makes for great storytelling. DON'T WAIT FOR THE MOVIES! Three movies aren't going to cover the detail and the history that sixty-two chapters and five appendices present. Of course, anyone who has read LOTR will want to see the movies, me included, to see Middle-Earth come to life. However, the result could be in disapointment, be it because the story may get mangled, or the visuals aren't up to par with a person's imagination. I hope Peter Jackson succeeds in a noble effort. I urge everyone to read this classic, fantasy fan or not. Hell, book fan or not! However, to get the full grasp on LOTR, please read the Hobbit before you read this one. The Hobbit gives excellent background, and though shorter and lighter in tone, it is an excellent book. It's what motivated me to read LOTR."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"5 stars or more to the Lord of the Rings, which I read many, many times.1 star or less to this edition (paperback with faded tower of Gondor on the cover ISBN 0395974682). It broke at second read, inspite of the fact that I treated it very, very gently.I read this specific volume once and it held up fine.

You can read it as a late evening's pastime and you can study it as seriously as an university subject, but it won't leave you uninterested. I really admire Tolkien's imagination as in this book he has created a whole world with its own people, languages and history, a world that is in the way ours should be and probably has been a long, long time ago.

A really, really special one."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"THIS BOOK IS THE ABSOLOUT BEST BOOK EVER. I swear if you read it you will suddenly fall in love with it.

Now, at the age of 28, I've finished reading it for the first time. I consider myself a serious reader, and the first conclusion I draw from now having read the book is that my experience as a reader of literature has been far enriched for it. The book is a masterpiece on so many levels; as a fantasy story with an insanely detailed inner world, as a story of a quest that ends up being a journey of self-examination for its characters, as a story of the fight between good and evil. And on a personal level, waiting so long to have read the book allows me better to see how far-reaching Tolkien's influence is on the likes of George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and others who have made fantasy and sci-fi something of their mien. Read this book by all means, but if you are not yet acquainted with Tolkien, make sure to read The Hobbit beforehand, as events in that book set up the storyline for Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Tolkien made a book that surpassed any other fantasy book of its time. Today, it still holds true. LOTR is a masterpiece, with vivid descriptions of every event, place, person, Elve, Ent, Dwarve, Orc, Hobbit, Wizard, and Nazgul. I feel that anyone that has given this book a bad review, based on the storyline, has not fully understood, nor is able to appriciate the vast amounts of effort, time and imagination put into this book. Many people have admitted to getting ideas from LOTR, in jobs such as directing, writing books, plays, movies, and many other things besides. The shear volume and immensity of LOTR is enough to keep any reader busy for awhile. LOTR has plently of action, suspense, romance, and humor to enlighten even the most imaginative. LOTR was not named Best Book of the Century by drawing names out of a hat! To be able to devise this kind of book takes lots of talent. I absolutely enjoy the bits of poetry put in. Now, the different types of sentient species included is stunning! It combines, men, wizards, elves, dwarves, and hobbits together on a Quest.Not your everyday Fantasy is it? There are plently of other beings as well, that play an important, but not a major part in LOTR. Not everyone will agree with me, but I feel that it was necessary to submit a review such as this one, to prove that Tolkien is the master and deserves full credit for this nearly perfect novel!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I want to say that I am new to the Tolkien genre but will forever be a true fan. His wonderful creation of Middle Earth was masterfully done and carefully planned. The Millennium Edition of his classic trilogy brings the books back to there true form as a six book set that tells the final chapter of Middle Earth. Tolkien's use of a Ring that has the power to either save or destroy the world is excellent. The book is very well written and if you haven't ever read the Hobbit or any other book in the seris LoTR is still readable. I love the way that he uses such wonderful detail in the description of his Middle Earth and draws the books conclusion to a fufilling close. This is the closest a book has ever come to perfection. Trust me any true fantsy fan cannot be complete without reading the wonderful history of Middle Earth and meeting Bilbo, Frodo and the One Ring."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Tolkien is not only a great fantasy writer -if not the best-; he might as well have invented the genre.

The villains we meet are interesting enough, particularly the ringwraiths and the traitorous wizard Saruman.Secondly, you need some wonderful people to root for. This book has some great heroes you'll remember all your life. Wizards, elves, dwarves, hobbits, and men. Don't leave the women out either.What greater scope can you have than the rescue of the world from evil? With all of these ingredients, you can't miss.

If you want an audio version, the BBC Radio one is fantastic, the best translation of Tolkein to another medium (including the stellar Peter Jackson movies). Get it instead; avoid this one like the plague."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I'm writing this for people who haven't read J.R.R. Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings' yet but are wanting too - most likely because they've seen the dumbed-down, royally-screwed/altered movie versions (although they are very visually and musically appealing) unleashed upon us by Peter Jackson.(or you're at your local Barns & Noble and see a display of Lord of the Rings books being advertised in anticipation of Jackson's upcoming 'The Hobbit' movies)Of course if any other Tolkien fans want to add their own two-cent tips please put them in the comments (people seem almost afraid to review the actual books - they seem to only review the manner in which the books are presented; that alone should tell you something).Reading Tips for Beginners: (this is a Journey after all)1:) Do NOT try to put this book into any genre-classification; this (in my opinion) sets one up for false expectations. Yes, this is a 'Fantasy' story, but it is also so much more: it is also a Historical novel, a Romance, an Epic, a Tragedy, a fireside tale told in a manner that suggests this all really happened a long time ago in the forgotten ages of our own world. Again, avoid classifying. These books have everything and more.2:) Do NOT skim-read. This is not a pulp-novel; or a Twinkle in book form. This is a literary six-course feast complete with before-meal speeches and music and dancing at the end. If you skim-read you will miss things, many beautiful things; many important things. I myself have made this mistake; I was in a hurry, I wanted my action-scenes and battles given NOW; I was impatient. I regret it deeply. I suggest buying and reading each book (The Fellowship of the Ring; The Two Towers, The Return of the King) on their own to help avoid this temptation. Do not rush. If you are planning to skim-read the books just so you can say you 'read' them don't even bother reading the rest of these tips.3:) Pretend that you NEVER saw any of Peter Jackson's movies. This will be very hard, I know, it was so for me. It took multiple readings of the books and multiple viewings of the (extended) films - which I also own - before slowly realizing just how much damage had been done. Jackson played some serious God with Tolkien's works, both obvious and subtle. Put the movies out of your mind; pretend you're entering Middle-Earth for the first time and try to imagine the world and its people in your own unique way, otherwise you'll set yourself up again for false expectations. Again, do not rush.4:) Do NOT let Tolkien's style of writing freak you out. Middle-Earth is Tolkien's own fully-imagined world so he takes great pains to describe the beauty of said world and the culture, language, histories and names of the many different peoples who inhabit it. There are stories within stories. There are songs and poetry. There is a storehouse of vast history and lore that is remembered and spoken of by the characters of the present. There is a deep sense of sorrow and yearning nostalgia.This is not a tale for shallow or superficial people or people in a hurry. You will either love this story or you will think it was a complete waste of time.5:) Pretend that you are encountering Fantasy (and all the trappings that come with it: Elves, dwarves, Wizards, goblins, secret kings; enchanted objects, mysterious realms, evil tyrants, swords with cool names, mighty cities, horrid monsters, last stands, epic questing and fighting and celebrating) all for the very first time. This book is, after all, what almost all other high fantasy comes from; what other fantasy stories try to aspire to. 'The Lord of the Rings' actually ruined most other similar fantasy stories for me. All other Wizards (except maybe Dumbledor)and Elves and Dwarves seem just like pale copies of Tolkien's. Whenever I encounter the word 'wizard' I envision Gandalf; when I read 'dwarf' I remember Gimli and Thorin and the others; when I hear of Elves I'm reminded of the mighty Elrond and Galadriel and Legolas. When I read of warrior-kings it is Aragorn and Theoden (and their ancestors) that I compare them to. For me there are no others. I don't need any others.Tolkien has given us all these things and only in Middle-Earth will they remain in all their wisdom and beauty and glory, forever enshrined in our hearts and imaginations, were none (save Peter Jackson in those botched movies that I used to admire so much) will ever spoil or mare them.Here is a good final reason to at least try to explore the Middle-Earth Tolkien created. These are not my words and sadly I couldn't find the person's name, but they are SO true:\\"Middle-Earth is not an Imaginary World.J.R.R. Tolkien not only kindly shared with the whole humanity the extraordinary world created by his mind. He brought to everyone who believed in his words, a shelter, whose walls can't be trepassed by any evil. A shelter where love and friendship mean more than just false promises based on biased words. It's a light to you in dark places, when all other lights go out. He shall live forever inside each page that brings Arda to life.You laugh, you cry, you fear, but most of all you believe. You believe in the only thing that saved you, in the only thing that made you feel real. Even if it was for a glance of time. Til your heart stops beating, the story will keep beating with you. And will keep beating for you.\\""},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I read this huge work because it has been touted as a classic of fantasy literature. I will grant that it is one of the most imaginative things I have ever read, but there each of this work's strengths is almost counterbalanced by a glaring weakness. Yes, Tolkien can write a battle scene with the best of them, and has a real knack for describing horror and terror, but the man can't write dialogue to save his life. Most of the conversation sounds like it came out of a Prince Valiant comic strip.There is a lot of these books that a really good editor would have cut. Do we really need pages and pages of discussion of plants, flowers, trees, shrubs, nuts, thorns, thistles, and every other kind of green and growing thing. This is supposed to be an epic adventure novel, not a horticultural travelogue. Then there's the pages of poetry in his invented languages. A line or two here and there would be all right, but pages of this stuff? I don't speak Elvish, do you? Speaking of poetry, the poetry that the author writes in English is not such hot stuff either.There are whole chapters that contribute nothing to the plot. What is the deal with Tom Bombadil? The entire section of the book with him in it looks like an intruder from another novel--the tone is different and it doesn't relate to anything else in the book. No wonder Peter Jackson never even seriously considered putting that part in the movie. The Hobbits could have gone straight from Crickhollow to Bree and we would not have missed a thing.Tolkien's love stories don't do much for me, either. They are minor plot elements, but neither the tale of Aragorn and Arwen, nor that of Faramir and Eowyn goes beyond some sort of cardboard cutout of what love and romance are supposed to be.On the other hand, there is lots of true brilliance in this work as well. The Shire is a wonderful creation that appears to come straight from Tolkien's heart. His descriptions of places of glory, such as Minas Tirith, and places of horror, such as Shelob's tunnel, are exceptional. His battle scenes are nothing short of glorious.So, in conclusion, I suppose my overall impression is that this is an overlong, occasionally brilliant, but seriously flawed work. I am glad I read it, but I don't see myself picking it up again any time soon."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is a review of the novel, not this particular edition. Before the LOTR fans eat me alive, Orc style, let me say that I'm not an expert on Tolkien or LOTR, and only read the epic once, in a non-approved Swedish translation. Still, I offer my comments, for all they may be worth.Here in Sweden, almost everyone reads LOTR. And I really mean, everyone! I met assembly-line workers and dispatch riders who read LOTR. Already in elementary school, all kids read LOTR, and one of our teachers read it aloud during class. It took at least two semesters. Every year in February, Swedish bookstores have a traditional clearence sale. LOTR always sold out the very first day. Imagine growing up in a nation where reading \\"Lord of the Rings\\" is considered conventional, almost common knowledge!As a kind of protest against all this, I decided already as a kid *not* to read LOTR, and I never did, until after I saw Peter Jackson's first movie, and by then I was obviously an adult. I can't say the novel thrilled me. The first part, \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" smacks of being written for children, and I found it quite silly. By contrast, \\"The Two Towers\\" and \\"The Return of the King\\" are more for adults. Here, Tolkien presumably wanted to write a quasi-historical epic, and inadvertently founded an entirely new literary genre, fantasy. I didn't really like the two concluding books either, however. To me, \\"The Two Towers\\" and \\"The Return of the King\\" are essentially the same story, repeated twice. First, the dark lord Sauron attacks Rohan, and somewhat later he attacks Gondor. The Ents were just plain silly, a kind of throwback to the childishness of \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\".I readily admit that these impressions of mine are purely subjective. Perhaps I'm just not a fantasy guy. Incidentally, I think Peter Jackson experienced the same problems as I did with the contradiction between children's story and adult epic. He seems to have solved it by turning his movie version of the \\"Fellowship\\" into a dark monster movie (adieu, Tom Bombadil).Why is LOTR so popular, then? Perhaps one of the reasons is that the story can be read on many different levels. The similarities with Norse and Anglo-Saxon mythology (Beowulf) are obvious. Indeed, Tolkien apparently wanted to create a new mythology for our age, and what better place to start than simply re-write the old one? The popularity of LOTR here in Sweden can at least in part be explained by this Norse angle of the work, which the un-authorized Swedish translation apparently strengthened even further.On another level, LOTR is a political allegory of World War Two and the Cold War, although Tolkien himself denied this. Still, the similarities are pretty obvious: Saruman is Hitler, Sauron is Stalin, the Shire is England. The main part of the story could be read as a Third World War allegory, with the Soviet Union (Mordor) in alliance with the Third World (the pirates from the south) attacking the free nations of the West. While this may appeal to people with bad experiences of Communism, it unfortunately leads to racism at times. The crooks are often black-skinned, have almond eyes and wield scimitars, while many of the heroes are white and fair. Still, it seems few people interpret the story as racist, thank Iluvatar, and many actually see it as anti-racist, since the Fellowship of the Ring consists of both humans, elves, dwarfs and hobbits.Yet another reason for LOTR's popularity is that the work can be read as environmentalist. A romantic love of nature and hatred for modern industrialized society is a recurring theme in the novel. For some reason, Saruman seems to be the chief culprit in this regard, both in Isengard and later in the Shire. Indeed, it was a great pity that Peter Jackson left out the scourging of the Shire from his movie version of \\"The Return of the King\\", since this is obviously an important part of the story.Here in Sweden, most people have only read LOTR in ke Ohlmark's translation from 1959-61. Tolkien himself hated this translation, and never authorized it. This lead to a later fall-out between Ohlmarks and Tolkien's son Christopher, who prohibited Ohlmarks from translating \\"The Silmarillion\\". Ohlmarks denounced Christopher as a \\"sociopath\\" and the Silmarillion as \\"crap\\" at a fantasy convention, which didn't exactly endear him to the Tolkien fans. Later, Ohlmarks claimed to have been attacked by a dark-side faction of the Tolkien Society, and wrote a scurrilous book accusing fantasy fans of being Satanists, going so far as to state that he regretted ever having translated LOTR. He even claimed that the real author of LOTR wasn't Tolkien, but C.S. Lewis (!). This entire episode was something of a tragedy, since Ohlmarks, despite being a very well-educated man, was a fantasy freak himself. I believe he was over 70 years old when he agreed to play \\"Bombur the Fat Dwarf\\" at a fantasy party organized by the Tolkien Society in Sweden!It's ironic that generations of Swedes have grown up reading a version of LOTR Tolkien himself discarded. Indeed, the only Swedes who don't read Ohlmark's translation are presumably the members of the Swedish Tolkien Society, who prefer the English original. Yet, it might have been Ohlmark's idiosyncratic translation that made LOTR so popular in Sweden, since he consciously attempted to make the names of places and persons in the epic as \\"Swedish\\" as possible.I have no idea how to rate this work, so I give it three stars out of five. One thing is certain: badly translated or not, LOTR will sure find new readers and new converts in many generations still to come."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Have you ever had to save the world from total inhalations? Probably not, but the boy or hobbit in the Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship By J.R.R Tolken does. Frodo ho, the protagonist, is a very unique boy. He is very young and small and is the bravest hobbit to ever live in hobbiton. He is also very brave and he has no idea about what he is about to get into. It all starts when Frodo and his friends set off to Mordor. They met in Elrim and from there they set off to Mordor. The nine companions are Frodo, Sam, Merriy, Pipin, Gandalf, Aragorn, Legilos, Gimily, and Borimer. They are going through many obstacles. Most of their obstacles are Orcs and Uhr~ihy. But they strive through.My favorite part in this book is when they go through the grimy, smelly, and ruined mines of Morea. Gimily thinks that they are going to his family. When they had made it there his family is slaughtered. They went on but right before they are out they are ambushed by Orcs. Then they run through and out of darkness comes the Belrog. Gandalf, with his mighty staff, fends off the Belrog and makes the creature fall into a shadow. Then right before the Belrog falls he grabs Gandalf and drags him down.So if you want to read this book by J.R.R Tolken you can find it in a library. I promise when you read the first four pages of this book you won't be able to put it down. When you read this book it is ten times better than the movie with all the details like thegood description of the Belrog. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"My husband and I took this audio version (Amazon calls it the Minds Eye, but the publisher is Soundelux) of LOTR with us on a long road trip and had to stop listening to it before long, because it was so annoying. I love the books and the movies, but do yourself a favor and buy a different version. Frodo and Bilbo voices sound reasonable, but most of the other characters have weird voices. For example Sam sounds like a little boy (although, maybe his part is read by a woman?), Strider has the voice of an old time radio hero (you know that \\"hear I come to to save the day type voice\\"). Actually, the whole thing sounds like an old radio version, which wouldn't have been bad, if it was done better. Plus the actors aren't really that good, so the mood isn't conveyed properly."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I can't see what all these complaints about the &quot;Red Leatherette Edition&quot; are about. I have maybe found a dozen letters in the entire 400 plus pages that weren't printed entirely. The margins are parallel with the edge of the pages. There aren't any spots smattered on the pages with the exception of the blank page opposite the Foreword. All in all this is a very nice printing. Maybe the others that have complained just got &quot;lemons&quot;. It happens in every manufacturing process. I agree that they should have been pulled in quality control before they were shipped, but a total damnation of the volume is not called for. I personally would have liked larger letters and larger pages that one can lay the book open and it stay that way. The book isn't perfect, but is still quite nice. I feel that it is, all in all, a good buy and a very pleasureable book. I also recommend the Hobbit (collector's edition) which I also purchased. As for the grammatical &quot;errors&quot;, I have read that Tolkien meant to make those &quot;mistakes&quot; and that they were erroneously &quot;corrected&quot; in the first printings of his work. But whatever printing you choose, you will no doubt enjoy Tolkien's genius.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The majority of work in creating the movie must have been deciding what to discard. They also had to distort much to fit it to their deletions. Reading the book and getting the full experience of it requires complex visualization and spacial organization. Doing this while reading is a tedious task and makes the book a weary tale. Also, without the deliberate effort of performing the various parts, the dialog falls short and it reads as a book meant for children. This masterful performance hits the mark. It couldn't have been told better by ol' Bilbo himself, which is how I think the book was meant to be enjoyed. This has to be the best performance that will ever be. You can even see that some of those in the movie must be guilty of borrowing some of their performance from this one. Get some good pipeweed, and listen to this with a friend!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"LOTR is a great story. One of the greatest. These comments pertain to the Millennium edition seven volume set.LOTR was written as a single book. Due to WWII era paper shortages it was broken up and published in three volumes each a few years apart. It seems silly to break it up further. If you want a portable LOTR, buy the paperback boxed set. If its a bookshelf copy to replace your worn out paperbacks, get the single volume &quot;red&quot; collector edition."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Lord of the Rings is a classic in my mind. It takes the reader on an epic journey of good verses evil. Dramtic and exciting. The main Character, Frodo Baggins, is a wonderful hero."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"A stunning book, I couldn't put it down! The Lord of the Rings is a book series that continues the story of the Hobbit. In it there is magic, war, and romance. It is much longer than the Hobbit, each book is about 500 pages long and there are 3 books. It was very exciting and is full of suspense."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"It is a very good book, but only understandable if read after the less serious book, The Hobbit. For members of Generation X, I would like to recommend the book, even though it is not written in a contemporary style.The Lord of the Rings initially caught on for reasons I can only guess. My theory: The fears of a generation living in the nuclear age (One ring = Raw Power Used irresponsibly-- The Bomb etc) were defeated symbolically in a mythically based story, written by a man who would, were he alive today, most likely be a member of the Green Party. I read the Hobbit and LOTR while in high school in the mid-70's, a few years after the great Tolkein craze had settled down. I have reread them frequently since then.Here are the story's strengths:A world you can picture because it is so thoroughly and lovingly described.A clean story. No profanity. No sex. Some romantic love a la Sir Walter Scott. The battle and combat scenes are full of energy, but not graphic/gory detail of spilled entrails and vomiting blood.Good versus evil, corruption of the greedy, tragic loss of life.Heroes you can identify with somewhat, i.e. the Hobbits. Because they are the least powerful, through them the sense of danger is vividly portrayed.Magic that is not really explained, but that adds a sense of wonder to the tale.Here are weaknesses, when measuring LOTR against contemporary fantasy:Does not dig deeply into very many characters' minds. One of the advantages of the current fantasy offerings at the quality end are the depth of characterization.You only get to know a few of the primary characters very well.Too dependent on Appendices for detail that explains the &quot;political&quot; situation.You never get enough detail on the Ring Wraiths or Sauron, though they are certainly vivid in their personification of pure, unadulterated evil.Not PC as it was way pre-PC, like many other good books.(See Huckleberry Finn.)When all is said and done, many contemporary fantasy writers have improved upon Tolkein's introduction of heroic fantasy into fine novel form, or used the genre as a back drop for what would otherwise be simple dramas, similar to what SF writers have often done.The best thing about this series, all four books, is that you can share them with children. Far too many current fantasy books in the swords and sorcery genre are simply too graphic, albeit well written, for consumption by young audiences.For those who ascribe racist and anti-woman complaints to JRR Tolkein, please remember that in the 1920's through 1950's, when the work was going through various stages of development, the cultural context that we currently accept was hardly the normal outlook of a university educated Englishman. And remember, _for centuries_, Europeans had feared not Black/Negro invaders, but rather tan Turk/Arab/Moorish moslem invaders who were a real &quot;threat&quot; to Christendom--for centuries!! This shared cultural perception made portraying the Southrons and Orcs as swarthy/dark skinned made easy identification of bad guys for a 1950's British audience, far better than for our enlightened, and lately 'politically correct' _American_ cultural world view. And oh by the way, women had only had the vote for one generation at the time of initial publication, and the feminist activism of the 60's was yet to make deep changes to American, and lately European, cultural norms. Yet Prof Tolkein's Galadriel preceded Maggy Thatcher as a strong female leader under pressure, in position of power if not in style, and both Elrond and Aragorn descended from &quot;interracial&quot; marriages.So put the PC histrionics on the shelf for a few days, enjoy a well told story of high fantasy, and share its positive aspects with your friends and/ or children. You will enjoy it, even if it does not turn you into a foaming-at-the-mouth advocate like some of the reviewers below."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Well I was looking for reviews of the Kindle version.

Meanwhile, the Ring weighs more heavily on Frodo, as he is forced to get help from one of the people he most despised: the Ring's slave Gollum.\\"Return of the King\\" brings the trilogy to an action-packed, slam-bang and ultimately poignant finale. Sam barely rescues Frodo from Sauron's orcs, and the two resume their journey to Mount Doom, barely escaping Sauron's forces. As Aragorn leads the desperate battle against Sauron's armies at the city of Minas Tirith, Frodo falls increasingly under the seductive spell of the Ring.\\"Lord of the Rings\\" is indeed a powerful book, speaking to virtually everyone who has read it. J.R.R. Tolkien drew from legends and myths, ranging from the ancient Norse mythology to more recent legends, mingled with his love of the British country folk and his Roman Catholic beliefs. Though there are no direct linkages or lessons in the trilogy, Tolkien probably drew on his experiences in World War I for the ravaged battlefields and breakneck action sequences. His beliefs are equally misty but present: they fueled the ethics of the good guys, the fall of formerly-good wizard Saruman, and the themes of temptation, redemption, evil and good that run through every character.Frodo Baggins is an everyman hero, who dreams of adventure but begins to treasure the simple, boring life that he had once he is deprived of it. His deteriotation is saddening, all the more so because he is aware of it. Sam Gamgee is his loyal gardener, a shy young hobbit who grows in confidence and courage. Gandalf is the quintessential wizard -- crabby, kindly, powerful, with a hidden unique streak that elevates him over the usual. Merry and Pippin start out a bit flaky, but are matured by their harrowing experiences. Aragorn is noble, kind, kingly, and intelligent, but with darker streaks in his personality that make him ultimately human. Legolas the elf and Gimli the dwarf initially grate on each other, but overcome their prejudices to become close friends.Tolkien's writing is evocative and descriptive, though not to extremes; Mordor, for example, is best described through the way that Sam and Frodo react to it. The dialogue can range from goofy and hilarious to solemn and archaic, or to some combination of the two. And the pacing is gradual but necessary -- readers with short attention spans won't be able to handle this story. If they can handle sprawling, epic tales, then probably they can.Even after all the years, J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" still rules the fantasy genre and has become an integral part of modern literature. It's an epic for all ages, and few books have even come close to equalling it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I collect books from Easton Press. That being said, this book getting a rating of 4 says enough about it.A good binding, but a bit thin, I can't see this spine living through more then 10 years, assuming it was picked up at least every other, the weight of the book is not overwhelming, but it IS a quite a bulky volume. If this is leather bound, then it really is a thin strip, that would seem to be bound over paper, as normal. To me, it feels like a smooth hardcover as normal;compared to an easton press leather bound, this simply is not the real thing. Also, moire end pages would of been nice, especially since the spine really is a bit thin. Perhaps, in regards to the binding, its quality dropped along with the price? In anycase don't expect a thick, unbend-able slice of premium cow butt. Leave that to the pro's at Easton Press.ASIDE from the Easton Press editions of Lord of the Rings, this is good quality, the price cannot be beat, especially considering the E.P. version (which includes the hobbit and sillmarillion) costs literally 7 times as much.Click buy, it will look SO nice on your shelf, and you will feel refined while reading it, reclining in your favorite chair, enjoying your favorite beverage, in the place you call home."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have read the Lord of the Rings over and over since I was about 12.

My boyfriend loved it and was it what he was looking for quite some time."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Lord of the Rings is, with no doubts at all, the best epic history ever published. Wrote between the mid 30's and the beginning of the 50's, this book is a best seller since his first publication in 1954. Tolkien introduce us to a world full of fantasy which he created first with THE HOBBIT just to entertain his sons.Lord of the Rings has inspired many areas including culture,Rpg and cinema(Star Wars for example). And with the release of the movie (The Fellowship of the Ring, the first part of the trilogy), which takes place 19 december, you really got to have this book to feel the fantastic imagination of J.R.R. Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"When author J.R.R. Tolkien released the last installment of the Lord of the Rings in 1955, it was as though he had tilled a seismic line in the sands of fantasy and fiction literature: Before Tolkien and After Tolkien. With his extraordinary depth of characters and storyline, scrutiny of detail, and flowing, serial writing style, the author - in one swift stroke - redefined a genre of modern literature in much the same way that the great bards in Shakespeare's time recast the foundations of drama and the spoken word. The story begins in the fictional land of Middle-Earth, a place not unlike our own in days gone by. Turquoise streams and chill valleys cut across the scenery; intimate villages and great stone cities dot the landscape; and an endless array of interesting characters, both kindly good and plotting evil, wait to be met. The reader first meets Frodo Baggins, the book's protagonist, in a town called Hobbiton - a mythical Pleasantville, USA where the grass is mowed and one's neighbors are just down the road. Frodo is a Hobbit, a kind, soft-footed creature of small stature. He could be any one of us, an Everyday Joe going about their tasks of today. But a mission soon thrust in his hands by Middle-Earth's powers-that-be? To destroy the One Ring, a fulcrum symbol of absolute power, creation and authority... and the one device that may end the world. In short, Lord of the Rings is truly epic: It is chock-full of battles, heroism, romance, comradeship, royalty, long-days, cold nights, plot twists. But Tolkien's ability to capture the imagination of the everyday reader is, perhaps, his greatest accomplishment. The reader feels drained at the conclusion of Frodo's remarkable journey, but filled with new experiences, as if one was actually there riding, walking and fighting with him and his colleagues. Tolkien succeeds in stimulating our emotions and diverting our minds, while clasping our hearts in a way that no other epic has before."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is the best book I have ever read. Vivid description and great adventure makes this book one of the best. If you're on a deserted island this would be a great book until you wait for help. Giving this book a good chance (even though it sometimes gets tiring) will give you one of the best books ever to read."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is one of those books which can be read time and time again.Tolkien's LORD OF THE RINGS (or perhaps better known by its separate titles The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers and The Return of the King)is one of the greatest literary achievements of all time. For those who look upon this as a simple fantasy with elves, dwarves, goblins (a/k/a orcs)and of course hobbits, they miss the greatest part of the story. Tolkien has fashioned a timeless tale of humanity within a world of his own creation.LOTR is an epic, more telling, more indicative of human behavior than any of those epics which are considered part of serious literature. Richly detailed, the book evokes simple themes of bravery, good versus evil, love, magic, wonder and loss while treating the characters not as simple fantasy stereotypes, but as complex individuals. The struggle of good and evil, temptation, fall and redemption is presented marvelously throughout and Tolkien's keen abilities for both prosaic and poetic expression make this a story to remember.The final chapter of the book is one that will remain in thought for a long time. I have read LOTR many times and it is a treasure."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"You either love it or hate it, one star or five stars, which I think says it all. Only the greatest works of fiction produce a reaction like that. I first read it as a teenager, which is the best time to read it, read Harry Potter and The Hobbit when you are a kid. Up until that point I was an an omnivorous reader and still am up to a point but most of my reading now is fantasy. Tolkien is the reason for my shift in reading habits. I gobble up the Feists, Goodkinds etc in a quest of my own. The quest is to find another Lord of the Rings but it is a quest that is destined to fail. The original and the source of all fantasy. LOTR has as much impact on its readers as the Iliad had on the ancient Greeks. I feel sadness for those who read it and find it boring. I can understand their feelings, the first time I attempted it I gave up, too many long words, too many pages, one even needed a map to guide you through the landscape. Nevertheless don't condemn a book on the grounds of boredom, Pilgrim's Progress is the most boring book you could read but it is rightly regarded as a classic and has been very influential on subsequent authors.LOTR heretics remind me of poor homeless urchins at Christmas peering through a window at a happy family opening their presents. They can't get in so they make disparaging comments about the presents. Read it again and if that does not work read it again. Suspend your critical facilities and immerse yourself in a magical world, your cares will lift and childhood will come again."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Reading the Lord of the Rings, it's easy to see why it took something like 15 years to write. The sheer scale of it is awe-inspiring. Nothing else I've ever read even comes close to the vast, intricately created world of Tolkien, complete with its own geography, flora, fauna, history and of course a fabulous cast of characters (I'm gushing a bit here, amn't I?).I first read the Lord of the Rings when I was something like 8 or 9, and it's been a couple of years since I last opened it, but so many details are still vivid in my mind - Gandalf's stand on the Bridge of Moria, the vivid battle scenes (one with comic relief as an elf and a dwarf compete to see who can kill more orcs), the horrors of Mordor, the final confrontation with the Enemy and the wistful, bittersweet final chapter. Of course, this could be partly because I've reread the whole book once at least, and certain bits more times than Barad-Dur has dungeons.The Lord of the Rings also contains many intelligent personal stories set against its vast canvas. The hero, Frodo the hobbit, tortured by the terrible burden of the Ring that he carries, the good man corrupted by its terrible power, the wise and powerful people who fall under the spell of the Enemy without realising it, the schizophrenic Smeagol/Gollum, all these and more can be found in this book.Galvanised by the oncoming release of the first part in cinemas (December of next year), I am going to read this wonderful book again soon. I suggest you read it too if you haven't, and even if you have it's well worth returning to.One last thing - if you get the appendices with this edition, read the first and second ones when you've finished for an excellent overview of events, and in particular make sure you read The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen, which further explains one of the prime motivations of an important character."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"No matter what your tastes in books are, if you are even slightly interested in any sort of fiction then this is a book for you. The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are both outstanding fantasy books. These are by far my favorite books ever, I read them through every year or so they're so good. This hardcover edition is very well made and the illustrations are outstanding. Alan Lee is definitely the best Tolkien illustrator out there. It even has a nifty little red bookmark ribbon, which I really like and think all hardcover books should have.. more for style than anything ;) Again, take the time to enjoy this book no matter your tastes!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is a story that I have read so many times. It is the type of book that is going to make you sad when it ends. I hate to make comparisons, but for the sake of defending this story against people who claim that more recently-written fantasy books are better (for whatever reason); sorry, but LOTR reduces them all to the ilk of a Harlequin romance novel.

It will be long, and tortuous, and complicated but - that's Tolkien! He might not always be easy reading, but he is certainly worth it! One thing - it must be a pretty hefty volume!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I absolutely love Lord of the Rings. Ever since I was read The Hobbit when I was young, I have loved Tolkien. The Lord of the Rings gives beautiful descriptions of a well-thought out world peopled by diverse races of beings. The story itself is about the struggle of good against evil and saving all that is fair in the world. Some of the characters in this novel are among my favorites in all of literature.About this edition: I love that it is a one-volume edition, as I can read it as a single novel if I choose, like Tolkien originally intended. The appendices are easy to reference in a one-volume book. Since it is quite hefty, I don't recommend it if you are looking for an easily portable book. What I do recommend this volume for are the illustrations by Alan Lee. His paintings to a wonderful job of capturing the atmosphere of Middle Earth, and I love coming across them in my reading. The book comes with a ribbon page marker and is bound in a satisfactory manner for such a large book. If you are a fan of Tolkien and want an edition to treasure for a long time, this is, in my opinion, well worth the price.That being said, there is one con (other than the bulkiness factor) that I must mention. The maps, unlike in some editions, are not pull out. Rather, they have separated one map over multiple places so that it is rather difficult to figure out where places are in relation to each other. I don't know why the publisher decided to do it this way, since it renders the map ineffective. Other than this problem, it is a great edition."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"My favorite book is Lord of the Rings, but this review is about this edition, not the story itself. I've owned a cheap paperback set of Lord of the Rings and the Alan Lee illustrated editions, but this edition is absolutely the best. I absolutely love the fold-out maps, the beautiful leather binding, the red ribbon bookmark, everything. I'm sure Tolkien would have loved this version. It truly honors his work. If you want a nice version of LOTR, (and don't mind spending a bit of money), get this version."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Hi, I am a California Community College student and upon the completion of all Lord of The Rings books, including the Hobbit, my Professor assigned a brief book review. It was the first time I have read these books and I was amazed of how J.R. Tolkien can describe the scenery and shrubbery with so much detail. At times I did find my self almost wanting to fall asleep, but there is excitement like the battle at Minas Tirith, Helms Deep and the Mines of Moria for example. Another great achievement J.R. Tolkien has accomplished is creating this whole world in which this epic tale takes place. It is also remarkable that he even created his own language. You will be amazed of the amount of information contained in these books from all the maps, family trees and history that all tie into making these books a remarkable tale. The characters in these novels will definitely stay with me for the rest of my life. From Beorn the black man bear, Tom Bombadil the trippy trailblazer, Tree Beard and my favorite character Bill the \\"beast of burden\\" pony. I found it quite humorous when Sam would talk to his pony until they had to go there separate ways. Another character that I enjoyed is Gollum. I also thought Gollum was hilarious yet tragic and one of my favorite quotes from Gollum is \\"Give me fish now and keep the nasty chips!\\" I would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a good fantasy novel to read."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I own both the BBC and Mind's Eye LotR dramatizations, and I am a life-long fan of the LotR novels. In that sense, I have a broad ability to review this production. The first thing any buyer MUST know is that this production was conducted in 1979 on a literal shoe-string budget using volunteer local voice talent and equipment. Bernard Mayes was the president of NPR at the time, and masterminded the production as a labor of pure love in a market that had not had seen radio dramatizations for many years. In this sense, you have to be willing to cut the production a lot of slack considering the difficult circumstances of the origins.I will discuss the weaknesses first...The Mind's Eye production (MEP) is lacking in quality and polish. The voice acting is definitely of a low caliber. Some of the principle actors are poor actors. In particular, the two main characters Frodo (Arrington) and Sam (Louise Bliss). Louise Bliss in particular is a terrible choise. I refuse to play along with the cast notes that call her \\"Lou\\" Bliss. This is Louise Bliss - the same woman who played Smurfette in the cartoons and you can tell. Some of the performances are painful to listen to in the same way that the kid in Phantom Menace was painful to watch. Others performers are more capable, such as Bernard Mayes himself who humbly gave himself the role of Gandalf. But none of the acting in the MEP comes across as 'good acting'.Similarly, the production values of the MEP are poor. The music is a set of 'stock' music that has been used in many cheap, cheesy children's audio productions. The sound effects and other background noises are also noticably substandard. Sometimes they are comically bad and sound like laser beams when Gandalf performs magic. But in most cases the effects are simply basic and forgettable such as when they are clearly using silverware clattering together to make sword sounds. The overall production values of the MEP ranges from somewhat below average (at best), to poor, to the absolutely cringe-worthily laughable.Where the MEP does shine though is in the scripting. This is beyond any doubt the most complete of all the adaptations. They include the bulk of the dialog, and quite often the narrator includes many of the lengthy descriptions that Tolkien wrote. They included the Tom Bombabil & Barrow Downs chapters, which most productions ignore. This is not to say that they do not abbreviate or condense at times. However, for the most part the MEP sticks to Tolkien's text more faithfully than most. If you are looking for a version of LoTR that is particularly detailed, then this is your best option.That pretty much sums it all up. Low quality performances and production values combined with a high level of detail and faithfulness to the text. I would say this production is suitable for children, but not as much for adults. Poor acting and bad production values will jar your experience. Overall, a less satisfying experience than the BBC production - but longer."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is the best narration of the LOTR series I have been able to find.

While the descriptions maybe long and at times it might not be as exciting as the movies I believe you get a better experience with the books than with the movies. While I agree with a few that there are some slow parts in the books I would never classify them as \\"boring\\" or \\"poorly written\\". If the book kept the same pace throughout the entire story it would've been rather plateaued and therefore less exciting when the story itself got to an exciting moment. Tolkien goes into descriptions about things to give the reader a good picture on what things are like, how characters act, how they dress, how they live etc. I find this a good quality in books.

I am not a massive Tolkien geek and though I have also read and reread The Hobbit, the Perilous Realm tales and Mr Bliss (all excellent) I have never been able to stomach the Simirilion or the other middle earth books. It seems to me that Tolkien's genius lies in being able to spin gold from straw and I have not felt the need to examine the straw too closely. The give or take in those numbers would coincide with the release of the recent film version of the epic which I hated. I watched the first half of the Fellowship of the Ring DVD a few months ago and had to turn it off. The film is both camp and silly where the novel is not. It is a testament to Tolkien's humanism that he is able to avoid that trap when so many of his followers waltz right into it. I have just started my 2010 reading and am still transported by the language and the believability of the story.

I read several notes on the works and find that it is smarter to read the work first them if you want to you can compare your view with the notes. You don't want to stop and say \\"Oh a shadow. What can that mean?\\" Also even thought J. R. R. Tolkien is quite explicit in the beginning that this is not an allegory or even a reference to events in the real world, some people try to equate the RING with the BOMB.There are several things that I found pleasing. One is that no one goes off and has any unrecorded adventures. This is each group especially in \\"The Two Towers\\" is completely tracked even though the events are parallel. And he does not have to use flash backs to do it. I am also impressed with the fact that even though you see several references to good and evil, that every being in the story had a purpose and a destiny that was not strictly black and white. Gandalf reminds Frodo to spare Gollum as Bilbo did. At other times as in Bible stories evil intentions can bring about good situations.

The maps included are wonderfully done in black and red ink although somewhat non-removable from the binding itself making for an complicated unfolding. The included glossy pages of old scripts are a plus as well(although I would have liked to have seen more throughout). The reason I am giving it 1 star is because of the claims of it being \\"leather\\" bound. I must presume you think that we would fall for such a clever sales tactic. Guess what, we did! I gave this as a gift and it came wrapped in shrinkwrap which I left on as to not damage the cover at all. When my friend unwrapped and opened the box/book I was saying how that it is leather bound. After inspection by my trained eye (I am a product developer for a photo album/diary company) I noticed that the cover material was NOT LEATHER! What it is is actually coated paper! Please if you buy this don't expect it to be leather because it is certainly not!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Again, most who purchase this are LOTR devotees, as am I. The fact that this is how Tolkien imagined the story to appear in the first place adds to the delight in re-reading this timeless tale of good vs. evil.As a writer or heroic fantasy myself, Tolkien influenced me greatly from the moment I read the first line of the Hobbit in 1967. This is what I aspired to as I penned my own 'gift' to my sons, The Book of Legends: Hallowed Ground.I recommend this for the collector. Read it once and put it on the shelf only to be opened on special occasions--like when you need a Tolkien fix!A.V. Spallo, Jr.Author, The Book of Legends: Hallowed Ground"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Though Tolkien was not the first or most critically-acclaimed fantasy writer, he remains the most beloved and influential, even though \\"Lord of the Rings\\" is decades old. Now with the epic movie trilogy based on this book, new waves of readers are discovering the unique power of the \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" It has quietly created the fantasy genre as we know it, set the tone for most fantasy ever since, topped many \\"best book\\" polls, and helped spawn such entertainment phenomena as \\"Star Wars.\\"Following up on events in \\"The Hobbit,\\" \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" stars the quiet, good-natured hobbit Frodo Baggins, who has inherited a golden Ring that allows its user to become invisible. But his friend, Gandalf the wizard, informs Frodo that the Ring is really the Ring of Power, a tiny invulnerable token that the demonic Dark Lord Sauron has poured his essence and power into. And if Sauron can regain the Ring, he will be able to conquer Middle-Earth. Aghast, Frodo joins a fellowship of Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, Men and a wizard, to go to the one place where the Ring can be destroyed: Mount Doom.\\"The Two Towers\\" begins directly after \\"Fellowship,\\" after Frodo Baggins flees with his friend Sam into Mordor, with no one to protect them. His cousins Merry and Pippin are kidnapped by orcs from the renegade wizard Saruman. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli begin a frenetic search for the hobbits, and receive unexpected help from unlikely allies. Meanwhile, the Ring weighs more heavily on Frodo, as he is forced to get help from one of the people he most despised: the Ring's slave Gollum.\\"Return of the King\\" brings the trilogy to an action-packed, slam-bang and ultimately poignant finale. Sam barely rescues Frodo from Sauron's orcs, and the two resume their journey to Mount Doom, barely escaping Sauron's forces. As Aragorn leads the desperate battle against Sauron's armies at the city of Minas Tirith, Frodo falls increasingly under the seductive spell of the Ring.\\"Lord of the Rings\\" is indeed a powerful book, speaking to virtually everyone who has read it. J.R.R. Tolkien drew from legends and myths, ranging from the ancient Norse mythology to more recent legends, mingled with his love of the British country folk and his Roman Catholic beliefs. Though there are no direct linkages or lessons in the trilogy, Tolkien probably drew on his experiences in World War I for the ravaged battlefields and breakneck action sequences. His beliefs are equally misty but present: they fueled the ethics of the good guys, the fall of formerly-good wizard Saruman, and the themes of temptation, redemption, evil and good that run through every character.Frodo Baggins is an everyman hero, who dreams of adventure but begins to treasure the simple, boring life that he had once he is deprived of it. His deteriotation is saddening, all the more so because he is aware of it. Sam Gamgee is his loyal gardener, a shy young hobbit who grows in confidence and courage. Gandalf is the quintessential wizard -- crabby, kindly, powerful, with a hidden unique streak that elevates him over the usual. Merry and Pippin start out a bit flaky, but are matured by their harrowing experiences. Aragorn is noble, kind, kingly, and intelligent, but with darker streaks in his personality that make him ultimately human. Legolas the elf and Gimli the dwarf initially grate on each other, but overcome their prejudices to become close friends.Tolkien's writing is evocative and descriptive, though not to extremes; Mordor, for example, is best described through the way that Sam and Frodo react to it. The dialogue ranges from goofy and hilarious to solemn and archaic, or to some combination of the two. And the pacing is gradual but necessary -- readers with short attention spans won't be able to handle this story. If they can handle sprawling, epic tales, then probably they can.Even after all the years, J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" still rules the fantasy genre and has become an integral part of modern literature. It's an epic for all ages, and few books have even come close to equalling it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have bought this edition book though I think it's a bit expensive. But...when I received the book, I felt like getting the Red Book of West March. Now the book has attracted me as once the One Ring did to Isildur, even Frodo. IT IS MY PRECIOUSSSS!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This red leather bound edition is a must have for any Tolkien Fan. This was given to me as a gift for Christmas back in 1988 and I have cherished it ever since. The leather is of high quality as is the paper upon which the novel is printed.The best thing about this edition is the fact it contains all three parts of the novel in ONE volume, the way it was intended to be. If you are a fan of the novel, then this is a must have for your collection."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Where does one begin? To judge near perfection, all the while striving to place words in such a manner to draw the yet unchanged masses into our shared love affair, such a task is beyond my means, but my love for this glorious tale drives me to make an effort despite the fact.It is with great regret that I admit waiting until my twenty-fifth year to have read this literary masterpiece, and having claimed to be enamored with fantasy-fiction. Heresy, that's what it was, to have avoided this grand tale in favor of lesser offerings when only my memories of that foul and near blasphemous animated film version drove me away. I am driven to shame.I will refrain from illuminating the history of the story, and its author, as the information is available so readily in the \\"Editorial Reviews\\" portion of this page. Instead, I fear my review will remain in the realm of the subjective, as opposed to an unbiased intellectual appeal; sorry the story simply touches to deep for such a callous approach. However, I would like to suggest that if you decide to purchase this magnificent tale, I highly recommend the \\"Houghton Mifflin Co.\\" edition, released in June 1999, an edition which claims to be the most accurate copy to date. More importantly, it is said Tolkien intended the three works: \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\", \\"The Two Towers\\", and \\"The Return of the King\\" to be considered one work, not a trilogy as we have come to know them. Having the three divisions in one binding reinforces the continuity of the tale as a whole, and I felt it greatly increased my veraciousness to devour each skillfully placed word.I am loath to reveal even the most innocent and seemingly innocuous detail about the tale, for fear, my words could steal any of the joy you find while reading Tolkien's words. Yet, you should understand that the tale follows in the days after \\"The Hobbit\\", and that the meager forces of light must fight the insurmountable shadow of evil. An age is coming to an end and with it the wonder and majesty of Middle-Earth. If you have yet to read \\"The Hobbit\\", do so first for it sows the seeds, which the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" skillfully harvests. Tolkien's opus is, and will always remain a seminal work of our age, a title none can afford deny themselves.The author's gentle, but sweeping touch resounds with a love for his creation. The fullness of the characters, and of the lands in which they live and die are so three dimensional, so very tangible and full of vitality that it is nearly impossible to refrain from growing emotionally involved. Even the villains are well developed. Through dialogue and narration we become aware of their motivations, giving renewed depth to the story and its events.Even now, this masterwork is being translated to the silver screen (a trilogy by \\"New Line Cinema\\"); read it now before you see the films, do not deny yourselves the true wonder of Tolkien's mastery."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Maybe not one for the literary intelligensa but a masterpiece to the common man. Epic, poetic, heroic - its all of these 'ics' and more. The Lord of the Rings is the only modern fantasy tale that can compare to Homer's great works."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Tolkien was a great man. He was not James Joyce or even JamesEllroy. His characters are limited, in that they have definingcharacteristics, not fully fleshed personalities, like Ebeneezer Scrooge. Tolkien's great achievement, the one that merits 5 stars for any of his middle earth works, is the creation in and of itself. Middle Earth has over 37,000 years of history. Read The Silmarillion. It is amazing. He spent his life trying to complete a supernatural land with a nearly thoroughly documented history. The fact that he pulled it off (though never to his own satisfaction) surely ranks him among the greatest creative geniuses on the 20th century. As to the assertion that the mystical elements of Middle Earth (The remaining Istari and Elves) left middle earth (Europe) for the west (America)...this is all wrong. Middle Earth as europe is correct. Tolkien said that he wanted to create a mythological past for England, like unto that of Greece and Rome. But the claim that the west is America is laughable. The Elves and all the &quot;magical&quot; elements of the world left at the end of the third age for Valinor. These were the Undying Lands, Eden, if you will, where the Elves first awoke, then forsook. Eru Illuvatar (&quot;God&quot;), at the end of the Second Age, sank the Island Kingdom of Numenor (&quot;Atlantis&quot;) into the sea and changed the fashion of the world from a flat plate to the globe we now know. Valinor was removed from the circles of the world and out of mortal comprehension. It can be compared to heaven. People believe it exists as a place, but cannot tell you where it is, as it it out of our plane of existence. The Istari and Elves did not go to &quot;america.&quot; They went back to the beginning. Enough, already. Don't expect maodern gender/culture neutral speech from someone born in South Africa in the last years of the 19th century. Also, read Tolkien's &quot;Leaf by Niggle.&quot; It can be found in &quot;The Tolkien Reader.&quot; It is a story about an artist painting a forever-growing picture of a tree. It parallels Tolkin's own life's work."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I'm essentially writing this review to summarize my thoughts on the series as a whole, and its overall quality.I was very pleased with it; the heroic main characters, the veiled allegory for sin embodied by the ring, and the fights and struggles, which, while they sometimes seemed a bit slow, and sometimes seemed to skim right over the important parts, were, in just enough cases (like the Shelob fight,) exciting and well-done, and delivered a very thrilling experience.I'm not as enamored with scenes of armies of men fighting as Tolkien seems to be, but I appreciate a good fantasy epic as much as the next guy, and that's what this story really is. Too many men for its own good, in my mind, but still just enough presence by wizards, orcs, elves, dwarves, and especially hobbits to keep it all interesting and involving, despite some dry bits.I can't really see much of anything about this story that would give people moral problems. Even those with very extreme religious hang-ups (such as myself) will have a hard time finding anything to raise issue with. There's magic in the story, but not in the \\"strongest guy wins\\" sense, which makes many modern pieces so problematic. There's great evil, but it's always rendered as just as vile and repulsive as evil really is. The main characters are small and weak, which only increases the excitement over how things turn out in the end. After all, beating an enemy isn't all that exciting if he's weaker than you are. Nobody likes a bully.The minor issues that I do raise with this story primarily have to do with the very slow pacing of the story overall, and the way the narrative seems to lose its focus somewhat during most battles. I think that Tolkien's main point during a large part of this story was to encourage people to see the beauty of this world he's created, which is an effort I can't raise issue with, though it ramps down the excitement somewhat. I feel the movies struck a slightly better balance between beauty and excitement in their pacing, but the books were still a lot of fun to read, and I reccomend them very strongly to anyone who still believes in the fight between good and evil."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"There are SO many different LOTR editions out there. It's difficult to know which one to choose. If you want one that is going to hold up over time &amp; through many readings, I say the Red Collector's edition it the best, by far. Forget all the paper backs. They may be cheaper, but by no means as durable. I was torn between the Illustrated edition &amp; the Red Collector's edition. After looking at both of them, it was a no-brainer....the Red Leatherette wins by a Landslide!!!! The book is a nice size....not too big, yet not too little. The beautiful gold, blue &amp; green foil embossing that embellishes the front cover, back cover, &amp; spine add to the book's elegance. It looks like something that fell directly out of Middle-Earth and right onto your lap! The entire Trilogy along with the appendices and a fold out map are contained within the single volume. A sturdy protective slipcover is also included. A wonderful fold-out map of Middle Earth is secured inside the back cover. I have read reviews that complained about the type-set. I think that it is fine. There might be a couple places where a letter, like the top of an &quot;a&quot; or &quot;e&quot; might be a little light. But this is few &amp; far between &amp; does not affect one's ability to read this treasured tome. The pages are a soft white...almost like an ecru...not quite yellow, but very easy on the eyes. There are no illustrations, but they are not at all necessary. The Illustrated Edition has illustrations, but just cannot measure up to the Red Book. It's pages are a bright glossy white...harder on the eyes to read.... and although Alan Lee did some wonderful artwork, it really doesn't add too much to the tale. I am happy I purchased the Red Leatherette Collector's Edition. In addition, I also purchased the Green Leatherette Collector's of the Hobbit.It is also simply beautiful! (Read the Hobbit first. The background in it will help make LOTR make a bit more sense to first time readers.) The two collector's editions make a great set that can be treasured &amp; enjoyed for many years to come! You won't be sorry!!!!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I am not able to read LOTR nearly as often as I would like, so this FABULOUS unabridged reading converts hours of driving time into reading time. With his rich English accent, Rob Inglis is about as good a reader as you can imagine. Although this is NOT a dramatization (but contains EVERY word of the written works), Inglis brings so much soul to each character, description, etc. that Tolkien himself couldn't have done better.A bonus is that Inglis actually sings all the songs (he wrote many of the tunes), and they are really excellent.I can't recommend this enough as a fabulous way to experience LOTR, esp. on long trips with your family. And don't miss his unabridged reading of the Hobbit, which is just as great."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"As a long time Lord of the Rings fan,.... I have had the paper back set for years... I saw this set and immediately ordered it... To start with, the presentation of the set is excellent... The three books are delivered in a cardboard case that is covered in Allan Lee\`s art work... The books themselves are 8x10.5 inches in size and are hefty in weight.. There is nothing like sitting and reading a book that has some weight to it... maybe just me, but reading a hardback over a paperback is the difference between night and day even if the words are identical. The type face is excellent and the artwork through out is images from Allen Lee.If you are reading this review, you are most likely already a Tolkien fan, so to review the book itself can be set aside as this set of books has probably been the most reviewed books in history. (save for he Bible of course). This set has a quality that is far above some of the other sets out there. I personally give this set 10 out of 10 and it has a special spot on my bookself.. Enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"No no no, I am not referring to the perfect date. I am referring to The Lord of the Rings (50th Anniversary Edition). I won't review the story cause you and I both know it is one of the very few best high Fantasy stories in human history (there are about 9 total). But this particular version of the book (format) is the focus here. I owned an earlier edition (you know the Red leather bound version), which I liked, but never read so I gave up on it, sold it on eBay, and moved on. It was a little dull looking, but it had heavy duty binding. The movies came out and then I thought about reading it again. But since I had no copy of the book(s) I wanted to re-purchase it once more. This time it had to be a keeper.Sure a cheap soft cover would work, if all I wanted was to know the story, but I wanted a truly elaborate experience with moody lightly on a rainy night in a soft reclining chair. Only a super elaborate copy of the book would do.The 2005 version Lord of the Rings (50th Anniversary Edition) is exceptionally attractive, and modestly solid. The smooth cover feels soft and warm in my hands, but the book is a bit heavy to read. However it opens up to flat nicely so I can put the book down to read it and only turn pages.Is it worth the $63 I paid at Amazon? Well yes and no. Yes, because it is the only version out there with as much attention to detail and elaborate design in appearance as a Rolls Royce, and no because, while solid, for $63 I would have expected heavy duty binding like the earlier red leather version, that would last ages. The binding is the only issue with this version. It holds the book well, but I was hoping for thicker and fuller binding that really says \\"this book was made exceptionally well to last\\". Instead, what we have is \\"this book is made exceptionally well and give it binding that befits it price.\\" I would have gladly paid double for a book that had a more robust binding.In the end I have a very pretty copy of The Lord of the Rings (50th Anniversary Edition) which I treasure highly, protect more so, and will own for as long as am able.I recommend this version over all other versions if your intention is to have a collector's copy that you are proud to own, if even in a flaunting way. If your intention is to read the story and could care less about what format the book comes in, then this version is not only flat out over priced, but overdone with impressive but unnecessary detail.I am one of the proud owners."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"For its 50th anniversary The Lord of the Rings has at last been produced in an edition worthy of the beauty of its contents. For the first time, J.R.R. Tolkien's masterpiece has received the treatment due to its classic status: leather binding, gilded edges, fine paper, everything the finest literary works should be accorded but are rarely given.J.R.R. Tolkien was never very happy with the publishing treatment given to The Lord of the Rings. He was obliged to leave out the pages of the dwarf history found in the Chamber of Mazarbul in Moria when the publishing technology of the mid 1950s wasn't able to accomodate his painstaking production. He was never pleased with the arbitrary division of the book into three volumes, and much of the artwork, particularly that of the first American paperback editions, pained him deeply. Now at last we can feel that he would pick up this edition and smile.For this edition Tolkien's son Christopher has carefully prepared the text so as to eliminate many typographical and other errors which had crept in over the years. Noted Tolkien scholars Wayne Hammond, Christina Scull, and Douglas Anderson have contributed forewards to explain some of the history of these revisions. This edition will truly become the Standard Edition of The Lord of the Rings.This edition of The Lord of the Rings is worthy to be read in Middle earth itself. As I hold it in my hands, I can imagine reading it sitting by an open round window in Bag End, or in the Hall of Fire in Rivendell, or on a flet in Lothlorien or a tower in Minas Tirith. Any edition of The Lord of the Rings will introduce you to Tolkien's world. Only this one will do so in a manner worthy of the genius of its creator."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have to agree with the previous review regarding the quality of this over-hyped edition. This is not the best edition of LOTR ever produced - far from it.The publishers quality control is clearly poor. The spine of my copy is squashed and dented, whilst the slip case is not, so it could not have been damaged in transit. The maps were folded together with globs of dry glue, which ripped when I opened them. This copy is inferior to the British De Luxe 50th Anniversary edition published by Harper Collins, which is a more understated and elegant edition of LOTR, designed with greater sympathy to what a De Luxe edition might have looked like when Tolkien published his masterpiece. It is also inferior to the old De Luxe Harper Collins India paper edition, and the earlier Allen and Unwin De Luxe India paper editions.The over all effect of this edition compared with the British De Luxe editions is clumsy and a tad naff.The British Harper Collins 50th De Luxe eddition had a fairly limited print run (it was not a limited edition, but only 2,500 were published)but it still might be possible to pick up a copy on Amazon UK. INMHO the Harper Collins De Luxe is the better edition, and the one most likely to be sought after by collectors in the future.Whichever edition you choose, Tolkiens text is, of course, superb."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The \\"steep price\\" here of sixty dollars on Amazon is an amazing deal compared to what the book is retailing for: $100. Nevertheless, if Amazon didn't exist, I would have purchased the book.Luckily I didn't have to. &#60;grin&#62; I received this yesterday as a Christmas present, and it took quite a while to pry my eyes away from it. First I explained to all present (whether they cared to hear it or not) that the picture on the slipcase was the tower of Isengard, drawn by Tolkien himself as he intended it to look. They wondered why the tower in the movie was so harsh and foreboding, and I explained to them that the tower in the movie was a representation of Saruman's treachery, whereas in the \\"real\\" world of Tolkien Isengard was originally a fortress of Gondor - for the Dunedain, specifically, if I remember correctly.When I slipped the book out of its jacket and felt the supple leather of the book itself, I ran my hands over it several times. I couldn't have felt like a bigger geek if I had tried! But it is gorgeous leather - so far superior to the beautiful collector's edition that there is simply no comparison between the two books.It was interesting to note that a large amount of emendations were made to the text, and that a book will be published next year detailing each one, and the reasons they made it. One of the reasons I wanted the book (other than I collect hardcover LOTR editions) was specifically to see the emendations, so when this book they spoke of is published, I will probably reread LOTR for the first time in years. It should be fascinating to see what the changes are.With the combination of the supple cover and the gilded pages, the high quality of the pages themselves, this book is a treasure: easily worth the price of a shirt woven of mithril."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"My review is simple, this is a complete and unabridged reading of all three parts of Lord of the Rings and boy is it great! Rob Inglis is a master of the voice. His pacing and ability to capture the mythical feel of the Rings world is magic.

Most, if not all, Fantasy authors strive their entire lives to produce a work that will equal, much less excel, the legacy of Tolkien's epic. The novel, published over 50 years ago, has been voted by Australia as the National Favorite Book of all time - and the mythology of Lord of the Rings, with Elves, Dwarves, and Hobbits, has even entered into the American mainstream with Peter Jackson's Tri-Star blockbusters. Tolkien's masterwork still captivates the hearts and minds of readers today just as it did when it was first published in the mid-1950s. And so, if you're reading this review for more information about whether or not you'll like Lord of the Rings, as a novel, then I can offer no more than this: the 50th Anniversary edition of the novel is just as splendid, if not more so, as any edition.Since you are reading a review for the 50th Anniversary Edition of Lord of the Rings, I'm sure you are more interested in this specific edition of Tolkien's classic novel instead of critical review of the novel. In that case, I'm sure that you're quite interested in what you see: a single volume edition of the Lord of the Rings, clothed in a black leather, gold trimmed pages, and complete with a slipcase to keep the actual book free from shelfware. And these are only the external qualities! Inside, you'll find heavy-duty crisp white pages which give extra emphasis to the printed text; you'll also find Tolkien's original pictures for the Book of Mazarbul (from the chapter The Bridge of Khazad-Dum), inserted just Tolkien originally desired; you'll also find two large scale fold out maps which give you the feeling that you, too, are embarking upon this journey to Mordor! All in all, these additions make an already excellent story into something even more special. In fact, just by purely owning it, I can't help but feel that I have an \\"inside\\" ticket to the world Hobbits, Elves, and Dwarves!The only downside to this edition is the fact that it is rather heavy, and if you like to sit and hold your books while reading, you'll find that you'll need to do a deal of weightlifting before attempting to do so with this book. It is not extremely heavy, mind you, like the Oxford English Dictionary, but it's no regular hardback book either.Is this edition worth $100, as listed? No. $100 is a lot of money to drop for anything, especially for a book. However, I'm sure other Lord of the Rings enthusiasts would disagree with me! Nonetheless, this edition is truly valuable in terms of everything it provides, both as a story and as a single volume. If you can find a pristine copy of this novel at a discount - such as here at amazon.com - by all means, be sure to pick it up: it'll be the most worthwhile purchase you have ever made."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Nach 278 Reviews was kann ich noch dazu sagen?

Because I have read other works of fantasy that I find more enjoyable, and while this is generally considered THE ultimate work of fantasy, Tolkien said it himself: &quot;It's too short.&quot; Mind you, he believed that making it longer would hurt it's chances of getting published back then. Who could know how famous and beloved this work would become? It is the first fantasy series I ever read, and I have multiple copies and versions of the trilogy. It is a wonderful tale of bravery and self-sacrifice, set in a world so well described that I can actually envision Hobbiton, Bree, and Minas Tirith, along with so many places in the book. I thank Tolkien (I hope he can hear me from the Blessed Realm!) for introducing me to the realm of fantasy novels, and for inspiring so many other authors to take up the craft of storytelling in this genre. If you haven't read it, please do. While I don't find it has the depth of so many other authors today, such as Robert Jordan, Elizabeth Moon, or Tad Williams, it is still an excellent read. you may find it a bit slow at times, but let's face it: not every second of an epic quest is going to be, well....epic!

One, which hasn't read LoTR and the other which has read it. But believe me when I say that even this statement doesn't express much enough the greatness of this magnificient story. The story is simple and yet an epic. Its about how even the smallest of things can change the tides of time and face of the world. This is a story of all stories. Theres fantasy, adventure, mystery, suspense, humour, romance in this saga of friendship, honor, loyalty, sacrifice, courage and bravery.There's one powerful ring, which is to be destroyed before it falls into the hands of evil orelse the world will fall into Darkness forever. It can only be destroyed by throwing it into the cracks of Mount Doom. This responsibilty comes upon the shoulder of one little hobbit, frodo baggins.In the entire story, Tolkein never mentions anything about Life, but after reading the story, you'll yourself realize how wonderful Life is and how a person should respect and enjoy it and thank God for such invaluable gift. In short, Life is a journey to one of the biggest celebration of the Universe. The meaning of Life is Life itself and Death is the celebration of all the moments of good and bad things happened to you;the moments of happiness, sadness, fear, joy, love, hatred, hope, despair;the moments you have spent in light, darkness, morning, night, summer, winter and all the moments you have lived through out your life.READ THIS BOOK AND YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING. YOU WILL NOT GET THIS KIND OF STORY THROUGH YOUR LIFE!!!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is usually found in a single volume, or in three volumes: 1) \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\", 2) \\"The Two Towers\\", and 3) \\"The Return of the King\\". My recommended reading age is 13+ years old, and I recommend reading \\"The Hobbit\\" first.When I was 15 years old in high school, I had to read \\"The Hobbit\\" for an English class. After reading that book, the teacher then let us borrow \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". Before I had started \\"The Return of the King\\", I had bought my own set of books. After I had read both books, I actually liked \\"The Hobbit\\" better than \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" at first - because \\"The Hobbit\\" was brighter: a fun, grand adventure with more humor, whereas \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" was darker: a serious, grim life and death struggle for world survival. But by the time I was about 16, the historical significance of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" began to appeal more to me. This is especially true if you read Appendices A and B of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", and also read \\"The Silmarillion\\". You begin to understand the rich history of Tolkien's Middle-Earth/ Beleriand creation. How \\"The Silmarillion\\" brings out the significant events of the First and Second Ages, while the events in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" are the culmination of the Third Age...each Age lasting thousands of years and ending with an immensely significant event.It was 25 years before I read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" again, but Bilbo, Frodo, Sam, Gandalf, Aragorn, Galadriel, Legolas, Gimli, and many more had become household names! I had matured over those years, and my tastes changed. I was no longer a big fantasy/science-fiction reader: instead I was reading military history. I didn't expect to still love \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" the way I did as a teenager. I was happily wrong! This is still an exciting book, but I discovered what I really love...it is allegory-type stories. J. R. R. Tolkien himself has said that \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is not allegory, because he hated allegory where he felt the author is dictating to the reader what is in their story...and that any other interpretation is incorrect. Tolkien wanted a reader to apply their own experiences and tastes to influence what they were reading. OK, but in real history one can still get allegory if their own experiences and tastes allow it. How many can learn about World War II and not apply the basic allegorical interpretation that good triumphs over evil? I've heard of, and can understand, several allegorical interpretations of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". Frodo is like Jesus Christ: bearing the greatest of burdens for world salvation while being tempted to stray from his purpose, and the weight of the ring is similar to Christ's cross . The One Ring is like the atomic bomb: the ultimate weapon that corrupts whoever uses it, despite even good intentions, into a power-hungry creature of evil. There's an ecological message with the Ents trying to protect trees; and also the natural beauty of various places throughout Middle-Earth, while evil beings try to destroy it all (including the use of mechanical and polluting progress). I also get out of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" a sense of a military mission: that Frodo & Sam are behind enemy lines on a mission that could end a war, and that Frodo realizes that getting back home or even staying alive doesn't matter - just completion of the mission...that's also sacrifice, perseverance, & camaraderie so prevalent in the military history I've read. There's prejudice with years of animosity between elves and dwarves, and how small, kind gestures can begin to erase all those blighted years...also, how people or races can put aside differences to solve a common problem. There's the recognition of the small, common people (citizen soldiers) that perform the greatest, toughest, and most necessary duty in any war. There's world peace in peril and that something needs to be done before it's too late. There's avoiding the easier way out, and facing one's problems and seeing them through to a conclusion despite severe hardships.I feel that Tolkien saw a little bit of himself in many of the good races of his world. The hobbits are like Tolkien because they love food, company, and talking about family. The ents are like Tolkien because of their unbounded love of trees. Gandalf the wizard is like Tolkien because of his exceptional intelligence and purpose of guiding others along the right path. Some men are like Tolkien because of their inner strength and gallantry, while other men show weakness by succumbing to evil...very realistic. But I believe he saw the beauty and enchantment of the elves in his wife, and why he loved both most dearly: that's why on their gravestone Luthien appears after his wife's name, and Beren appears after his name. The dwarves don't seem to resemble Tolkien, but they are present in much folklore, which is linked to his personal love of medieval languages.\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is a masterpiece in my opinion, and it's size (over 1000 pages in any printed format) is pretty daunting, but give it a shot! It'll be time well spent. And get ready for adventure, terror, excitement, love, treachery, devotion, monumental historic events, unforgettable battles, military strategy, exotic languages & culture, etc. See what you get out of the book! I think most people will enjoy it and/or be moved by it. And who knows, maybe it'll become your favorite book too!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Leather bound. Guilded page edges. Silk bookmark. Matching sleeve. Definately a worthy eddition for the 50th anniversary! This is THE eddition to get if you don't have one yet."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Thanks for all of the reviews. I read many carefully before purchasing this item. I stuck to those reviews that actually talked about the quality of the book rather than the content (why would I spend $100 on a book I've never read?). I was able to look for the quirks that others had written about and get a book that was perfect. My husband loves it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is not a review of this edition as I don't have it. But I have read LOTR, The Hobbit and the Silmarillion several times, years before the movies came out, and again afterward.I think it's almost irrelevant to compare the books to the movies, as they are different stories. The movies remind me of the books of course, but there are so many huge, fundamental differences, that I cannot consider them in the same light at all. The movies amost completely lack the very spiritual core that the books are founded upon.It's interesting to me that before the movies came out, it was almost hard to find a negative review of Tolkien's work. Almost every adult I know personally who has read the books consider Tolkien's work to be of such high caliber that it seems doubtful that it will ever be surpassed. \\"Life changing\\", is not too strong a phrase, if you \\"get it\\". I suppose only those with significant literary and intellectual depth and appreciation for historical context typically earn the rewards these stunningly deep and beautiful books offer.Now that the movies have been out a while, and many more people have attempted to read the books than otherwise would have because of their exposure to the movies and videogames, I see many reviews that seem to entirely miss the point of the books. Perhaps it's because more people are reading them. Perhaps it's because the very time it takes to read through the Midgewater Marshes is one of many factors that contributes to the impression of realism, and helps the reader empathize with the characters. Perhaps some don't have the patience to appreciate the beauty of a journey for its own sake. Perhaps the reader's intellect and imagination, that Tolkien relied on heavily to fill in gaps and speculate about the \\"uneplained vistas\\" and character development have been stifled by the spoon-feeding that movies and videogames offer. Almost everything Tolkien DIDN'T explain was just as intentional as what he did write, becasue he understood the longing and curiosity it generates, not to explain everything explicitly.I think I speak for most Tolkien fans by saying that the depth of detail included in his work makes the memory of the books very nearly as vivid as the memory of a real place. Perhaps more vivid in some ways."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"What can be said about the greatest novel of the 20th Century...except that it is so long, that it's broken up into three volumes. And it's so good, that it inspired a whole movement of fantasy writing. I wish I had a story like this in my head, waiting to come out."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Although Tolkien's work scarcely requires further comment, I feel obligated to pay homage to the father of the modern fantasy genre. The impact of his work on literature is incalculable, and I might venture to say that it created the entire fantasy subculture as a byproduct. No one can be considered an educated person without reading the Lord of the Rings; their influence is that great. But The Lord of the Rings shouldn't be read simply because of it's importance to literature- it's a work of art, beautifully written, and should be appreciated as such. This particular edition is absolutely stunning, and the illustrations a works of art in and of themselves. I highly reccomend these books as a gift to any reader."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Let's face it: This is a classic. It is a compendious, dazzling testimony to the power of the imagination. It's hard to think of any other imaginary world, before or after Tolkien, which exhibits such beauty and richness. The sense of irreversible loss which pervades this beauty and richness produces a high level of convincing pathos. Not that the figment of 'literary history' is as important as individual books of literature, but its place in the history of fantasy literature is assured. Few works of fantasy since it stand untouched by its shadow, and I daresay none inspires such passion and loving regard in its readership. I would even go so far as to say Tolkien has outdone more than a handful of the medieval and post-medieval romances which were his models. But I have to be honest: there are writers with greater depth than Tolkien. There are writers whose epic vision encompasses more than Tolkien. Tolkien's style is certainly a better modern attempt to reproduce the feel of medieval prose than the Victorian patois ever was, but in style as well as substance, too much has changed since the 14th century. This isn't chronological snobbery; it's an acknowledgment of the facts. Tolkien's books were the mainstay of my childhood and adolescence and were still primary in my early college years. But I can't read him now as I read him then. Middle-earth has receded somewhat, become more provincial. The high moments do not come as often. Among fantasy fiction it certainly merits five stars. I recommend it enough to new readers to give it five stars for their sake. But set against the classics of the world, in which the true five-star books appear but rarely, I can only give it four stars (four and a half, perhaps). I consider this a great &quot;transitional&quot; work, between the classic fables for children and the great books meant for adults. Be prepared, then, and understand that perhaps this ring should also bear that famous inscription of another, &quot;This too shall pass.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I love this book, and I'm still in Middle School. I think this is on the top three of the greatest books of all time. It is heartbreaking, heartwarming, and will keep you on the edje of your seat, or your desk, or wherever you may be. Tolkien does a magnificent job on creating characters, middle-earth, and the whole history which could only been created by pure genius.I think I really love this book because I was subjected to too much Middle-Earth when I was little. I loved the movie-cartoon &quot;the hobbit&quot; and at that time my brother and dad had read the book and I remember them talking about Galadriel having one of the elven-rings. That was when I was about four, and When I was in fifth grade I finally read the hobbit. Now I'm on the last chapter of &quot;Return of the king&quot;, And I find the complex plot, the many tear-choking deaths and near-deaths, and the sheer coolness of it is just awesome. Hey, I found out that there is a poll on the internet on the greatest book of the 20th century. So far, Green eggs and ham is winning over Lord of the rings! Let's turn that around!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"As a child, my parents began buying me and my brothers Mind's Eye tapes to listen to while travelling. My absolute favorites were always the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings sets. I read the books when I was a teenager and was not disappointed in the comparison between the spoken and written versions. While, like any abridged audio version, some portions were skimmed over or lost, the story itself remains remarkably intact and accurate. The dramatic telling of this story fascinated and stirred my imagination. It is actuallly a recorded drama with characters read by various actors/actresses who do an excellent job of conveying the emotion and tone of the story. A few years ago, I bought both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings on CD and I still love to listen to them as I travel on business or pleasure. I believe that you will find this to be a great story that you can enjoy time and again with each retelling."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I did really love this book. So much so that I know have three copies of each book floating around. But I wouldn't say it's perfect, and I can't say it's the best book ever written. Here comes the justification:I found it too short. This is supposed to be an epic tale of the weak against the strong, but it seems to cut out too suddenly. After the 'Great Battle' at the gates of Minas Tirith, the Armies of the west could march all the way to the gates of Mordor. Now, call me old fashioned, but isn't it likely that Sauron would've left some troops behind, just in case?There are so many chances for the book to go into more detail, so many avenues left unexplored, I felt almost betrayed when it ended. Maybe this was intentional, but it did leave me feeling that there should have been more.Another thing that annoyed me was the sudden change in style. For most of the first book it's very colloquial, as though someone was sat there talking to you, tellig you what happened. Then, towards the end, it suddenly changes to a mythical style - lots of Lo!'s, and 'he beheld's. It seems almost as though Tolkien couldn't make his mind up about what sort of story he was writing.Please, though, don't think I'm slagging it off. I really did enjoy LOTR, and I would be singing its praises, but I think people have already done enough of that."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I read this book for the first time at 16, three years ago, in December 1996. I simply love it. It is true that once you have read it, you can't be the same person you were when you started it. It changes yourself deeply, it becomes a part of your heart... Please, don't try to analyse it from a mere rational point of view: I tried to, and it was a difficult and unsuccesful work. Perhaps that inside this book there are literary intentions that can't be &quot;rationally&quot; shared, but do I really have to care? My birthday is in December, and during this month every year I start reading again &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. While I become older, I somehow save my soul from the violence of reality. This is the story of my life. Give this book to children, try to educate them to courage and nobilty. Just a little final note: some literary critics said that Tolkien expressed in his works a fascist point of view. I don't think they have ever read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, or, if they have, they couldn't understand a word."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Tolkien is inarguably the world's best writer of fantasy novels. Not only did he start the genre in this modern age, but he also influenced other maestros such as C.S. Lewis. It started with &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; but quickly moved on to more serious things. He gave us what we consider to be Elves, and Orcs, and Hobbits today. His world of Middle Earth is the most expansive one, with hundreds of thousands, if not millions of years of history, theology, creation, war, love, hope, adventure and daring. In his ultimate masterpiece, &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; he brings out much of what is unknown to the reader of &quot;The Hobbit.&quot; All that world that he describes in less popular books, such as &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; and &quot;The Book of Lost Tales,&quot; are described in this book, and he extends those stories to their final conclusion with the passing of the One Ring (or &quot;Ash Nazg&quot; as Sauron originally spoke the words) and the removal of the Elves to Valinor. Despite Tolkien's protest that he wrote the book purely to write about the world he created, there are underlying themes such as friendship between races, as can be shown in the companionship between Gimli the Dwarf and Legolas the Elf.This particular edition of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is a must because it commemorates the centennary of Tolkien's birth in 1892. Both fans and non-fans alike will enjoy Alan Lee's illustrations as they depict the journey of the Ring."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"My greatest enjoyment of this trilogy has come from the reading of the original books, which I did many times as a boy, and perhaps twice as a man. I also liked the movie cycle, which I saw once in a theater and perhaps two other times on DVD.This radio play was, to me, considerably more engaging and imaginative than the movie cycle. Its power derives from effective use of basic ingredients like spoken voice, sounds, music and silence. I do like the spectacular visuals in the movies, but I shall probably return more often to this radio play than to the movies.A great companion on the commuter bus and train, when perhaps at the end of the day I may not feel like reading.A sentimental element - the Frodo here is wonderfully played by Ian Holm, who appeared some 20 years later as Bilbo in the movies.I have not heard the later edition of this radio play, so my comments pertain only to this product in its own right.BTW this edition is in the collection of several public libraries in my region, which are not exceptional in other respects, so it is probably widely available for free listening."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I've got this edition of the book not a long time ago, and even though i'm only in chapter 5, it's excellent. the leather bounding and the paper smell an feel wonderfull. this is, no doubt, the ultimate edition of the lord of the rings. and i'm 12, i just don't want that stupid \\"kid's review\\""},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I've read the LOTR just about yearly since I was in 7th grade, and I bought this edition because I liked the illustrations and because my older boxed set has nearly flamed out. I still love the story, but this edition is terrible. The kaolin paper is shiny which makes any book difficult to read comfortably; in this edition, the ink used varies in color from medium to dark grey--it rarely ever approaches black--and is unevenly applied, so the reduced contrast combines with the shiny paper to make this a most uncomfortable read for extended sessions. This is more of a nitpick possibly than a complaint, but the line spacing is also too wide. Finally, throughout the work there are occasionally smudges or lines of text that have smeared or slipped. On balance, I have rarely encountered any more physically awkward and aesthetically disappointing volumes, and recommend strongly to all comers that you get the separate volume of Alan Lee illustrations and find yourself a hardback edition printed on 'normal' paper for your actual reading copy.

All of Tolkien's &quot;The Lord of the Ring&quot; is present in this one book (It is normally published in three volumes.)

The Lord of the Rings is a vividly written story with an entangling plot, genuine and original characters, and the bewitching voice of J.R.R. Tolkein. Though at first glance many modern readers find the descriptions and dialogue overwrought, upon closer examination, nothing less could possibly do. Our impatience comes from our way of life, which must be utterly put aside to enjoy this book's breathtaking landscapes, enchanting cultures rich in songs and history, and a cast of both noble and despicable characters. Each development comes in its due time, accompanied by the laughter and tears of the irresistible connection between storyteller and audience.Yet in these pages the reader will also find layers of symbolism, an almost unintentional social conscience, and a story of our world that makes these books frighteningly relevant today. There lies wisdom for the discovery of anyone who will listen."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"From this point on, for better or worse, it will probably be impossible to read The Lord of The Rings without the very successful film trilogy (currently still a duo until next December) looming in the background. Probably the best thing about the films is that they will likely entice the reading of the book. The book is very different in some spots, verbatim in others. For example, after seeing the films, it's hard to think of Frodo as being 50 years old when he leaves the Shire (Elijah Wood, Frodo Baggins in the films, barely looks out of his teens), but in the book he is well aged by the time Gandalf sends him on his way. This is only one of many many examples.It's interesting to read the one-volume edition. It's how Tolkien intended it to be presented, as one large novel (Tolkien's publisher divided the story into three parts against his wishes). With the one-volume edition you feel like you're reading something hefty, an old tome from mythology, something with real weight and umph. It's a massive 1008 pages (not including the appendices and index), but it's a fast fast neckbreaking page turning read. It isn't difficult reading (i.e., not much unfamiliar vocabulary apart from terms coined by Tolkien and the passages in Elvish or Mordor), but it is detailed, far more detailed than a film could ever hope to be. It is a book that will reward many repeated readings.Some of the basic themes of the book seem to be hope, despair, singularity, and plurality. There are many places in this book where things seem beyond hope for the heroes. In some places this leads them to despair, which does them no good. Finding hope in despair seems to be one of the book's main themes: we don't know what will happen, so why despair before the fact? All you can do is keep going. In a way the book is an analogy for our lives which are filled with hope and despair, but we keep going on even against impossible odds.Concerning singularity and plurality, on one side there is the fellowship of the ring which is made up of a diverse cast of beings: hobbits, a dwarf, humans, and an elf. They set out to meet their task together while trying their best to put behind their differences. On the other side you have Sauron and the One Ring or singularity. Sauron is trying to bind the world to his single will which is embodied in the ring of power. It ruins those who try to possess it (Humans are particularly susceptible to it). It is pure self-obsession and self-importance. This singularity is put forth as evil, while the plurality of the fellowship is presented as good. It's an interesting dichotomy.Fans of the films will be shocked to see the differences in the story line, especially in \\"The Two Towers.\\" In terms of suspense, the book is far superior to the film (I'm sure the filmmakers would completely agree). I literally could not wait to begin reading \\"The Return of The King\\" and I could not put the book down until I reached page 1008. The book sometimes kept me reading obsessively until 3 or 4 in the morning (such as when I was reading the chapters with Shelob in \\"The Two Towers\\" - amazing).This book deserves its place amongst the greatest works of the 20th century. It is a story that can re-invent itself in terms of the time it is read in or the perspective it is read from. It is this ambiguity and multi-facetness that makes the book timeless. Doubtless people will be reading this for hundreds of years while they face the hope and despair of their own lives and times.It will be fascinating to see how \\"The Return of The King\\" turns out. Unfortunately, I had a hard time not thinking about this while I read the book. I tried. Nonetheless, the book will likely prosper beyond the films. Technology will develop and this book will be presented again in film or some other medium, of that you can be sure. At the heart of it all, regardless of the hype, will be the book by J.R.R. Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"My husband usually doesn't like *any* type of fiction; he usually finds the stories dull or mediocre at best. But this is different - he eagerly looks forward to reading the Trilogy every 2-3 years. And for him, that's reading a story on a regular basis. (I purchased the leatherette edition - The Red Book of Westmarch - as a Christmas present for him.)As for me, the only reference I had heard to these stories was back in the late 1970's, when I was in high school. An English teacher asked the class if any of us had read the books. I had never heard of them at that point - but one boy, a burnout (this was back when high schools had smoking lounges), raised his hand and said it was the best story he'd ever read! For a boy whose face looked drawn and whose hair is best described as scraggily, I have to admit I was absolutely stunned. Of course, I didn't bother to search out the story. What a mistake!It took marriage to my husband (just 3 weeks shy of my 22nd birthday) to find out about this wonderful Trilogy, and how he originally read it in grade 6, at the age of 11. Although he didn't understand a lot of it at the time, he was utterly taken with it, as his teacher thought he would be.That it took took me another 2 or 3 years after I got married to buy the authorized paperback editions makes me want to kick myself for waiting so long. I have since read it about 7 times, and it has never ceased to move or amaze me. You truly pick up different things each time you read it. In fact, even though I know how the story ends, it always makes me cry (the 1st time through, I could barely make out the words as my eyes were flooded with tears).Yes, the movies don't quite follow the books, but the movies are a visual medium, and, with the books, you can read at your leisure; you can drink in all the vast, lovely details that make Tolkien's Middle Earth a place you want to visit again and again."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"A few years ago, I read THE HOBBIT. One day, I was telling my friend how much I loved it, and her sister said, &quot; You should read LORD OF THE RINGS.&quot; I kind of shrugged it off and never bothered to read it, figuring it couldn't possibly be as good as THE HOBBIT. Then I saw the movie. It was so cool I just had to read the book. I bought a boxed set in August, and before the month was over, I had read it twice. It is the absolute best book I have ever read. It is written very very well, and I love the way all of the races are so different.J.R.R. Tolkien has created this amazing, realistic world; complete with countries, different cultures, and an antagonist.

I first read these tales when I was a teenager and have re-read them several times since then and it never gets old. As an aspiring author myself, I unabashedly marvel at J.R.R. Tolkien's imaginative genius. Tolkien was not satisfied with merely writting a good story, he created an entire intricate mythology through which, like a master storyteller of yore, he tells an ageless moral story, while taking the reader on one of the most wondrous adventures ever written."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This hardback edition of Tolkien's trilogy (The Fellowship of the Ring, The Twin Towers, and The Return of the King) is a MUST for the bookshelf of any J.R.R. Tolkien fan! I watched the first movie before reading the book, and I must say the movie is a disappointment. While it is fascinating to see Tolkien's characters depicted on the big screen with dazzling special effects, the movie still pales in comparison to the vivid word pictures and painstaking attention to detail the author presents in this classic work.With all the publicity surrounding the Fellowship of the Ring movie, most persons are familiar with the basic plot: the hobbit, Frodo Baggins, is given the daunting task of destroying the great Ring that offers ultimate power and conquest for its bearer. This tale describes the adventures Frodo and his company experience as they make their way towards Mount Doom, the only place where the ring can be destroyed within the fires of the dark summit.I recommend this hardcover version highly over the paperback edition, for it likely will be read more than once in one's lifetime. The extra money paid for the hardcover edition is well worth the additional investment. If you enjoy Tolkien, buy this book, read it, then read it again!

I recommend this to every Tolkien fan!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is a fantasy novel of epic proportions. Each chapter draws the you father away from the real world and deeper into the realm of Middle Earth, the fantastic setting in which the story takes place. Its author, J.R.R. Tolkien, uses detailed imagery, well-developed characters, and an ever-evolving plot line to produce a tale that has shaped the minds and styles of readers and writers all over the world. Each of Tolkien's descriptions add to the collection of imagery yet another part of Middle Earth's landscape. Middle Earth is so expansive and detailed that it seems to develop into the main character of the tale as a whole. The important characters of the novel are each unique and dynamic. They all have strengths and weaknesses that one can relate to and understand. As the story progresses, each character's personality is bent and forged, shaped by the terrors and joys faced by each as the tale fulfills itself.The Fellowship of the Ring is only the first part of three novels in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. It moves slower than the latter two books but is more descriptive and sets up a lot of the staging for the latter plot development. It is a wonderful story line, and is played out with exquisite results, often catching the reader off guard.This book will entertain you if you have any kind of interest in the subject matter. It is one of the few books I've read that gave me emotional reactions from cold chills to sincere worry. Rich in characters, plot, and imagination this book is a classic."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Yeah, we all know that its a classic, and many of us have read classics before. Lots of them are boring, and weren't worth our time, but this book is. I have read all three books 4 times in the past year, and I can't get enough of them. I have bought other books concerning the History of Middle Earth, and they are just amazing. J.R.R. Tolkien spent over 15 years writing these, I think its worth a read.So many people say 'I don't like fantasy books'...well, it IS a fantasy, but its so amazing, everything is thought through so well that it seems like you are reading the history of the Earth, over 7000 years ago. There are so many small little details, its so real, and you can never get enough of it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Une trilogie qui se lit en peu de temps.

J.R.R. Tolkien drew from legends and myths, ranging from the ancient Norse mythology to more recent legends, mingled with his love of the British country folk and his Roman Catholic beliefs. Though there are no direct linkages or lessons in the trilogy, Tolkien drew on his experiences in World War I, the ravaged battlefields, and the mechanization of the countryside for the most moving passages of the book. His beliefs beliefs are equally misty but present: they fueled the ethics of the good guys, the fall of formerly-good wizard Saruman, and the themes of temptation, redemption, evil and good that run through every character.Frodo Baggins is an everyman hero, who dreams of adventure but begins to treasure the simple, boring life that he had once he is deprived of it.

Merry and Pippin start out as a chirpy boy and a well-meaning flake, but are matured and made more multi-dimensional by their harrowing experiences. Aragorn is noble, kind, kingly, and intelligent, but with darker streaks in his personality that make him ultimately human. Legolas the elf and Gimli the dwarf initially grate on each other, but overcome their prejudices to become close friends.Tolkien's writing is evocative and descriptive, though not to extremes; Mordor, for example, is best described through the way that Sam and Frodo react to it. The dialogue ranges from absolutely hilarious to solemn and biblical, or to some combination of the two. And the pacing is gradual but necessary; if you don't have a good attention span, then you won't be able to handle this story.This particular edition is pretty good. The binding is fairly strong and tight, necessary for a book of over one thousand pages. The paper is of good quality, very pale and in stark contrast to the dark type.

It is a gorgeous volume, with heavy embossed paper, the edges of which are covered in gold leaf. The red leather binding and cover might seem garish, and the volume is eye catching. The protective box fits perfectly on one's bookshelf, and one will be proud to display this impressive volume."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"If you love The Lord of the Rings, this set is of the highest possible quality. No other publication of the story can come close to this one. In other words, if you just want to read the story and throw it away, buy a used &quot;regular&quot; copy. But if you treasure it and want to read it again, THIS IS THE ONE TO HAVE. I bought it sometime ago and it is a treasure on my shelf next to the Hobbit's similiar book (and to which every thing I said is just as true). Actually you MUST read the Hobbit BEFORE you see the movie if you truly want to understand it, because that is where it all starts, and the movie makes MUCH MORE SENSE if you've read it first, especially since they left almost the entire story out--so your're starting well into the TRUE STORY, and may have trouble making sense of some things that happen."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Tolkien was so special because he created not only characters who were true to themselves, but also species who were true. They had their own languages, songs, poems, traditions, characteristics. . . in short, they were embodied of their own cultures. Keeping track of all these things, so he wouldn't be caught in inconsistency, is why Tolkien was a genius who is, so far, unmatched. I have re-read this series many times. If I were stranded on a deserted island with five books, the LofR and the Bible would make up my five. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"When I was 12 I read J.R.R Tolkien's THE HOBBIT , LORD OF THE RINGS and SILMARILLION for the first time and I just can't seem to stop.

It's one of those books you read quickly to keep going in the plot, then re-read for its deep content and meaning, and then re-read again because hey, by now you're addicted. What I mean by this is that the story, characters and the world of Middle Earth is just so overall enthralling that you get to the end of the series and you say,&quot; What? That's it? But what am I supposed to do now?&quot; ( I think this feeling is what carried me through all of Appendix A, B, C, and most of the remaining). Anyway, not only are Tolkien's writings the most interesting ( a horrific understatement) but they are also the most touching, involved combination cliff hanger and tearjerker that I have ever read. I'd better sum this up, so I'll just say that if you're looking to read something you'll enjoy and never forget, you should definitely remember the Lord of the Rings By JRR Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Too bad the ratings stop at 10.

I share all the thoughts of previous readers of (to me) the best book you can read.Over twenty times I have read all four (The Hobbit is as much a part), and I still find something new and wonderful. It is a lifetime every time I read the Lord of the rings and the Hobbit and thus the story stays real, along with a part of me. I,ve tried to discribe the story to anyone who likes to read,but I'm usually left gasping for words, for it is the amazing number of different feelingsI experiance reading the book that I love most. How can you describe a different world that sounds madeup to somebody? Only those of us that have read it knows it is real!!."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This book is the best fantasy ever written. It transports you to the very world where the story takes place. Tolkien has created a whole world with it's own history and mithology to go with it. The story is captivating. The fear of darkness drives everyone on in the story. There are different cultures with different languages and scripts that would take me years to invent. I have read this book three times and never have I ever read one single line and been bored. The despair of all things intrigues you to read on. The way that there is no hope for anyone but Sauron the Great. And one halfgrown Hobbit has the fate of the entire world hanging from around his neck the whole time. The dark necromantic powers are tempting him non-stop to put on the ring whick will attract the enemy and consume his very soul. The characters are wonderful and well developed. The story is almost impossible for anyone else to rival. And the fear, the fear that holds all the characters and all the readers together in the book. The fear is so great, that the ruler of Minas Tirith(the most powerful city in all of middle Earth) burns himself alive in his fear. If there is one fantasy book that you absolutely have to read, it is The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. When I was seven years old, my Dad read the Hobbit to me. I loved it so much that I read The Lord of the Rings to myself. And I have read it twice since then. I am in the prossess of reading it again. Everytime I hear someone tell me that this book is boring, because they started it(and read the first twenty pages), I tell them: &quot;I you think that this book is boring, it's because you probably are not at the right mental level to read it yet.&quot; And while I say that, I feel like people do not try hard enough at anything. If you have not read The Lord of the rings, Read it now!

Tolkien made me feel as if I was in the story myself by how he described it. He sort of doesen't describe the characters as good though. But it still had a very good plot, a few twists and turns, and alot of action. He also somehow made me get a little on edge when he was describing Sauron and the ring. This book was decent in general, but I like the Two Towers more."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I am really tired of listening everyone gush about how Tolkien is 'God' of fantasy. The trilogy is a wonderful story with a great deal of detail and history behind it. It was one of the earliest epic fantasy trilogies of our time. It is not the best one. It doesn't define the genre, it is merely defined BY the genre. To tell you the truth (I swear) I stopped reading in the middle of 'The Two Towers' because the story was just too slow for me. I had to go back and finish it (the trilogy) a couple of years later. Meanwhile I was occupying my time with authors such as Robert Jordan, Stephen R Donaldson, and David Eddings who are (arguably, and I'm sure you all want to argue the point) better at the craft of storytelling. Call me a blasphemer at the altar of 'Tolkien-ness', I'll just say that I am honest.

Realistically, if it were released today it would be well read but then disappear along with most of the good-but-not-great contemporary fantasy novels.In between some gripping storytelling and vivid characters the book drags and meanders. The two times I have read it it has taken me over a week (I'll read a really good book in under a day).Still, I'll probably read it once more just so I can again justify not giving it a 10 (and yes, I do give 10s - Ender's Game got one of only a handful)"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This book is great!

Apparently some idiots just don't know what an imagination is. Every day this world is becoming more and more of a sad place to live in. No one has time for anything, no one cares for anything, all I hear any more is bickering, yelling, cursing, hatred, anger, and many slews of empty uneducated comments. If a book like the Lord of the Rings is to \\"complex\\" for your brain to handle then it sounds like to me you have no grasp on imagination at all. If you to try and make sense out of every single word and compare it with reality then you should be sticking to non-fiction and quite reading fiction. It sounds like to me you're just some idiot who saw the films then decided to read the book and was upset when it wasn't up to the same standards. Also, the Hobbit was written more for children while the Lord of the Rings was written for an older crowd, so of course the Hobbit is easier to read, but it's also interesting that my 8 year old nephew read and understood the Lord of the Rings book before the films even came out. Sounds like to me your just too simple minded. As for my opinion, I wish the world could be more like the beauty that is written in Tolkien's epic. To celebrate a simple life, how grand that would be."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Acknowledging Tolkien's brilliance as a writer (he writes very, very well) and linguist (innovative) and accepting that a truly great imaginative mind wrote this book, I found _The Lord of the Rings_ to be a turgid trudge of a read. Thoroughly and utterly disappointing.It's interesting for the first 700 pages. Thereafter I couldn't wait for it to finally end.I completely lost interest in _The Return of the King_ -- the first two books of the trilogy were moderately interesting.A good cure for insomnia, makes a very good door-stop. I hope the movie is better than the book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I shall pretend that there are actually some people reading these reviews who have not already read LotR...First off, LotR is the defining work of fantasy fiction. I think EVERYONE publishing in the genre today owes some kind of debt to Tolkien, consciously or not. Basically, Tolkien is a world-builder and not a mere novelist. He had a very deliberate project of creating a new mythology and he succeeded admirably. The amount of originally unpublished (but now available) background material for this book is truly amazing and reveals the depth of Tolkien's project.As a writer, however, Tolkien has definite flaws. His style is somewhat antiquated (and British) but I, personally, do not see these as bad things. (IMHO, very little being published in the genre today has any literary merit.) His characters are rather flat and he has a very poor sense of the dramatic: the death of a major character is disposed of in a paragraph; the climactic battles cover only a few pages. (In this regard, the movies did a far superior job).The beauty of Tolkien, however, is that he's not a \\"professional\\" writer; he's not churning out formulaic novels that conform to the \\"conventional wisdom,\\" i.e., novels that are designed to sell and not to be good. Yes, he \\"tells\\" instead of \\"shows\\" but his narratives a gracefully crafted and, often, truly beautiful. True, any literary agent today would probably turn Tolkien away, but this is a sad commentary on the publishing business and the low standards of the reading public.I read Tolkien the same way I read Poe or Shakespeare: to appreciate the use of language in-and-of itself, as well as for the actual story-line. In his own way, I think Tolkien has a subtle brilliance. Even so, I'm sure that LotR is \\"boring\\" to some. I can see why they would think this, but, in the end, I think that says more about the standards (and intellectual capabilities?) of the reader than it does about J.R.R. Tolkien.With the possible (?) exception of the Bible, I think LotR is literally the most-loved book in the world. You owe it to yourself to give it a chance. To never read this book is to miss out on a true pleasure and a gift."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"After watching the first two movies I was enchanted to read the books and I wanted to finish them before &quot;Return of the King&quot; came out on the theatre. Well, I finished all the books and they were kind of a chore to finish. If you are big into scenery more than action then these books are for you. I probably wont read them again because of the extreme detail of clouds, mountains, underground, rivers and such. I'd rather get more of the character's feelings and emotions and it was just hard for me to get that with these books. But the story is excellent otherwise and there are plenty of fighting and treachery."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This edition is absolutely wonderful.

But, if you simply must have it then I say, go for it! Awesome bi-color metallic ring logo on the front and gold-trimmed pages. Also, inside both covers are fold-out maps. I absolutely love it!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Most execellent book, brought back memories of the first time I read the book Back in 1978"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I spent a lot of time reading reviews for different versions of these books before I bought them, I already knew I was going to purchase a set that had illustrations by Alan Lee, but i wanted to see what other people thought of this set first. I know some people reported having problems or issues with theirs, but i had no such problems with mine. After they shipped I discovered I lived in the same state as the warehouse apparently, so the books arrived less than 48 hours after i ordered them. Since they come in a sturdy hard case, and the case was wrapped in bubble wrap inside the box they were in perfect condition when they arrived. Not even a dented corner on the case. The books are heavy, but I wanted something that was going to last as I want my children to read these books someday and maybe pass them on to them at some point. The pages are glossy but I dont find them hard to read or that they have glare on them. I'm currently reading The Hobbit by the same publisher and its printed on the same paper and I'm not having any problems with it. I would definitely recommend these books for someone looking to buy a keepsake item, but they are also great for everyday reading and enjoying. And it goes without saying that Alan Lee's amazingly beautiful illustrations only enhance an already wonderful story."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is the most amazing copy of this book I have ever found. Fold outs, gold lined pages, leather bound. I am thrilled!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is a beautiful edition of Tolkien's classic fantasy. It includes two maps, has beautiful artwork, and is overall a striking book. An added bonus is a detailed history of the various editions of LOTR. Definitely worth the price!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I like this edition a lot. It is almost perfect but I think that the expedition ruined a bit the edges of the book. The other thing that isn't 5 stars is the way the maps are glued. You can seriously ruin them when first opening if you aren't extremely cautious.Everything else is perfect. There are notes at the beginning of the book explaining the evolution of LOTR and the many corrections made by JRR Tolkien to the past editions. I like the paper on which the book is written and the two-color style (black for normal text and red for elvish or other alphabets). The bound feels very good even if actually I don't think it is real leather. The book seems very robust and the golden border of the pages doesn't seem to wear off at all.I recommend this edition for any collector, if the two minuses don't bother you"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is the first edition of Lord of the Rings to contain many features that Tolkien had hoped for from the beginning: specifically it not only has the fold-out maps that were always part of the three volume hardcover editions, but the \\"fire letters\\" on the ring are printed in red ink and the color facsimiles of the leaves from the Book of Marzabul are included in the book, both for the first time. Numerous \\"deluxe\\" editions of the book have been printed over the last 30 years or so, with a variety of bells and whistles (I own five or six in that category), but none of them have fulfilled this simple and well-documented wish of the author.As for the quality control question: no the physical book isn't perfect; the craft of book making is not what it was 50 years ago. But though the list price may be $100, I haven't seen it for sale anywhere for much more than $50, which is about what you would probably pay for the three volume hardcover. I am delighted with it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"A single volume is more impressive; yet a little hard to wield. You may want to look up the reviews for the individual books (The Return of the King/the Two Towers/the Fellowship of the Ring.) Note one book or three that this is one story and not a trilogy. The work was artificially split for convenience. Also if you listen to a recorded version you can hear how to pronounce the names and places. Listening also allows time to digest the story as it progresses.I read several notes on the works and find that it is smarter to read the work first; then if you want to you can compare your view with the notes. You don't want to stop and say \\"Oh a shadow. What can that mean?\\" Also even thought J. R. R. Tolkien is quite explicit in the beginning that this is not an allegory or even a reference to events in the real world, some people try to equate the RING with the BOMB.There are several things that I found pleasing. One is that no one goes off and has any unrecorded adventures. This is each group especially in \\"The Two Towers\\" is completely tracked even though the events are parallel; Tolkien does not have to use flash backs to do so. I am also impressed with the fact that even though you see several references to good and evil, that every being in the story had a purpose and a destiny that was not strictly black and white. Gandalf reminds Frodo to spare Gollum as Bilbo did. At other times as in Bible stories evil intentions can bring about good situations. Well, enough philosophizing just read it and enjoy it on the story level. You may find that only drawback is that it ends too soon."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"What more can be said about this legendary work? It is truly the finest work in the history of the fantasy genre. Often imitated but never duplicated, Tolkien set the bar to an unattainable height for all who have followed in his footsteps. I first read these books as a young child and they have become an annual read in my adult life. There is something new and rewarding every time."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Lord of the Rings is the follow-up epic adventure to the Hobbit. The movies follow the book fairly well but there is so much more to it in the book.

My all time favorite book and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The quality appears to be excellent and it arrived in pristine condition. \\"Precious\\" shiny golden gilded pages with a nice ribbon place marker in an elegant and high quality slipcase.

One review in particular described it as unabridged, too. Why it's reviewed that way, I can hardly guess. When I received it, I found it to be a complete dramatization, not an \\"audiobook\\" at all. The dramatization is ok, I guess, but not great. I was expecting an audiobook, and got a dramatization - plain and simple. Very, very disappointed. I haven't had many bad experiences with Amazon, but I feel deceived."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"In many ways this is one of the foundational texts of the twentieth century. It's hard to imagine a world without Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and the hundreds of works that it influenced. For example there would be no Dark Tower Series by Stephen King or A Song of Ice and Fire by George R R Martin without Lord of the Rings. So rather than talk about how awesome and amazing this book is, I will talk about the one volume edition itself.This is a great purchase. It combines all three of the Lord of the Rings texts into a single volume at a reasonable price. Sometimes these massive paperbacks have a tendency to be a bit frail, however, this edition stood up well against my daily commuting through New York City. It survived lunches where I hunched over it with burritos and burgers. It endured a couple trips to bars where I read it over a few beers. This edition is durable.If you have the individually published books, I would still recommend picking this up. It is easy to flip back and forth between the sections. It also has an extensive appendix and index of the epic novel. Usually I tell people if they're hesitant to buy something like this it wait until they're sure, but for this I think it's worth the purchase."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is the version that JRR Tolkien wanted to publish. Although the corrections were colmpleted by his family,they did so according to his notes on earlier print versions. So not only do you get the most authoratative version of the novel, but you get a beautiful work of art with the high quality paper print, binding and guilding.You deserve this version of the Novel, Ignore the high price."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I do not have the edition it says I'm reviewing, what I have is a big floppy paperback with a picture of a silhouetted Nazgul from the movie on the cover, but there are so many editions I can't find mine, or else they don't sell it anymore. I just started reading it again. I had forgotten how good it is right from the start, and I figured it was about time I give it my 5 stars on Amazon, because it definitely deserves it. My dad used to read me these books when all I could understand was \\"there's a big scary spider!\\" and \\"they're going to throw a ring in a volcano!\\". Other little details stuck with me too, so now when I read the books it's like reading a dream I forgot a long time ago."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Lord of the Rings is an epic trilogy (and I try to not use the word \\"epic\\" lightly). It is well worth reading. There isn't a whole lot to say about it other than READ IT! I know there have been some complaints about different editions, so if you are concerned about the look and feel of the book, the binding, and whether it has maps or glossaries or anything like that, I recommend looking at it in a book store so you can pick your edition, then buying on Amazon. Looking at it in the book store first will help you know what you're getting, but you're almost sure to get a better deal on Amazon. It never hurts to price compare though. If you don't care about which edition and only care about the story itself, buy it and read it! It's an epic journey everyone should take. Yes, I'm aware I said \\"epic\\" more than once, haha. This trilogy deserves it :)"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I just received this version of the Lord of the Rings in the mail and spent the last 15 minutes going through it. First off the cover picture isn't the same. Mine is a picture of mountains i'm guess look like Misty Mountains instead of the picture that was advertised which is Minus Tirith. The cover seems solid and well made and the i like the size of the font and they way it's laid out. The paper itself seems a little cheap. It's kind of thin and reminds me of paper that you might find in a textbook. They probably chose this type of paper because the book is so big that they needed a thinner paper. It's not bad and i've owned books that have used horrible paper, but that aspect of the book could be better. The binding itself was kind of loose. That might be because of the shipping but it seems like the book is already slightly broken in. This next criticism is extremely nitpicky and is just my own opinion but the book has a odd smell. I don't know why but some books give off a very good smell that reminds me of quiet nights reading my book and listening to the rain outside. I think it's the glue but the glue used in this book gives off a bad smell. it's not so bad that the book becomes unreadable at all, it's just that if i was to deliberately smell this book the smell wouldn't be very pleasing. But i do understand that the smell of a book is extremely nitpicky. Other than the criticisms talked about above this book is a good book and i can't wait to read it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The paperback 50th anniversary one volume edition is worth the price.

Since I like to read the whole thing, and not just randomly re-read one third of it, it makes sense that it is all togehter. The book itself is fantastic.

I don't know how many would agree, but it was certainly my favorite book for years and years, and is the standard against which I measure all other fantasies. The novel, in three books (but really 6 parts) traces four hobbits, along with various other of the beings of Middle Earth, in their quest to destroy the evil one ring of power that the powerful and evil lord Sauron forged in earliest times, that will give Sauron domination over all living things. The ring had been lost for ages before the book begins. Sauron's power and life are bound up in the ring. As Sauron learns that the lost ring has been found, he tries to discover it, and also launches a war against men, elves, dwarves, and the earth itself. But the themes are age old themes about good and evil, power and humility, love of the earth, and love of others. It follows the good guys as they try to fight against treachery and darkness as they move the ring closer to the fiery cracks of doom in the mountain where it was forged--the only place it can be unmade--deep in the heart of enemy territory. It also follows members of the Fellowship of the Ring as they fight evil in the good territories.This particular version is handy, since it has all three books of the trilogy present. However the only downside is that the table of contents does not list the chapters of the separate books separately. It would be even better if it did that."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"WHAT?

Frodo is such a likeable fellow, and Sam a loyal companion. The trials these Hobbits go through are incredible. I almost thought Frodo would never see the Shire or Hobbiton again. A must read."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Why do people like these books so much? I admit, the plot is really good, but the names of places are so odd that I get them all confused. Also, a lot of the names are similar, so if you just scan over them and don't try to pronouce them, you have no idea what's happening.Normally this doesn't happen, but I actually think the movie is better than the books. It definatly has much more action in it than the books, and more emotion, too. It's like the only emotions the charactures have in the books are afraid, not afraid, glad to see each other again, and homesick. Despite of all this, the plot is interesting, and very well put together. The best book was probably The Fellowship of the Ring. I think the best characture was either Frodo, Gladriel, or Legolas. Gandalf was good, but a little too perfect. Of course Gladriel was almost perfect, too, but she's supposed to be; she's an Elf.Altogether, I wouldn't recomend this book to people who get bored easily, and to people who like to have a lot of emotion in books. Other than that, you should try to read them and see what you think."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I listened to this version (Mind's Eye) years ago when it was on tapes and immediately fell in love with Tolkien's world. Maybe the voice acting and effects aren't the best in the world, but it still immerses you in Middle Earth so you feel like you're there. It is also a much more complete version than any of the others I have heard. I like the fact that it includes the scenes with Old Man Willow, Tom Bombadil, the Barrow Downs, etc. Even some of the scenes which are included in other versions are much more detailed in the Mind's Eye production. For instance my brother tells me that his BBC version brushes quickly past Gandalf's battle with the Balrog, which I think is one of the epic encounters in the books and very vital to the story. The Mind's Eye version does it justice with a detailed description in gripping fashion.If you're looking for a beautiful *sounding* version of LotR, despite many missing scenes, go with the BBC version or better yet buy the DVDs of the new movies when they come out, but if you want a (nearly) complete version that lets you excersise your own imagination, get this one."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"...No matter what my lawyers say"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I don't believe Tolkien wrote this book, no man could.

Corrupting the wearer, it must be destroyed in the fires of Mt. Doom lest it be rediscovered by it's creator and used to conquer all of Middle-earth. Frodo-along with his trusty hobbit friends, the wizard Gandalf and a company of elves, dwarves and men from across the land, sets out on a quest to destroy the ring.

Everyone should read this book if they want their lives changed forever."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"A worthy production of a classic trilogy. No mention of the content is needed, as anyone looking to buy this should be well aware of the story already. There is a subtle, psychological fluidity that is offered by this edition, as the story is not quite as segmented in the reader's mind by having only one bound volume as opposed to three. There is alas, only one disadvantage: The book itself is so admirable that I find myself in constant paranoia of soiling it's pages with dirty fingers, or heaven forbid should a sneeze catch me at the wrong moment. The same with creating a crease along the binding as one lays it open. Furthermore, the large folded map in the back may be subject to tear if it is handled often. It's probably worth the [money] or so to pick up a set of cheap paperback editions to do the actual reading.You must forgive my paranoia, and probably many a book collector would say that I have only stated the obvious, and shouldn't even think of using this edition for reading purposes. Still, the reading of it is like good wine in a fancier bottle."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This may be the best book you will ever read. If you are a fan of fantasy, read it. If you aren't, read it anyway! Tolkien's masterpiece draws you into a world all its own, and once you enter Middle-Earth, you won't want to leave. You come into a world of Elves and Dwarves, Men, Hobbits, and Orcs, and their conflicts and struggles become your own. This work is so amazing and enchanting that you will finish it and want to read it all over again. And again. And again...you will never grow tired of this classic that will outlast the generations. I know I won't."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This book, although sometimes dull and full of details, is a chilling tale and worth reading. If you read this book, you will surely want to read the other two in the trilogy, so make time to. I would compare the genius of the novel to that of the Harry Potter series or The Chronicles of Narnia."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I don't want to say something about the content of the book here, because I think everybody knows it. I give my opinion only to the books printing.First it is only artificial leather bounded. Therefore the price is a little bit too high. 35 - 40$ US should have been enough for this issue. Otherwise the printing inside is ok and very good to read, because the letters are not too small and not as bad as some customers have written here. Also the book block is not glued slanting into the book and the map at the end is also ok.All in all 4 stars and not 5, because of the cover material and the high price."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"A thoroughly satisfying fantasy experience. A rich world, noble characters, and detailed plot make for an engrossing, rewarding read."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The best work since Homer bar none."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"These are beautiful books. Very attractive ! Easy to handle. The bindings are fine, not like written in previous reviews(don't believe them), & they stand up to use. I would and have bought this set to use and treasure !"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"We recently built very nice maple bookshelves for our living-room and I just couldn't bring myself to put my 20+ year old paper-back copies of The Lord of Rings on the new shelves, so I purchsed this handsom edition along with a copy of the Hobbit, both in artificial leather. After receiving them, I decided I couldn't just put them on the self like some show trinkets and started to read them (for the ninth time). Overall, this is a great edition. The paper feels good and it's great having all six books in one volume. There were some inking errors but they were minor. I also found that the size of the volume definitely makes it a book to be enjoyed at home (in a living-room with new book shelves and a warm fire is perfect); I have to admit, whenever I wanted to read outside of the house, I took my old paerbacks with the torn covers - they're simply more portable. For all Tolkien fans (and there are now more than ever) who want an edition worth keeping for years, this is it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"GREAT the best trilogy ever"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Although this review is for the leatherette edition, I have rated the book as a Tolkien novel.I owned a John Howe illustrated 3-1 version of LOTR about 5-6 years ago when I first read a newspaper article about the book. Between Alan Lee and John Howe, I prefer the latter's depictions of Middle Earth and its characters. Howe's illustrations are more detailed and they never fail to ignite some fantasy daydreaming wherelse Lee's illustrations (after being so familiar with Howe) just seem a mite childish.And because I loved my paperback one-volume John Howe-illustrated version, it gradually (as all paperbacks go) fell apart after 6 years of passing around and continuous readings. I decided to look for a new edition (preferably a hardbound one-volume edition with Howe's illustrations but there is apparently none in the US market, though UK seems to have some.)Before I elaborate on the leatherette edition that I now own, let me tell you about my experience with LOTR. Like I said, I first read of this book in a newspaper article and was curious as to whether the quote about the english literary population having been divided between those who have read it and those who have not, held up.Admittedly I did not jump with awe at the first few attempts of reading LOTR. It took me 1 1/2 years before I actually restarted again after a few tries to get through the first few chapters. This time I attacked it, I read it properly, looking at the appendices, and maps. And after awhile, the story just kept getting better and I was hooked. It was just incredible, I couldn't put down the book. I went through a reading marathon. I slept, ate and dreamnt the book for days and when it came to an end, I was actually disappointed. Really disappointed that it has come to an end.The movie to me was great because it helped visualized some of the scenes and plot that were lost to me when I was reading the book. If any, it helped make LOTR more meaningful and understandable. And if it were Jackson's intention to complement the book and not rival it, that the movie is a ranging success.As for the leatherette edition, I cannot fathom what all the negative reviews about its terrible terrible quality is about. The book is very nicely bound, the paper quality is indisputable and the text neatly aligned to the sides as it should be. The map at the back is very nice and clear. The only gripe I have is that the text colour (both red and black) tend to vary from pages to pages and I had only noticed this because I was reading the reviews and everyone kept complaining about its shortcomings. Otherwise, I did not find any badly-printed characters on its own, just whole pages of text with varying colours, some lighter or darker than others.I'd like to think it gives the book a little character and rawness which goes with the creamish paper and the imperfection of most ancient books.All in all, I am happy with what I have bought."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Never has there been a universe in fantasy so intricately detailed from languages to races to every aspect of the shire. It reads like a legand or a history, so character development is not the point of the book. The idea to to create the non-existant English mythology. And he has managed. This book will always be a legand. It is wordy, at times slow, and at times the battles can get annoying, but it is definately worth a read."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"this book set is great, i've read it 5 times! if you want a great book to read, and an even better gift to give, buy this set! Tolkien tajes such depth in it, it's almost like you're living the series yourself! Tolkien has a full appendix telling you anything you don't understand on middle earth, where it all yakes place. this is a great book set!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Last year, before the Lord of the Rings came out in theaters, I read the book. I felt that I wanted to the movie so I should the book first so I had my vision of the book in my mind and not the vision of movie as I read the book. Well everything from there is history, I finished reading the Lord of the Rings (Tolkien ment for it to be considered as one book spilt into three parts- The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and the Return of the King) and I got hooked from there.This book is definitely not a children's book, it is will be too hard for them to comprehend and plus they will not enjoy the full effect of reading the book as a child. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. It is a book for the ages and a book that you can fall in love with and read over and over again, because trust you will see things you might have missed the first run through. Again I recommend that anyone who has the chance read the Lord of the Rings, a masterpiece by one of the greatest writers of our time, J.R.R. Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Tolkien. There are so many words that can describe a man like him. Awesome author of the greatest series in the world.

This book is great i would not change a thing!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is a classic masterpiece which just gets better with each read!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"One of the finest books ever written and perhaps the finest book written in the 20th century, The Lord of the Rings is a masterpiece from the mind of JRR Tolkien. It is the father of all fantasy for anything that came after inevitably was greatly influenced by Tolkien.It is a story of a Ring that could give its maker Sauron the power to rule the world. It has been lost however for thousands of years. Eventually it is found and winds up in hands of Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit, who then gives it to Frodo Baggins. Gandalf the Grey wizard discovers what this little ring actually is and tells Frodo he must leave his home with it to a keep it away from the enemy. This starts an epic journey with elves, dwarfs, men, wizards, orcs, and ring wraiths that is scary, wondrous, and truly adventurous. It is eventually determined that the ring must be destroyed in Mt Doom where it was created. However this is located in Mordor the land of the Dark Lord Sauron. The peril deepens with every step of the journey resulting in classic confrontations, epic battles, and true selfless heroics.The story is broken into three books, The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers and The Return of the King. The themes range from power corrupts, unwavering friendship, hope when there is no hope, and the sadness when a beloved world evolves from what you love. It is a wondrous yet bittersweet tale that captures you from the beginning and makes you long for it again when you finish.Allen Lee is one of the most respected artists whose primary focus is the works of Tolkien. Many of his images are now cannon of the way things in the book should look like. So much so that he did much of the design work for the Peter Jackson movie which I also highly recomend.I suppose Ian McKellen who played Gandalf in the movie said it best,\\"It is a fantasy, a fairytale. It never happened, except somewhere in our hearts.\\""},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"When I was a teenager, I bought the Lord of the Rings boxed set -- which included The Hobbit -- and attempted to read the whole Tolkien saga over the summer. My intentions were good, but both the scope of the quest and the tiny type on the standard sized paperback defeated me. I did not so much \\"read\\" The Lord of the Rings as \\"skimmed\\" through it. Even though I got the gist of Frodo's quest to destroy the One Ring and was astounded by the narrative of the War of the Ring, I could never say with a straight face that I had read The Lord of the Rings completely.That is, until I found this one-volume edition in a trade paperback format. Even though I still had to fight off the temptation to skip through the various poems, songs and other embellishments Tolkien added to the basic \\"Gandalf-enlists-the-reluctant-but-brave-Hobbit-to-go-on-a-great-Quest\\" plot, at least with a more eye-friendly page/typeface size I could read The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King in their entirety and in a single book (which, as I found out last year, was Tolkien's intent; it was his British publisher who, for business reasons, divided the gigantic novel in three).Considering the cost of books these days, this one-volume edition is quite a bargain!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I've recently received this unabridged collection and I must say that it is fantastic! Rob Inglis is absolutely fantastic. He does all the voices, the music is great, and of course the story is fantastic! A real must-buy for readers who haven't the time to read!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Tolkien was a genius, there's no two bits about that. What he did with this work is extraordinary in that it forever defined the fantasy genre. Who can mention wizards without having an old man with a long beard and pointy hat come to mind? The same could be said for Dwarves, Elves, and Orcs--when you mention the name, you picture them in your head the way Tolkien defined them. This is how you can say he was revolutionary; his creatures, races, and ideas have been used over and over again since these books first made their appearance.Every genre has it's pioneer, the one who established the boundaries to be used for generations after. In the fantasy genre, this pioneer was J.R.R. Tolkien.As for the books, they are set in middle-earth, a world so elaborate and intriguing that you would never be able to explore it all, though you have a great desire to. The characters are many, and they are all masterfully developed, each having his role in this classic depiction of good versus evil. While some aspects of the reading (poems, extensive detail, etc) are a little heavy for children, this is a timeless story, infinitely intriguing. The one flaw of the book is that you will not be able to put it down, and it will quite possibly disrupt every other aspect of your life until you finish it.This is a classic which will endure the strains of time and entertain for generations to come."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I think you'll love it. Paper quality is high, and the layout comes elegant and clean. Also the hardcover quality is pretty good. I was afraid because of other reviews talking about poor (fading) printing, but, at least in my copy, it is definitely not true, the printing is perfect throughout the book.Just feeling lack of a bookmark, it would have been a great touch, unfortunately missing. And about the story... you know indeed. :)"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"There are plenty of reviews on this site that can tell you what a great book the Lord of the Rings is -- it really is very enjoyable tale and worth multiple reads, despite its length. Although you can certainly read the story in other, cheaper editions, this one is worth having for several reasons:1) The novel is in one volume as Tolkien intended, rather than three -- makes it easier to jump around among favorite scenes.2) The volume is well constructed, with good quality paper and binding; it should hold up well for multiple reads.3) Most importantly, the 50 illustrations by Alan Lee nicely capture Tolkien's vision in the Ring, including the landscapes of Middle Earth, its creatures, and its structures. Whereas some illustrators have made the LOTR (and more so the Hobbit) look like cartoons, Alan Lee's illustrations have a solid reality to them. It is interesting to note that Lee was one of the artists whose work was incorporated into the recent Peter Jackson film(s) -- I thought that the \\"Fellowship\\" movie was visually stunning, and some of the imagery can be traced back to these illustrations created in the early 1990s for the 100th anniversery of Tolkien's birth.... Bottom line is that this is a great edition to have if you want a nicely bound, creatively illustrated copy of LOTR."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Having read an early paperback version of 'The Lord of the Rings' as a kid in the '60's, I had no need to reassess my perception of this story as being one of the most wondrous, magical, expansive, and excellently-written tales ever told. Imagine my dismay, then, at finding that the hardcover editions I had finally acquired were the result of poor-quality printing that cannot be ignored. Individual pages display various levels of contrasting black print. Often the print bleeds on the paper, blurring many of the place-names on the otherwise-perfect maps. The pages resemble those made on a copy machine that's running out of ink. If I had it to do over again, I'd have purchased paperback editions until I had a chance to go shopping at a walk-in store in order to peruse and identify a finer hard copy version."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Though I completely adored THE HOBBIT as a child, I never got deep enough into THE LORD OF THE RINGS to appreciate what Tolkien was really doing. Twenty years of setting it aside, I spent the end of this past summer slowly and patiently enjoying every minute of Tolkien's grand and masterful tale of Middle-earth.The hobbit Frodo has a simple task fraught with the most terrible of dangers--journey to the Crack of Doom to destroy the One Ring so that the evil lord Sauron cannot use it to subjugate the land and all its inhabitants. The trouble is that the Crack of Doom is in Sauron's own country, and his Eye sees almost everything. Advised by the wizard Gandalf and accompanied by three fellow hobbits, two men, a dwarf and an elf, Frodo's journey is the main thrust of the tale. Meanwhile, preparations for the decisive war are being made on both sides of the mountains that border Mordor, the land of Sauron.Tolkien's style is straightforward and measured--the narrator never gets excited. Tolkien was a Classics professor so it should be no surprise that Frodo's journey is told with several Homeric devices, notably the repeated descriptions of the weather (reminded me of &quot;dawn's rosy fingers&quot; reappearing every day in THE ODYSSEY) and the state of the characters' stomachs. Also like Homer, Tolkien allows his characters to tell their own stories around the fire. To read THE LORD OF THE RINGS well perhaps also takes the skills of a good listener.The length of THE LORD OF THE RINGS forces well-intended readers afflicted with the modern short attention span into a calmer, more relaxed perspective. While Frodo and his dear friend Sam may run till they drop, while Gandalf's horse Shadowfax may outpace all other animals that run, Tolkien never rushes. This deliberate pacing is a prime reason why his epic is so rich and rewarding.THE LORD OF RINGS gives us much to think about on the theme of what any one of us is really capable of. It deals with honor, endurance, treachery and sacrifice like few other stories of the twentieth century. Sit back, relax, and be transported to Middle-earth."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I can remember how impressed with myself I was for reading the whole work in the late sixties. Now when I go back to this trilogy I'm amazed at what a model of compact efficiency it is! (If only Robert Jordan could get to the point this quickly). Some groundbreaking works don't age well; their ideas are expanded and improved by those who come after. But Tolkein is a scholar, a thinker, and a gifted writer, and no one who's copme along since can handle this kind of material as well as he did. The writing is beautifully crafted, the characters vivid, and the tale built on a solid foundation of mythic story-telling. You read golden age SF so that you can understand the roots of what came later, but you read the Lord of the Rings because it's just that good. A timeless classic, this, so good that I'll take the time to write this review even though it will probably go unread and unclicked simply because this work DESERVES to have a boat-load of glowing reviews attached."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"There are two audio dramatizations of the Tolkien classic -- this one and the one done by The Mind's Eye. This one is the better of the two IMO. Done in thirteen parts on 13 cassettes (each cassette roughly 45 minutes to an hour long), this British production is well produced!The voice actors were well picked and do an excellent job of bringing characters like Gandalf, Frodo, Stider, Sam, etc. to life! One of the nice things is that plenty of voice actors were hired and if one did more than one voice, it was not noticable.Those who know TOTR very well will miss parts like the entire Tom Bombadil (sp) story as well as some other minor cuts. However the edits are done in such a way that one who's never read LOTR will not know something was missing!I HIGHLY recomend this audio collection not only for long road trips, but for home or work.

You can't go wrong buying this one!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I am a 13 year old male who likes to read.

There you will learn the story of Hobbits and how the One Ring came into their possession. This particular review is for an illustrated version that is all three books in one. The art is great, but including the Appendix (A-F) and the Index, this book has over 1193 pages. At times you feel as though you're getting nowhere. I personally recommend a three book set. But which ever one you choose, you'll love it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is a good audio dramatization of LOTR but not the best. The production value is not as good and the voice actors are not as convincing in their characters. Also, many voice actors have to perform other character roles which can be confusing to the uninitiated. The Tom Bombadil (sp) story is picked up in this 24-part (12 hour) audio tale but many minor details are sacrificed. This leads to unfortunate references by characters to events which are skipped when the actually happened. All in all not a bad thing (I own it and still listen to it) but the other LOTR audio (done by the BBC I think) is better done."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This audio version of the long beloved masterpiece is impressive in its inclusion of the entirety of the original three books. Scenes that all of the movies and all of the other audio versions have left out for whatever reasons are presented here at last, including the Old Forest and Tom Bombadil, and the Barrow Downs scenes. Even in the face of this laudable boldness I am compelled to say I hated it from beginning to end. The production sounds as though a bunch of somnambulant old men with no acting skills whatsoever were dragged into a closet filled with expensive digital recording equipment and forced to read a script which they have never seen before. It appears that no attempt was made at casting or direction in spite of the obvious effort to include nearly the whole of the three books.I highly recommend anybody considering the purchase of an audio dramatization of TLOTR to consider the BBC Radio version also available at this site, in spite of a few sadly missing scenes the production is much better."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"One may be tempeted to question the purpose of reading these books in light of the fact that Peter Jackson has just recently graced the world with his towering exploration of them in visual format. The answer to those who would so question is what I have always said, even before the films were made. This book is, I believe, unsurpassed by any other work in human history aside from the Bible. It is impossible to really do the work credit with any sort of brevity, however, for the sake of the reader's patience I will comment on what I believe to be the most important points.Firstly, if it is of any interest to anyone, in a world full of writers who become immensely popular despite very poor writing, here is a genius. Tolkien's masterpiece is written in somewhat antiquated language, which tends to add to it's mistique and prowess rather than to distract the reader. With a mixture of glowing description, intelligently crafted dialogue, and a combination of genres from narrative, to poetry, to prophecy, The Lord of the Rings will not leave you bored if you are intelligent enough to appreciate the style. When I first read the book I found the descriptions to be somewhat tedious, cutting off the story as they did (I was 15), however, having now read the books four times I have an appetite for good writing, not just an urge to find out what happens next. The dialogue can be rather long as well, as in the chapter, \\"The Council of Elrond,\\" where upwards of 20 characters speak, the majority of whom you have heard little or nothing about. However, I have come to enjoy that chapter much more as I have grown older because of its hinting at a much greater world than the one we are exposed to.Secondly, the tale is captivating. It is a story of increasing intensity as the reader progresses and he is drawn in so easily and so fully that he may come out of it half believing that this quest actually happened. You feel Sam's joy and being sent with Frodo; you feel the Hobbit's terror at the Barrow Downs; your hurts are healed with the Fellowship at Lothlorien; you are captivated by the mustering of the Rohirrim; you are petrified by Shelob; you are laughing at Merry and Pippin the whole way. The genius of Tolkien creates a complete empathy on the part of the reader for the characters. I would be interested to know how many other people are actually in tears at any point in the reading of this book. I am at several, I will admit.Lastly, and I believe, most importantly, it is necessary to uncover some of the timeless thematic elements of this masterpiece. Books like, Finding God in the Lord of the Rings, have failed to do this book justice in their exploration of such themes, unfortunately. I do not wish to comment on all such themes b/c to do so would take far too long. However, I will make bold to say that I believe the overarching theme of the book to be self-sacrifice. Ultimately, self-sacrifice amounts to love, as far as I can see it, b/c it is a giving of one's self in the interest of others w/o expecting any good for one's self to come out of it. Just think, Frodo had no hope of ever making it back from Mordor, but it didn't matter. He had a task to complete for the saving of the rest of the world. Sam, Merry and Pippin went with Frodo, having no idea what they were going into, and not caring. It did not matter to them; all that mattered was that they could give of themselves to him. And finally, when Aragorn, Gandalf and Prince Imrahil marched with their armies to the black gates and had no hope whatsoever of victory, it was only with the hope that they might provide a lengthy enough distraction to enable two small Hobbits to make it to the Cracks of Doom without being discovered by the Enemy. I wish to comment on one other point before being finished b/c I believe that to those of the Christian Faith it should be encouraging. When Sam and Frodo are going with Gollum through Ithilien they come to the Cross-Roads and there is a statue of a king seated, however his head has been thrown down and there is a big ugly eye, the symbol of Sauron, where his head should be. As they walk there is suddenly a beam of light where the sun manages to search through the darkness, that blazes out upon the head of the king which is lying by the road. A vine of flowers has grown around his head and Sam says, \\"Look! The King has got a crown again.\\" Such hope have we as well.I would make a passing remark about this edition. Though the size may make it somewhat difficult to read it lays open nicely so reading it in bed is quite nice if one likes to lay on one's stomach to read. The illustrations are very true to Tolkien's own vision as can be seen in, \\"Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator.\\""},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"No need to review the story here. If you're willing to spend this amount of money on the book you are most likely familiar with the story. Over the years I've obtained several hardback and paperback copies of this story. While I've used the paperbacks for reading and not cared if they suffered damage I do get upset when the hardbacks end up falling apart. You know the type of hardback book I mean. The pages are loosely glued to the spine and sit uneven. When you read the book many of the pages become loose and fall out. The spine becomes cracked or split even though you do nothing more than open and shut the cover. Well if you want a nice hardback edition of the entire LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy you will want to purchase this book.I was impressed with the leather cover and the gilded pages. The price here at Amazon.com is at least 30% cheaper than anywhere else I've checked. I have a copy of the 50th anniversary hardback edition of THE HOBBIT and it is no where near as nice as this edition. I was surprised to find so many reviewers, here at Amazon.com, that found faults with this edition. I'm sure they may be right but I'm pretty sure some of them are nitpicking. If you can find a better edition out there then by all means buy it. If you're not that big a fan of THE LORD OF THE RINGS than there are plenty of cheaper editions to choose from. However, if you're a real fan and want a nice hardback edition that will stay with you a lifetime than this is the edition for you. My only problem is that I probably won't be able to read it for another decade. I'd love to leave it on the table next to my armchair but I can't. With a kitten that scratches everything it can find and kids that turn anything into a drink coaster, I think I'll wait until the kids are grown and the cat is old to leave this book out and read it. When I do read this edition I'm sure I'll be glad I purchased this edition when I had the chance. After all, how often does a 50th anniversary edition come along?"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"There are no sound effects. Yes, Rob Inglis does alter his voice for different characters. And he even sings the songs. (I do wonder where he got the melodies. &quot;The Road Goes Ever On&quot;? Strange that it isn't in print. . .) But there are no sound effects. Perhaps that review refers to the BBC or other dramatization?"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I already own an edition of The Lord of the Rings, but when this came out I knew I had to get it. I am a graphic designer and this is by far the most beautiful book I have laid eyes on! The type and layout are just perfect. A great looking book for one of the best stories I've ever read!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I'm not gonna write about the content of the story as I don't need to. However, the quality control is pretty sad. The first book I got was dented in one corner with the gold binding squished in. Other corners of the book weren't that perfect either. The book was media mailed to me in a mangled cardboard box with no padding whatsoever. It appeared as if the box was thrown around and the book is heavy! It was *really* annoying to see the crushed leather corner, so I returned it.The 2nd book was packaged must better, but not that great though. They cardboarded one face of the book and shrink wrapped it. Amazon is great in this sense as they picked up the damaged book and sent me the 2nd one via UPS 2nd day air. However, this edition is flawed in ways that are perhaps worse than the first one. The binding is glued wrong so the first few pages are wrinkled in the middle part of the binding. And the bottom pages aren't cut straight. It is noticeable by eye when reading and especially if you close the book and look at the gold edge. And yes, the text is centered way too high. At least this copy seems to have the text aligned straight!In any note, i think I will keep this book as it's a hassle to return and, chances are, I might end up getting a book that's even worse! At least this copy looks marvelous in the slip case as opposed to the dented original."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I read The Lord of the Rings at the age of eleven. (I'm fourteen now.) I'm the only kid I know who a) read it before seeing the movies and b) read it without my parents making me. That said, I love the movies -- I think the third is my favorite film ever -- and they come quite close to the book. But it is still second-rate...everything is, compared to this masterpiece.Firstly, it's not a boring tale told in a Beowulf-esque way, as some people think; and if you think this you should probably wait awhile to read it, when your tastes are more refined. It's a story of the tiniest little evil -- the Ring -- having the power to destroy the world, and the tiniest little person -- a hobbit -- having the power to save it. It's the story of unconditional friendships, no matter what. And it's the story of someone giving up everything, anything and all, only to find once he's done that his age is past, the world has moved on, and his own home doesn't recognize him for the hero he is. They have moved on, and he has to leave, because some things can't be cured by time.It's not a kids' book, and I don't say this to demean kids' books, since I love them. But it's heavy, far heavier than the fun and cheerful The Hobbit. It's powerful and sad and painful, and if the last chapter doesn't make you tear up you need to visit a therapist. It has joy and sorrow side by side, tragedy and loss, excitement and heroics, sadness and pain. It's life, pure and simple, in fantasy form, where hardly anything's black and white and things are always in gray, and sometimes you can't understand what's right or wrong.Sam is my favorite character, mainly because I still aspire to be that kind of ever-giving, expecting-nothing kind of friend who's always there to help, even when the help's unwanted. I love the end of the Fellowship of the Ring, where Sam pretty much forces Frodo to take him with him to Mordor:\\"Safely!\\" said Sam. \\"All alone and without me to help you? I couldn't have a borne it, it'd have been the death of me.\\"\\"It would have been the death of you to come with me, Sam,\\" said Frodo, \\"and I could not have borne that.\\"\\"Not as certain as being left behind,\\" said Sam.\\"But I am going to Mordor.\\"\\"I know that well enough, Mr. Frodo. Of course you are. And I'm coming with you.\\"I'm a self-proclaimed fantasy nut, and enjoy original fantasy when I find it, but never have I met the equal of The Lord of the Rings. It's an incredible journey through a world that just might exist, somewhere past reality and into dreamlike imagination; it's characters you truly care about and who care about each other; it's a fantasy story that mirrors incredibly true sacrifices, joys, and tragedies of real life.Read it. You'll thank yourself.Rating: Masterpiece"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is an exquisite book to own and to read, even to touch. It has a beautiful slate grey leather cover, beautiful binding, smooth off-white pages and the type set is well printed and a very easy size to read. The color images of the leaves from \\"the book of marzarbul\\" give you the sense that this book was translated from texts that are from thousands of years ago. The gold edge on the pages are great and you have to love ribbon markers in any book. Dont hesitate, just buy it! This is a great book to cherish in quiet moments while you live out all the adventure and poetry of Tolkien's illusion of anitquity. Not enough stars for this one!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Item arrived as described in shrink wrap. Brand new book. Great collection for anyone interested in an excellent hard-back edition of LotR. It is modeled after the 1974 collector's edition but with upgrades. Slip case is very cool. I found small \\"smudges\\" on random pages (reason for 4 stars instead of 5) but these are obviously a production accident and nothing to do with Amazon or the shipping. Overall I am very pleased.

The leather is great, the font is not too big or too small. If you are a fan it's a must have. Just be sure to buy the Hardcover, it makes a world of difference. I got it as a birthday gift, and I loved it, just to smell it and know I have an anniversary edition is awesome. One more thing, and a very important one, the price of this book on a bookstore is at least 3 times more than the amazon price, so you are getting a bargain."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is the most beautiful book on my bookshelf, right next to \\"The Hobbit\\" (collector's edition of course). It contains the entire trilogy (The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and the Return of the King), so you can imagine it's a fairly heavy book. This is how Tolkein wanted his book to be from the very beginning. He never wanted his story to be split up into 3 separate novels. He wanted it to be thought of as one story, so this is the edition he dreamed of having. And what a beautiful version it is! I love the guild pages, the leather, the cover design, the ribbon used to keep your place, etc.Whenever I read this book I feel as if I am reading a classic, which I am of course, but the book enhances that feeling. I love the cardboard cover they give you. It is far better than dust jackets like many other books, such as the Harry Potter series or any other hard cover book really that provides a paper dust jacket, which does nothing beneficial at all if you ask me. It just gets in the way. That's why I love the cardboard cover instead.Overall, I highly recommend this to any LOTR fan! Even if you don't plan to actually read it (though I don't know why you wouldn't want to ... it's an excellent book even if you did watch the movies first) just the fact that you own a book as beautiful as this is quite satisfying."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Beautifully maintained collectors book!

The paper for text is bright white uncoated stock with minimal bleed-through. The Illustrations are full-page in color on coated stock and very nicely done: Alan Lee's delicate colors look just right.The text is a disappointment. The old-style typeface has been poorly handled; letters are thick, muddy, and poorly aligned. The book says it was \\"printed and bound in Thailand for Imago\\". It looks to me like it was photocopied for Imago. It's not terrible, mind you; no filled-in counters on e's and d's, and a reasonable size, even for my old eyes, so you'll be able to read it just fine. But it's not what a book this important and expensive and language-centered should be.Oddly, the companion volume of The Hobbit, is beyond reproach. The text is razor-sharp and laser-straight. It was printed in Hong Kong, for whatever that's worth. It's all on coated, stock, too."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Back in the late 1970's, in an era when radio drama was disappearing from public radio, the American prodcution of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit&quot; were created with a full cast of voice actors along with music and sound effects. Reminiscent of the radio dramas of the 1940's and 50's, these productions were usually aired on Sunday afternoons, when a family could listen and enjoy the week's story. Released on Jabberwocky Audio on cassette tapes, I remember the Christmas when I received the entire collection of Jabberwocky's stories on tape. From &quot;The Hobbit&quot; to &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; to &quot;The Red Badge of Courage,&quot; all were classic tales. They even re-released on cassette some of the original radio productions, such as &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; and &quot;The Gift of the Magi.&quot; These stories were designed to get the listener interested and promote reading the books the productions were based on. They were not designed for an adult audience, but rather for children and families to share. Wonderfully edited and masterfully performed, many modern audiences find these old productions a little silly or even perhaps dated, but play it for a child, and they will listen in rapture, just as I did 25 years ago when they were new. Of all my collection of the Jabberwocky tapes, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; are the only ones that I have trouble playing today, because they have been played so many times over the years that they are worn out. We would play them in the car on road trips, I would play them in my room while putting together a puzzle, and I played them for my friends, who enjoyed them as much as I did. I am delighted to have it on CD to listen to over and over again. At seven years of age, I had not yet read the books when I first listened to the tapes. But the tapes were perfect for a small girl just getting interested in reading. If only all the rest of the old radio dramas were also on CD! I would buy them all. It was unfortunate to come to this website and see the poor reviews written by people who have no understanding of the history of the production or what demographic it was originally intended for. I look forward to the day when I can play these CD's for my own children and see the wonder and delight in their faces when they hear the same stories that I grew up with."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is usually found in a single volume, or in three volumes: 1) &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, 2) &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, and 3) &quot;The Return of the King&quot;. My recommended reading age is 13+ years old, and I recommend reading &quot;The Hobbit&quot; first.When I was 15 years old in high school, I had to read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; for an English class. After reading that book, the teacher then let us borrow &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Before I had started &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, I had bought my own set of books. After I had read both books, I actually liked &quot;The Hobbit&quot; better than &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; at first - because the &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was brighter: a fun, grand adventure with more humor, whereas &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; was darker: a serious, grim life and death struggle for world survival. But by the time I was about 16, the historical significance of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; began to appeal more to me. This is especially true if you read Appendices A and B of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and also read the &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;. You begin to understand the rich history of Tolkien's Middle-Earth/ Beleriand creation. How the &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; brings out the significant events of the First and Second Ages, while the events in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; are the culmination of the Third Age...each Age lasting thousands of years and ending with an immensely significant event.It was 25 years before I read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; again, but Bilbo, Frodo, Sam, Gandalf, Aragorn, Galadriel, Legolas, Gimli, and many more had become household names! I had matured over those years, and my tastes changed. I was no longer a big fantasy/science-fiction reader: instead I was reading military history. I didn't expect to still love &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; the way I did as a teenager. I was happily wrong! This is still an exciting book, but I discovered what I really love...it is allegory-type stories. J. R. R. Tolkien himself has said that &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is not allegory, because he hated allegory where he felt the author is dictating to the reader what is in their story...and that any other interpretation is incorrect. Tolkien wanted a reader to apply their own experiences and tastes to influence what they were reading. OK, but in real history one can still get allegory if their own experiences and tastes allow it. How many can learn about World War II and not apply the basic allegorical interpretation that good triumphs over evil? I've heard of, and can understand, several allegorical interpretations of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Frodo is like Jesus Christ: bearing the greatest of burdens for world salvation while being tempted to stray from his purpose, and the weight of the ring is similar to Christ's cross . The One Ring is like the atomic bomb: the ultimate weapon that corrupts whoever uses it, despite even good intentions, into a power-hungry creature of evil. There's an ecological message with the Ents trying to protect trees; and also the natural beauty of various places throughout Middle-Earth, while evil beings try to destroy it all (including the use of mechanical and polluting progress). I also get out of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; a sense of a military mission: that Frodo &amp; Sam are behind enemy lines on a mission that could end a war, and that Frodo realizes that getting back home or even staying alive doesn't matter - just completion of the mission...that's also sacrifice, perseverance, &amp; camaraderie so prevalent in the military history I've read. There's prejudice with years of animosity between elves and dwarves, and how small, kind gestures can begin to erase all those blighted years...also, how people or races can put aside differences to solve a common problem. There's the recognition of the small, common people (citizen soldiers) that perform the greatest, toughest, and most necessary duty in any war. There's world peace in peril and that something needs to be done before it's too late. There's avoiding the easier way out, and facing one's problems and seeing them through to a conclusion despite severe hardships.I feel that Tolkien saw a little bit of himself in many of the good races of his world. The hobbits are like Tolkien because they love food, company, and talking about family. The ents are like Tolkien because of their unbounded love of trees. Gandalf the wizard is like Tolkien because of his exceptional intelligence and purpose of guiding others along the right path. Some men are like Tolkien because of their inner strength and gallantry, while other men show weakness by succumbing to evil...very realistic. But I believe he saw the beauty and enchantment of the elves in his wife, and why he loved both most dearly: that's why on their gravestone Luthien appears after his wife's name, and Beren appears after his name. The dwarves don't seem to resemble Tolkien, but they are present in much folklore, which is linked to his personal love of medieval languages.&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is a masterpiece in my opinion, and it's size (over 1000 pages in any printed format) is pretty daunting, but give it a shot! It'll be time well spent. And get ready for adventure, terror, excitement, love, treachery, devotion, monumental historic events, unforgettable battles, military strategy, exotic languages &amp; culture, etc. See what you get out of the book! I think most people will enjoy it and/or be moved by it. And who knows, maybe it'll become your favorite book too!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"....under the publisher;s constraints, in the land of Houghton-Mifflin, where the profits lie.Most people think this superb book, which is popularly abbreviated LOTR, pronounced &quot;Loater&quot;, is pretty darn good, a Jungian archetype in its own right. Some people criticize the slow development, and the various included songs and poetry as being archaic, and the journey through the marshes as being depressing, but they miss part of the point - this is literature influenced and honoring older styles. The MTV generation should consider learning to slow down and savour things. I cannot contribute anything particularly original to a review of this book as a literary work.However - on the edition: One caution: The boxed red-leather bound collector's edition, (echoing the fictional &quot;Red Book of Westmarch&quot;, the mythical preserved source of the story) has one jarring flaw. It lacks the much enlarged, detailed map, showing Gondor, Rohan, and western Mordor, normally found in the third volume (The Return of the King, ROTK) in the individual-volume editions. That map greatly aids readers in following of the events of ROTK, and it is worth one's while to have a regular hardback or paperback edition handy in order to have access to this map."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Put it simply - this is the seminal motherlode of modern fantasy.

It has everything a reader could want: action, adventure, the ongoing battle of good and evil. It contains your greatest fears, such as Ringwraiths, which are skeletal beings with piercing eyes and horrible powers. It also contains one of a human's greatest desires: power. Power contained inside a little Ring. The story focuses on a young Hobbit named Frodo Baggins. It is his job to destroy the Ring. Along with him are more Hobbits, a wizard named Gandalf, a future king, a prince of Gondor, an elf, and a dwarf, thus giving the first book its name, The Fellowship of the Ring.In these books, you will find a perilous journey, a war for the Ring, and a little creature with luminous eyes named Gollum.

If not, read them anyway!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"What more could possibly be said about Tolkien's, &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;? It is the best fantasy I have ever read!! Alan Lee's illustrations also enhance this book tremendously. Sadly, the book has an extremely poor binding and one missing page. I specifically refer to the hardcover November 1991 version. The book is published by Houghton Mifflin Company in New York, and is printed and bound by Rotolito Lombarda in Italy. Instead of binding the book as three separate books, it is bound as one large &amp; bulky book (It weighs in like a dictionary at approximately 4 lbs). Additionally, its size makes it very inconvenient to read or take outside your home. In my hands, after one reading &amp; some very gentle handling, the book is already falling apart. It's too bad because the book is definitely one you would want to read over and over again."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is the One, true fantasy that started it all.

I would have bought this at any price."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"In my line of work, I have to drive a lot from school to school with trips taking anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour and a half. These Nine Hours of adventure, hobbits, men, dwarves, elves and Tom Bombadil, (yes, Tom Bombadil!) is a great way to pass the time. Unlike the Unabridged Reading where the casual listener can get bogged down in the misings of the reader (a production which should be given justice in a situation where you can give it your full attention), this exciting performance with a great cast of voices and well done music is just what the traveling listener needs. Gandalf, Sam, Frodo and Aragorn's voices have to be my favorites. Gollum and Gimli are a bit overdone but to interesting effect but they are all leagues better than the BBC version. I bought that first figuring that a British version would be the golden standard but Gollum just sounded like a normal guy who occasionally slurped or sucked his words and Gandalf sounded like a real loser. The Gandalf here speaks with authority as does Aragorn. Sam has just the right touch of innocence and Frodo never lets the listener down. All the major events of the books with the exception of Galadriel being tempted by the Ring are very well presented. What a sight for sore eyes (or ears I should say) was it to hear Tom Bombadil's merry voice, a favorite of fans and readers who never quite made it into any production at all of the series. The battles are all satisfying as is the climax in Mount Doom and the skirmish with Shelob. I recommend it for journeys long and short."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Most of the people who are going to buy this book are LOTR fanatics and collectors Is the book good value or is it collectable.

Full maps. section sewn.The text font is very clear and legible unlike many other editions and you could use this book to read the whole saga. Though my personal preference is the Allen and Unwin editions particularly the 2nd edition.Very nice presentation and considering you would pay almost the same price for the \\"ordinary\\" hardcover volume represents good value. Consider how much you pay for the folio society set.Still I await the ultimate three volume set....maybe the 100th Anniversary edition."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have listened to about twenty classic novels in the form of unabridged audio recordings, and the Lord Of The Rings was by far the best. In fact, it was altogether different.That Tolkien is a master of the written word is beyond question, and you will find few other books that will delight you like this one, or educate you half so well. But, it is Inglis that makes this work so remarkable.You will wonder that there is not a whole cast of actors given the diversity of the voices, or that the book has not been dramatised given the performance. You will fall love in love with the adorable Treebeard, be inspired by the wisdom of Gandalf, and shed a tear at the simple goodness of everyday hobbit folk.The term 'Shakesperian actor' is bandied around a little too often; it's true worth is not alway acknowledged. But Inglis' performance demands applause. In conjunction with the equal mastery of Tolkien, and the value of the sum is necesarilly greater than the value of the parts.The Lord Of The Rings audio production is more than a work of art, it is a place to spend your time, a solace from the tedium of everyday life, and a shared understanding between you and the characters of Middle Earth.I urge you to buy this book, or some other great work. If you are not touched by it then you have no heart, and if your integrity and fortitude are not strengethened by it then you have no soul. If you can't afford it to own it then gain access to it some other way - it's your birthright."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"First of all, I spend a lot of time writing reviews of books, computer games, and movies. I very rarely, if ever, give anything a perfect score. The Lord of the Rings (and The Hobbit as well) is an exception. These books come so close to perfection it's amazing. I've heard people compare the Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit to Shakespeare and the Bible. To be honest, comparisons like those probably sell Tolkien short. His ability to create a totally fictional world and then wholly and completely draw the reader in is simply amazing.If you haven't already read The Lord of the Rings then you are missing out on one of the greatest literary works ever created. These are books that everyone and anyone with any appreciation for literature can take something away from. To be completely honest, I'm shocked at the few (and they certainly are in a VAST minority) negative reviews I've seen here. There is nothing wordy, boring, or dull about any of the volumes in The Lord of the Rings. Tolkien's incredible sense of detail and imagery are what make the story so intense and so real.If you're still not convinced then all you need to do is stop by your local bookstore and read the first paragraph or two (past the foreward and prologue, of course) of the Fellowship of the Ring. Every sentence is so masterfully written and immersive that you'll be drawn in immediatly. Ever since I first picked Lord of the Rings up I haven't been able to put it down - and that was more than ten years ago.A NOTE ON THE COLLECTOR'S EDITION: A few people have already mentioned that the quality of the collector's edition isn't as great as would be hoped. Unfortunetly, this is more or less true. Fortunetly, that doesn't mean they're not a good buy for serious Tolkien fans. They are a bit pricey, but it's nice to have a much more durable version of a book that you'll be reading for years to come. Not to mention that they look great sitting on a bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Before anything else is said about it, it should be noted that in the context of serious 20th century fiction, 'The Lord of the Rings' is a really, really weird book. A lot of people, most notably literary reviewers, literary journalists, public intellectuals and academics, never miss a chance to pour scorn on the book and dismiss it as rubbish. It is, however, enormously popular, and has been so since it was first published in the years after the Second World War. Why does the book inspire such fondness, and such derision?I myself have a chequered history with it. I first read it aged about 12, and loved it. I became at the time a fully-fledged Tolkien geek, immersing myself in the arcana of writing in Elvish and so on, which is more than most fans of the book do. I grew out of that phase, and forgot about the book. Later on, in my early 20s, I read it again - but this time, I had read and absorbed shelves-full of academic literary criticism of the then dominant Anglo-French persuasion, Marxism-lite with a heady pinch of deconstruction, and I despised the book for being wilfully archaic, not enough strong roles for women, surely there was more than a hint of racism in the depiction of the bad guys as coming from the East and South, the style was sheer fustian...and so on.Aged 30 I read it again, because the movies were coming out and I wanted to watch them, and I was wondering why I'd liked the book in the first place. Much to my surprise, I enjoyed it. It seemed far more haunted, less triumphant, more ambiguous than I remembered. Subsequent readings have confirmed this assessment. The 'The Lord of the Rings' is a really weird book because, almost alone among serious mid-20th-century fiction in English, it is not at all interested in doing the things that the most critically acclaimed fiction of its era wanted to do. I doubt that any serious writer of Tolkien's level of education was more intellectually independent and single-mindedly focused on his own personal creative mission than he was. Most fiction writers are over-stuffed with ideas about things they want to do, which they put into practice with little or no concern about whether they have much to do with the story they want to tell. (I suppose the nec plus ultra would be a writer such as B.S. Johnson, who went as far as to proclaim that it didn't matter anymore what the story was, the only thing that was important was how it was told - and then defied his own pronouncement by frequently refusing to write about anything that hadn't actually happened to him or to someone he knew.) Tolkien, like very few writers of his generation, doggedly worked and worked until he knew exactly what he wanted to do, and then proceeded to do it.'The Lord of the Rings' is a yarn. It is a good story; to a certain extent, you could retell it yourself and it would still retain much of its power to move and enthrall a listener. In that respect, it is unlike much great modern fiction. 'Ulysses' is one of my favourite novels of all time, but I am under no illusion that I could persuade someone how great it is by just recounting what happens in it in my own tone of voice.'The Lord of the Rings' has been criticised as being racist; the usual charge is that blackness is associated with the bad guys. Also, it has been noted that some of the bad guys have crossed 'orcs' (a non-human species) with humans, and this is Not a Good Thing. Elsewhere, journalists have had simple-minded fun with the extremely tenuous links between Tolkien, philology and German romanticism on the one hand, and the Nazi party on the other. This needs to be said: the book is not racist in any recognisable way. Whiteness is equally associated in the book with sterility and barrenness, or else corruption and death. Many of the hobbits are recognised as being of mixed ethnic origin, and one of the main good guys is Elrond, who is of mixed Elf-Human parentage. So much for the charge of racism. What the book's left-wing critics have not noticed is that it is not racist but speciesist; the characters are always ready to reserve sympathy for men who have gone to the bad, but they never bat an eyelid before killing orcs, who are presented as being reasonably rational and sentient beings, albeit of a different species. But since orcs are a fictional species, does it matter? Animal rights campaigners might profit from looking at the book and the way it has been misinterpreted.The most dismissive and least cogent criticism of the book has been that it glorifies vanquishing a conquered enemy, and that it's in some way an allegory of the second world war. This does not fit. The author once observed that if the book were an allegory of recent history, the Ring (for which read=atomic bomb) would have been used by the most powerful good guy against the main bad guy, and the majority of the population of Middle-Earth would end up falling under the hegemony of whoever had used the Ring in the first place - which, we may note, is exactly what happened in real life.In the book, the Ring (which is a symbol of power and potentially unlimited hegemony) has to be destroyed, so that an unwinnable war can be averted. That is exactly what didn't happen in real life, which is why American soldiers are now dying in a senseless war in Iraq. 'The Lord of the Rings' is a classic novel because, for all its faults (it's long, it's oddly structured, it's sometimes long-winded, there aren't many interesting female characters, and perhaps most importantly it seems to exist a little too aside from the history that engendered it), it has a remarkable capacity to talk to successive generations about the things that worry and beset them - what am I doing here? What is my purpose? Am I really the person who should do this? Why keep going when it looks like I won't live to see the benefit of it all?Tolkien knew what he was doing. This is his best book, far more gripping and readable than the interesting and sometimes gorgeous but basically sluggish and arcane 'Silmarillion', and readers who have disdained it in the past would do well to come off that high literary horse and give it a go. Not the least thing I got from reading Tolkien was a conviction that nobody can call her- or himself an educated reader without at least a bare acquaintance with Old English literature. Tolkien was saturated in the stuff, and it gives his work essential depth, richness and perspective. (The Riders of Rohan basically speak Old English, slightly modified.)And in the end, it's perhaps the most haunting and saddest of fantasy novels. Tolkien knew about post-traumatic stress disorder before it was called that. He had served as an Army officer on the Somme in World War One, and knew first-hand the damage and grief that are caused by war, which is a lot more than many of his critics and some of his right-wing fans can say. This book respects his experience and transmutes it into something rich, strange and memorable. Isn't that what we who care about good writing normally call art?"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This isn't a review of the book, it's a review of the Kindle version. First, from a quality perspective, the Kindle's version is lacking. I don't how hard it is to move from a printed book to a digital version but there were many misspellings and typographical errors in the Kindle version. This can be improved upon. But from a hardware perspective, the Kindle shows its limitations. In the book there are hyper-links from certain terms that the characters use to their definitions in the appendix. This is a great idea! Unfortunately it takes forever to use the joystick controller to select the hyperlink. This is a limitation of the Kindle software. Another limitation is the ability to look at the maps in the book. You can't zoom in! :( It's too bad that an electronic version would not have better features that a book doesn't have. I may end up buying the books instead."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"From having this edition now for a couple of days, I wanted to report that it is a fine edition for actually reading (as opposed to collecting). In particular, the typography is great, and seems (to me) substantially better than in previous deluxe editions. The paper has a very appealing finish. And, at least for me, the book does not seem too heavy for reading in a chair or in bed."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"After many stops and starts trying to read 'The Lord of the Rings Trilogy' I was finally inspired to try to listen to it on my one hour commute to work. I was amazed at the beauty of the language that was not easily evident when reading it myself. The audio version gave me the opportunity to enjoy a work that I otherwise would have missed out on."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I've read &quot;LOTR&quot; just about every year since 1964 when my high school English teacher said, &quot;I think you might like this.&quot; She was so right. And now, having all three books, unabridged, on CD is so marvelous. Mr. Inglis does a wonderful job bringing the characters to life (you always know when Gimli is talking) and even the greater part of the appendix is included.You cannot know how great it is to fall asleep at night listening to tales from Middle Earth with some of my favorite characters of all time. There are times when I wish he'd read instead of sung some of the tunes, but it never detracts from the beauty of Tolkien's prose or the magnificance of the story.I still cry reading the last parts of RoTK - it's all so very well done."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"There was much hype about this special edition of one of the world's most loved books' arrival. However, I found it to be somewhat disappointing. The binding and slip cover are very nice, but the pages are akin to an old family bible - thin and flimsy, nearly transparent. There are a few generic graphical decorations, but no illustrations. The maps in the back are of low-quality and flimsy - mine actually ripped just by opening it despite the extreme care I was taking. Overall, I much prefer the red-bound Collector's Edition or the one illustrated by Alan Lee. This one was *not* worth the money!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I agree with Martin Steen, who reviewed this below. The Mind's Eye dramatised 9 CD version is truly awful. The people who produced this obviously didn't have a clue. The character's voices were ridiculous : Frodo with an American (!) accent, other hobbits with a ludicrous screeching/gurgling sound, elves with voices like Mickey Mouse....pathetic. If you want to listen to a good audio adaptation of Lord of the Rings, try the BBC version. It features REAL actors of the highest calibre, such as Ian Holm, the late Michael Horden and Robert Stephens, and many other revered thespians. More importantly, it captures the spirit of Tolkien's books with just the right mixture of heroic suspense, magic, humour, and awe. I've had the 13-tape box set for years and have listened to it many, many times. I wish they would release this version on CD. Anyway, in closing, I'd like to warn fellow Tolkien fans to steer clear of the 'Mind's Eye' American production...I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Everyone else has said it all before me, except this:This is the ONE THING I remember my parents arguing over in their divorce -- who would get this volume?"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I just wanted to reassure those thinking of purchasing the Kindle version, that yes, all appendices of the books are included!

I have to say I am kind of disappointed by it, Rob Inglis did a so so job, he read the book more like telling a tale to small kids, which he did well, but it did not do the right to the book. TLOTR is far beyond a kid's tale, it is a literature marvel. In the book there are many narratives describing the middle earth, the language used by Tolkien is beautify, Rob Inglis did a poor job for these parts, he sounded monotonous. I tried to listen to this version many times because I love the book, but I could not finish it because soon I got bored by his tone, this is a long book and with many dramatic language in it, it should be much more vivid than what was done by Rob Inglis."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I received my copy yesterday and the maps are glued together in the corners.

Not a bestseller when it was first published, it slowly gathered a cult following which then grew into universal popularity. Millions of people have read this series and I wanted to be one of those millions. I was told by other readers how great this series is, a great story, etc. After reading &quot;The Hobbit&quot; I attempted to read &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;.Earlier this year I read the first two books but I didn't finish the third. To be honest, I found the first two books a bit of a trial as well. To me the story was slow and meandering. I thought there was too much singing, which lulled me. I found Sam pretty annoying too. I would hate to have him following me around all the time. Everything seemed a bit sugar sweet.I will concede the story was written well and had some good moments, like the flight from the Black Riders and the Balrog in the Mines of Moria. But a lot of the story was just people travelling here and there in a way that seemed repetitive: characters coming to yet another forest, another mountain, another dark cavern. I felt a bit guilty that I wasn't enjoying the story the way everyone else had. But I have heard of other people who have similar feelings. The well-known fantasy and science fiction writer Michael Moorcock described &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; as &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; posing as an epic. People have described how the defeat of Sauron is accomplished too easily. After building up to the momentous climax through hundreds of pages, the Dark Lord is vanquished in a couple of paragraphs.I really like the artwork that illustrators have done over the years based on Tolkien's work .I even have a Tolkien 1999 diary. But I wouldn't call myself a die-hard Tolkien fan. I prefer science fiction to fantasy so I have generally stuck to that."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"What? Only three stars? How dare you!J.R.R Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is one of those things that one is simply not allowed to dislike. Oh sure, you can voice your criticism, but to do so is to be labelled an ignorant, illiterate fool who would be better suited to reading children's stories than high fantasy. One can see this phenomenon right here at Amazon; simply look at all the negative reviews for Tolkien's work. No matter how well the reviewer articulated his or her thoughts, every negative review has a heaping of \\"Not Helpful\\" votes from people who cannot seem to grasp the idea that some people just don't like Lord of the Rings.Knowing the kind of geeky following these books have and the sheer amount of snobbery surrounding them, I was instantly inclined to hate it, as I do with everything geeks worship to an obsessive degree. But instead I fought my preconceived notions and slogged my way through the entire Lord of the Rings with an open mind. After finishing it, however, I was left feeling distinctively unmoved. For the longest time, I could not think of what it was, exactly, about LOTR that I disliked. Clearly, it's easy to admire Tolkien for what he did. In creating Middle Earth, Tolkien not only created an entire world, he also created millenia of history to go along with it. He created different races, with different languages and customs. Looking at a map of Middle Earth, one can only imagine how much time and thought Tolkien put into this. The sheer amount of detail is mind-boggling.But why did I dislike it so? I'm not going to criticize Lord of the Rings because of its supposed racist undertones, or because the women have only minor roles, both of which are examples of projecting modern values onto a medieval fantasy world. No, the reason I found LOTR such a chore to read is Tolkien's writing style. To be honest, Tolkien's style of writing is dull, dry, humorless, pedantic, and needlessly ponderous. I had to fight through page after page of purple prose as Tolkien endlessly detailed every environmental detail and every geographical and historical facet of Middle Earth. As someone once put, Tolkien stresses the unimportant and trivializes the momentous. Take, for example, the Battle of Helm's Deep, or the Battle of Isengard. Tolkien presents these epic battles with all the grandeur and importance of grocery shopping.As a result, the pacing of LOTR is agonizingly slow. \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" is frontloaded to the extreme, dumping a huge quantity of information in the reader's lap right off the bat, and devoting page after page to exposition until something finally happens. The turgid pace eventually picks up slightly, but even then it remains dreadfully slow. The result is reading that is dry, disjointed, and downright confusing in places. Historical details of Middle Earth and strewn about with no regards to context, characters and events are elaborated on that bear no relation to the plot; it's all an exercise in wretched excess. LOTR reads like a dry historical account, although even historical accounts are free of the pointless tangents Tolkien insists on following.Characters, too, are likewise uninteresting. We never really get to know the innermost thoughts and drives of the people of LOTR; Tolkien keeps them at arms length and the result is detrimental. None of the dialogue sounds natural. Characters speak in a purely declarative manner, as if they were all about to pontificate on some matter of great importance. As I forced my way through, I came dangerously close to uttering the eight words that are the kiss of death for any novel: \\"I don't care what happens to these people\\". Having no particular interest in the characters, and finding Tolkien's exposition utterly boring, \\"Lord of the Rings\\" was a battle to finish.\\"Lord of the Rings\\" is a story that's easy to admire, yet very difficult to actually enjoy. It's the kind of thing that I would read simply to say I've read it, and then never read it again. I'm sure a Tolkien scholar could expound at great length about the sheer depth and content of these books, but many a reader will finding them tough going indeed.

It has a huge cast of characters, every one with a mythology behind them that is barely hinted at in the book (but is expanded on in the appendices and other works connected to Middle-Earth) and an amazing attention to details of towns, cities and landscapes, it has more songs than you can shake a stick at and it even has its own languages. Unfortunately, the plot is poor and Tolkien's ambition far exceeds his skills. His language is stilted to the highest degree, the language is fanciful and far too archaic and the dialogue is frankly awful. When a book's appendices are more interesting than the main text, you know you're in trouble. The problem is that the Lord of the Rings is caught halfway between \\"The Hobbit\\" (which is more colloquial and much more engaging), and what would become \\"The Silmarrilion\\", which has both a plot and a cast to match the pseudo-epic tone that Tolkien often adopts. You would probably be better off watching the films rather than reading the book with this one, simply because the films achieve everything that Tolkien fails to (although the last half-hour of the third film is truly awful). I would read this as a companion to the films, not as a work in its own right."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"All I can say is that the guy who wrote this is no Harold Robbins."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Everyone reads these books and sings their praises.

And he did create a wonderful, if highly eurocentric, world.But this book fails because of its incessant praise of war. The Nazis were evil because of the Holocaust. What did the Allies do to stop that? Not much (didn't even bomb the tracks leading to the death camps). War is simply evil; the sad lesson of the 20th Century is that warriors only contribute to the problem (Hiroshima) and only peacemakers fight evil effectively. (MLK, Ghandi, Einstein)Tolkein should be criticised for glorifing war because he: (1) wrote for children, is very popular, and (3)is credited with greatness. But Tolkein set up a world where war is becomes the essentially bloodless killing of evil subhumans or spirits. As in Beowulf, there's no horror, just glory. The enemies, who live in a &quot;black and evil land&quot; can't be reasoned with, only killed. (Contrast this with the Iliad). Real evil never works that way; Hitler came from the same people that produced Beethoven and Goethe. Speaking of which, the the book's subhumans are so gleefully killed, that one wonders how Lord of the Rings would have been received if the author were german and not british.It's too bad really. Tolkein had a magnificent imagination, made evident by the wonderful interplay between the Dwarf Gimli and the Elf Legolas--they eventually learn to overlook and finally appreciate their differences. But, given the criticism above, I can't recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"LOTR is a whole century masterpiece! Tolkien's writing ismagnificient!

BUT then againit's the quite poor quality of this book: The Collector's Edition..."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Generally, I really liked this audio series. There are only a few quibbles I have with it. First of all, Rob Inglis's singing on Tolkien's many songs is quite enough to make you lose your lunch. Somehow, these songs seem like commercial breaks in which you can get up and go to the fridge before the program resumes and you can continue listening to the stuff you came to hear. At least in the print versions you can easily skip them without batting an eyelash. The Fellowship is the worst offender in this regard, as the characters break out into song more often than the cast of Cats.Another problem with the Fellowship is that the story really takes a long time to get moving. If you ask me, Tolkien's descriptions of what the hobbits ate on their way out of the shire can be skipped in their entirety and wouldn't detract from the story one bit.Some of Tolkien's writings sound silly and pretentious considering they were written in the twentieth century, what with all of his &quot;ere's&quot; instead of &quot;before's&quot; and &quot;hither's&quot; instead of &quot;here's,&quot; etc. Further, many of his descriptions of people and places seem a bit overwrought, and much, again, like annoying commercial breaks before you get back into the action.Lastly, Tolkien's admiration of his fiction &quot;Elves&quot; who seem to look better, sound better, cook better, make prettier stuff, than everybody else in his fictional universe seems to sound like the worship of some non-existent hero race to me. It hardly seems possible that one group can be better than everybody else in every conceiveable way. Just gave me the heebie-jeebies. Oh, and Gimli's obsession with Galadriel gets tiresome after a while.Now, if you think all of this makes me sound a bit like one with an attention span that's too short, I'll grant you that you may have a point, but that said, slogging through over a thousand pages of this stuff takes a bit longer of an attention span than average.Generally, good compelling literature, but it does have some major drawbacks in its pace and tone.

Probably not, but still good stuff."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"2APR2012: Not sure why, but Amazon has my review of the Lord of the Rings CD set tied to this book.

Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings' is one of the few books that I enjoy reading and rereading. It's become a yearly ritual for me. The story is of unparalleled depth, and could get very slow at times (especially in the chapter titled &quot;The Council of Elrond&quot;) but is overall just great. Reading &quot;The Hobbit&quot; before this book is essential. Of course, you probably know all this already from other reviews or word of mouth. The real decision is not whether to buy the book or not, it is which edition to buy, among the numerous paperback and hardcover ones available.If you're going for paperback and are primarily going to read at home, I'd suggest the The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings box set, which goes here for $30 and has nice covers illustrated by Alan Lee. The movie cover ones are also pretty nice, but the Alan Lee illustrated ones have a nice classic feel to them. If you're going on the road, the Del Rey versions, which are a lot cheaper and smaller(and use paper of lesser quality) are the better buy.As for the one volume hardcover editions- if you have the money to spare, go for the leatherette collector's edition. Or if it fancies you the one the comes with Sideshow/Weta's awesome Gandalf/Bilbo bookends.(They are both at $51.00- the prices of both shot up a couple of dollars) The leatherette one has no illustrations besides Tolkien's map, so the Alan Lee illustrated one might be a better bet.($54.40) If you just want a no-frills hardcover, any of the movie cover ones (the most recent one has a shot of Sauron's finger with the ring on it) should suffice.($20)If you really get into the book, you should look in to 'The Silmarillion', which is an account of the First and Second ages and basically sets the stage for The Lord of the Rings.So there you have it!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I know what you're thinking. &quot;How many CD's come in this set? No way I'm reading all that.&quot; And you would be right in thinking as much. It took my wife and me the better part of a year on vacations and road trips to finish the entire book.But I can only say that the experience of LISTENING to the LOTR is a qualitatively different experience than READING it. It makes one wonder whether or not Tolkien intended the LOTR to be an Oral History rather than a Narrative.Either way, the experience of hearing Inglis work through the text was quite possibly one of the most moving literary experiences I have ever had. I found myself engaged emotionally in the book in a way in which I never was while reading it. I never realized how often I had skipped over the poems and long narratives containing the back history. But Inglis voice characterizations and dead on grasp of intensity and place breathe a new dimension of life into this already amazing piece of literature.If you appreciate LOTR at all, you simply will NOT be disappointed with this set."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is a great rerelease of the books just in time for the movie. I love the covers -- they're probably the best shots of the characters. The box containing them has a great frozen action moment: Nazgul galloping through a river. FOTR's cover: Frodo, looking very concerned and intense in candlelight. Two Towers: Saruman, clutching his staff and looking suitably sinister. ROTK: Aragorn, looking grim, in woodland surroundings.The quality is pretty good -- it's a little too easy to get finger smudges on the shiny covers, but that's not a major pet peeve. This may also be a good buy for those of who annoyed by the boxed mass market paperback editions, which I am told are of lesser quality.The plot? Well, virtually everyone knows it anyway, so I shall not bother.One can only speculate on the tastes of &quot;reader from Spokane,&quot; but I tend to think that low-grade D&amp;D is about the extend of his attention span. As for Tolkien's reported &quot;spelling changes,&quot; he was a British person in a different era -- not all the spelling will be similar. Ditto with the dialogue. And pardon me -- the whole point of having jolly, chubby &quot;halflings&quot; as heroes is to show that everyone has the capacity for heroism.Additionally, to dismiss it as being overly long and to judge EVERY character on Tom Bombadil is a simplistic judgement that ignores the mind-blowing scope and creativity of Tolkien's world. He created a religious pantheon of angels, an entire history of a world, and the rise and fall of several civilizations -- not to mention breathing life into multiple species like elves and dwarves. But even if you have not read the books on his invented languages or read the Silmarillion (the &quot;Bible&quot; of Middle-Earth), its still a pretty wild ride, complete with orcs, demonic Black Riders, enormous spiders, the beautifully ethereal elf Galadriel, exiled king Aragorn, the ghastly Gollum -- and a pair of friends who must fight against the worst thing in the world: The pure evil Ring that they have to lug with them.LOTR has a lot of valuable lessons, heroes, and stories. One person once speculated that Tolkien also gives us a few lessons on prejudice (Legolas and Gimli, best friends from antagonistic races), friendship (Sam and Frodo), and classes (Sam, the lowly gardener who eventually becomes... no, that's a spoiler!) Whether this is true, it nevertheless has good role models to follow. Some kids trained by TV and movies to have short attention spans will probably complain, but if you can get to the inn at Bree, then it shifts from &quot;The Hobbit&quot;-like lightness into a darker, faster-paced more adult story.A small note: Though Gandalf gives Frodo (and readers) the run-through in FOTR, you probably won't understand the stuff about Bilbo, Gollum and the Ring if you don't read the Hobbit. That book is not included in this boxed set. So I advise you get a nice copy of that, and read it too.And whether you have never read it before, or whether you have in the past: You must read this trilogy before the movies are released."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"No other book(s) I have read do I return to every 2-3 years and read again. Without a doubt, LOTR is the best example of fantasy writing ever.That said, I wish I had read the customer reviews regarding &quot;The Lord of the Rings Millenium Edition Boxed Set&quot; (ISBN: 0618037667). I had expected a wonderful hardbound set worthy of a once-in-a-thousand-years printing. Granted, at this list price it wasn't going to cause those in the binding industry to drool, but a &quot;Millenium&quot; edition should stand out from other editions. Sadly enough, the Millenium Edition Boxed Set stands out for all the wrong reasons. Have you ever checked out a book from a library and noticed the book was obviously a paperback that had its cover removed and pasted onto a hard fiberboard and then put back onto the rest of the book? This edition is exactly that, only the publisher has done the work for the libraries. Truly disappointing.The LOTR deserves better and Houghton-Mifflin has done much better than this, so why bother issuing such an inferior version? I plan on returning this as soon as possible and ordering something more in line with the collector's quality I had hoped to receive."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is a review for the Kindle edition of this offering, not a review of Tolkien's work, which I've already read in print form (and would rate five stars for a quality edition). I cannot speak of the print edition also offered under this entry, since I haven't purchased it, but the Kindle edition is marred by numerous typographical errors. For example, I've seen more instances of misplaced quotation marks than I can count, and I've seen \\"&Eacute;omer\\" misspelled several times. These are just examples, but anyone who cringes at sloppiness in renderings of Tolkien's work will have a hard time with the sloppy editing of this Kindle version.If you just want to buy something that gives you all three volumes of the epic at once for your Kindle, and you can forgive the errors, you'll be perfectly happy, as far as I can tell."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This 13 hour radio play, produced by the BBC in 1981, gives as much depth through the actors performance as the novel itself does through the written word. Ian Holm stars as Frodo, and he is more than perfect for the role. So too are Michael Horden as Gandalf and Robert Stephens as Aragorn. All the actors project worry, haste, excitement and joy though their acting. All the performances are top notch. The original music by Stephen Oliver adds much dimension and depth to every area of Middle Earth, for there are themes for each area. You will hear battle sounds, horses, elves singing and Nazguls threatening our heros on their quest. The BBC's soundeffects are in full stereo. No Tolkien fan should miss this. This radio play adaption by Brian Sibley and Michael Bakewell is better than the version by The Mind's Eye, because it captures more of the story and, most importantly, the atmosphere of Middle Earth that Tolkien was able to convey through his writings. Buy either this cassette version or the CD version, but don't miss this excellent radio play."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have listened to about twenty classic novels in the form of unabridged audio recordings, and the Lord Of The Rings was by far the best. In fact, it was altogether different.That Tolkien is a master of the written word is beyond question, and you will find few other books that will delight you like this one, or educate you half so well. But, it is Inglis that makes this work so remarkable.You will wonder that there is not a whole cast of actors given the diversity of the voices, or that the book has not been dramatised given the performance. You will fall love in love with the adorable Treebeard, be inspired by the wisdom of Gandalf, and shed a tear at the simple goodness of everyday hobbit folk.The term 'Shakesperian actor' is bandied around a little too often; it's true worth is not alway acknowledged. But Inglis' performance demands applause. In conjunction with the equal mastery of Tolkien, and the value of the sum is necesarilly greater than the value of the parts.The Lord Of The Rings audio production is more than a work of art, it is a place to spend your time, a solace from the tedium of everyday life, and a shared understanding between you and the characters of Middle Earth.I urge you to buy this book, or some other great work. If you are not touched by it then you have no heart, and if your integrity and fortitude are not strengethened by it then you have no soul. If you can't afford it to own it then gain access to it some other way - it's your birthright."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"There's no point in reviewing the novel itself, so I'll only talk about the 50th anniversary edition in particular. It is without question amazing in quality, from the leather binding to the golden gilded pages and even the slipcase. Unfortunately there are a few flaws, one of them glaring, that I need to subtract a star for.First and foremost, the fold-out maps enclosed in the front and back covers, while nicely constructed on parchment-like paper, are glued to hold them in place when first shipped. I carefully managed to remove all of the glue in the map behind the front cover, but I was not so successful with the back cover's map, resulting in a bit of a tear. Considering this is a collector's copy, I consider this fairly unforgivable, not to mention completely unnecessary.Also, the spine seems a bit thin, as a few other reviewers also noticed. As for the pages themselves, I was mostly pleased, fearing they would indeed be transparent-thin as one reviewer claimed. All in all, this is a book that would stand up to a few readings, which is all it should be subjected to considering most of us will have other copies for casual reading.As I stated before, this is a beautiful edition of the (single, 6-part) novel, and the best edition I've ever seen, though I've never had the pleasure of owning the British, Harper Collins edition. Certainly well worth the price, though, frankly I would've preferred an even better, more expensive edition."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is THE edition to get for lovers of Tolkien. You get the complete trilogy in one volume and what a volume too! It's leather bound with great gold letterings on the cover plus nice illustrations within. The fonts are of a good, easily-readable size and the binding is first class, ensuring that this tome will stay in great shape and is likely to be passed down from parent to child many times over.

I started reading these around age 16 when I read the hardcover edition in the library, and was delighted to discover this set in a used bookstore a number of years ago.What I like best about them is that they predate the movies, and the graphics are all from the pre-movie era.I must confess that I read through these about once a year. And every year I learn something new. A personal favorite."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Beautiful books.

It's a unique art work by one of the greatest philologists of the world."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Being a huge fan of Mr. Tolkien, I tend to be quite particular about which editions I keep in my library. This copy is a wonderfully compact, durable, and beautiful representation of all three episodes in \\"The Lord Of The Rings\\" saga. I highly recomend this book to anyone wishing to explore this tale."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Just as J.K. Rowling is popular for a book about death eaters that resemble terrorists, in Tolkiens day, he became famous for a book that resembled a World War. There have been many Tolkien spinoffs since this book, and even Steven King has thrown in an attempt to equal this pivotal work of the genre. As a recent high school graduate however, I do not remember a time where all the nations of the world decided to tear each other to shreds, and some of the experience is lost for me. What makes this book last more than say, \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\", however, is that Tolkien has a new world to introduce to us, and we can relate to it through our similar experiences. While the tone of this book is often frustrating, and some parts in the beginning of the Fellowship of the Ring can be slow, this book has endured throughout the ages, which is testament to the authors skill of worldbuilding paired with social reflection. This is a classic world that has stood the test of time and is still reminiscent of our own, and because of this it is a very accessible story."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Allow to keep this review short.Simply masterful. A must read by any fantasy and adventure lover. One cannot help but love the characters although some may feel Tolkien throws in tedious details, I love the depth and feeling.

Tolkien is a masterful storyteller & brings the tale alive with his expertise. The story is for all ages. The masterful way that Tolkien describes his world will transport you into his world of hobbits, dwarves, fairies, orcs, etc & the age-old battle of good & evil. You'll walk away, with your outlook on life richer & wiser after you've read this. When I'm bored, I think of reading this book, again. I've lost track of how many times I've read it! My kids beg me to read this book to them, at least once a year. The handy paperback is easy to throw into a backpack & take it with us on trips, doctor's offices, parks, even in the car, when we go anywhere. I strongly recommend this book, if you want to have an adventure that the whole family can experience & after reading or experiencing it, you will want to do it again, & again & again.

All the features mentioned are indeed here with the exception of the book being leather bound.It is a paper covered hard cover book not leather. The case is also covered in the same paper. The paper is nice looking.Amazon should change the listing of this as leather bound because it is deceiving."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Lord of the Rings is one of the most well known books of the 20th century. It played a huge role in the creation of the modern fantasy genre-every writer of fantasy today owes something to Tolkein. And it is simply excellent.Tolkein begins the book with the lighthearted story of Bilbo's last birthday in the Shire, and then draws the reader slowly into something darker-the final confrontation, in this age, between good and utmost evil. Tolkein writes wonderfully-he uses many old, archaic words and poetic descriptions, and his characters often burst out into song or poetry, but, unlike some less skilled writers, Tolkein makes this add to his story, rather than take away from it. Indeed, the thing that comes through most is the shear wonder and majesty in which he describes his world-a world he created and fleshed out in exacting detail, in a way few authors have managed to do since. Tolkein's descriptions of the journey his characters must take are excellent too-we feel Frodo's shock at finding the ring, determination to do what he must, wonder at the world he encounters, and, as he walks through Mordor, despair combined with a determination to, if nothing else, complete the task that fate has, for reasons of its own, dropped into his lap. The other storylines Tolkein introduces are treated just as well-the urgency of the battles, and the final decision of Aragorn to sacrifice everything, in the one, final hope of letting Frodo live to destroy the ring.Indeed, if Lord of the Rings has a central theme, it is hope. There is an old quote, I believe by a Mr. Chesterson: \\"Fairy tales are real not because they tell us dragons exist, but because they tell us dragons can be beaten.\\" In an uncertain world, where it is impossible to tell how things will settle, and where the books esteamed as \\"literature\\" all seem to compete to see which can contain the most unhappiness and despair, it is reassuring to have a book with a resounding message-the dragons of the world can, indeed, be beaten."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Of course, I've always loved Lord of the Rings and J.R.R. Tolkien; I really enjoy the in-depth characters and intense plot. But it was even better as a single volume... the books that you love in less expensive and relatively durable binding. My family and I have read through this volume SEVERAL times, and apart from some slight creases in the spine, it's faring quite well.For those of you that have not read LOTR but seen the movies, I'm sorry- I loved the movies, but they pale in comparison to the books... READ THEM. If you've neither seen the movies or read the books, and you actually enjoy books... READ THEM. If you don't really enjoy reading but you'd like to like reading and you have some spare time... READ THEM. Fantastic for almost everyone- my guess, though, is that anyone 10+ would understand them and enjoy them."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Amazing copy of LOTR. Beautifully bound with gold rimmed pages. A must for any Lord of the Rings fan. Excellent quality and worksmanship."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"this book was one of the two best stories i have ever read. the characters and some of the scenes are magically beautiful, but also darkly sinister. i can't help think that Tolkien (the author), was trying to catch the reality of this life... that there is an almighty struggle between the forces of good and evil. there are agents of darkness as well as agents of light. i believe, that in writing this book he must have felt a great anxiety about finishing such an epic. this would have been with the knowledge that it had to be written. he is not only telling a brilliant story, but he is also pointing towards the real situation. not only is this world involved, but also whole galxies and perhaps universes in an almighty war between the forces of good and evil. there are magical devices, scientific machines, mysterious races and perhaps even rings of magical power in this battle... you can loose your soul. you can become a deceived minion of evil. beware and watch and pray... the road is slippery, and yet along the way you will have moments of joy and happiness.the one ring of power to bind them all, closely represents the 'urge' to power. i use the word urge because this is more primal and fundamental than 'will'. will emerges from an urge. pride is that which needs power, to be powerful, pride is a form of greed. therefore it can clearly be said that the urge to power is an extremely deep rooted urge in the human being, perhaps found in all idividualities. 'pride' is 'force', whereas the prime quality of humility is gentleness. the urge to power forces its way, whilst humility, the antithesis of pride is 'truly' gentle, in an uncontrived manner. the urge to power can be hard to overcome. this urge in itself is 'strength' or power and as such is potentially very corruptive. any super-man is in danger through the self destructive urge to power. just look at the case of adolf hitler. though initially the urge can be a force for growth and development, eventually it passes a point where its growth in position, knowledge or whatever other form of power expression leads to its own self destruction, or onwards into a true enlightement (if in pursuit of the spiritual path). i find it worrying that we have this 'urge' built into our genetic programming. what initially could be of great benefit to the species survival, could ultimately either be the end of all life on this planet, or its salvation. hence the parallel between the one ring to bind them all and human 'pride'/the urge for power. it should be mentioned that greed plays an important part in the urge for power, but we must not forget that it is also part of the species survival mechanism.i feel that rather than stronger and stronger weapons which only make us proud and posturing, what is needed is agaponic technology, the tools to overcome all forms of harmful violence and warfare (to neutralize it) by peaceful, non-destructive means... thats on the technological front. the second thing and perhaps more important is an ontological change in our natural makeup. i have outlined this in my posts, and the third thing is an understanding of what is true and what is false, through the guidance of our conscience ('feelings' of rightness/confidence and peace/comfort as opposed to guilt and vengeful anger) and most importantly the objective statement of loving-kindness.it is through recognising the dualisms of good and evil and understanding them in all their substance and power that we can aspire to understand and appreciate the 'true' good. to deny the existence of evil or good is sometimes to be overtaken by the forces of darkness. this is since that evil can only be resisted if it is understood to exist. the teaching of non-dualism sometimes found in some eastern religions denies the existence of evil, and in a sense it is right (there is nothing purely evil), but it is also wrong... i say wrong since without acknowledging the existence of evil one will never aspire to be good, nor perhaps be able to resist his assimilation into it. it is only by recognising human pride and forcefulness that we can work at overcoming it within ourselves, never mind others. the buck starts with me and you.perhaps one of the greatest storys ever told. i find the symbolism in this book akin to that in the 'never ending story', by michael ende, but even better.do take care, love, flakey xxx."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I feel sorry for the people who wrote reviews anything under five stars for this.

It is most likely one of the best books I've ever read. It begins about a hobbit, or halfling, who must venture off into an evil enemy's territory to banish a ring. This is no ordinary ring, it holds power beyong our imagination. The main character of the story is named Frodo Baggins; and on his journey, his friends and he go through countless adventures trying to destroy the ring. From great battles with dark forces to mysterious elven-woodlands, the book keeps you on the edge of your seat. From the journey you learn of great and strange friendships that arise, such as that of Legolas the Elf and Gimli the Dwarf; you are also introduced to great people with more to them than you would see at first, such as the mysterious Strider.

Yet I simply had to have this one.Yes, it is leather-bound - with about the thinnest leather I have ever seen. While I would have appreciated a far more substantial leather binding, I understand the mass-market requirements. A full-grain leather binding would have put this out of the reach of most buyers. That said, I would still have enjoyed and willingly purchased such a tome.The maps are incredible - and it takes quite a bit of care and attention to unfold and fold them back up again. Once again - perhaps they could have been packaged as separate items for easier use.Sure - no volume of a true classic is going to please everyone.

Do no be misled. For that, you must pay for the deluxe slipcase edition. Perhaps worth it for roughly twice the price. The maps are tiny. Nicely reproduced, but tiny. If this is a big deal for you, buy the deluxe edition. If not, buy this one. But definitely buy one or the other.2) Print quality is excellent, but page thickness is just good. This one volume edition ends up being less than half the size of three volume hardbacks. This is both an advantage and a disadvantage. Be aware.Praise: The new index is vastly improved; it's fun just to thumb through. And the appendices are fuller; for enthusiasts of Elvish languages the 50th edition is a delightful upgrade.

Even a better deal than the UK Harper Collins hardback with the eye of Sauron on the cover (the edition through which I first became acquainted with the Lord of the Rings), of which major downfall of that edition is the jacket...Index--Comprehensive index that covers characters, names, events and places. Fantastic if you just want to jump to one point to refresh your memory of a certain scene, or have a favorite passage :DAppendices--Five appendices(A-F)--Explaining more in-depth about Middle-Earth history, lore, character connections and an appendix E(my favorite) which details the languages used in Middle-Earth, contains a brief pronunciation guide and (even!) a listing of Tengwar and Angerthas letters/characters! Plus interesting foreword and prologue (especially as to specifics on translation).Book Chronology--Chapter divisions according to events and listing of books in thematic groups (The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, The Return of the King--this is not in all editions...).Jacket Design: Great cover illustration by Alan Lee, which features Minas Tirith. Colors on spine and back jacket compliment illustration and are not gaudy or overwhelming. Elegant scheme.Now for the Con (which can be rectified...)Maps: Multi-page maps instead of one fold out map. However, this is a minor greivance for me, since one can go online and find a complete map of Middle-Earth and print it out on good quality paper if one should require a complete, unbroken map while reading.Overall, a very good edition for reading and gracing one's bookshelf for a decent price."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien, yet has died, but the literature, and words of wisdom, will remain for generations to come. This will be remembered as the classic of 20th century trough this millenium, like we remember such great titles as Defoe's Robinson Crusoe.By no means think this epic tale has no wisdom of life in it, because it does, and that rises it from the swamp of the usual fantasy literature. It tells a story of rather weak ( by size; not by heart ) race, called Hobbits, fighting a great evil, Sauron and his armies. I won't spoil the plot, nor details, to you; because this story is going to take you along, and soon you notice you're in the last chapter of Return of the King ( assuming you buy this one-volume edition ), desperately wanting it to continue. When this story ends, it isn't the end, because you can read it again ( and you'll always find something new, I promise ) or buy Silmarillion ( or book of the lost tales ) to study the past. But this is the main story, others are builded around it, and the world of middle-earth is large.One world created by a single genius, so wonderfully generated, that it creates so real atmosphere you really believe Hobbits existed, and this is a true story after all. Never I have seen languages so complicated ( well, for one example Star Trek's Borg-language ), nor world so large, being created. With these kind of details and atmosphere.This book borrows some biblical &quot;events&quot;, like good is the God, hobbits are Christ -like, and bad the hellish force, and Sauron itself the devil. Read this and you can see it yourself.Read this yourself, and enjoy it!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Few novels reach the level of writing this novel achieves. The masterpiece that set the standard for all fantasy novels to follow, will captivate and trap any reader who picks it up. Tolkien does a remarkable job in portraying the vivid locations and characters he creates and moves the reader to fall in love with his Middle Earth. The introduction of new races, hobbits and orcs, set the stage for an epic tale that will never fail to mesmerize and enthrall any reader. As one reads one can't wait to read on, and feels that he or she is right there along with the characters as they traverse Middle Earth. Issues of rebirth, sacrifice, and good vs. evil are found throughout the story, and one finds that they re-read chapter after chapter so not to miss any little detail as the story unfolds so vividly within ones mind. No review can give justice to this novel, all I can say is get it as quickly as possible and fall in love with Tolkien's Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is without a doubt the best book I've read ever, and really, it is outstanding. It has a style and a world that has been thought of to great length - giving it backgroud and atmosphere. Also you can tell that it took Tolkien years to write this massive book in the way it changes style after one third of the first book. It's about good versus evil in pure form, and it has a nice heroic air. Some might find it too long - some even boring, but I myself think it's a marvelous time in a world I wouldn't mind being in."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This book is a fantastic read, but if you're looking for a high-quality collector's edition to adorn your library this isn't it. The quality of the printing is very poor, sometimes very light and other times too dark. In my copy the map that is glued inside the back cover is slightly askew and sticks out beyond the edge cover. Not worth the money."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This book has great covers with the movie art. There is not a better looking set out there. Of course, it goes without saying that the books are simply the greatest books ever written. This set contains the lord of the rings trilogy. J.R.R. Tolkien did not want his book in a trilogy, he wanted it in one full version, but publishers printed it as a trilogy. I defiantely like having it in a boxed set trilogy, because the full version book is too large to carry around and is a hassle to read. This set could be even better with The Hobbit, but it can be read without the Hobbit. For anyone who does like this book I would recommend The Hobbit, it is fine to read it before or after the series. Anyways, I believe this is a great boxed set and is really fun to read. Oh and by the way I almost forgot to mention the great fold out maps in the back!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"In a rising tide above the rapidly aging Pottermania comes the sweep of Tolkienmania. In preparation for the three new live-action movies, the famed trilogy is rereleased.Years before, the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron was discovered in the possession of the creepy Gollum - and came into the &quot;ownership&quot; of Bilbo Baggins, a pleasant hobbit in the middle of an adventure. Now, it is given to his relative Frodo, who soon encounters creatures both mesmerizing and evil in the Shire. Wizard Gandalf has him head off to the elf city of Rivendell, but along the way he is attacked and nearly killed by the sinister Black Riders. It is determined at Rivendell that the One Ring must be destroyed, and that Frodo's the hobbit to do it. With Gandalf, he sets off with a group of companions: the hobbits Sam, Merry and Pippin, men Aragorn and Boromir, elf Legolas, and dwarf Gimli.They travel across the length of Middle Earth, from the beautiful gardenland of Lothlorien to the rotting wasteland of Mordor. Aragorn and the others will attempt to save the city of Minas Tirith from the armies of Sauron. Frodo and Sam will try to take the Ring to Mount Doom, the only place where it can be destroyed. But that will take a terrible price.When this book was first published, Tolkien had no idea that he would jump-start the fantasy genre from an odd little collection of fiction to a major part of the book market and would inspire more ripoffs than any other author in history. Lord of the Rings is a sweeping epic of good and evil. Cliche? It is a cliche now, but it's also one LOTR spawned.What sets it apart is two things: the Judeo-Christian morality and ethics that Tolkien held so dear, and the crafting of Middle-Earth. If one carefully examines the themes of temptation, redemption and punishment, as well as the innate nobility of the heroes. I also advise, to get the full effect of Tolkien's beliefs, that you read the Silmarillion.Middle Earth is perhaps the most intricate fantasy world ever created, with Patricia McKillip's Riddlemaster trilogy's world as a close second. Tolkien crafted not just geology and various species for his world; he also created a religious background, complete with a God and a pantheon of deitilike angelic creatures, individual languages, cultures, and several outlooks that are alien to the other species. Add to this his poetic, strong descriptions, pleasant dialogue, occasional song or poem, and you have a true classic. The classic status is cemented into immortality by the fact that this was the first widely-read fantasy.A recommendation: If you've already read the trilogy, then you may want to read two other intelligent trilogies, &quot;Children of the Star&quot; and &quot;Riddlemaster.&quot; Though they cannot match JRR (who can?) they are two of the best.If you are one of the few people who has never read this trilogy: Put down your Harry Potter and read the story that introduced the world to fantasy."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have attempted to buy this book 3 times from amazon,the two copies sent were both damaged ,so I went to other stores to order it,3 more copies from borders all damaged and I am wondering how poor the book companies employee attention must be to ship out damaged items at almost $100 a pop. I was attempting to give this as a gift and have been on a month journey trying to find just one book not ripped,ink stained,etc. This is pretty sad for a collectors edition LOTR item and totally looks down upon Tolkiens good name.Unless you can personally inspect it dont bother ."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have read Lord of the Rings 3 times.It is my favourite bookever.The copy that I previously owned was a one volume paperback.But when I saw the 50th year anniversary book I just had to buy it.I ordered mine from Amazon,and I was one of the lucky ones who had nothing wrong with the book first time.The 50th year anniversary contains gilded pages,leather covering,fold out maps,corrected text,leafs from the book of Mazurbal,and a slipcover to hold the book in.All in all,this is the best Lord of the Rings ever published.And if you are a die hard fan of JRR Tolkien,I reccomend you get this book,you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I will spare the urge to expound on how great story this book is about as there would not be any more point worth discussing among those who have read it. Instead, anyone who might be buying this leatherette edition should be interested in what kind of physical quality this higher priced print brings about. I, for myself, was so enchanted with the quality of the writing, I decided I should have one that match it, physically that is. Indeed it is one heavy book, bright red leatherette cover with golden linings, black text with red prints for the foot and headnotes (pages, chapter title, etc). The paper is slightly yellowish to give the kind of old, aging air about it, and if you hold it more than a few seconds, it will mold the shape of your fingers into it, as if it begs to be personalized by your touch. The printed text, however, are not entirely uniform, some pages have it really dark and bold, and some are not as much. Nevertheless, it shouldn't bother the overall experience. Only time will tell if this quality will hold for passing it to my great grandchildren."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"For the price, I was very concerned that the reading would be poor. However, it was absolutely outstanding. This is a must0have item for LOTR fans."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"It was very enjoyable. Would recommend to those that enjoy thinking in a spiritual realm and enjoys this kind of book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is an excellent digital copy. J.R.R. Tolkien is, of course, the best fantasy writer in the history of mankind. If you have never read The Lord of The Rings: You owe it to yourself to do so now! You will never regret it. I enjoyed reading this so very much. I wish he was alive and still writing."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This edition I thought would be too bulky, however the organization is quite neat. Am very pleased with the single volume setup as opposed to having to dload three individual volumes + ancillary material."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I had previously seen all 3 of the movies and have just finished reading the Hobbit. I really enjoyed The Hobbit so I decided to read the Lord of the Rings. My God but there were alot of names that I could barely pronounce and place names of equal tongue twisting ability. I did however get through all the books and though I thoroughly approve the changes made for the movies I now understand more of the backstories for all the main characters."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is and always will be one of my favorite books. It never fails to amaze me! It takes some courage, endurance, and persistence to tackle this adventure, but it's worth it every time."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien is one of my prefered authors being, along with Homer one of the greatest authors of all time! But while the story itself is excellent I have to ask, why do people continue to comment on the binding and illustrations when this is the kindle edition which lacks illustrations and you only have abinding if you bought a case!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"really enjoying these books. Should be considered required reading for fantasy fans. Not sure why they haven't made them into films, it seems like the story would lend itself to that sort of thing. I guess this precious little treasure will be all mine."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Wizards, hobbits, kings, orcs, elves, dwarfs, evils and wars. What more could you want? A well spun story about friendship and honor. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I bought the Hobbit by Tolkien and really enjoyed the book. After reading the Hobbit I decided I wanted to read the Novel to get the full story. I really enjoyed the book and was amazed at how much was left out of the books.I will say some of the writing in the 'medieval' style was a little difficult to comprehend at times but still it was a very good reading and enjoyed every bit of the book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"For newcomers and old fans alike, this is the version to buy. Plenty of bonus content to go along with the trilogy itself."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This book is one of the best works of literature of all time. The effort and development that went into the three books that comprise the Lord of the Rings trilogy creates a world for the reader that is unmatched by any other storyteller I have ever read.This edition happens to make the reading and enjoyment of the book an even more rewarding experience. The size and feel of this book makes you feel like you are reading from an old and important document. It is a feeling that every Tolkein reader would enjoy and one that beckons to those who haven't yet discovered the joy of his writing."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I gave this book five stars and gave the whole series five stars. The first two books were very good but the third book was the best.During this series you will be taken through a world that is new and very realistic. It is realistic because you can relate to the characters. When they feel sorrow, you feel it and when they feel happiness, you feel it. For example the character Gollum had two sides to him. As it is written in the book other characters say that Gollum hates and loves the ring. People want him to die and yet they pity him. The writing is done so well that you can tell when they are sad and when they are mad. I fell in love with this character because of his feelings and emotions.While reading this book I could not put it down because the story gets better and better as you turn the pages. Every time you turn the page there is a new character involved, or a new story board. For example, Gandalf the wizard dies in the first book and when you turn the page in the second book you find that he is back with a more powerful incarnation. Meaning instead of a Gray wizard he is a White wizard. This series will take you on a ride through your imagination.This book is also the kind of book that you can read over and over again and still be surprised at what it is saying. You never get bored.The reason why I enjoyed the books very much was it was very original and gave a fresh perspective to life. The depth and the amount of time put into this book was well done. What also fascinates me is that J.R.R. Tolkien studied language as a major. And in this series he wrote his own language. What also was very interesting was that books are supposed to reflect Tolkien's life journey.One of my favorite characters was Samwise Gamgee, the hobbit gardener from the Shire. I thought he was very brave and courageous. I also liked the character Gandalf who was a wizard and was very wise. I also loved the character Gollum.I enjoyed the setting of the books. The details in the maps made it look so real. It is unpredictable. There are many settings in this book. One for my favorites is Fangorn Forest, which is a huge forest that is old and creepy. There were also two major kingdoms and two major cities. One was the kingdom of Rohan that was a rural landscape with houses that looked like huts. Another city was Minas Tirith(also known as The White city), and that city was all made of marble and built against a mountain.I would recommend this book for people from ages ten and older. The books are both educational and mystical. If you enjoy fantasy then you will enjoy this book. It is written in old English as well, so it is difficult to understand. IT was a really good book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"If, in the past, you tried to read these books, but found them hopelessly complex or difficult, have now fear anymore. I had the same problem with this book when I read it the first time, it is so hard to keep track of character names and places.Now that I have seen the movie, though, I find this book an absolute joy to read again. Passages that once were difficult slogs, are now emminently easy to read. So, if you have seen the movie, but are discouraged from reading the book because of past failed attempts, go for it. You are going to find it much easier than you remembered. There are enough differences between the book and movie versions of the story that the book will remain interesting.This particular edition -- the paperback with a close up of the ring on Sauron's finger -- is a great deal and is my choice for the best paperback edition of the book.The page size is bigger than the small Del Ray versions of the book, but the book is not so big that it is too heavy to hold. In a nice touch, the front and back covers fold out to reveal very nice detailed versions of the maps. These larger scale versions of the maps are MUCH nicer than those usually found in paperback versions and prove to be very helpful reading aids.The paper quality itself is a little bit too much like newsprint, but it will do. There is a hardback version of this edition that uses much nicer quality paper, but being hardback, it is a little heavier."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This audio book is far more than the reading of a Great Book. Mr Inglis gives us a reading that brings alive Middle Earth. You are transported to a world that is both beautiful and compelling. The singing of Mr Inglis is truly excellent and his reading of Tolkien's words brings out the beauty of the English language. A truly Must Have."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"While this is a very sincere effort at reducing LOTR into digestible audio episodes, it simply cannot compete with the BBC's version. It might be slightly more appropriate for younger listeners, and features more direct quoting from the novel's descriptive passages, but essentially every voice actor is inferior to the BBC counterpart, and the breaks every half hour (at least on the cassette version) leave the story feeling choppy. Look into this if you're a completist, but if you only want one, go with the BBC."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Although I had already read the LOTR trilogy several years ago, I was thrilled to receive this one volume paperback as a gift, and I thoroughly enjoyed re-reading this epic story. Tokien has taken the classic tale of good versus evil and has turned it into a completely captivating adventure involving humility and greed, love and hate, corruption and redemption. Although you know that the good will succeed in the end (as it always does), you can't help to feel both awed and amazed as the humble Frodo overcomes incredible odds to save the beautifully wrought realm of Middle-Earth, a world that seems to actually exist beyond the pages of these books.This single volume helpfully combines not only the books themselves but also the many complex supporting resources that make up Tolkien's world--ie, maps, appendices, etc. I found it extremely useful to have all of these materials contained in one book; I enjoyed my second reading of this series more than the first party due to having access to all three books at once. This classic work has stood the test of time, and it is likely to continue entralling new readers for generations to come."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"If you have only seen the movies, you are missing out on so much that goes on in the books. They did a phenominal job of cramming all that they did into the film, but you have got to read the book. This printing of Lord of the Rings is really cool. I usually don't like movie art on book covers but the hand of Sauron with the ring is beautiful. On the inside of the dustcover is a color map of Middle Earth, very cool. I like the hardcover because it will last longer. The single volume is great because a lot of times I find myself wanting to look back at somthing that happened or a name or whatever and with the 3 volume series you may not have either of the other 2 books and be in a pickle. Plus, if you are like me and 'misplace' stuff a lot, you have 2 less books to keep track of. This would be a great starter for a Tolkien collection, (trust me, after reading 1 of his books you will be hooked) or another great copy to add to an existing one."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is, by far, the most I've ever read for a single story. I saw the first movie which made me want to read the books. I read all three books and then a few months later, I saw The Two Towers in the theater. After reading the book, the movie pales in comparison to the imagination :)"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This work is far more than a fantasy novel, it is the creation of a virtual world, very much like ours, yet peopled with strange races and heroic quests.Tolkien's universe is very real; this is beacuase he has gone to tremendous lengths to write its history, complete with its creation myths, lost civilizations, and folklore.I read this work many times when I was young, and the lessons it taught me about honor, friendship, right and wrong, courage, and life itself have stayed with me throughout my life.The story itself forms a bridge between Tolkien's children's story, the Hobbit, and his works of mythology (The Silmarillion). The story is about a heroic quest in which an unlikely hero, Frodo Baggins, a hobbit, is called upon to challenge the very Dark Lord himself, Sauron, in completing a quest to destroy a magical gold ring that would give Sauron domination of the world. Frodo is assisted by a cast of characters including the great wizard Gandalf, who undergoes a death an resurrection in the course of the quest; an outcast king named Aragorn who regains his kingdom; his faitful servant Sam; and other hobbits, elves, dwarves, and men who stand against the Dark Lord in challenges that take place both on a personal level and on the field of battle.It is a world of remarkable beauty, told by a master storyteller who also happened to be an Oxford professor of languages. This is no amateur tale, but a profound work of myth and literature."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I know that I said that The Hobbit was John's best work, but then again this is the second part to that legacy. Of course this book gets tedious and boring at parts. But it is still a phemonal epic fantasy! It has real emotion and exciting battle scenes with orcs, trolls, Ringwraiths and more!

I have recently started doing my thesis work for my MA and I needed a PB version that I could make notes in (I didn't want to write in my 50th anniversary HB version). This edition has fantastic weight and feels very sturdy. It feels like it will hold up well over the years, which is great because I read LOTR at least once a year. It is not a showpiece, being paperback, but it does have a very nice look to it and will work beautifully as an everyday reader. If you're looking to get into LOTR, or if you just need a new copy and don't want to purchase one of the more expensive hardbacks, this is a good edition to start with."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is a beautiful book. If I had to grasp at straws to find a negative, as you read the book it expands slightly, making it harder to fit into the slip cover, and unfolding the maps can be a little tricky because there's not a whole lot of room for them to move.

The leather feel of the box and the cover of the book is very nice. The gold leaf pages look great as well.

There is enough extra paper around the perimeter of the maps that I am considering cutting them out of the binding. However, I have not done so yet. There is a section in the beginning of the book that explains the newly revised text. Unfortunately, I have not read any of the introductions nor any of novels in this particular book yet, as I am still in the process of finishing The Hobbit.

As children, we bring a different way of appreciating the written word because we have fewer prejudices and experiences with which to overanalyse.

If you have not read the book for a long time, read it again.

Since then, I have read the entire series at least once a year since then. No other book matches its depth and vision. This is a story that is a privilege to read.

It is a beautiful story, rich, varied, and positively breathtaking. And don't dare skip over the poetry, it's just as lovely. I bought the hardcover edition a couple years ago and its already beginning to fall apart. My dad's old 1972 paperback is in pieces. &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; presents the reader with a world nearly as complex as our own, full of intriguing characters, a mythical history, and depth like you wouldn't believe. I recommend this book to anyone interested in fantasy, epic, fairytales, or myth."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The author fills the pages with insight into human nature. Everything from wisdom to foolishness and every thing inbetween. It is the struggle of good verses evil with all of the varied outcomes. It is very well written, not only to the point that I can visualize the scenes but also I can smell the smells. If a person has never read any of Tolkien's tales of Middle Earth it takes a few chapters to figure out the charaters, but well worth the effert. I highly reccommend."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I am 13&amp; live in Central PA. This book was,in my oppinion, EXCELLENT! Some might not like it because it gives alot of very lengthy descriptions. The book is a continuation of 'The Hobbit'. In it Frodo Baggins, Bilbo's nephew, becomes the bearer of the ring. Gandalf the Grey finds out this ring is known as THE RING, and that the Dark Lord, who forged it&amp; then lost it, wisshes to have it back. Together with the help of some unlikely companions destroy the ring and set the world right.

The series has lengthy moderately enjoyable sections interspersed with some high action. If I stopped reading the series halfway through the final book I would have rated it 2 1/2 - 3 stars, but the ending is so powerful and moving that it just makes you glad you read the whole thing and looking back you feel like you were there on the whole journey with them.

I was blown away by the story and the way Tolkien was able to create an entire world rich with interesting races, creatures, and places. His descriptions are amazing. You will be drawn into Middle Earth like a moth to a flame.So, then the movies came out. I watch them every year during the Holidays. So, they are fairly well ingrained into my memory. I had forgotten much of the original story. So, I decided to read the book again. I found it even better the second time around. If you've never read the book and have watched the movies, I urge you to savor every word that Tolkien wrote. The movies are different from the book. The basic story is the same, but many details and scenes were left out.As others have said, there are a few minor printing issues with this edition. Some of the text is printed a little lighter than the rest on the page. But, it is completely readable. The artwork by Alan Lee more than makes up for this minor annoyance.I was very sad when I came to the end of this epic tale.

Can't wait to finish the Two Towers segment and watch the movie version."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I was deeply moved by Lord of the Ring. This is a story that I will reread many times. Having finished reading the book about 4 months ago, I already missed the characters a great deal. It is certainly a must-read! :)"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I remember rereading The Lord of the Rings in graduate school for the first time since I had read it in my early teens. I remember expecting to read something juvenile, mildly entertaining, and largely forgettable. So when I found myself weeping over the closing pages, you might say I was surprised. This was not at all the book I thought I remembered--not at all the childish sword-and-sorcery humbug I had pictured. Rather, it was a masterfully plotted, beautifully described work of immense depth and power. It was deep in many senses of the word--philosophically and morally rich, and bearing layers of background, setting, and character that invited hours of further exploration into its imaginative world.Since that time, I have reread the book about every other year, and I still weep, as Gandalf tells us we may, \\"for not all tears are an evil.\\" The ending of The Lord of the Rings is one of the saddest in literature, but it's not sad in the way so many of the brutally, even bestially, pessimistic books of the twentieth century. It's a realistic and an honest sadness, for it sums up Professor Tolkien's worldview--a view of the world as a good but corrupt place, a place where evil has marred beauty, distorted wills, and injured some people (like Frodo) beyond their ability ever to be the same again.Tolkien's work has never set well with most literary types--though there are notable exceptions (like W.H. Auden and Iris Murdoch). Sometimes the naysayers raise objections that are more or less reasoned and legitimate; more often, however, their objections reveal less about their concerns with Tolkien's writing as writing than they do about the critics' discomfort with his worldview or their unease with his popularity. I don't particularly identify with the worldview of Homer or of the Enuma Elish, but I believe that if I'm judging them as literature, I need to stick to making literary judgments."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Great books, great edition, and great illustrations by Alan Lee. The only thing I did't like was the maps don't fold out like in most other hardcover editions and are in the endpapers so down the middle of the map there is a crease."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"you shouldnt have to read reviews if you are already a tolkien fan. if you are not then dont buy this big expensive book that you might not like. remt one from a public library or borrow it from a friend. you could get one on Kindle because theyre really cheap. you should already know whether or not to get this. outstanding series"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Phew! Trying to read all three of the LOTR novels in one volume is tough. But it is more than worth the effort. This is still one of the the best stories ever written in the 20th century if not of all time. It is full of action, myth, poetry and language. The epic tone of much of the novel, like The Silmarillion, adds gravitas and excitement to this tale. Everyone who can read should read this book at least once in their life before dying. Heck! Everyone should read this more than once in their life as the themes of hope, love, and friendship will mean different things to people at different times in their life. This is my second time reading LOTR, the last time being in high school, and I have gleaned so much more out this reading than I did the last time. Having said all that, there is one criticism that I must give of this novel. There is a serious lack of character development throughout the novel. Excluding the four hobbits, no one ever really seems to change much from what they were at the beginning of the novel. Even Aragorn, one of the central characters of the novel, stays roughly the same from the beginning to the end. Gandalf doesn't change very much and, aside from switching from enemies to friends, Legolas and Gimli don't change either. Still, this is one of the greatest novels of all time and should be read by everyone."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I ordered this from Chronicles Bookstore on Amazon and it came fast in shrink wrap.The box itself looks impressive enough on anyone's shelf but the books themselves look even better. I've seen a few different versions of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy and this is by far the best looking in my opinion.The books are of a solid \\"last forever\\" build and even after heavy abuse they still look like they're in perfect condition. I highly recommend this as a gift to anyone who enjoys reading of course and fantasy especially. The movies were great but these books are even better. Get this trilogy and read a literary classic!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I first read 'Lord of the Rings' when I was 12. Ever since then I have been hoping to read a book as good, I have read many good ones but none have come close- in a way it's depressing to start at the top. Every few years I pull it off the shelf and reread it. It has many strengths, the obvious being the incredibly detailed background of Middle-earth. It is also thematically a complex work, with many underlying themes, such as faith, good vs evil, the perils of technology, and the ability of seemingly inconsequential persons to affect great events are ones that come to mind. But I also love, what seems to put off many people, the slightly archaic language Tolkien used. I find it entirely fitting, and gives the book a mythological grandeur. I include the dialogue in this judgment, there is some simply wonderful dialogue in the 'Lord of the Rings'.My favourite book ever."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is a great edition of this work. Good price. Fast shipping.

The quality of the paper and ink and binding is just O.K. for a paperback.I gave Tolkien's writing five stares.

The latest film, based on the books, Peter Jacksons \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\", really brought my interest to the story. I hadn't heard of the Trilogy until after I'd seen FOTR.I believe people sometimes need to take a break from things and enjoy a good story of such magnitude; to suspend our worries over petty things,and to embrace a story that uses our brains, forgetting our societal customs for a bit and embracing our imaginations. To dip a toe into the pond of escapism.In any case, the book is a great story with great characters. These characters act independently and with each other in an attempt to rid their world of an evil that plagues them. It is a story that has a familiar aspect to it. The Shire is reminiscent of youthful adventures, and even though there was no Gandalf when I was younger, it seems like there should have been."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I didn't like Fellowship of the Ring the first time I read it, but plowed on to the end and gave up on the other two \\"books\\" (it's really just one long book). I think I now know why. I had just read and loved The Hobbit, and was expecting another book along the same lines. In short, I feel that LOTR is about the world first, characters second, and plot last. This took me some getting used to, and I could not grasp everything the first time through.It's pure fantasy in the sense of looking around at all the wonder. (often times of things that are not magic eg, trees and grass and hills in the shire.) Indeed, the later books focuses on humans. (In the recent movies they injected Elves in places where there were none before in the story, I expect to increase general interest in the atmosphere)The result is that I did not enjoy LOTR until I took a very leisurely attitude towards it, rather than an adventurous one, notwithstanding that there are adventurous moments. Every time I read it I find some facet of the world that I did not notice before, or that I forgot. That is now when I most enjoy the book. For others to enjoy this book I think you must enjoy the moment, and not be in a hurry for the plot to advance."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Its divine the books are beautifully bound and reasonably priced, definately a must for Tolkien fanatics."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Lord of the Rings opens to the reader a whole new and vibrant world. There is so much detail that you can see very clearly what is going on. There is also enough action to keep you on the edge of your seat. Also there are great characters that you will never forget. If you want some books that will keep you interested for quite a while read The Lord Of The Rings!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Lord of the Rings provides entertainment for people of all ages. In this book Frodo receives the ring of power and sets out to destroy it. He has nine companions including himself, Gandalf a Wizard, Aragorn a Ranger, Sam a Hobbit, Legolas an Elf, Gimli a Dwarf, Pippin a Hobbit, Merry a Hobbit and Boramir a man. They go through many challenges from being chased by the Nazgul, and going through the long dark journey through the Mines of Moria. They come in contact with a Balrog while in the Mines. They loose one of their companions (so they think), Gandalf, as he fell with the Balrog. They then journey through Lothlorien and meet Galadriel along with other elves. They make their way through the great river and eventually Sam and Frodo start the journey by themselves.Reading this book requires a lot of time, but after a while you really get into the story and do not want to put it down. It took a while for me to get into it, but once I did, I enjoyed it very much.Tolkien is a very gifted author and it shows by how much this story is detailed and why it is still popular today. Many people from children, teens and adults enjoy these stories and they have entertained and taught us throughout time. I think these stories are geared more towards adults, but there are some children who enjoy them as well. Although some words are hard to pronounce and understand what they mean, he is very descriptive and even provides a lot of meanings and even maps, family trees, songs and verses, calendars, writings and spellings, people, beasts, monsters, places and things. Some children may have a hard time since this book is so in depth and has many difficult words, but if they like it that much, they can get through it. Tolkien's ideas are presented consistently, thoroughly, and logically throughout this book. He had an amazing imagination and displayed that a lot through all of his writings like The Two Towers, The Return of the King, The Hobbit, The Silmarillion, and Unfinished Tales: The Lost Lore of Middle-earth.I recommend reading this book if you enjoy fantasy and adventure. If you have seen the movie and you read the book, you learn many different things not mentioned in the movie and it makes the stories even more enjoyable. I can't wait to read the other two books and see what I have been missing out on that is not mentioned in the movie."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Having decided to order the US version of the 50th Anniversary book after reading reviews of both the UK & US versions, I was delighted to open this as my main present on Christmas morning 2005. As ever with Amazon, it was well packaged and contains everything promised!The possible added value appears to come in the fact that, on the slip case, there are 2 separate images, one on each side. One states the contents are the 50th Ann. book, the other is a production drawing of a tower. On my slip case, one of these is upside down!! This could, of course, be deliberate so that one can turn the case over and so avoid wear on one side! Whatever the case, it raised some extra smiles Christmas morning.Looking at the book itself, I've only just reached chapter 3 but having seen the \\"Extended film trilogy\\" numerous times, I'm fascinated to see just how closely the films follow (or don't) the book! So far, so good.There's no doubt this is a splendid, timeless story presented in this edition, in a unique and very attractive manner. It should form the centrepiece of any true LOTR fan's collection!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Lord of the Rings is a stunning work that mingles that which is great about traditional narrative writing with the broad-sweeping strokes of myth that do indeed touch the core of the Soul. At slightly over a thousand pages, Tolkien's masterpiece is of perfect length. A great strength of his work is that it avoids verbosity without losing the depth necessary to bring his private mythology to life in the third age of Middle-Earth.The enduring power of the Lord of the Rings is the fact that it is much more philosophically grounded than a topical or allegorical text. The themes of good, evil, friendship, nature, simplicity, and many others are all generally applicable to life throughout the ages. In order to create this landscape of definite moral clarity and beauty, Tolkien drew on his experiences as a linguist, a mythologist, and as a Roman Catholic.As a linguist, Tolkien had a copious knowledge of a variety of languages, both modern and ancient. In particular, he was a scholar of Old English and was an accomplished professor of this subject. As the means of expression between rational beings, language had a special place in Tolkien's heart. It was more than one of mere functionality but one of beauty. By means of phonetic tastes, as well as morphological and syntactical analysis, he built a linguistic structure from which he built Middle Earth, enfleshing his earliest linguistic creations within the culture of the Elves.Mythology, as a testimony to the infinite nature of God, was of great importance to Tolkien. It was by means of mythology that man is refreshed and able to view the world anew, shaking free the bonds of complacency that often developed in day-to-day living. A central theme of his personal reflections is the nature of man as a sub-creator. In particular, the creative element of the human person, endowed by a creative God, was shown forth in a special way for Tolkien in the work of the mythologist.Finally, the work of the Lord of the Rings is thoroughly Christian and specifically Catholic. His notions of privational evil, the domination of the will by enslavement to evil, a variety of overtones related to the lembas bread, and many other themes are developed from within a Catholic framework.The Lord of the Rings did not get named \\"Book of the Century\\" without due reason. The power and clarity of its message deserve lauds because the text bears much good fruit. I suggest this book to everyone because of its influential role and its great message and story!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Finally, the great work is published in one volume as it was meant to be."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"it is a must for any Tolkien lover, but at the price for this book I would expect perfection.

Tolkien completely creates an entire world, complete with history, language, family trees, the whole deal. And he takes you there, on a journey you'll never forget. You can't just read these (the three parts) once...every time you read them you get a little more out of them. The characters are loveable or hateable, the battle between good and evil continues, and heroes are made. Cities are created so well you know them personally; people the same. The Lord of the Rings has everything: true love, monsters, good guys, bad guys, swordplay, magic, devotion...it pulls up all the emotions but leaves you with a sense of completion. Like I said, the greatest work of it's kind ever, and definitely deserving to be read."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"What other work in the whole genre of other-world fantasy can even approach the grendeur and significance of The Lord of the Rings? None. The very finest later examples, such as Frank Herbert's Dune cycle, if push came to shove, still wouldn't displace it from the pinnacle. And very few of the multitude of would-be LOTRs deserve even to be mentioned in the same breath. The creation of a vivid, three-dimensional world with a rich culture, history, languages, pantheon, and mythos is only part of the tremendousness of the achievement. On top of that, the story is wonderful, the writing both idiosyncratic and engaging, sometimes funny, sometimes poetic, the marvellous web of foreshadowing and interconnected plot elements, everything about the LOTR is classic. The few stylistic problems of diction or characterization are minor, even endearing. Like Shakespeare to the Fantasy genre. Invaluable, Priceless, Timeless."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have found this the best written creation ever. It is not as dull as Shakespeare's most books, who will talk to you about fobidenn love, but this book is magic itself.

This is the definitive way to listen to Tolkien!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Tolkien's LOTR is the Ur-epic of English literature; it cannot be compared to standards of greatness because it is itself that standard. More than simply a rousing adventure story (altho' it is that), more than a masterpiece of prose and imagination (altho' it is these things), it recaptures forgotten memories of lost times and places and explores the realms of fantastic wonder as well as the subtle paths of the heart. A terrible beauty. Twenty-five years after my first exposure to its pages, it still weaves a spell, revealing new truths and insights with the passing of the days. A gift from the Valar to bring us Home over the Western Sea."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ.MAGIC CREATURES ARE FABOLOUS,TOLKIEN MADE NEW WORLD WITH ITS HISTORY FUTURE,THE WORLD OF HOBITS,ORCS,ELFS,GOBLINS,WIZARDS...THE POEMS ARE SO INCREDIBLE,EVERY PART OF BOOK IS FANTASTIC,I LOVED ESPECIALY GANDALF AND FRODO.

Put this book on your bookshelf next to your Bible, Koran, Book or Morman or Baghvad Gita. You can learn something about life from it every time you pick it up. Joy, sorrow, love, hate, war and peace all in a (short) few thousand pages. Truly an amazing work of literature."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"...This is not lightweight fantasy, this is worldbuilding on a grand scale. Tolkien's achievement ranges from the epic to the intimate, painting a canvas which draws the reader in and makes us feel deeply for the characters. It is difficult to sum up in a few words what LoTR is about: the struggle between the forces of good and evil certainly, but it's also about loyalty and friendship and honor and difficult choices and sacrifice and hope...woven in a rich tapestry involving the creation of beings and languages that came solely from Tolkien's imagination. You will laugh, you will cry, you will never forget experiencing Middle Earth for the first time. If your first exposure to Tolkien is through Peter Jackson's movies, now treat yourself to the whole story. Middle Earth awaits!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I just want to say that the print quality of this book is rather bad, there are many letters with tiny blank spaces and not very well printed characters; there are little black spots throughout the text as well.

I think it's not worth the price, not at least until the publisher will be able to put these things right. I personally recommend to purchase a less fancy (but better printed) paperback edition. If I had known that this hardback edition contained so many typographic errors, I would have saved my money without doubt.The Lord of the Rings is a great and challenging book but this \\"renowned\\" edition has been a letdown for me and does not do justice to this literary classic.Publishers, edit a new reprinted and revised edition please."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Without a doubt the greatest book ever written.

Seeing the movies has made reading the books easier. You can see all the faces and act it all out in your head.

The movies was so great i though i would actually read the book. It is the greastest book ever written! The amount of detail put into forming this world is so great you want to be there. The story is basically good versus evil but what makes it so great is the characters. Everyone is important in the story for the main quest, destroying the one ring.

I'm an adict! I love these books! Everytime I finish the series, I get that bittersweet feeling, and start over. I pause to read other books, but every other book I read (if not more often than that) is the Lord of the Rings. It's a fast-paced action adventure with something for every whim. It brings us face to face with the lowest of evil and the highest powers of good. We can see the strenght of hope and love in Sam and Frodo, as well as the powerful will of greed and corruption in Denethor and Sauruman. We see the deepest of love (Aragorn and Arwen) and hate (Gollum). I could go on forever. These are truely wonderful books."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Lord of the rings is without a doubt the best book i have ever read. the film is a credit to the book and the book is brilliant. each time you read it you pick up things you didn't notice the time before.I think that this book is undoubtedly one of the best ever written and i really like tolkeins style of writing and portrail of the charadcters!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is a wonderful audio version of the book (I am talking about the BBC cassette version). It is virtually unabridged, all important scenes are there (the only notable casualty being the scenes with Tom Bombadil) and all the characters get a great treatment. The performances are excellent, without exception.The voices are all well chosen and represent the characters the way I imagined them while reading the book. Gandalf sounds witty and irascible, Gollum is both creepy and pityable, and Aragorn hath a very thekthy lithp. The whole thing is stirring and exciting all the way and has the epic feel of the book.

I listened to those tapes until they wore out! As a gift, my parents gave me this boxed set a few years ago. I know practically every line and I still cry at the end. It is, in my opinion, the best story ever translated into an audio version. This version is true to the book moreso than the movie or any other audio recording. The characters draw you into the story and you become a part of it by creating your own vision of &quot;Middle Earth&quot; around their voices. Every time I listen to it, I think of home and my family because, for us, it was (and still is) a family activity. This is a book and audio recording every family should own!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I first read this book when I was 15. As soon as I finished, I started at the beginning again - I couldn't bear to stop living in Middle-Earth. Tolkien not only invents a plot and characters, he invents whole cultures with separate histories and languages. It took him years to write, and you can tell. This is no book that some hack writer slapped out in a couple of months. Every other fantasy writer since then has tried - and failed - to live up to this incredible standard.I am now 47 and read the trilogy again every year. I still fall in love with it every time and hate to close the book at the end. Tolkien's use of language is a delight, and the book still surprises me each time, I find something I missed before.

The blackish leather is very dull in finish and you better be sure to sterilize your hands before ever touching it. It shows the most minute amount of moisture or grease as a stain. I am afraid to touch it. The attached title and image on the box cover are very nice, as are the beatiful multi-color images and printing on the outside cover and spine of the book. They are much more accurate, though no more beatiful, than the graphics on the red book edition. And sorry, but I greatly prefer the \\"faux\\" leather cover. First of all, hello, it's RED (this is supposed to be the Red Book of Westmarch after all)! Also, the faux leather seems much less fragile to the touch and has a nice pebbly finish and sheen. The black leather cover is just dull. I've never seen such a drab leather finish on an expensive book.Inside the book, the guilded pages,the place ribbon, and the two multi-color fold out maps on the new edition are very nice features. That's all I have to say that is positive. My copy's pages are poorly centered on the spine (the bottom of the pages is barely inside the cover, and there was a lot of messy glue that I had to remove carefully. This quality lapse in assembly is inexcusable. Aside from a few pages, the prining is just black. I am not qualified to compare the typefaces, or printing and paper quality as these seem to be about equal. The Red Collector's Edition has two color on EVERY PAGE with red chapter names and page numbers. It looks beautiful. All in all, the printed pages of the Anniversary Edition are just dull by comparison.I guess it's just a matter of personal taste and many find the various quality touches of the Anniversay justify the price, but to me I wish I has not bought it. I would suggest that you find an actual copy in a bookstore to at least look it over before purchasing at Amazon's really quite excellent price. I will continue to love my appropriately red 1974 Collector's Edition as my most cherished copy of my most cherished book of all time."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"While it would be nice if the maps were in the book, and if more of the images had been included, this is a great book.The text has all of the corrections up to the most recent print editions, the story is great and these are books any fan of fantasy should read."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I first received *The Lord of the Rings* as part of a boxed set, complete with *The Hobbit,* for Christmas in 1985. I also received a boxed set of the first four *Dune* books. I was 13 and in 8th grade.Like many 13-year olds, I loved *The Hobbit* but I thought *The Lord of the Rings* was simply awful. For one thing, the plot was not immediately obvious to me. (Keep in mind that at the time my enjoyment reading primarily comprised Doctor Who novelizations and Choose Your Own Adventure books.) Instead of the short chapters of plot and dialogue to which I was accustomed, Tolkien provided page after page of exposition, describing the local color and history with any \\"action\\" provided almost as an afterthought. And then there is what may have been the biggest problem of all with *The Lord of the Rings,* the scores of strangely named characters and places, some of whom are central to the story and others of whom are purely peripheral and which is which is unclear. I mean, sheesh, who names their two main villains Sauron and Saruman, names that differ by only one syllable?It should be here noted that while I loved reading at age 13, I was also not the best reader. Memories of reading what I managed to of the trilogy consist mainly of reading a single page over and over and over again just to follow the main thread of the story. Somehow I managed to finish *The Fellowship of the Ring* and made it a few dozen pages into *The Two Towers* before I threw up my hands and abandoned Tolkien to the realm of \\"authors I think are overrated.\\" I still have a vague recollection of giving a a pretty worthless presentation on the first book in front of Mrs. Fox's English class, the same class I was in when the Challenger exploded. (I also have an even vaguer memory of reviewing some disposable piece of genre SF calledDushau (Dushau Trilogy, No 1), but that's another story.) In short, I never thought I would ever read this book again, and considered all those folks who worshiped Tolkien to be little short of fools.Fast-forward sixteen years. It's Christmas time in Champaign, and I'm attending *The Two Towers* with my coworkers, mainly because the bosses gave us cinema tickets for the holidays. As the movie begins to unfold, I remember those few dozen pages that I read at 13, and I slowly begin the journey of reappraising Tolkien. While I agree with those who urge reading the book as well as simply seeing the movie, I think that in this case I could not have done the former if I had not done the latter. Peter Jackson's trilogy allowed me to familiarize myself with the overall story arch (something that was hard for me to do from within the perspective of the novel, at least at first) and also helped me to handle the enormous cast of strangely named characters. (Finally Saruman and Sauron were decidedly distinct characters in my mind's eye, and the logic behind their naming, based as it is on Tolkien's invented languages, became more apparent.) So in fall of 2007 I finally decided to give the damned book another chance, mooched the one-volume \\"trilogy\\" (apparently Tolkien always considered it one big novel) through BookMooch, chose it over the New Testament for 2008's \\"big book\\" (sorry Mom), and devoured it in January, 2008.In short, I loved it, particularly the exposition and the bizarre names for characters and places. Strange, huh, how the passage of time will do that to one's sensibilities? The very features of the novel that I found off-putting in 1985, I found absolutely ingenious in 2008. The names and locations in *The Lord of the Rings* all figure into a much-vaster cosmology and narrative history, and this becomes more apparent when the reader peruses the voluminous appendices. All the details that seemed arbitrary and distracting from \\"the action\\" were in fact anything but arbitrary, deriving as they did from a comprehensive mythology (of a world that did not exist until Tolkien wrote it into existence!). Take for example the appendix on the \\"translation\\" of the text explaining why Tolkien chose English words like \\"elf\\" and \\"dwarf\\" and \\"halfling\\" to \\"translate\\" the \\"original\\" Elvish words. Apart from the implication that there is really an original manuscript written in Elvish, this appendix also implies that the \\"elves\\" in this story aren't really elves, the \\"dwarves\\" aren't really dwarves, etc., but that these are the closest analogs that the translator could find in fantastic literature.That these 1,000+ pages, with all their hyper-detailed exposition, are merely the tip of the iceberg of Tolkien's invented world, makes the novel all the more amazing. This really is a masterpiece of storytelling and myth-making. I can understand now why so many people love this book. I think I'm now one of them."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The sufferings of the reluctant Frodo, the stoutness of Samwise, the heroic endurance and faith of Aragorn, the fall of Beorn, the slimy humaness of Gollum-Smeagol, the old wizard Gandalf -- I have run into readers that cite only one of these characters as the lone reason they must continue to read the Lord of the Rings again and again.I was introduced to this masterpiece by a strange, elderly woman while a sick grade-school student in the early 1960s. I bless her again and again now almost four decades later for letting me into the mind of J.R.R. Tolkien. This dark, inspiring work was written in England during World War II, although Tolkien began thinking about Middle-Earth before he served in World War I. Middle-Earth truly is a masterpiece of imagination, created by a word archeologist.

In 7 fantastic days I read through The Hobbit and LOTR, an awesome experience.The deliberate pacing of sections of Fellowship and Two Towers only served to make my heart race wildly in the Return of the King. J.R.R. Tolkien has few equals in the use of imagery save perhaps C.S. Lewis. I can see with clarity the Palantir clouded with the hands of Denethor, the coming of the fleet of Umbar flying the standard of Elendil flying to the rescue of Gondor. The regal majesty of Aragorn hiding under dour Ranger garb. The perfect beauty of Arwen.Even after dozens of readings over 15 years the picture in my mind becomes ever more clear.As for my bookshelf, Tolkien has overtaken Trek - and well he should.

To me it takes on much more meaning than just a &quot;book,&quot; &quot;fantasy novel,&quot; or anything of that sort. It is another world that is a concrete possibility in my mind. His writing style(s) of course have a great influence on this. While reading it many a time, I could not help but to become so involved in this world that it was as if I were in it myself. Night after night, staying up for hours into the morning (as I am now), reading, reading, and reading again. What an experience!!! Tolkien has put forth a wonderful world...I would much sooner classify his writings of Middle Earth, primarily &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and the &quot;Silmarillion,&quot; as &quot;Theoretical&quot; rather than &quot;Fantasy.&quot; Indeed, many a time have I mused over the possibility in my mind that he played the role only of a translater of an ancient script, or of many. However it was that these wonderful writings came about, I am extremely grateful for the gift given us in them.

For days I could not sleep for fear I would have to put the book down - the creation of this world is so extensive and well thought out that it baffles even the concept of what fiction is to me - for I believed that every charachter lived and breathed - Gandalf surely has a temper to be feared, I shivered when I could see it begin to smoulder in his eyes and I certainly cried when I thought the Barlog had defeated him. Every charachter was fascinating - Tolkien's gift was that of life and a superior imagination - one that created a world in which no other author can contest, complete and whole. I have read this book 13 times and suspect that I will keep reading it till my eyes fail me, by which time I am sure I will have my grandchildren well enough trained to be reading it to me. Obsession you say ? Nay - just pure admiration for the great mind which has created such a work, such a masterpiece.

If you have a brain and an imagination and you want to do something special for it, then read the Tolkien tale Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. Your life will never be the same."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Lord of the Rings is the most rereadably ripping yarn of the 20th century. No modern literary fiction has been nearly so devotedly reread by its admirers.To foreshorten, hobbits are not just rabbits or even leprechauns: hobbits are Pycts (evidently migrant pygmies, who picked Britain out of all the world, before even the Celts came, following whom Romans, Saxons and Normans became Britons too). Tolkien's interlaced narrative is as Dickensian as it is medieval, and hobbits are Dickensian ambassadors to Valhalla.Like all of Tolkien's fictions, The Lord of the Rings is a saga: the story of a family's place in the history of the world. Frodo and Sam, master and servant, become family. With reference presumably to Malory's Arthur, Tolkien termed The Lord of the Rings a Romance. The point being that, unlike almost all other longer modern prose fictions, The Lord of the Rings is not a novel. Nor is it a fanciful gloss of medieval society, but rather of medieval literature per se.There are female characters in The Lord of the Rings, and the journeys of the Fellowship are great nature hikes. The Lord of the Rings has been translated into many languages.There are 1100+ lines of verse in the Old and Middle English alliterative meters, the long, common and half ballad measures and two neoClassical meters, the leonine hexameter and the English fourteener; plus an invented-language group in pastiches of metrical devices from various Celtic, Germanic and Latinate traditions. There is a near-hiatus of verse in volume two after its first hundred pages, and volume three's reprise of all prior metrical modalities features the Old English meter prominently. There are also Tolkien's own runes and his son's map.To the Bible belt school of Tolkien criticism I should recommend Thucydides' History of the Pelloponesian War, in which I count a few hundred parallels. The Lord of the Rings is neither childish nor humorless: it's preChristianitively stern.I look forward to a full-length animation with landscapes in the manner of Ted Nasmith and hobbits in that of Darrell Sweet, in which Sam will have a Liverpool accent."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"That says it all - and I'm not excluding Shakespeare! Tolkien creates and sustains a credible alternate reality with exquisite detail - even including maps and complete languages for multiple races. Written as an exercise in creating a modern-day fairy tale, it easily transcends the genre into a truly stunning epic.LOTR and \\"The Silmarillion\\" comprise a unique convergence of scholarship and insight into the nature of good, evil, and heroism, all told in a totally engrossing tale. I first read it in 1968, sitting in a motel room, suffering from the flu at a job site far from home. I became so engrossed, I read all three volumes at one sitting, sending me back home in urgent need of medical care. I've since read it four more times and, having recently seen the movie, will soon read it again.When \\"The Silmarillion\\" was published, I also read it cover-to-cover in one sitting, but fortunately I wasn't sick then. Unfortunately, I read \\"The Hobbit\\" after LOTR, which was a mistake. Since \\"The Hobbit\\" is a children's fantasy story, it's a real letdown if you've already delved in to the rich detail of LOTR.The only caveat is that this is not an easy read. It's easy to get lost in all the detail, but the effort pays huge dividends. One of my grandduaghters read it at age 11 and shares my opinion of it (she hasn't yet made it though \\"The Silmarillion\\" though, which is an even harder read). On the other hand, a grandson tried to read it at age 15 and gave up on it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I've just received the book and I am so happy of this purchase!LOTR is absolute my favourite book. I read it more than once in Italian when I was in my teens and every time I grew fond of new and different characters and places of the Middle Earth. It was always sad to reach the very last page of the book and to say goodbye to Frodo, Gandalf and the rest of the Fellowhip. After having seeing Peter Jackson's movie I decided to read the book in English, I really wanted to know the very words used by Tolkien. I'm starting the second chapter of the first book but I can already say that I'm really enjoying Tolkien's way of writing.Alan Lee is as well my favourite painter. I fell in love with his art when I was a child when I received a book full of his watercolours and drawings. Lee has perfectly represented the atmosphere, the characters and places described by Tolkien. I was so pleasantly surprised to know that Alan Lee's concepts were behind the marvellous scenarios of the movie.For all these reasons I couldn't miss this edition of the LOTR.

It is delightful, exciting, full of visual imagery. Tolkien was best at character development and one cannot help but become engrossed with the ultimate fate of Frodo, Sam, Aragorn, even Gollum. There is a wide chasm betweeen those good and those evil (unlike in Harry Potter).I always thought this would make a good movie series as well, and it proves to be so. My first experience with the LOTR was in high school. At 45 years of age,I re-read it this year before the movie came out and was smitten all over again."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The LOTR trilogy is an incredible feat. Its predecessor, The Hobbit, was as complete and spellbinding story as could be written.The LOTR surpassed this. What seemed like a grand adventure in The Hobbit was dwarfed by the sheer breadth of the trilogy.Tolkien, being a professor in Medieval English in addition to mastering related subjects, shines with his deep knowledge and love of the craft. It is impossible to not be swept away into his imaginary land that somehow leaves the reader a true believer.The FOTR was a gratifying first book. Two Towers was more difficult to read whatwith the heavy use of antiquated verbage, but enjoyable just the same.ROTK was rewarding - as any final chapter should be - but I sensed Tolkien increased his marked pace that existed in the first two books. I felt as though he needed to finish this story that consumed him as desperately as the powers of good sought to end Sauron's reign of evil.I read the LOTR to my son, who along with me, at times found it impossible to put down. I remember, more than once, the hoarseness in my voice from reading outloud too many hours on end.I rate the LOTR an excellent 5, but do state that it is not mild reading, and to perservere through The Two Towers as you will be more than thrilled that you did.Excellent story, and in regards to enjoyability factor, easily surpasses the movie."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The movie is amazing. One of the best I've ever seen. And these new versions of the books will get a lot of attention from people who see the movie.Now, that said, these books can be hard to get into. I'm not saying they're bad, they're pretty good, but to the average reader, it might be a little overwhelming if they're not familiar with Tolkien's style. He loves to describe everything to the smallest detail.I'm here to tell you to stick with them. Don't even think of putting the book down. If you do, you'll regret it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"No, of course he wasn't, but I find his childish Dungeons and Dragonisms O, so amusing, and I think they are a refreshing water to be dashed (with no doubt pitiful result) on the roaring Tolkien furnace.Of course he is missing out if he has only read the first 130 pages, but really, not everyone HAS to enjoy these, and some of the things in his review remind me of the things that Tolkien himself sometimes says (&quot;I am aware that not everyone will enjoy this, but I have no cause to complain as I have similar opinions of their own works,&quot; etc).If the notorious reader from Spokane ever returns to this site, I just want make sure he knows that without The Lord of the Rings his Dungeons and Dragons game would never been invented. Instead of looking at the novels through your Dungeons and Dragons glasses (&quot;Tom Bombadil is such a pathetic NPC&quot;)try to step back in time and see these as the stories they were before D&amp;D was ever dreamed of, and dwarves, elves (or, as they were before Tolkien, dwarfs and elfs) and other folk were &quot;mere figures of fun.&quot; They seem stereotypical now only because so many other ideas have been based on Tolkien's groundbreaking fantastic. My advice is, Hang in there. Tom Bombadil is not my favorite character either, (though the Barrow-wights are intriguing) but once you get into the main part of the book you'll be able to see how three novels could chase the face of the fantasy genre forever. Reader from Spokane, without this book you'd be reading Snow WHite and Seven Dwarves.Obviously, everything that might be said about the books has already been; it would be superfluous to say that they are the greatest fantasy books ever."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Second only to the BIBLE, this is the greatest book ever! J.R.R. Tolkien was a Christian who was able to create a world and a conflict between good and evil of Biblical dimension and impact. The Ring is a device of Sauron (a fallen angel in Tolkien's world) that represents his power. The point of the book is that evil must be annihilated utterly. To use the ring corrupts its user and even the desire for it drives many to wicked and lustful desires (see Boromir). Saruman, a once good wizard (Wizards in Tolkien's world are basically created angelic beings) becomes corrupted merely by delving into the study of Sauron and his evil ways. Tolkien blows away anything else in the &quot;fantasy&quot; genre. Pay careful attention to key scenes such as the confrontation between Gandalf and Saruman in &quot;The Two Towers&quot;. No spells to cast here, Saruman's power is broken because he fails to repent of his wickedness and he loses his authority as the head of the wizard's council."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Lord of the Rings Trilogy is one of the greatest fantasy series ever written. When I first began reading the books, I was swept away into the land of Middle Earth. A land that was on the brink of turmoil - the Ring had been found. A plain gold ring but full of deadly, sinister magic that was a constant reminder of the One who made the Ring and was determined to retrieve it, at whatever cost. So begins the quest of Frodo the hobbit, the adopted heir of Bilbo who some years earlier discovered the Ring. Now Frodo and eight other companions must journey to the land of Mordor. There, it is left to Frodo to destroy the Ring by casting it into the fires of the raging volcano known as Mt Doom. Nine set out but will Nine return? Who or what follow the companions? Dangers, obstacles will be thrown in their path as they journey closer to a land as black and foul as the heart of Sauron the Dark One himself."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I just want to say, you have to read this book. you'll forget all around you. you'll be transported to another world. a world of fantasy. the best world i have ever been imagining. and then, you'll be surprised. you'll wish that dream never ends...you'll be transported to the World of Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"So,when I began reading this book I thought it\`s just another fantasy book.But I was mistaken the book contains so many charachters speeches and amazing things.The book in short words kidnaps you for ever you just keep reading it on and on until you get crazy from it but its just a never ending story and you never get bored from it.So if you are looking for a really good deep and awesome book.I\`ll recommend this one."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I started reading &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; last year, and I stopped a couple of times. I did not think much of the first book (there are six books, or chapters, on the Trilogy), but once I got around page 200... Gosh! I could not stop.Tolkien's characters are rich, and they experience growth along the book (they also grow on you). There is a great complexity in the book, and the history that is narrated on the book (not just the story) seems real.What impressed me most about the book was the pains Tolkien went through to create such a detailed and life rich world, including its past. I do not think I have read a book like this before.Something that got me started on the book again was the upcoming movie Internet site. If you go to the download section, you can see the shadows of Hobbits, Dwarves, Elves and Men, and to me it was really helpful."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Tolkien's trilogy, The Lord of the Rings (The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, The Return of the King) is, without a doubt, the greatest work of fantasy ever written. With a sweepingly epic tale, grand prose, and beautifully fleshed-out characters, Tolkien has created the War and Peace for the fantasy genre. The characters...what can be said? I have never had the joy of reading a novel filled with so many characters about whom so much is known. Tolkien is masterful at introducing people (from hobbits to wizards), making us fall in love with them, their dreams and desires, their faults, and their fears. Even a character as deplorable as Saruman can be enjoyed because of the instant journey you can see his character has taken (simply from references other characters in the novel make about him!). Tolkien has written a most theatrical work, a little bit of fantastic genius springing from a work of fun and adventure (the Hobbit, its predecessor). It is said that almost all fantasy since Tolkien has drawn in one way or another from this work. I only wish they could come as close to perfection. There is a movie trilogy being filmed (2000) of Tolkien's epic. I know things will be pared down to allow for a movie timespan, but let us hope they preserve the beauty of one of the finest literary works of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"For lovers of Fantasy (i.e. magic, and sorcerers e.t.c) this book is a MUST READ. It deals with the genre in a mature, practical way. It is the greatest fantasy book ever written. For general readers, this book is a MUST READ too! As it says on the back cover: &quot;The English-speaking world is divided into halves. Those who have read the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, and those who are going to.&quot; For Star Wars fans, this book is a must read too, because this is where George Lucas got his inspiration. Do not be daunted by the size of this story. It is one long story, but it keeps you hooked all the way. A person's life isn't complete without reading Lord of The Rings! Some people have made a few outrageous claims and said the book is racist/or male-chauvinistic. All I can say to these people is that they are looking to find the slightest pre-text to get offended. This book is a fantasy book, and as the writer himself mentions he just wanted to write a story, and there are no allegorical references of ANY KIND. Take this story for what it is. Just a story, and a FICTIONAL one at that. Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This book is the pinnacle masterwork of the twentieth century. From its epic symbolism to its grand scope, Tolkein's legends from Middle Earth are more than just the stories they tell. They are the foundation for all fantasy that has followed them including, but not limited to, media as varied as The Shanarra books by Terry Brooks, and Star Wars by George Lucas. To say that these books have had a profound impact on our society and culture is to underestimate their importance; to herald them as the best of all time is to give credit to an artistic master."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Words can't express how good this book is. It really is a fantastic tale full of adventure, danger and emotion. The book should be included among some of the greatest English mythology. You HAVE to read this, it's sooo good. It tells the tale of Frodo the Hobbit and his quest to destroy the One Ring forged by Sauron in MiddleEarth, the end of the Third Age, the return of the King of Gondor and the remaking of Narsil, the sword of the heirs of Elendil and of the passing of the Elves over the Western Sea. An absolute must - already the downloads for the movie coming out in 2001 have surpassed those of Star Wars: Episode 1, and I for one can't wait for the movie to come out.................."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Like i say, if you haven't read this book, you can not consider yourself a truly well read person. It is the ultimate in fantasy literature, but so much more. This man, and this book are the fore fathers of one of the most important book genres today. Read it now, or if you have already, read it again, its worth it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The only bad thing about Tolkien's masterpiece, is finding something to read afterwards."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I know many people have different tastes in literature, and that is fine. But for someone to read the Lord of the Rings and say it had no feelings and wasn't great is missing the picture. The story is about myth and fantasy. Before this work, how much imagination was present in modern literature? Tolkien spent most of his life creating a world, describing every stone and blade of grass, and forming entire languages for its inhabitants. When I first read it, it was difficult to get involved in the story. So I read it again at a later time, and you know what? Each time I read it I discover something I missed before, and only then can you truly discover the magic of Tolkien's work. Please don't be too hasty in your judgement !!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is a sweeping work. Tolkien's elegant prose gives the reader a grand picture of a world as real as our own. While the events happen in a fantasy setting, there are many profound insights on the realities of life and human nature, as well as many religious insights that reflect upon Tolkien's Catholicism. While the trifold book is hardly light reading, it is well worth the time to read. I highly recommend it to anyone with a little patience."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I bought this CD version of TLOTR in order to introduce the story to my wife as we went on a road trip from Texas to Colorado a few years ago.Although both this and The Hobbit were true to the original story, the dramatization was poor and lacked emotion. The audio value is bad, with volume problems. The music was at best loud, at worse bothersome.Still, we listened to it, and my wife was introduced to two classics of literature.(this review is for the boxed, CD recording of the books)"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I love Lord of the Rings. I like how there is so many characters and it kinda relates to reality. I also like the adventures that the characters go through. The information that the book gives you let your imagination go. It the best book ever!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This book changed my life. Before it I was a spotty 14 year old hooked on my science studies. Then I read LOTR, and, at the same time, discovered women existed and.....but thats enough of that. You want to hear about the book.By now there are few people who haven't at least heard of LOTR, and most of them have an opinion. There are the fans, almost fanatics, and there are the people who have read fifty pages or so, sometimes five or six times, but just can't get it, and don't understand what the fuss is about. I might have been one of them, if it hadn't been for an accident.I asked my local librarian to recommend a book for me as I had read all the Arthur C Clarke and Isaac Asimov works they had. She pointed me at LOTR, and handed me what she said was book 1 of 3. It was only when I got home I found I had book 2: The Two Towers.I arrived in the story just at the point where the first film ends - The Fellowship is broken and Frodo and Sam are heading for Mordor.I think that is what made me keep reading -I had started at a point of crisis and I needed to know what happened next. Of course I had a lot of blanks to fill in, but I managed to pick up most of them as I went along , and I caught up with the first book as soon as I'd finished the third. (I bought the big all-in-one paperback, the one with the yellow cover. If you were a student in the seventies it was obligatory to have one lying about, all battered and torn to show that it had been read several times. You used to see backpackers in their hundreds on the trains going south through Europe, all with this version of LOTR falling apart in their hands.)As for starting at the begining, I believe the reason a lot of people give up is that they are expecting heroes, wizards and high magic. What they get is, in great detail, the rural goings-on of a bunch of small hairy creatures who eat and drink a lot and seem to live in an idealised version of the Home Counties. Anyone who has read \\"The Hobbit\\" will know that there is more to the Hobbits than that, but newcomers often feel cheated and give up.They don't know what they're missing.The story only picks up AFTER Bilbo's birthday party, and after the passing of his ring of invisibility to Frodo. Gandalf, a wizard, discovers the true nature of the ring. It is a magic item of great power, belonging to Sauron himself, a dark god intent on taking dominion over the world.Gandalf tells Frodo that the ring must be taken to a place of safety, to Rivendell, where the high-elves hold out against Sauron.And so the great journey starts, with Frodo and his friends, Sam, Merry and Pippin, taking the road to Rivendell. On the way they have many adventures, and the mood begins to darken with the appearance of the dark riders, servants of Sauron intent on finding the ring.The travelling band is befriended by Strider, a ranger of the north, and he helps them get to Rivendell, but not before Frodo is wounded by the dark riders, and starts to understand the power of the ring.At Rivendell, many things are revealed; the history of the ring is told, Strider is shown to be Aragon, the rightful heir to the kingdom of Middle-Earth, and a fellowship is forged, of wizards, elves, dwarves, men and hobbits. They form a band of nine who will try to take the ring to Mount Doom, a volcano where the ring was forged, and which is the only place where it can be destroyed.And so the adventure truly begins. From here on we have battles in deep mountain mines, the loss of one of the Fellowship, encounters with elves in enchanted forests, treachery and betrayal leading to the breaking of the fellowship - and we're still in Book 1!Books 2 and 3 deal with the fight for middle-Earth, with Aragon and his allies taking the battle to Sauron and his minions and Frodo and Sam trying to reach Mount Doom to destroy the ring. There are huge, stirring, battle scenes, moments of humour (especially when the younger hobbits meet the Ents), spectacular feats of high magic when the White Rider enters the battle scenes, and moments of great friendship and tenderness - I defy anyone to have a dry eye when Sam and Frodo are parted at Shelob's lair.It all builds up to a terrific climax, and the story comes full circle back at Hobbitton where we see the effect the war has had on the rural life of the Hobbits.And that is why the beginning is important - you might not see it till right at the end, but it is teaching us a lesson about the value of the simpler things in life - respect them or lose them.Tolkein's genius lies in melding these simple aspects with world-shattering events, showing how even the \\"little people\\" have their part to play in the fight against the darkness.And he also knows that the best villain is a mysterious one....Sauron hardly appears at all in the books, but his dark presence stretches over everything, and he's always there, his evil eye seeing everything.I used to have nightmares about that large, red-rimmed eye, but that was before I discovered women, grew my hair, developed a liking for Hawkwind and Led Zeppelin, and started to write fantasy fiction. I've never been the same since...... but that's another long story."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is a must buy product. The book is so fascinating youll find yourself rereading the storys over and over again. As they say &quot;There are 2 types of people in the world: peolple who have read THE LORD OF THE RINGS and people who will read it.&quot; This is also way better than the movie becasue once you read it you will find out that it really is much different from the movie."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Tolkien creates a world and breathes so much life in it. These three books can not be separated. They are a trio. So much of the story is built in its characters and the plot is interesting. The main player Frodo has to take the One Ring and throw it into the pits of Mount Doom. Seems easy enough right. Oh yeah don't forget that Ringwraiths are after it, everyone who comes into contact with the ring wants to use it to control Middle Earth, you get separated from your best friend, a crazy split personality helps guide you along the way, and that Sauraman and Sauron are both trying to find you. A great story that weaves so much action and interesting characters (Gimli, Merry, Aragorn, Pippin, Treebeard, Gollum, Gandalf, Sauraman, Theoden, Samwise, and Legolas) together without missing a beat. These books are just plain awesome."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I saw the first two movies before I read the books, and having seen them, I knew I had to read the books, which I'm in the process of doing. No, I haven't finished the trilogy, but this is what I can tell you so far: Yes, the books are hard to read, at least, in the beginning. As you get more into the books, the action improves. Keep in mind, the books weren't intended for little kids or pure amusement. The books were intended to provoke thought on the triumph of good over evil and the sacrifices it entails.Tolkien's works are nothing short of masterpieces and I fully intend to finish the complete series by the time The Return of the King hits the theaters!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"It was C.S. Lewis who said:\\" Here are beauties which pierce like swords and burn like cold iron; here is a book that will break your your heart... good beyond hope\\" and was completely correct, although if you cannot see what he means, once you read it will be clear. This book shows the divine line between good and evil and how evil can overcome good like a shadow. But shadows are only temporary and evil can only destroy itself. The Lord of the Rings is a book that will win your heart, mind, and soul . Tolkien has created a world so real ,loving, and terrible that you would wish it were like your own. The book is finely descriptioned and will make you think that you yourslef lived there. Tolkien puts it in words that should never be changed or revised becasue history should never be changed or revised. The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King is one novel consisting of three books containing two books in each. This story is about a Hobbit, a hairy footed stump high little man, who destiny was not intended on his own nor by the Ring of Power. On his mission to destroy which he grows to utterly love is a compelling story for the household and the mind."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is a wonderful book, and is advised to readers, as bed times stories, to serious studies.

Sure, there arent really times like this for us to live through but if we can capture some of the feeling of this series in our everyday lives then we have more than most people do.

But the story of Aragorn and Arwen in the apendixes moved me to tears and I hope to one one day find a woman like her.

On one level, it's the fantasy book that revolutionized the whole genre. It paved the way for thousands of books after it, and influenced almost every modern fiction writer in one way or another. On another level, it's a classic piece of literature that can stand tall even when compared to the great 19th century works. It's a story of human nature, of strength, of morality, and at its very heart, it's a love story.

Likewise, if you have only read the oft described &quot;charming&quot; Hobbit, then a whole new world lays in wait for you.I invite you to make this classic a part of you life as it has become a part of mine.

I had to glue it together twice."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Lord of the Rings consists of three parts, that is The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King. It tells the story of the halfling Frodo Baggins, who receives a magic Ring of Invisibility from his uncle Bilbo (see The Hobbit). Frodo discovers that the ring has the power to control the entire world and, he discovers, to corrupt its owner. Joined by fellow hobbits, dwarfs, elves, and men he goes on a mission to destroy the Ring by casting it into the fires of the Crack of Doom where it was forged. Their mission is opposed by Sauron and his evil Black Riders. In summary the book recounts the Great War of the Ring and the closing of Middle-Earth's Third Age. It is a time men rise to dominance and the magic of old begins to fade.The book is exciting, detailed, filled with diversity of scenes and characters. Tolkien's masterpiece is exhaustive and it is difficult to imagine another fantasy novel being it's equal.

Please take my word that The Lord of the Rings is worth your time: whether you are a fantasy fan or not. Don't read all of the reviews because it's best to know as little as you can coming in.Another problem I see here is the rating. On Amazon this book should be an easy 5 overall; I can't believe it is at 4.5. For anyone that sees poor reviews and fears that the book will be a burden, I can clear things up: I believe that many readers are young when they first read this book, since they are drawn in by the magic and battle, and because of their age, they miss the great depth and craft of Tolkien. Or perhaps some others are drawn away by various complexities in the novel that make it so realistic.Give Tolkien thirty pages in this masterpiece and you will be convinced that you can not only tackle the novel, but also enjoy it.My advice is to read this special work of art. Do not pass it up. Trust me, you won't want that last page to come."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I can go on and on pertaining to the literary marvels which have been extensively covered by the thousands of converts of LOTR. However I have one particular observation that I previously suspected manifest in the act of reading this book. LOTR was one of the first serious books I read as a twelve year old. I was overwhelmed by the power of the story in the way that it eerily transported you into the action. Over three decades later and having read thousands of books, (fantasy fiction and other genres) I have returned again recently (my fifth time) to middle earth with one of the collectors editions;(The Red faux leather bound one).I have found that my original experience upon reading it was indeed unique and remains so. This last time, I scrutinized the construct of the yarn bit by bit and realized that Tolkien indeed used a hypnotic trick in his construct of sentences. One can begin to read and shortly fall into a vivid, clear world which unfolds from the imagination into the waking world! I don't read too many books where I will suddenly jump from the couch and exclaim \\"Man!!! I can almost see that!!\\" or something of that nature. I have visited middle earth enough times that I feel as if the members of the \\"Fellowship\\" are my comrades and I am actually having a smoke with them at Saurumans stronghold.

It also tells us something; too much power can easily corrupt you. As we see the evil Sauron has had use of the Ring for many many years, and the more times that goes by without him having it he becomes more brutal and wants the ring more and more, for he can invoke the magical powers that are imbued upon it. While he is seperated from the ring he becomes more evil, gains more power, and eventually he has become so evil that he cannot help himself but to destroy everything he sees.

And who vanished? The Lord of the Rings, part one, The Fellowship of the Ring, by J.R.R. Tolkien, will tell you. This story is full of detail and adventure. I highly recommend this book. Since J.R.R. Tolkien is so descriptive, whoever reads any of these stories can picture exactly what the scene looks like. He described the forest that the adventurers went through wonderfully. All throughout the story, &quot;black riders&quot; were following the main characters. These riders were trying to catch the main character, Frodo. I could see the whole scene. This story could have been a lot shorter if so much detail wasn't in the story. I'm not saying the detail is bad, but since so much detail was described, at times I did get bored while reading the book. Throughout the first part of the story, the travelers were going through the woods. Most of the beginning was description, but a little adventure thrown in to keep the reader reading. For example, when they were in the woods, they became tired and fell asleep under a willow tree. While they were sleeping, the willow tree opened up and surrounded two of the characters. They were in quite the predicament. This kept me reading to see what the outcome was. Wolves, and/or the black riders throughout the story would also attack them. An image in this book that has really stuck in my head is at the end when Frodo was coming upon Mordor, his destination. He was going down a river and ahead of him were two pillars on each side of the river. The river was in the woods, so I could see the trees, looking dark and gloomy since the weather was bad, and he was near an evil place. I could also see the little creatures attacking them in the woods. The picture on the cover illustrates a scene perfectly from the book. The reader would picture that same scene in his head. I immediately knew when I read that scene what the picture on the front of the book was. He described the horses coming out of the water, engulfing the black riders immediately after Frodo crossed the lake. I know who everyone is in that picture. If so much wasn't put in the book, I wouldn't know who was who or where the scene was from. When I've read other books, I couldn't tell what part of the book the picture on the front was, or I could, but I had a different picture in mind. In this story, I had the same exact image in my head as the one on the front of the book. I liked The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R Tolkien. I chose this book because it was recommended to me. Every person I talked to recommended that I read this story, along with the others, which go along with this story. I haven't yet read the next two books, but I do plan on reading them in the future.

I love to escape with these books!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Lord of the rings is a philosophical adventure in the lessons of right and wrong; good and bad, and so much more. In every chapter there is a lesson. For example, in the very begginning when the great wizard learns of the power of the ring, he goes back to the hobbit town to try the take the ring back from old Bilbo. Bilbo has become so upsessed with the ring that he is willing to risk one of his strongest friendships to keep it and not until the great wizard frightens Bilbo with his strenght does he relinquish it. The lesson is, of course, that over indulgence in anything is bad and so is greed. We must give up the things that make us forget to live no matter how beautiful or enchanting they are because nothing is more important than being true to ourseleves.Tolken was a very wise man and there are tons of treasures of wisdom in this book. Because of the pictures in this edition, I think it is definitely great for children even if the don't follow every single twist and turn in the book. It is really the morals that are important. This book is full of them."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"THE classic of Fantasy (all literature?), and definitely worth reading multiple times. Why? Well, a couple of reasons. One: Believe it or not, the story is quite unique. Many have tried duplicating it (e.g. Shannara), but none have managed to capture Tolkien's vision so well. Two: Middle-Earth. As complex and as visionary as any world you (or any author) ever imagined. More importantly, it feels real, which is a definition of a good literature. Three: The characters. All of them. All of the characters are complex, all have their failings and their positive traits, none are stereotypical and none do what you would expect them to.I could go on and on, but I won't. If you haven't read it, read it. If you have read it, read it again. And I recommend this one-volume edition highly."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I first read The Lord of the Rings when I was in 3rd grade. I had read a large, fully illustrated version of the Hobbit during the summer before 3rd grade, and was utterly hooked. I have read the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings about five times in the last twenty years. I think the Hobbit is the best book overall because it has a faster pace. LTR is a much more serious, darker series, and in fact, I remember being scared reading some of the scenes when I was younger. LTR has a great deal of depth that provides a sweeping backdrop for the current story. I tried reading The Silmarrillion, but found it to be boring, and never got past 100 pages; indeed I have not found anything else by Tolkien that I really enjoyed. Read these books, and you will always be disappointed in any other work of fantasy.

The Hobbit is very comical and features an adventure, while The Lord of the Rings is very serious and features a quest.The Lord of the Rings is a great story, but some of the parts may seem a bit boring and confusing to those who have not read The Simarillian.The best part of the book (which the movie dosn't really show) is the \\"Moralistic\\" parts. Without friendship,freedom, trust, pity and hope the story would have ended tragicly.One part that made me think was how Men envy the Elves' immortality , while Elves envy Men because they hate to see all that they love fade. This contridicts a lot of people's thinking.People who have watched the movie will also note many wonderful characters and scenes never even shown. Also, although there is a bit of love between Arwen and Aragorn, the whole story is not about their love!!!! ( the movie also leaves Eowyn and Faramir at loose ends while they fall in love in the book) The violent war scences depicted in the movie THE RETURN OF THE KING do not take up half of the story, either.The Lord of the Rings is my favourite book, and I think that it would be wise to devout a few hours of your time to read it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"this book is great i am only 12 and i read it in 5 days.

Among fantasy novels, it stands alone -- a masterpiece. I cannot do justice to the plot, or the mythology, in such a short review. It is an epic quest narrative of grand scope, in which the most seemingly insignificant race of creatures -- the hobbits -- are called upon to save the world. This work has influenced probably every fantasy writer since Tolkien's time.It is also a potent tale of good versus evil -- of courage in dark times, of hope amidst despair, and of sacrifice to save others, all of which resonates more clearly with me these days.I am buying TWO copies of the boxed sets, one for my son, and one for my nephew. This is one piece of literature it is a joy to share."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I write this immediately after commenting on the Hobbit. I was inspired to write another after this, for the Silmarillion.To me the three books intertwine into three levels of journey, from lower to higher levels of conciousness and expression of imaginative genius.The Lord of the Rings can certainly stand it's ground as a saga and a work of a brilliant mind. Having learn't a little of Tolkien himself, it is clearly evident this work is the result of a lifetime of toil. The cumulative expression of his experiences and knowledge, accentuated with the playful abandon of a child, sobered by the grim wisdom of a sage; this is the Lord of the Rings.The scale of this work had an effect on me similar to mythologies and legends of ancient civilizations - of our own world. But the world Tolkien created here was a complete immersion. I could taste and smell it. I yearned for it. I suffered with the heroes in the book, and I revelled with them in their moments of joy. I felt the yawning agony of defeat and death, and the mourning of times lost.The world Tolkien created was ever in a state of decay. Call it entropy in our scheme. Evermore the purity and innocence of ages past faded away and died.This did not distress me. For every now and then brave souls on this journey gathered their spirits, and in mutual kindness, brought forth joy. That was the victory, that was the achievement. And those moments made up for all the suffering and toil.The book is HUGE, but I relished each page and dreaded the end. Such is it's excellence."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"These are my favorite books in all the world. Nothing I have read has compared to the richness of this story and its settings and characters. J.R.R. Tolkien is a genius who has created not only a stirring, epic story, but a world with histories, legends, songs, and languages that are so complete that they can be learned and spoken. Each and every character, from Frodo the hobbit to Aragorn the heir of kings, is so vivid and real that by the end of the book, you feel as if you have walked along the roads with them throughout their long journey. I strongly recommend reading this book BEFORE you see the movie, so that you can form your own images of the characters and settings. This is a book that has changed my life, and I can't find the words to do it justice. Everyone ought to read these books!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"One ring to rule them all, One ring to find themOne ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind themThis is epic as it has never been done before. That one man created a world in such stunning detail, a world full of beauty and ugliness, courage and cowardice, joy and despair, good and evil is awe-inspiring. And not just a world, but a complete history - replete with folklore and legend, poetry and song, heroes and villains. \`The Lord of the Rings' is the product of a formidable imagination, a book that spawned a whole genre of writing, none of which matches this, the Bible of fantasy literature.Tolkien was clearly in love with Middle-Earth and its mythology. Every character, from Gollum to Galadriel is lovingly rendered in compelling detail. Every twist of the road to Mordor is convincingly constructed, as though the author had ridden across Middle-Earth in his mind. What Tolkien has managed to do, like the handful of other great epic writers, is take a very personal story and set it against the backdrop of great events with which it is inextricably bound (don't laugh, but in this respect the book is reminiscent of \`War and Peace'). The average reader will associate themselves much more with Frodo or Sam than Gandalf or Aragorn, but that is not to say we aren't as interested in their fates - we just get to see them through the eyes of the less elevated, which makes them seem more human.The three parts to \`The Lord of the Rings' are each quite different from each other. \`The Fellowship of the Ring' begins with Bilbo's birthday party and sees the company formed in haste as they realise that Bilbo's ring is indeed the One Ring, and that Sauron's servants, the Nazgul, are hot on its trail. \`The Two Towers' sees the narrative take three different routes, as the fellowship is broken up, while \`The Return of the King' deals with the final great events in the War of the Rings, and is the most epic of the three. The sadness at the passing of the third age of Middle-Earth is quite poignant, and the fact that Tolkien was writing at the time of the second World War should not be overlooked.'The Lord of the Rings' is a very long book, but all the better to lose yourself in. As you may have gathered, I think it is brilliant - there aren't enough superlatives to describe it. Can't wait for the film...."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I agree that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, so I will not say that I disagree with so-and-so's review on Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. Personally I have a very, very strong affection for this book and I think it is truly one of the most beautiful works of literature. Tolkien's imagination is mind-blowing. I understand that some people may find the songs and poems tedious to read, but I think it is these songs and poems which bring a certain magic to the whole story. Tolkien's writing is simple but elegant and beautiful. I thought that many of the characters were given great depth, and I became especially fond of Gandalf and Sam! And one of the things I really loved about this story was that the 'hero' who embarked on the quest to destroy the Ring was a little hobbit and not some stereotyped handsome hero you read about in so many books. This goes to show that everyone - including little plain people - can be a hero in our own way, as long as we have the heart to reach our goals.I have read other fantasy stories, but somehow I just don't find them even remotely as captivating as Tolkien's LOTR. Reading this book opened up a whole new world to me, and it was indeed a wonderful, unforgettable experience. I read this book in high school, and I've been reading it at least once every year since. I never tire of it.

A classic and a gem!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"When author J.R.R. Tolkien released the last installment of the Lord of the Rings in 1955, it was as though he had tilled a seismic line in the sands of fantasy and fiction literature: Before Tolkien and After Tolkien. With his extraordinary depth of characters and storyline, scrutiny of detail, and flowing, serial writing style, the author - in one swift stroke - redefined a genre of modern literature in much the same way that the great bards in Shakespeare's time recast the foundations of drama and the spoken word. The story begins in the fictional land of Middle-Earth, a place not unlike our own in days gone by. Turquoise streams and chill valleys cut across the scenery; intimate villages and great stone cities dot the landscape; and an endless array of interesting characters, both kindly good and plotting evil, wait to be met. The reader first meets Frodo Baggins, the book's protagonist, in a town called Hobbiton - a mythical Pleasantville, USA where the grass is mowed and one's neighbors are just down the road. Frodo is a Hobbit, a kind, soft-footed creature of small stature. He could be any one of us, an Everyday Joe going about their tasks of today. But a mission soon thrust in his hands by Middle-Earth's powers-that-be? To destroy the One Ring, a fulcrum symbol of absolute power, creation and authority... and the one device that may end the world. In short, Lord of the Rings is truly epic: It is chock-full of battles, heroism, romance, comradeship, royalty, long-days, cold nights, plot twists. But Tolkien's ability to capture the imagination of the everyday reader is, perhaps, his greatest accomplishment. The reader feels drained at the conclusion of Frodo's remarkable journey, but filled with new experiences, as if one was actually there riding, walking and fighting with him and his colleagues. Tolkien succeeds in stimulating our emotions and diverting our minds, while clasping our hearts in a way that no other epic has before."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"i first read the Lord of the Rings when in high school. I was immediately hooked. I couldn't believe the depth of the characters, the richness of the backgrounds, the intricacies of the invented languages, all without boring the reader or going over the readers head. Mr. Tolkien most likely had no idea his work would become the stuff of legend, but it has. The story has developed a life of its own, and a world-wide following. What makes the story so compelling is the absolute believability of the main characters. you finish the book feeling you actually know these people, that you just experienced the most incredible adventure of their lives with them. Not many books of any kind make you feel that way, least of all fantasy books. Mr. Tolkien fashioned the perfect epic fantasy, and obtained a sort of immortality for himself as well. His work will live on forever, for his books are the epitome of what writing should be about."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Before you get your backs up please read on.The Bible is more important, but The Bible is more than simple literature, and therefore I think it unfair to compare a mortals writing skills with those of almighty God himself.Shakespeare's works are wonderfull too and I have enjoyed them immensely, but they could not come close to the sheer ecstacy of climbing Mount Doom with Frodo and Sam for the first time, of being there when Gandalf returns from death itself to aid in the overthrow of Sauron.What Tolkien has done is to reveal a world to us that has no equal. In terms of pure enjoyment, reading Tolkien for the first time is akin to one's first taste of fine chocolate (maybe even sex if you REALLY enjoy reading). For those of you with children, read the Hobbit to them when they are little and when they get older, buy them Lord of the Rings.If you are going to read one book in your life just for entertainment, this should be it. In a time where quick fixes and simple fare are the rule, indulge yourself with this book.

Looking at the books on a carousel there was one which caught the eye - a weird looking landscape made up of purples and blues, with strange black figures on horses flying through the air. The author's name meant nothing, but the cover was enough to get it sold. I didn't realize then that it was only the beginning of a journey, one which started in 1965 at the age of nine. It began a search for the other books (back then not an easy thing) and a world filled with strange creatures, honest feelings and sometimes betrayal. Because it was the first Tolkien I'd ever read, \\"The Two Towers\\" is still my favorite. If your looking for excessive violence &amp; language, these are not the books for you. If your looking for something that can surprise and delight, then read everything the professor has written about Middle-earth. This is a world unto itself, well worth the time spent traveling along the hobbits' road."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I am 19. When I was 15, my friends encouraged me to read this book. I have read all the Tolkien's books in Spanish, and also I have read The Lord of the Rings in English.

The fame this book and his author have won are not exagerated."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The whole story is an amazing creation by the master of the subject J.R.R.Tolkien.The adventures that Frodo has,the way he escapes with his fellowship and the bravery of Aragorn,Legolas and Boromir promise a fantastic continue after the first book.In the second book the agony and the action are in maximum grade.You feel like you are with Meri,Pipin and the Eds marching to conquer Orthanc.But also you participate in Frodo's journey through the dark,like being Samwaiz.In the third book Aragorn shows his majesty and Frodo finishes his mission after tremendous difficulties while &quot;The Captains of the West&quot; trying in vein to help him against the black majesty of Soron.I just love this story!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The work Tolkien has done with this book should make us see how a human can create a world where every language in it has its own grammar, where all characters which appear have their onw linage and where everything in it can be accurately explained by reading other books of the same. Landscapes and places are treated with such an elegance and perfection that you can really feel the humidity, the darkness or the morning wind touching your face. He has done of a week and small creature the heroe of an epic fantasy novel and has avoided using the usual strong and intelligent one. It's certainly the masterpiece of a literature master. What I admire of this book is everything, maybe because I firstly read others of Tolkien such as the hobbit (indispensable if you want to fully understand the LotR)and the Silmarillion. It's not appropiate for an under fifteen boy to read it as he would find it boring. I would recomend it to those who are keen on fantasy and that would pay for living in another world where strange creatures and places existed."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's work is not simply a series of books. It is not merely a story. It is a mythology. Tolkien created a world all his own. Not like some other authors have a &quot;world&quot; for their stories to take place in, but a full and total world, complete with history and languages. His work is not so much a story as it is a glimpse, as through a window, into a different universe.Tolkien begins, in The Silmarillion, with the creation of the world itself. He tells the tale of the original powers of the Earth, and how evil entered the world. He covers the history of the Elves, the Dwarves, and yes, even the Humans, from their first awakenings. He continues this history through three ages of the world and the epic of The Lord of the Rings.In all, over four thousand years of history are covered in amazing detail. Not simply mentioned. Not simply outlined on a few pages of notes. No, Tolkien is far better then that. His is a complete history, not simply a background to a story. He starts with the creation of the world, and ends, in effect, with the start of real-life recorded history. Tolkien's work expands to fill the sum-total span of human comprehension.With that in mind, you can begin to appreciate why you cannot read Tolkien's work just once and expect to enjoy it. Like our own world, you need to study it, to examine it, to live in it for awhile, before you truly start to feel just how rich and textured it is. After two or three reads, you will begin to see the pieces fit together into one, large, complex *thing* that can only be called a world.You need to realize that fact to enjoy these books. Tolkien does not let you off easy. You have to work to take it all in, just as you have to study history to understand the human race. If you are unwilling to make that commitment, do not bother reading it. You will be bored to tears. If you make the effort, however, the reward is that of dreams themselves.Too many people miss the point of Tolkien's work. It is not about character development, or suspense and plots, or even telling a good story. I feel it has all of those, but it is not about them. It is about world-building -- and Tolkien is the master."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I took the English edition of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; by J.R.R.Tolkien as theme of my English class exam.

I would highly recommend reading The Hobbit before attempting to digest the trilogy, just so the concepts of hobbits, wizards, and Middle Earth, will be old hat."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The idea is awsome as others have noted. However for the cost of the book, I was disapointed with the flaws in the gold leaf. I returned it and got another somewhat beter copy."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Hardcover, paperback, Kindle - you name it - I won't get it here. Why? Because it's difficult to figure out what kind of product you're getting since they lump reviews of different editions together. I've been an enthusiastic Amazon customer for years, but this just makes me angry.I'm going to make an old-fashioned trip to a number of old-fashioned bookstores and enjoy the process of hand-picking that special edition for myself. Devote a day to it. Because Tolkien is worth the effort."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is one long novel, often presented in parts. It is \\"Great Literature\\" for adults. But for younger readers who were enticed by \\"The Hobbit\\", LOTR proves to be hard work that gets harder as the novel progresses. Also, LOTR is considerably darker than is \\"The Hobbit\\".There are plenty of reviewers here who will give you the gist of what happens in the story. I just want to let you know that you may have to prepare yourself for some work in reading this long novel.Three stars may be a poorer rating than the novel deserves. I am not kidding about LOTR being \\"Great Literature\\". There is a lot of stuff going on and the author spent a lot of work building up the background for the story. However, \\"Beowolf\\" also is \\"Great Literature\\", but is not a great deal of fun to read. Fortunately, LOTR is fairly good reading. Still, I will stick by the three stars. I think I, mostly, felt exhausted by the end of the story. Frodo does most of the hero stuff. But, I could not help but feel that Samwise was the hobbit to really admire in this story."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I love fantasy, so i read all the fantasy books, reading Lord Of the Rings is no exception even if the book took months to finish and maybe too advanced and confusing for me.Still I read it after finishing the hobbit in curiousity who destroys the ring. I could have just flipped over the last page but I started from the beginning which had an intriguing plot because of the ring Sauron made. I could not stop reading it to see what happens in the next chapters.That is what all the book should be like, dramatic and suspenseful, the book was like a movie. A few bad things about the book was that the story was overwhelmingly long, I get tired of the book and also the terms that J.R.R Tolkien used, made the storyline hard to follow especially for an illiterate like me. However, I would recommend it everybody and call it a true masterpiece anyway....."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This audio version is TERRIBLE. The narrator sounds like a failed game show host. Frodo is flat, lifeless and reminds one of limp lettuce that has been in the fridge for too long. Very dissapointing after hearing the BBC version of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. This doesn't even come close to quality entertainment."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is by far the best edition of LOTR ever published. I bought it off of Amazon, and it is just amazing! I have never seen a book that looks better than this one! You must buy it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Though Tolkien was not the first or most critically-acclaimed fantasy writer, he remains the most beloved and influential, even though \\"Lord of the Rings\\" is decades old. Now with the epic movie trilogy based on this book, new waves of readers are discovering the unique power of the \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" It has quietly created the fantasy genre as we know it, set the tone for most fantasy ever since, topped many \\"best book\\" polls, and helped spawn such entertainment phenomena as \\"Star Wars.\\"Following up on events in \\"The Hobbit,\\" \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" stars the quiet, good-natured hobbit Frodo Baggins, who has inherited a golden Ring that allows its user to become invisible. But his friend, Gandalf the wizard, informs Frodo that the Ring is really the Ring of Power, a tiny invulnerable token that the demonic Dark Lord Sauron has poured his essence and power into. And if Sauron can regain the Ring, he will be able to conquer Middle-Earth. Aghast, Frodo joins a fellowship of Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, Men and a wizard, to go to the one place where the Ring can be destroyed: Mount Doom.\\"The Two Towers\\" begins directly after \\"Fellowship,\\" after Frodo Baggins flees with his friend Sam into Mordor, with no one to protect them. His cousins Merry and Pippin are kidnapped by orcs from the renegade wizard Saruman. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli begin a frenetic search for the hobbits, and receive unexpected help from unlikely allies. Meanwhile, the Ring weighs more heavily on Frodo, as he is forced to get help from one of the people he most despised: the Ring's slave Gollum.\\"Return of the King\\" brings the trilogy to an action-packed, slam-bang and ultimately poignant finale. Sam barely rescues Frodo from Sauron's orcs, and the two resume their journey to Mount Doom, barely escaping Sauron's forces. As Aragorn leads the desperate battle against Sauron's armies at the city of Minas Tirith, Frodo falls increasingly under the seductive spell of the Ring.\\"Lord of the Rings\\" is indeed a powerful book, speaking to virtually everyone who has read it. J.R.R. Tolkien drew from legends and myths, ranging from the ancient Norse mythology to more recent legends, mingled with his love of the British country folk and his Roman Catholic beliefs. Though there are no direct linkages or lessons in the trilogy, Tolkien probably drew on his experiences in World War I for the ravaged battlefields and breakneck action sequences. His beliefs are equally misty but present: they fueled the ethics of the good guys, the fall of formerly-good wizard Saruman, and the themes of temptation, redemption, evil and good that run through every character.Frodo Baggins is an everyman hero, who dreams of adventure but begins to treasure the simple, boring life that he had once he is deprived of it. His deteriotation is saddening, all the more so because he is aware of it. Sam Gamgee is his loyal gardener, a shy young hobbit who grows in confidence and courage. Gandalf is the quintessential wizard -- crabby, kindly, powerful, with a hidden unique streak that elevates him over the usual. Merry and Pippin start out a bit flaky, but are matured by their harrowing experiences. Aragorn is noble, kind, kingly, and intelligent, but with darker streaks in his personality that make him ultimately human. Legolas the elf and Gimli the dwarf initially grate on each other, but overcome their prejudices to become close friends.Tolkien's writing is evocative and descriptive, though not to extremes; Mordor, for example, is best described through the way that Sam and Frodo react to it. The dialogue ranges from goofy and hilarious to solemn and archaic, or to some combination of the two. And the pacing is gradual but necessary; if you don't have a good attention span, then you won't be able to handle this story. If you do, then probably you can.The fiftieth anniversary version is, simply put, a gorgeous edition -- the binding, cover, golden edges and slipcase are smooth and well-made. The illustrations and expansive fold-out maps are good accompaniments that only serve to make the book feel more complete. It's expensive, but for a truly exceptional addition this is a good choice.Even after all the years, J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" still rules the fantasy genre and has become an integral part of modern literature. It's an epic for all ages, and few books have even come close to equalling it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I'd like to make a few corrections concerning other reviews and put my own oar in as well. This book (it was intended as one book by Tolkien) is NOT 3000 pages. Without the appendices, it is barely 1000 (1008 to be exact)and 1137 pages with them. And if this is considered a long book for the faint of heart, then you aren't much of a reader to begin with. It is also not just for children, although it is a great book for kids to dive into. It contains a lot more substance than the Harry Potter series, although they are good in their own right as well. Sometimes this book may seem melodramatic and formulaic, but remember, Tolkien was first, all who followed used HIM, not the other way around. As a fan af the written word, I am hesitant to see my favorite books adapted to screen, and rightly so. Rarely does the screen version of a book hold a candle to the book itself, and for good reason. There are no budgets on people's imagination. There is no cost for the CGI in my head, so the sets always look better than on the big screen. The first movie of this book surprised me, however. It gets as close to the book as monetarily possible. It follows the plot, shows absolutely fabulous locales, and the acting is top-notch (thanks in large part to the McKellan playing Gandalf). Unlike the Harry Potter movie version, Jackson (director) wasn't afraid to take a poetic license with his screen version, and it payed off extrememly well. Potter is true to the book (mostly), bt there is no feeling to the movie, no heart, just special effects with moderate acting (excepting Maggie Smith of course). But I digress... Overall, the book is excellent, the movie very true to the book with heart of its own, and it's NOT 3000 pages long!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"If you haven't read this you must its the best book of all by a long shot nothing comes close!!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Lord of the Rings is without doubt the best fantasy novel ever written. I know of no other author that comes close in detail, imagination, language. Modern novelists like Eddings and Brooks are fine but their prose is like high shool writings compared with the beauty of Tokien's language. His characterisations are superlative. How many of us wanted to be Aragorn or Frodo. He doesn't rush into the action but builds the tension bit by bit to a terrifying climax. This must be the only fantasy novel where the villain (Sauron) doesn't even make an appearance in the climax of the story. There is no sword fight etc. But it works and wonderfully too. I have read the book 5 to 6 times cover to cover over the past 15 years and it is still wonderful to read.For the audio dramatization I would highly recommend the BBC 13 hour adaptation with Ian Holm as Frodo. It is engrossing and wonderfully performed by all the actors.People who would compare Tracy Hickman to Tolkien ought to be shot. That is like comparing Sidney Sheldon to Dickens."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This book is great! i can't even believe it's so good, but you have to read the hobbit first to get it. i hope every one who reads this review will love the lord of the rings and movie if you are allowed to see it.

Beautifully Bound, it is an item to keep and hand down in the future."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"When The Lord of the Rings movies came out, I was instantly infatuated with them as a child. Not wanting to wait the year long release date to know the story, I decided to read the books in their place, but being so young I was unable to adequately understand the significance of the story as a whole. I wanted to read of the action parts and the continuation of the story line, not the \\"boring\\" descriptive paragraphs on the setting. Since the age of fourteen I hadn't picked the books up until recently when I attended a community college class covering The Lord of the Rings. We covered the three books as well as The Hobbit, with watching the three movies in a compare and contrast aspect. This review is actually part of the final project for this given class, and how much easier can you get for a final, right? But in watching the movies compared to reading the books at an adult age, I realized how much I really missed when I was a child. There is so much of the books that seem new to me in this second reading, and so much more than what is presented in the three films. I truly did love the movies, a fan that went to see them a minimum of 5 times each in theatres, but re-reading the books gave me so much more of what Tolkien wanted to tell. The \\"boring\\" descriptive parts became another world in which I could engulf myself in, almost to the point of escape from the troubles that blare across our news lines. But the books aren't for us to lose ourselves in, to escape the problems of our lives; it gives us a sense of what is required for them. A common theme of the book is courage in the face of imminent danger, which I sure a lot of us can relate to. Tomorrow is not guaranteed, and no one knows what troubles are in store for us, but we must have courage to go out our front door and face them head-on. This I feel is what the underlining theme that these books give us, and in them we can find strength, for if Frodo and Sam can travel to Mount Doom, then I surely can finish my schooling and become a Professor to help the next generation along its path. I would highly recommend these books to anyone that hasn't read them, or anyone that has seen the movies and doesn't feel that it is necessary to read them. They are world best sellers for a reason, and all of us should find out why this is, sooner than later."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This review is part of a assignment for an English class I am taking at a community college in California. We were assigned to read The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, and we also watched all three of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies then give a review that stated if it was better to just read the books, or if we liked the movies better, or if they worked well as a team. I had already read all three books (and The Hobbit) prior to the class, but re-reading them made me realize how helpful the movies can be in helping one understand the stories better. I have always been a firm believer that books are better than their film counter parts, but Tolkien's writing style can be very in depth when it comes to explaining the landscape; therefore, I can see why some people would find the books hard to follow in some areas. In addition, I always found the battle scenes a bit hard to understand as well. I do not think Tolkien's lengthy descriptions are harmful to his amazing story telling. In fact, it is his attention to detail that has made these books such a great success. I have always admired Tolkien's work because he changed the way we look at fantasy story telling today. His writing proves that a make believe realm with mythical creatures can still be taken seriously as a great piece of work. I read the books just as the movies were coming out, and I tried to have each one finished before the movie version was in theaters. I liked comparing and contrasting the books from the movies. I also found that the movies provide some clarity to parts of the books I had trouble visualizing. Those who are not strong readers might find the books challenging. Which is why I think the movies and the books make a great team in bringing Middle Earth to life; this also seemed to be the consensus of my classmates. Tolkien's genius cannot be overlooked, and although Peter Jackson did an excellent job staying as close to the books as possible out of respect for Tolkien, the books just show so much more of Middle Earth. Bottom line; do not skip the books just because you have seen the movies. There are characters and scenes that had to be cut because it was just impossible to fit them in a movie that would not exceed 3 hours. If you have read the books but have not seen the movies because you are a die-hard Tolkien fan and you have heard the rumors of too many changes, I would suggest getting the extended DVD versions. Those include as much of the books as I think film can allow."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This lord of the ring audio read by Rob Inglis is AAA+++.

I looked at the pictures for a few weeks before finally buying, and I was still surprised by the bulk of it.

I will not even try to write a summary of the book, since by now most people know what The Lord of the Rings is about, thanks to the films, and can probably even do a plot synopsis on their own. For any fans of Tolkien or epic fantasy, or just good books, this is a great one to have, and it really made re-reading the trilogy fresh and enjoyable for me.

The break-up into three, and the larger size, makes this book a somewhat more leisurely read, and I found myself giving more time to each chapter, reading it slower, absorbing more than I ever had earlier.The only drawback, as already mentioned, is that the paper used in the book as a whole is glossy, and therefore gives some glare if you read it with white light falling on it directly.

It is absolutely fantastic."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Full disclosure: I'm a fan that was brought in by the movies. Normally, I try to read a book before seeing it in movie form, but I was actually convinced not to in this case (more on that in a moment). Eventually, though, I watched the Peter Jackson film adaptations, loved them, and decided I'd like to get the full story. As a first-time LOTR reader, this edition looked like the best choice, as opposed to buying a fully-annotated or illustrated edition or the three parts individually (also, books with pictures from the film version on the cover is a pet peeve of mine, so I always avoid those editions). And the price of the 50th Anniversary edition is a true bargain.Though this isn't the annotated edition, there's no shortage of notes here. A lengthy introduction, footnotes sprinkled throughout the volume, and a series of mostly interesting, at times overwhelming appendices supplement the epic story. The book itself is bound well, using good paper, and is surprisingly manageable for a 1000+ page volume.But the real attraction here, of course, is the story itself. I had to agree with my friend who had stopped reading the book when she reached the section featuring Tom Bombadil. That character did not have the same substance as the others, and the frequent rhymes and poetry in those early chapters did not appeal to me. It drove my friend away from the book, but I continued on. Some of the poetry is pretty interesting, and I found that it was better in smaller doses, and in fact they do occur less frequently as the book goes on, achieving a better balance with the prose.The story is divided first by volume (3, like the films), then by book (each volume has 2 books), then manageably-sized chapters. Of the six books into which Lord of the Rings is divided, my favorites were Books III, IV, and VI. I felt that the emotions of the characters and the scope of the story were best realized in these sections, though there is certainly much to sink one's teeth into throughout the novel's entirety. One of the things I like best about the later Books is the way the characters, particularly the Hobbits, grow, the writing style becoming more emotionally real as the characters' conflicts become increasingly amplified.It's been said that LOTR could be seen as a parable for life in and after World War I, though Tolkien denied it. Still, that seems very much to be the case in the book's final chapters. I don't want to give away any spoilers, so I'll say only that Frodo and Sam provide two very interesting perspectives on this idea.(Also, though this is not a review of the films, I'd like to point out that I frequently could see images from the films in my mind while reading the book - not because it had tainted my experience of the novel, but because they had so accurately portrayed what had been written. This is a rare case of the films actually rewarding a comparison with the source text.)Overall, I can say that this book proved itself to me as a true classic, not just in the fantasy genre, but of classic literature. It works on countless levels, and has been a wonderfully rewarding experience. Someday, I hope to convince my friend to pick up the book where she left off - she doesn't know what she's missing!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"It pretty much is summed up in the title, but I'll add on more.I was raised on this book. It is my favorite literary piece by far. This version is expertly edited and binded. I know quality binding, and this is what you are paying for more than anything. If you are a fan, buy it and love it forever. When you have children and grandchildren, pass it down to them. If you aren't, check it out from the library or buy a cheap paperback that you'll be able to beat up and drop in puddles until it falls apart on your third reading. Either way, you'll get your money's worth."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"It's hard to add more than other reviewers have done. Most of the comments are right-on, but I think it's nice for a potential buyer to hear a lot of people voicing their opinions. This is a long set but perfect for a devoted fan.

Rob Inglis did a great job, and while a few of the female voices are a bit odd, you soon forget about such things when you get wrapped up in the story.He adds the right emphasis to the right parts and I think his voice is well-suited to this work. For hardcore LotR fans, it's hard to find something that meets our high expectations as this is a simply amazing work of art that will last for years - it's hard to find a voice that meets every (somewhat unreal, I think) expectation. But Rob Inglis comes extremely close."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I am not a \\"Total Ringophile\\", like some out there, but I have read the books three times and loved them. I lashed out and purchased this 46 CD set as I spend a lot of time on the commute to work. It is brilliant! Each CD has approx 15 \\"tracks\\" on it so that if you miss a bit as your mind wanders (as it does in the car..) you can just bounce back one track and hear that bit again, no problems. Rob Inglis does a great job, no question. It has added a new dimension to my experince of Tolkien's masterpiece, and I highly recommend it to all.

The UK version has \\"cleaner\\" Map print out, with two colors (dark brown and black), and it was printed in the inside of back cover, so it used heavier paper quality. This US version has hard-to-read and lower quality B/W map.If you want to buy, get a chance to see the UK version first by HarperCollins before deciding to buy the Houghton Mifflin illustrated edition."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This Audio CD is an excelent way to here the book The Lord Of The Rings. It is good for people on the go who do not have a lot of time to read and who also do a lot of driving. It is great because it is the entire book or I should say books since nothing is cut from the recording. So if you do not have a lot of reading time I would recemend this book. It also is good if you have seen both movies because a lot is explained in the book that did not go into the movies. You will also meet some new characters too."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"What everyone else says about The Lord of the Rings is true: this is truly one of the great stories that has ever been put to paper. But this particular edition (the paperback &quot;movie art cover&quot;) and several of the other similar editions (the equivalent hardback and individual paperbacks) are missing a line (look in chapter 2, &quot;The Shadow of the Past&quot;, where Gandalf reads what is inscribed on the ring--only the second of the two lines is there: &quot;One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them&quot;). In addition, in about 5% of the first 300 or so pages that I read, there were missing splotches of ink. Some of them are small, almost unnoticeable, but some are pretty large. For example, on the last line of page 81, the word &quot;return&quot; looks like &quot;ret n&quot; (and the last 'n' isn't all there). It wasn't just my copy, it was the same in every copy in a huge stack of them that I saw in brick and mortar bookstore. And the corresponding lines (and ink) were missing in the individual paperback editions with the movie art covers as well as the hardback movie art cover.If you can find a place to look at a copy of the books in person, you can decide for yourself if you are bothered by these errors or not. In my case, the book was purchased at the aforementioned brick and mortar store, and I decided to return it. I'll be purchasing another edition here. :-)"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The first time I read LOTR I was fifteen and I discovered that Tolkien's style of writing is not easy to read. I found pages of minute description and background history that was fascinating yet lent very little to the pace and purpose of the story. Some parts of the books were amazingly slow while other parts led up to action sequences that never happened or were disposed with in one paragraph. For those who have just watched the movie it should be noted that the fight with the Balrog was much better on screen than in the book.However, years later I went back to LOTR's and read them again thinking that maybe I was just young and the books were meant for a more mature audience. I found many of the same nagging questions I had the first tiime around. For instance, the true nature of the magic rings are never really described in detail. We know the One Ring controls all of the rings but what does that mean? We know that Gandalf has one of the elven rings along with Elrond and the Elf Queen but how do they ever benefit from them? More importantly we know Gandalf is a wizard but when does he cast a useful spell? On top of this I realized the books lack vivid and accurate characters. I never really identified with any of the characters because they all seemed so inhuman and predictable.So many things in the books just didn't make sense to me. For instance, if the Nazguls are so powerful (and immortal) why don't they just land in the middle of an army and decimate the warriors? Why are the elves leaving to the west? What do the orcs eat if the eastlands are all desolate waste? What the hell is Tom Bombadil dancing around for all the time? Why are there no female characters?In short, the books do have literary merit and Tolkien was one the first people to write such a compelling fantasy story. However, he did not invent the fantasy genre as so many claim, and his books are not without flaws. But if imitation is the measure of genius than Tolkien deserves the utmost respect."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Oh, lord. There are some things that are so bad it makes you wonder how they got famous. This is one of those. I am absolutely baffled as to why this is considered to be one of the greatest books ever written. The problems are numerous. Firstly, it is just downright boring. While there are some wondrous, masterful parts of the story, they are few and far between. For every battle with Shelob, the Balrog, or the Nazgul, there are literally a hundred pages of nothing. I swear, parts of the story seem like: THEY TRAVELED TO THE INN AT BORONOR, THEN WALKED ON FOOT THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS, THEN RODE HORSES ALONG THE RIVERSIDE, THEN SLEPT IN THE ELVEN CAMP, THEN VISITED GENERIC KING #12. Now imagine that I'd taken 300 pages to tell you that. In THE HOBBIT, a similar story was told. The difference is that in each chapter the characters found something new and wonderful. Here they just find a new road to trundle down. Secondly, the characters are robots. Some are great, and do in fact deserve to outlive the series. Legolas and Tom Bombadil are both interesting, and entertaining. Gollum, one of my favorite characters from any book, is funny and sad and disgusting all at once. However these are the acceptions that prove the rule. Also, their seems to be no heart in the story. The characters and the events don't seem to matter; their just pieces of a huge, boring puzzle. The sub title of the book is THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE EARTH, and that's what it reads like. A history book. Just names, places and dates, but no real feeling. In fact, the story doesn't even give us the full story. The real end is tucked away into a corner of one of the many appendices. The idea that the story ends in a minor footnote and not the text is sickening. Perhaps I'm wrong. Perhaps I overlook the impact that was actually made by the book at the time. All I know is that this is one of the most overrated stories ever told."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Tolkien is a master at worldbuilding and characterization. But I did find much of the books BORING. I mean fall asleep BORING. ZZZZZZZZZZZ. Some of it even silly in some aspects. Like Tom Bombadil. ? He is very LONG WINDED in describing the travel of the hobbits, especially in the first book. Which almost put me to sleep. He describes every nuance and rock, but after four pages of reading about the rocks and grass it gets a bit overdone. But I did enjoy the books. Just be prepared for more than a few chapters of fluff here and there that really aren't nessisary. Once again he's writing for world immersion. A great read though and an amazing world to explore. But not one of my all time favorite series. In fact I don't think I'll ever read Tolkien again, because I was that bored."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The book I read for library class was The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. The book was written by J.R.R. Tolkien. The book is fantasy.The book starts when Gandalf, a wizard, sends Frodo, a small creature half the size of a man, called a hobbit, and his three friends, also hobbits, Merry, Pippin, and Sam on a journey to destroy a magical ring that Frodo's inherited from his Uncle Bilbo, who found long ago. The four hobbits travel to a city called Bree and meet two wanderers called Aragorn and Boromir. They find they are friends of Gandalf and the two wanderers decide travels with them. Before the hobbits leave Bree an inn keeper gives them a message from Gandalf. The message tells them to go to an elf named Elrond's Palace. The hobbits soon arrive there and find Frodo's uncle, Bilbo, and Gandalf are also at Elrond's palace. They also meet a dwarf named Gimli and an elf named Legolas, who decide to join them on the journey. In order to get to a volcano that can destroy the ring, they all must go through a dwarf kingdom, called Moria, to get there. Gimli the dwarf says it is not a good idea because the palace was taken over by orcs, bulky, horned, creatures, long ago. Gandalf decides that they should go anyway and they soon arrive in Moria. In Moria, Gandalf is killed by a huge creature called a balrog in the process of saving everyone else in the party. The remainder of the group escapes from the kingdom and they once again set out on the journey. The rest you will have to read to find out what happens.The book was very interesting and kept my attention throughout it.

I have a little daughter (4month) and I will not give her the book, because all the heroes are male (see deserves more than beeing a princess) 2) Where is the loss of important people? Dead of people we love is an important part of our lifes. In the LoR all heroes survife: its a fairy tale nothing more. (As Tolkine says, too. 3) Where are the problems between the main charaters? Look at Star Trek TNG: The first episodes are terrible boring, because &quot;we all love eachother&quot; - Star Trek DS9, which had no such restrictions, is much better - right from the beginning.So it is truely a very good book, but only with respect to a very limmited part of human life."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This book!

The overwrought description drags on for way too long, and the way the war is described makes the whole story seem like some kind of weird dream rather than a real war.

The antagonists are the obstacles that they have to over come to get to where they are going. If I told you every thing that is in the book it would take forever. My favorite part in the book is when frodo is walking through the woods with the ponies, Sam, Pippen, and merry. They start to feel sleepy and stop to rest. Frodo has the sudden urge to dip his feet into the cool water of the stream. So he goes over to the riverbed and sits on a tree root. Then he fell asleep. Mean while Merry and Pippen are asleep by the tree and all of the sudden the tree opens up and eats them. Sam has gone for a walk in the woods. Suddenly the tree root moves and Frodo is pushed into the water. Sam comes back and gets Frodo out of the water. Then they try to get merry (Pippen has all ready been eaten out of sight they think that he ran off) out of the tree but it is no use the tree has too tight of a grip on merry. So then they decide to burn the tree to get merry out. When the y start the fire it hurts merry more than the tree. Then they start to yell for help. Luckily along comes a man named tom he helps to get them out he says a few words to the tree and it just spits them out. Is this tom friend or foe? To find out read this book.

If the ring is so darned powerful, why did Sauron lose it when he had it? And how come he seems so powerful now that he don't have it?The answer must be that the ring isn't magical at all. Rather, it is an object of obsession for the poor Sauron lad. Surely he had an unhappy, traumatic childhood, and the ring has come to represent loss and repressed sexuality. There is a streak of the pervert in Sauron, that old peeping tom in his tellingly shaped tower. (tower and ring: the symbolism isn't exactly subtle.)Obviously, the entire novel is written from his point of view, and describes his pathological visions of grandeur, of finally \\"getting the ring\\" (as I said, not exactly subtle.)

I am sure the Cliffs Notes of the LOTR are interesting and entertaining, but why anyone would want to torture themselves reading this collection is beyond me.I read one chapter a night until I was done, and that was too grueling a task.

Probably caused by the satin ribbon bookmark that somehow pulled on the paper during production.The second occured during the Return of the King.

It cleared up within 15 pages, but it was a slight annoyance.I would have hoped for a stronger paper for the fold out maps since I kept referring back to the map of Middle-Earth.

These three books comprise &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot; The prelude book &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is not included, and you will want to read that first if you haven't read it.There are a few nice things about this edition, first off, the whole novel is between one cover, as Tolkien originally wanted (but the publisher thought was too financially risky). Secondly, the illustrations by Alan Lee are wonderful. If you've recently seen the movie, you'll notice some similarities as Alan Lee was one of two conceptual artists used in the film (John Howe was the other one).When I read Tolkien to my daughter, this was the edition I used, because she really enjoyed the illustrations. My wife, on the other hand, still prefers the smaller paperbacks because this book is large and heavy. I also would have prefered a larger map of Middle Earth than the one included in the book.

LORD OF THE RINGS, of course, is one of my favorite books. One has to take care when reading it -- all three volumes in one book create quite a weight in one's lap!For the first-time reader of RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP (vol. 1) mixes adventure and high fantasy (ex: Tom Bombadil and the Barrow Wights) to good effect and really hooks the reader in. THE TWO TOWERS (vol. 2) takes its time. The characters are split and Tolkien spends exclusive time with each faction. Don't expect film-like cutting between the main storylines. Tolkien, instead, spends several chapters concentrating solely on Sam and Frodo leaving the reader to wonder what's been happening to Merry or Pippin in the meantime. RETURN OF THE KING (vol. 3) becomes quite beautiful and poetic and is a great reward if you can make it that far!

The accented E (as in &Eacute;omer) seems to be particularly prone to induce typos, with numerous instances of Rohirric names misspelled. Words are half-gone or entirely missing sometimes.

Everyone else, stick to paper!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"It is not necessary to understand exactly what Tolkien did to read The Lord of the Rings. A reader does not need to know that Tolkien used his knowledge of the history of the English language to create a language and alphabet of his own to enjoy this epic. You don't even need to realize that many of the themes and mythology of The Lord of the Rings is directly related to the lore of ancient England, legends going back before the written word. You don't need to realize the massive complexity of Middle Earth's mythology--how passing references to the past amount to a much bigger picture to be told another time, much as a small reference to Oddyseus brings up the Odyssey and the Iliad, which in themselves contain the seeds of even larger past myths. No, only a tasting of the effects of Tolkien's efforts are required to read his epic masterpiece.To enjoy Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, all you need to do is look at the characters, the completeness of his universe--with history, mythology, conflict. This is no simple fantasy novel, this is a rich, dynamic world, filled with real characters and fascinating, diverse locals.Tolkien was not just a master creator of worlds and professor, he was also a storyteller to whom few compare. The Lord of the Rings starts out in the simple fairy-tale style of the Hobbit. Even when Gandalf tells Frodo of the dangers Middle Earth is facing, we don't truely get a feel for it. Tolkien's talent comes out when we realize we are gradually becoming aware of Sauron's threat just as the characters are. The Black Riders at first seem just a mysterious, though deadly, hindrance, and their true demonic nature only is revealed with time. For Tolkien to accurately convey the growing sense of dread as he does, THAT is the mark of a writer who will be remembered for many generations.Enough of that; The Lord of the Rings is a classic, one of the great books of the English-speaking world.

Even in the face of this laudable boldness I am compelled to say I hated it from beginning to end. The production sounds as though a bunch of somnambulant old men with no acting skills whatsoever were dragged into a closet filled with expensive digital recording equipment and forced to read a script which they have never seen before. It appears that no attempt was made at casting or direction in spite of the obvious effort to include nearly the whole of the three books.I highly recommend anybody considering the purchase of an audio dramatization of TLOTR to consider the BBC Radio version also available at this site, in spite of a few sadly missing scenes the production is much better."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This 50th anniversary edition of The Lord of the Rings is truly a fine example of what a collectors edition of a book should be. The cover is a very fine leather (it looks blue in stock photos, but is actually a nice shade of black) with bronze and gold gilt creating the cover image. The pages are frequently described as \\"Bible quality\\" but they are quite a bit thicker than most bibles I've ever seen.The text is fully updated and includes 3 pages from The Book of Marzubul designed by Tolkien himself. It's interesting how much detail Tolkien went to when creating these pages. In the text, Gandalf mentions that the book is written by different hands, and this is evident from the pages given. More interesting however, is that using the Appendix on Runes found in The History of Middle-earth Volume 7 - The Treason of Isengard (being The History of The Lord of the Rings Volume 2) you can actually translate the runes of The Book of Marzubul into phonetic English (or I suppose Westron actually). Very interesting.The fold out maps are exceptionally large and useful as well. This is easily the nicest edition of The Lord of the Rings that I have ever seen and I HIGHLY recommend it to any Lord of the Rings fan. The price may seem a little high, but at my local Barnes and Noble it runs $100 even, so Amazon's price is EXTREMELY reasonable.If you buy this book, you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This review pertains to the 3 volume boxed set of The Lord of the Rings. I've had this set of books for a couple years now, and absolutely love them. The illustrations by Alan Lee are great, and in my opinion are the most faithful renditions of what was in Tolkien's head most of the time. The binding is immaculate and the books are printed on very high quality paper.This is a great way to enjoy the Lord of the Rings. This set is obviously not for the casual reader (though I can't imagine a casual reader dishing out this kind of money), and you certainly can't curl up with this version, but that's not the point. The illustrated edition is a work of art in its own right, and I can imagine using this version to read the books to my kids but not taking them with me to read in bed. I have a paperback version of the books as well, but this is a great edition to have if, like me, you love these timeless classics so much you simply want a lasting tribute to them."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I wanna so much J.R.R.

If this kind of care and attention were still given to the publishing of all great literature we might find that more people would still have the respect for reading that we once did. I would like every book in my library to be this kind of quality. As far as a review of the book goes... Well, it's Lord of the Rings. There just isn't much I should need to say about that."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"So after years of umming and ahhhing over reading this series I am finally glad to have done so! Having brought it I did not emerge from the book until I was finished and this is what I love in a book. One that truly ensnares the reader in the world and doesn't let go until the end. This is the essence of J.R.R.Tolkeins writing, he is the utmost master of writing that draws the reader in from the first world. I would insert a huge paragraph about how amazing these books are but given the fact that almost everyone knows how great they are it would be pointless.This kindle set is a nice set. Highly Recommend."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is a 3 books in one group and over 1100 pages. However, the story telling, descriptions and poetry are lovely.

I bought it used and it was in the good condition that it was advertised and also arrived well within the time allotted for delivery."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I like the book but it is a huge book and its not like you can carry it around where ever you go."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Thank goodness the book (still better than the movie) is as good as I remeber, The only reason I gave it 4 was shipping by the seller was slow.I just wish they had followed the book when they made the movie. I had the first edition when it came to USA but after reading and rereading it fell apart. Need I say more"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Overall, the book is good. I didn't see any print errors or anything like that. My biggest issue is the fact that since it is all three books put into one, navigating to a particular chapter or page is very difficult. It's basically just broken down into the 3 books themselves and then further broken down into the major sections within each book. Not broken down by each chapter the way I was hoping."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Bought this as a Christmas gift for my son. He wanted an older version not one with the movie &#34;commercial&#34; cover. This was a beautiful used version , like new. thanks !"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have to say this is a really nice edition of the Lord of the Rings. I have been wanting to get this edition for a while to go along with my illustrated edition of The Hobbit. Alan Lee is a wonderful artist. His drawings have a realistic look to them which is why I would prefer this edition above all the other ones. I see a lot of people try to compare the 50th anniversary edition and the illustrated edition but I can't really say the same as I don't own the 50th anniversary edition. Maybe in the future I'll purchase that one. I've read that one has a map of Middle Earth that folds out in the back of it. But I don't think it has illustrations. Nonetheless I'm still happy with this illustrated edition. It's the nicest copy of Lord of the Rings I've owned so far. My only complaint about it is that the one I bought didn't have the blue ribbon bookmark attached to it. Which is curious because I bought it brand new straight from Amazon and the ones I've seen on store shelves in the past had the blue ribbon bookmark. I didn't even see any sign of one that could have been ripped off or something. I don't know if there were some made without it or what because any reviews I read about it before described the blue ribbon bookmark as well. It's not really that big of a deal if mine doesn't have one. But at the same time I was just a little disappointed because I was expecting it to have it on there. So now as I close this review I will be returning to another adventure in Middle Earth (it's been a few years since I last read Lord of the Rings) in this very nice edition with Alan Lee's masterpiece illustrations. Once I'm done though I will also be getting the illustrated edition of the Silmarillion."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"We all know the stunning and captivating tale of, The Lord of the Rings. We are all familliar with the masterful exciting narrative. So I won't bother boring you all with a repetitive, review of the thrilling tale. Instead I will give a review of the Alan Lee illustrated edition of Tolkiens' masterpiece. Alan Lee's artwork is pure sublime & brings the characters and world of Middle Earth to life perfectly.The Blue edition (as it is known) is a hefty volume and its a workout for the arms while reading it, buit it is a beautiful edition and, well worth every penny spent on buying it. The illustrations are pure artistic genius and the care and detail which Lee had put into these pieces of art shows.I have prviouslt purchased the 50th anniversary edition which is alsoa n impresssive edition too, except with no art work bar the pull-out maps etc...So if you are thinking of buying a copy you won't go far wrong with the Illustrated edition a perfect addition to any Tolkien fans Collection."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"It was well worth every minute it took to read it.

For those who like the movies, the books offer so much more back story. Watch for places and characters that have show up in more recent literature and movies: large spiders (Aragog in Harry Potter), the creepy forest that people shouldn't go in -- Mirkwood (Forbidden Forest, again HP), Endor means Middle Earth (Star Wars anyone?) and many more!. How many can you find? Get to know the characters and what drives them. Experience the beauty and wonders of Middle Earth as never before.

Every book I was forced to read was a drudgery. Then my Dad bought the Lord of The Rings Fotonovel for me. I began to read it and couldn't put it down. Over the course of the rest of my school life I read this book 21 times and discovered that I loved to read! This book saved me and made me realize I could create my own images in my head without the pictures to do it for me. Best purchase my Dad ever made!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"What good is Lord of the Rings without the maps? Well, great, if you pretty much have it memorized! Having the Lord of the Rings available to me electronically is something I have desired for many years now. The hardcover editions of the book have always felt a little too much like college textbooks to be to my liking, and I have always hated paperbacks. Now the quest for the electronic version of the one book to rule them all is finally over, and we can all rest easy. Even if this version is missing some maps.I have been reading ebooks since the days Palm first came out, but have always been disappointed that the classic LoTR has not been available. Seeing it again really makes me smile, and even though there are some problems with this electronic version, one can't fault it as one of the great works of all time. Not only are some of the maps missing, but there are a few typographical errors as well, but for a book so large this is to be expected, and I expect that if they are corrected in later editions, the electronic versions I purchase now will be updated for redownload later.Even if not, I am more than satisfied with the way it is now.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Lord of the Rings books are great, but the publisher of these books really did a poor job of printing these. There is extra ink on some of the pages and the maps are poorly put in place."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"A clean version that puts the adventures of Middle Earth all in one place for a low price! When I lost (loaned and never returned) my old copies of the LOTR I started looking around for a version that presented all six books together without annoying spelling and editorial mistakes. This version was great, don't waste your money on other versions. Unless you can afford the leather bound versions, I've heard they are excellent."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This 50th Anniversary Edition of the LOTR Trilogy is really lovely. Its pages are sturdy enough, although a heavier cover would have been more suitable for a volume this size, combining as it does the entire \\"Trilogy\\" in a single book. While this edition may require a little extra care in its handling, this doesn't detract one iota from the enjoyment of reading it.There is a certain richness to the look and feel of this edition's gold-leaf pages, with both volume and slipcase bound in leather. I admit to being surprised by the explanation of one reviewer that the binding is not real leather. I am no expert, but I wonder if owners might be confusing this edition with a release several years ago of a red-leather-bound single volume edition (publisher unknown to me).Many Tolkien fans would certainly enjoy adding this handsome Edition to their libraries, so if you can still find this limited-edition LOTR, buy it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The illustrations are breath-taking!

Having 2 colored print enhances the beauty of the work, and a fold-out map in the back is quite handy and wonderfully done. Overall, this edition really is a collector's piece, whether to never open the book, or to explore each page in a whole new way."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Without the Lord of the Rings, we wouldn't have any great fantasy; not Star Wars, Thomas Covenant, or the Shanarra books. Reading the trilogy, you see how Tolkien has been borrowed from by so many of the great authors. The range of emotions encapsulated herein are far and wide. There is the warmth of the Hobbit's hominess, the nobility exhibited by most of the characters; Aragorn, even Boromir, and yes, the Hobbits. The power of evil is great, but in the face of such love and courage, it is rendered nothing, and all the sadness becomes untrue. Even if you have seen all the movies, you can't say there's no point in reading the books. While Peter Jackson's films are magnificent, they are not the books. The books have unusual turns of phrase and poetry, insights into the characters that film just cannot convey. See the movies and read the books both. While in most cases, the only way the movie can equal or surpass the book is if the book merely adapts the movie, in this case, the two are equals, complementary to one another."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I bought this edition online at Barnes and Noble. The prices are better here, so by all means buy it from Amazon. I cannot even comment on how the book is so great. I will talk about the actual edition - IT IS BEAUTIFUL - when it arrived I was so overjoyed I screamed. It's my prized possesion!! It comes in a matching red case, and easily slides in and out. Designs similar to that of the Door to Moria made by Durin decorate the cover. Something I really like is the ink. There is both red and black ink, and it is clear and beautiful. Buy this as a gift for a Tolkien fan, or a mild enthusiest. I recommend the owner be at least 12.WOW!!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Lord of the Rings in my opinion is the single greatest piece of literature to be written and conceived by a single man. Tolkien was am absolutely brilliant Philologist and was way ahead of all the scholars back then (when he was at oxford), and still is even after his death. He had a noble heart and was generous with his time to others. And Most of all he loved the natural world as god had created it untainted by industry. He was a lover of trees. He was and still is the greatest English Literary scholar of european and germanic languages, and read more than most people read in a lifetime. On the whole he knew the entire history of English literature, Could speak fluent anglo saxon, German and Greek and Latin. He knew the great tales of men's past not in their modern english translations but as they were originally written and conceived. Like the Iliad anf the odyssey, in greek, the kalevala in finnish, and beowulf in the original saxon. He had also read the Elder Edda and Younger Edda, sometimes known as the poetic edda and the prose edda, in original ancient german. He had read the whole corpus of Icelandic Sagas in their original language, and was a lover of the latin translation of the bible which he recited at catholic mass. Here is a book that should be taught in English classes in middle school and high schools and colleges. But the literary elite does'nt want that to happen because of their preference for post-modernism and reality based fiction. Plus he knew good literature, and not that snobby tripe they shove down our throats in school."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I first read Lord of the Rings just over 20 years ago. It took me close to a week of obsessive reading - I barely stopped to eat and slept only when I could stay awake no longer. As I turned the last page, I was overwhelmed with a feeling of envy that only a booklover would understand - envy of the people who had not yet read this work, and who could look forward to reading it for the first time. Since then, I have re-read it several times and if ever I am marooned on the stereotyped desert island, this is the book I would want most of all. I have long hesitated to review this opus - how could I possibly do it justice?The storyline is too well known by now to need any repetition. What impressed me were two major features. One, the sheer scale of the epic. Tolkien did not just write a story, he literally created a universe and populated it with peoples of various kinds, each with their own history, culture, language, customs and tradition. Yet the epic is internally and externally consistent, like a huge carpet or tapestry, covered with multiple themes and motifs, yet all fitting seamlessly into the overall pattern. I was, and continue to be in awe at his mastery of the complexity and detail of his universe. Second, the sheer beauty of his writing. Rarely today does one come across writing that is both prose and poetry combined (and I don't mean just the songs in the book). Whether it be dialog or description, history or geography, Tolkien's writing is filled with melody and harmony - not a single word is out of place. Now add in the storyline, a masterpiece of depth, width and color, a blend of commonplace daily life shaken by terror and fear, sparkling with emotion and building always with hope to the climax. We will probably never see the like of this again. Do also read the Silmarillion and the Hobbit; the former in particular will add to your appreciation of the Lord of the Rings.The Leatherette Edition, with high quality binding and an excellent fold-out map multiplies the pleasure of reading. A wonderful gift to give or receive, and to keep in a place of pride on your bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I just got this edition for Christmas. I own several paperback editions, and I've also lost several. So a big heavy book containing all three parts of the story is great for me. For someone who often reads on the go, this may not be the best choice. But for those who like to display their books on their shelves, or sit and read in front of a nice cozy fire, this is a wonderful addition to any Tolkien or fantasy fan's book collection.The designs imprinted on the book in gold, blue and green are intricate and beautiful; modled after Tolkien's drawings himself. Inside it's printed in both red and black ink (the headings are in red), and gives the impression that you are reading a very old book. And it fits the story perfectly, as it is legend. Unabridged, it includes all parts of the text, including the appendices. In the back there is a large and beautifully detailed fold-out map of Middle-earth. It's very helpful in visualizing the story.Over all, this book looks like something that could actually be found in Middle-earth; a timeless text that you can see hobbits opening and reading to their grandchildren. If you are looking for a gift for any Tolkien fan and book lover, this is a sure bet.(oh, and I am older than 12, but I don't have an account here)"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have been a long time fan of the LOTR. Since the movies were released some of my friends wanted to know more about the books, so I checked this set out of the Library thinking it was a good place to start. Sadly I was mistaken from the very begining this recording is a disappointment. The Actors voices are flat and devoid of expression. As a result, the listener gets the impression that the characters treat their task with the same respect that they would place on a Disney movie.After one disc of waiting for things to get better, I decided to try listening to the battle Of Helms Deep. Here too I found nothing but an endless monotone backed by poor sound effects.If you are a true Tolkien fan or someone who wants to get the full magic of The Lord of the Rings I recommend the BBC production starring Ian Holm."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Lord of the Rings is one of the greatest and perhaps most imitated works of fiction ever written. From the very begining the reader is drawn into a world of fantasy that compleatly surrounds. Tolkien brings the characters of Middle Earth to life in such detail and color that they seem as real as any name from history. As remarkable in it's rich detail and description as it is in it's plot, The Lord of the Rings is a must read for any fan of adventure or fantasy. My best advice is to spend the money to obtain a copy of the best quality that will last for a very long time, as this is a book that should be passed on from generation to generation."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Overall, I'd say this is a fair audio adaptation of the trilogy. However, there are times when the action portrayed isn't adequately conveyed by what you are hearing. Also, as another reviewer noted, the voices given to the characters are terrible at times. For instance, they give Sam an annoying little boy's voice, and in one scene, for some reason, they give elves screechy fairy-folk voices, like they're supposed to be pixies or something. Did they just misunderstand what elves are supposed to be in the Tolkein mythology? Also, after seeing the movie, you will be disappointed when Gimli doesn't have a Scottish accent, and in general disappointed by the other voices. Another problem is that you get cheesy sounding laser blast sound effects when Gandalf uses his power. These things kind of ruined it for me."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This seems to be the only unabridged recording on CD which is enough of a surprise. Unfortunately, I find the recording only average. Mr. Inglis does an alright job and I concede that this is a very difficult piece to handle, but I agree with the 12/11/2003 reviewer who said that he sounds bored at times, too sing-song at others. I would add to that that he doesn't do a good enough job of adopting well-distinguished voices for each character. If you have had the pleasure of hearing any of the Harry Potter books performed by Jim Dale, you will be disappointed, as I was, by this one. Nevertheless, for now, this is the only way to listen to the pure, unedited Tolkien.Also, I just discovered, my copy of FotR has two disc 16's and no disc 15!!! Tried playing each to see if it was just a labelling problem - they are the same disc."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"There is so much that can be said about The Lord of the Rings... The power of the book for me was in the piercing spiritual insights into the challenges and choices of how to face despair. Against overwhelming odds, and a sure knowledge of the HOPELESSNESS of all possible action, Denethor, who was so mighty and noble and wise and therefore should have been one to have more self-confidence, chose to succumb to the despair and committed suicide. In contrast the two hobbitts, by nature weak and frail and therefore with even less hope than one as mighty as Denethor, took into account the utter hopelessness of their situation but chose to go forward anyway. This is where the value of Tolkien's own experience shows: he who had been called away from his home to a hopeless war, away from the one he loved, held a keen understanding of the paths that Sam and Frodo walked, and the darkness that Denethor faced...The height of spiritual courage is conveyed in a few brief sentences that tell of Sam's progression while on the road in Mordor from hopelessness into a resolve that is made heroic by its utter selflessness... \\"But even as hope died in Sam, or seemed to die, it was turned to a new strength. Sam's plain hobbit-face grew stern, almost grim, as the will hardened in him, and he felt through all his limbs a thrill, as if he was turning into some creature of stone and steel that neither despair nor weariness nor endless barren miles could subdue.\\" (p.934)The book reveals the hopelessness of the road in Mordor in a way that the movie cannot do... the dread and despair of that journey as they realize there is no hope of return, and little hope of success ahead.After struggling with the despair Sam's resolve turns to steel and he reaches the point where he rises above the despair.\\"With a gasp Frodo cast himself on the ground. Sam sat by him. To his surprise he felt tired but lighter, and his head seemed clear again. No more debates disturbed his mind. He knew all the arguments of despair and would not listen to them. His will was set and only death would break it.\\" (p. 940)There are many worthwhile insights in the book, but the single phrase: \\"He knew all the arguments of despair and would not listen to them,\\" contains by far the most profound of all Tolkien's insights. It reflects the stance I believe that Tolkien took during his own dark days in the trenches, far from home, far from the hopes of his life. The lines he composed \\"Cold be heart and hand and bones, cold be travellers far from home... they do not see what lies ahead when sun has failed and moon is dead\\" were very apt and effectively conveyed the grim horror of being alone in the darkness far from home and hope that are meant to be conveyed as well in the dreaded journey of the hobbits to finish their task in Mordor.It is human nature to give in to despair. It is harder still to forge on despite being familiar with \\"all the arguments of despair\\". The reality is that there are some who choose this path and then never waiver, even as they face their own deaths. Essentially, Tolkien is describing the highest achievement of the human spirit, which is to carry the heaviest burden WITHOUT HOPE, and yet not renounce the journey, in essence to renounce self and all self interest as secondary and less important in comparison to fulfilling the heroic quest. This was the point that Sam reached, and ironically, it led to \\"a new strength\\" for Sam. Denethor could not renounce self, and his insistence on clinging to his self interest bound him as a slave to despair, just as the wringraiths were bound as slaves to the darkness of Sauron, as all others who could not renounce the rings(self-empowerment) were bound to the same doom.It is interesting to note that the same struggle between self-interest/self-preservation and self-sacrifice in service of the soul's higher calling is an age old struggle and well recognized in the ancient books of the world (John 12:27 \\"Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.\\")Tolkien offers a whole world of amazing complexity and depth; this is just a scratch of the surface.Tolkien's story is a great tale when read simply for the story itself, underneath the story lies a profound metaphor which taps into great reservoirs of spiritual truth.Well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"It seems Harper Collins has two different books in their catalog with the ISBN of 0261103253. One is the 1995 copywrite revised text edition paperback (which is the book you will actually get if you order it.) The other is the 50th Anniversary edition paperback (which is the cover picture shown here.) So buyer beware."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I don't actually own this particular edition of the series so I can't review it as I normally would, but I couldn't find my edition. So I would just like to express my perception of the story to perhaps change the perspective people view this with. Read on.Okay, I'm seriously tired of people not understanding why the content is as it is. What I mean is people complain about the lack of stylized storytelling as they are accustomed to in modern literature. One person said that there shouldn't be an introduction describing the hobbits because those details should be unfolded in the story, one said that there are characters with backgrounds that aren't expanded on, many say the language is too flashy and complicated.Of the language problem, all I have to say to that is: So's the Bible. Really, you have to look at them kind of the same. While The Silmarillion may be the one that is stylized after the Bible, this \\"trilogy\\" (really one story and not a trilogy) is also a historical document, but just of Middle-Earth. Historical documents are often written in language uncommon to our own; they sound more dated and mostly are. The misunderstanding of this not being an actual series of isolated novels actually answers the other questions as well, and this is something Peter Jackson clearly did not understand when making the movies. The Lord Of The Rings is not the story of Frodo, the Ring, and the Fellowship, but actually a part of the story of Middle-Earth that focuses on them. That is why the back story is not revealed in the text; it's already covered in past sections of this big story that the series fits into. In the original DVD of The Fellowship Of The Ring, I remember Peter Jackson talking about why he decided to cut out stuff like Tom Bombadil. His reason was that he had to look at it and say, \\"What relevence does this have to the story of Frodo and the Ring?\\" If you can see it from my point of view, that is the wrong question. I think it is ludicrous to cut out plot pieces that could only make the story bigger, better, and more expansive (and Tom's appearance would have been a fine piece of cinema. It could have added to a sense of surrealism and some mystery in the story of the first movie, plus I would love to see his dwelling - accurately - translated onto the big screen).Let me reiterate. There are so many parts of the book irrelevent to Frodo and the Ring because they are not the real subject. You read the Silmarillion and it does not seem as though you are reading a collection of single stories about events in Middle-Earth, instead you feel you are reading the history of the world. You must look at these the same way. Someone may quip that The Hobbit was practically a novel, and I agree there and would have to say I think I like it better for that, but I'm just saying you must understand the context of these stories. Why Tolkien didn't supply us all this backstory information beforehand I do not know, but I think it may have to do with the fact of how it was published. See, the appendix was supposed to be put in The Fellowship Of The Ring after the decision was made to split the one story into three smaller editions because of the post WWII publishing costs. But time and money didn't allow for this to happen so it wasn't until months later when The Return Of The King was published when the appendices were available. So perhaps the backstory was meant to be summarized for you from the beginning but it just didn't end up that way.If you can see it this way I can't guaruntee more enjoyment, but maybe a better understanding as to why it was written in this style and won't complain about it using language you don't understand and not being very traditionally written (although its language style is very traditional). But anyway, to make this a review, I see this as definately being 5 star material and I'm sure just about everyone else in the world does. Who hasn't read these books now? If you haven't, do it soon.Clearly from the vastness and style of these stories this was meant to be no ordinary novel and I hope that someone out there can read my view and maybe adapt theirs before my review becomes inevitably covered and lost in other people's."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is usually found in a single volume, or in three volumes: 1) \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\", 2) \\"The Two Towers\\", and 3) \\"The Return of the King\\". My recommended reading age is 13+ years old, and I recommend reading \\"The Hobbit\\" first.When I was 15 years old in high school, I had to read \\"The Hobbit\\" for an English class. After reading that book, the teacher then let us borrow \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". Before I had started \\"The Return of the King\\", I had bought my own set of books. After I had read both books, I actually liked \\"The Hobbit\\" better than \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" at first - because \\"The Hobbit\\" was brighter: a fun, grand adventure with more humor, whereas \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" was darker: a serious, grim life and death struggle for world survival. But by the time I was about 16, the historical significance of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" began to appeal more to me. This is especially true if you read Appendices A and B of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", and also read \\"The Silmarillion\\". You begin to understand the rich history of Tolkien's Middle-Earth/ Beleriand creation. How \\"The Silmarillion\\" brings out the significant events of the First and Second Ages, while the events in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" are the culmination of the Third Age...each Age lasting thousands of years and ending with an immensely significant event.It was 25 years before I read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" again, but Bilbo, Frodo, Sam, Gandalf, Aragorn, Galadriel, Legolas, Gimli, and many more had become household names! I had matured over those years, and my tastes changed. I was no longer a big fantasy/science-fiction reader: instead I was reading military history. I didn't expect to still love \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" the way I did as a teenager. I was happily wrong! This is still an exciting book, but I discovered what I really love...it is allegory-type stories. J. R. R. Tolkien himself has said that \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is not allegory, because he hated allegory where he felt the author is dictating to the reader what is in their story...and that any other interpretation is incorrect. Tolkien wanted a reader to apply their own experiences and tastes to influence what they were reading. OK, but in real history one can still get allegory if their own experiences and tastes allow it. How many can learn about World War II and not apply the basic allegorical interpretation that good triumphs over evil? I've heard of, and can understand, several allegorical interpretations of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". Frodo is like Jesus Christ: bearing the greatest of burdens for world salvation while being tempted to stray from his purpose, and the weight of the ring is similar to Christ's cross . The One Ring is like the atomic bomb: the ultimate weapon that corrupts whoever uses it, despite even good intentions, into a power-hungry creature of evil. There's an ecological message with the Ents trying to protect trees; and also the natural beauty of various places throughout Middle-Earth, while evil beings try to destroy it all (including the use of mechanical and polluting progress). I also get out of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" a sense of a military mission: that Frodo & Sam are behind enemy lines on a mission that could end a war, and that Frodo realizes that getting back home or even staying alive doesn't matter - just completion of the mission...that's also sacrifice, perseverance, & camaraderie so prevalent in the military history I've read. There's prejudice with years of animosity between elves and dwarves, and how small, kind gestures can begin to erase all those blighted years...also, how people or races can put aside differences to solve a common problem. There's the recognition of the small, common people (citizen soldiers) that perform the greatest, toughest, and most necessary duty in any war. There's world peace in peril and that something needs to be done before it's too late. There's avoiding the easier way out, and facing one's problems and seeing them through to a conclusion despite severe hardships.I feel that Tolkien saw a little bit of himself in many of the good races of his world. The hobbits are like Tolkien because they love food, company, and talking about family. The ents are like Tolkien because of their unbounded love of trees. Gandalf the wizard is like Tolkien because of his exceptional intelligence and purpose of guiding others along the right path. Some men are like Tolkien because of their inner strength and gallantry, while other men show weakness by succumbing to evil...very realistic. But I believe he saw the beauty and enchantment of the elves in his wife, and why he loved both most dearly: that's why on their gravestone Luthien appears after his wife's name, and Beren appears after his name. The dwarves don't seem to resemble Tolkien, but they are present in much folklore, which is linked to his personal love of medieval languages.\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is a masterpiece in my opinion, and it's size (over 1000 pages in any printed format) is pretty daunting, but give it a shot! It'll be time well spent. And get ready for adventure, terror, excitement, love, treachery, devotion, monumental historic events, unforgettable battles, military strategy, exotic languages & culture, etc. See what you get out of the book! I think most people will enjoy it and/or be moved by it. And who knows, maybe it'll become your favorite book too!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I picked this up as a gift for my brother and decided to get myself one too.

The trilogy is wonderful from start to finish, and the Kindle version is cheaper and far less bulky than the hard copies."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"So much has been written on Tolkien's grand saga (particularly since Peter Jackson has brought it to the forefront pop culture) that I fear I have little to add. Yet I must mention some of the greatest joys I found in Tolkien's masterpiece. First, though The Lord of the Rings is a wonderfully original creation and a fully formed world, I am repeatedly struck and entertained by how Tolkien weaves in themes from other works. Those familiar with the Edda and Wagner's Ring cycle will be pleasantly surprised how Tolkien takes old material and reweaves it into something appealing and new. Also, Tolkien reworks a lot of George MacDonald's ideas (the greatness of courage, the self-destructiveness of evil, and the wisdom of innocence) into a new, more complex setting. The theme that I love most from The Lord of the Rings is that truth overcomes knowledge. Truth keeps knowledge guessing and uninformed. This is seen in the misplays of both Saruman and Sauron. Most importantly, this is a tale that [stinks] the reader in and will not let them go...even after it ends."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"For someone in the third world $... is a huge investment. But I'm glad I ordered a book a couple of years ago. I'm a proud owner of this edition that a lot friends want to keep for their own. The centennial edition is the most elegant among all the LOTR sets I've seen. An added case would have made it more valuable. Considering the book's weight, the binding is surprisingly sturdy compared to most hardcover books.Alan Lee's illustration are simply marvelous. (The movie draws much of inspiration from Lee's images; Lee afterall provided the initial designs for the film I understand.) It's a good thing that the publishers decided to print the color plates on coated paper and the text on book paper. Text on coated paper is a bit difficult to read and stick to one another in time, especially under tropical conditions where I live.Well, I don't there is anything more to add to what people have said about the novel itself. Either you love it or you hate it. If you're one of those who love Tolkien, this one edition to keep, re-read and re-read, and display. I've lost so many copies of LOTR in the past 30 years. Certainly, this is one set to own. It's one convenienet volume everyone wants to borrow, but I'm not sure if any onw would want to lend."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I went to USA to study for my master's degree in 1978 and J.R.R. Tolkein and comments on Lord of the Rings were writen every where even in toilets. I bought the first book out of curiousity and spent 2 days and 2 nights finishing to set. The experience was more than good reading. It was like reading Greek tragedy with happy ending. I read them again many times untill now. Virginia Wolf committed suicide in despair during the dark hours of World War II, J.R.R. Tolkein gave us Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Those of you who know Tolkien and his amazing immagination, need not be told what is thought of the story. What you DO need to know is that I have owned this particular Edition since 1978, and it is still one of my favorite pieces to display.The price tag on this all in one trilogy should not scare you away, it is worth every cent and then some.By the way, go ahead and splurge, get The Hobbit in this configuration also.

This will work best with kids 10 and older. Read a page or two every night at bedtime. I've read through \\"The Hobbit\\" twice to our kids, and have read through \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy once to them. Our boys are all teenagers. We read every night for 20-30 minutes. We've also unplugged our TV and replace this time with reading in our home. Tolkein is an excellent storyteller, with vivid descriptions a cinematographer can only begin to play with. Your child's imagination is so much greater than that of any movie maker. Give them the gift of your time and Tolkein's genius writing: Read Tolkein Aloud to your Kids!For two books filled with other creative ideas for parents such as this one, take a look at \\"The Family Cloister\\" and \\"The Christian Family Toolbox\\", both written by David Robinson."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I am here to let the rest of the world know exactly how extraordinary The Lord of the Rings is. These books, along with the Hobbit made what we call the Fantasy genre, period. Without it, no one would know much besides the passing legends and tales of the times. Tolkien is an absolute genius, and his world is filled with such magic and visualization that at times it leaves you breathless.Now everyone is entitled to their own opinon, but there is no way that The lOrd of the Ring is as was called before, &quot;Annoying Drivel&quot;. Everyone I know, even those whom don't like the Fantasy Genre think that it is a classic, magical work of art. Like a Michaelangelo, or a Dali. To deny the fact that it is one of the classics is like denying the Earth is round.To anyone who hasn't read the books yet, ignor such reviews of book from people whom don't even have enough sense to read a complete book before they write a review. That would be like getting into a Historical Debate without even taking a History class in your life. (Besides... I don't think he graduated anyways)Diffently check these books out. They are that good, and wll worth your money and time. Especially if Fantasy is you favorite genre."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"We have, over the years collected the dramatizations of many books, especially the classics, in unabridged form. Pride & Prejuidice, Jane Eyre, and 30 or so others. For the most part we avoid abridged books on cassette.In the case of LOTR we had to make an exception. Firstly, it was re-run on Radio4 in England when we first moved there in 1987. Our son was only 5 at the time but was riveted to his seat every Sunday at 2pm for one hour. It made a lasting impression on him then and still does some 15 years later.For myself, once we bought the complete set (13 one-hour tapes) it was just a question of finding an excuse to listen to them again. It is by far the most captivating story every written for drama. And the characterizations are phenomenal, as were the choice of actors.My biggest question about the tapes is from where did they get the actor who played Gollum and under what rock is he hiding now? If he wasnt' mad when he started he must have been when the work was finished. One gets the impression that each participant in the dramatization lived the character, almost to the same extent that the actors in the LOTR movie must have felt, due to their isolation and long commitment to the production.A real bonus in my mind was also the music and singing, as they form an important part of all Tolkien works. Once you have received the radio version of the music, re-reading the books spices them up a bit when you get to the songs which had previously been dry.What amazed me about the set of 13 tapes was that it is now available on CD (13 disks) although I have only seen it at [a mass merchandiser] and not at any bookstore.If you love the book, I suggest that the abridged radio play will grab your attention. I am an avid Tolkien fan and fully intend to see the movie(s), but my yardstick for dramatization is the radio play and not the book. The book is just too dense and overwhelming and as always a liberty must be taken here or there (Black Riders on brown horses) to capture in manageable form such a long tome."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I was stunned. I have never read a book where the author has written so well that emotions rise and fall with the book. If the company has hope and is being merry then you are light and cheery and everything goes quickly. If the company is in a feeling of doom then your emotions fall and the book drags but you just can't put it (the book) away. Brilliant, too bad Tolkien didn't live longer to write us more books."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This book truly fulfilled my expectations. After hearing here and there that J.R.R Tolkien is amazing, I decided to try the 1400 and more pages that compose this trilogy, but don't get scare by the huge page volume, because when you pass the 100th page you are so immersed in the story that reading another hundred seems like something you have to do right away. Easy to read novel, but time consuming.While reading TLOTR you get immersed in whole new world, which is completely believable and fully described, from the strange and interesting (in physic and personality) characters, to the geography. The latter comes with maps!, which are indispensable to follow and enjoy the story to its fullest. While reading you are able to see in these maps the development of the quest (you should know that there is one), how much has passed, how much is coming, try to guess what direction will they take...across the mountains?, through this river or crossing that forest....The maps, the characters, and the journey make the book.Don't make the mistake of underestimating this book, I've read it right after Dostoievsky' Karamazov Brothers and Kafka's Metamorphosis, and I cannot say that they outstand TLOTR in quality. Even more, it's truly refreshing to read something completely different from all that we usually do.Another thing I want to add...you know how most people while growing up start loosing interest in things like video games or TV cartoons?, really, this may also apply to this book. I'm 25, and I recognize the possibility that I could've enjoyed more this novel when I was 16....and also that maybe I wouldn't have enjoyed it that much if I were 50. Its known that while years pass we loose our ability to feel surprised and amazed by new things...so read TLOTR while you still have your imagination running and have fun."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"There are a select few writers of High Fantasy who tell magnificent stories, paint striking landscapes, populate their worlds with unique and fully realized characters, and tell their tales with a humbling mastery of language. I am a harsh critic, and count this small group (while recognizing their flaws, as all writers have) as being: Stephen R. Donaldson, Robert Jordan, Tad Williams and George R. R. Martin.But towering above them all, as surely as Shakespeare towers over such masters as James Joyce, Nathaniel Hawthorne, William Faulkner, etc., is J.R.R. Tolkien.LOTR is in a different class than all other so-called contenders to the throne. It is a classic, and is the only work of High Fantasy to be universally recognized -- that is, outside the realm of fantasy -- as one of the greatest books ever written.If you have grown up on Brooks, Eddings, and more recently Goodkind, you may be disappointed (note that I did not include them above!). Do not expect to be wowed on every page, or to have magic thrust upon you at each turn. Tolkien's magic and power is in his words. He needs no special effects to tell his story, and that is what raises him above all the rest. He demonstrates restraint that very few writers would be courageous enough to attempt today -- at least if they were interested in selling books.But take this into account: The Lord of the Rings is *still* selling today, more than forty years after its first printing. It is on every bookshelf of every major bookseller in America. He did something right. Read it, and find out for yourself."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Im not a Tolkien fan, but this book marks the begining of a whole new begining of fantasy books.

Tolkien used much more than any other author in the creation of this story. It all stems back to the fact that he created an entire world, not just this story. While reading this you feel the angst of Middle-Earth as all of its beings are drawn into a struggle against evil. You can detect how some are swayed to try to use the One Ring to save good even though it will in the end betray and corrupt them. The setting of the story gives a feeling of being in a forgotten world or a forgotten time in our own history. It almost is soothing, for it puts you in a possition where you are no longer in the midst of the hustle and bustle of our world. Indeed, you are taken into a world where the only hustle is to destroy the Ring. The many references to the history of Middle-Earth make the book even deeper as you see that there is much more to this world than meets your eye at first glance. The depth of the world makes Middle-Earth more than a world... it makes it your world. I suggest this book to everyone!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Finally The Lord Of The Rings has been combined into one book.

I'm sure most of the negative reviews come from those who never heard of LOTR until after they heard the mainstream media hype and saw the movie.First of all, to call a book that is barely 1100 pages long and boring does not say much for ones reading skills or their life in general. This is just plain laziness. Did it take you a week to read the first 100 pages? Can you focus on anything in life for more than 4 Mtv minutes?Secondly, to say there is to much detail in the description of landscapes and too many characters is preposterous. Again this argument relates to length and focus. This is an EPIC!! Look it up. There is a book called the bible that has many more characters and is fascinating as liturature. These are the same people who don't understand Joseph Campbell. One of the main themes of the book is stewardship of the earth. Tolkien was in love and concerned with the welfare of the earth. He is writing in a travelogue style of the world he created the same way as John Muir, Bruce Chatwin, Edwin Wilson, and Bill Bryson write of this world. Anyone who does'nt get this should get off the computer out of the house and travel to become connected with their environment.Thirdly to say there is little magic in this fantasy novel is again preposterous. After Tolkien the use of magic in fantasy novels increased and have become a deus ex machina device for all the following less than skilled authors to write less than inspirational work. The lack of reliance on this device is a monument to Tolkien's skill as a writer.To use any of these points as a basis for a negative review is admiting you did'nt understand the work and what Tolkien was communicating. This results in the negative feelings you have for the book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Whatever problems might have been with this book before, they seem to have been solved - the pages are sewn in, the leather is gorgeous and feels wonderful, and it is a solid, beautiful, wonderful book.The Lord of the Rings is also, of course, a five star story, but I am five starring this review solely on the physical characteristics of this leather edition.Mmmmmmmm.... s'wonderful!Sit in your highback reading chair in front of the fire with a glass of Cognac reading this one.

But none has ever said it with quite the passion and resonance of J. R. R. Tolkien in his groundbreaking opus, THE LORD OF THE RINGS. This lengthy sequel to THE HOBBIT, mistakenly considered a trilogy due to its being published in three parts (&quot;The Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; &quot;The Two Towers,&quot; and &quot;The Return of the King&quot;), has maintained its reputation as the benchmark achievement of &quot;sword-and-sorcery&quot; literature for 47 years.In the exquisitely detailed story of Middle-Earth's great war and the quest to destroy the One Ring, a token imbued with evil power, stands a fable for the ages echoing with the message that the future is ours to choose even in the face of inevitable change. This epic stands as such a singular achievement due in part to its broadly identifiable heroes, vivid realization of Middle-Earth and its history, and the epic scope of the story in which everyone is willing to risk themselves for the good of the world.The story picks up some 60 years after THE HOBBIT, enjoying the same conspiratorial tone of narration as that of its predecessor. In the Shire, home of the diminutive, man-like race called Hobbits, we meet young Frodo, new owner of the Ring of Invisibility. The comforts of his rustic homeland become all the more dear to Frodo when he learns that his ring is the One Ring of Power, possessed of endless evil from its maker, the evil Sauron. Informed that Sauron is searching for the Ring --- the only thing standing between him and world domination --- and that the Ring will ultimately corrupt any one who owns it, Frodo undertakes a mission to travel across Middle-Earth to destroy the Ring in Sauron's own stronghold. Accompanied by three Hobbit friends --- Sam, Merry, and Pippin --- Gandalf the Wizard, and four others appointed as representatives of the free races of Middle-Earth, Frodo ventures beyond the world that he knows into the wild of the larger world and places fraught with peril. Each of the so-called &quot;Nine Walkers&quot; has a critical role to play in the course of events, both in the destruction of the Ring and in the coordination of the war against Sauron's forces.Frodo himself is very much the Everyman with whom readers will identify so well. In his fear, indecision, and courage, the little hobbit represents anyone who reaches a point in life when they have to make irrevocable choices without certainty of the results. Faced with the choice to do nothing and risk harm to everyone he knows or to venture into the unknown alone, against his greatest fear, Frodo chooses --- time and again --- to do the right thing. &quot;I feel that as long as the Shire lies behind, safe and comfortable, I shall find wandering more bearable...&quot; Accompanying Frodo to the bitter end is his gardener, Sam Gamgee, a character possessed of an astounding level of loyalty to his employer. In Sam Gamgee, Tolkien crafted the true friend who stays with us through thick and thin and who would give us the shirt off his back without being asked. Sam remains overtly overprotective of Frodo from beginning to end, refusing to be left behind even for his own good and even forgoing food and water for Frodo's benefit. The choices that Sam is forced to make provide some of the book's most heartbreaking moments. The other hobbits, Merry and Pippin, display a range of irksome silliness and denial until pressed to hard choices, and both prove themselves worthy players on the stage of world affairs.Through the character of Strider (Aragorn), a seasoned warrior wise beyond belief, Tolkien is able to interweave elements of mystery, bittersweet romance, unrequited love, predestination, and ultimate sacrifice. While every character is willing to expend themselves in the efforts to stop Sauron, Strider is the first after Gandalf to join the quest with a full understanding of the consequences of failure (&quot;...if by life or death I can save you, I will&quot;). The introduction of Strider also introduces us to the diversity of Middle-Earth through the many names by which the various races (Elves, Dwarves, nations of Men, Orcs) call him. Throughout most of the novel languages are interchanged, giving people, objects, and places a variety of names. In this way THE LORD OF THE RINGS realizes the gravity of the situation, that a vast group of divided nations are putting aside their differences to face a common enemy who threatens the entire world. This idea is also affirmed in the unconventional friendship that develops between Gimli the Dwarf and Legolas the Elf, whose races have a history of enmity dating back centuries.Tolkien worked on this novel over the course of 13 years, a fact that becomes clear in the narrative tone that moves from conspiratorial to grimly melodramatic as the story moves towards its climax and the heroes' respective situations become dire (&quot;So they were come to the bitter end&quot;). The extent to which the author labored over this work is also apparent in the complete realizations he painted of each character and each race. The inherent qualities of the various species are thoroughly described in terms of the physical, spiritual, aesthetic, lingual, and intellectual. The speech and actions of each reinforces the images of &quot;stupid Hobbits,&quot; &quot;foul Orcs,&quot; &quot;fair Elves,&quot; and &quot;hardy Dwarves.&quot;A lot of attention is also paid to the terrain of Middle-Earth as the travelers move from the lush, green comfort of the Shire to rough mountain passes and wastelands created by industrial processes. Whether the characters experience comfort or suffering in the wilderness, the reader feels the situation fully. The greatest evidence of Tolkien's extensive mythology-building is the 103 pages of appendices to which the text frequently refers. It is hard to say whether readers should refer to these whenever prompted or simply read the book straight through and then read the appendices. Either way, the appendices (which chronicle everything before and after this story, complete with maps, charts, and alphabets) is a stunning testament to the author's vision.--- Reviewed by Sofrina Hinton"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This Legendary book that includes Hobbits, and huge trolls is a magnificent book for all ages. My name is Steven Johnson and I read this great book and it took my mom a lot of pulling to get me away from the lord of the rings. I know own all of the movies, that is how good this book is. J.R.R Tolkien is a great author and I recomend it to any person.In Ancient times the ring of power was crafted by the elve-smiths. and saron, the great dark lord, forged the one ring, filling it with his own powers so that he could rule all others. But the one ring was taken from him, He hunted for it throughout Middle-Earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages, it fell by chance into the hands of Mr. Bilbo Baggans. From his fastness in the tower of Mordor, Sarons power grew far and wide. He gathered all the great rings, but always he searched for the one ring that would complete his Domaine.On Bilbo's eleventh birthday, he disapeared, giving everthing to his young cousin, Frodo, the ruling ring an the pearl chest; to journey across Middle-Earth, deep into the powers of the dark lord, and distroying the ring in the crackes of mount Doom. Gandalf the Wizzard, The hobbits Mary, Pippen, and sam; Gimly the dwarf; Legolas the elf; Boromir of Gondor; and a tall mesterous stranger called strider are the main characters in The Lord Of The Rings.I think this is an Extraordinary work, and really exiting book and I recomend it to everyone. This book original copy was copywritten in 1937 but its new copy is just as good. The Lord Of The Rings has a mix of exsitment, scaryness, and servival so I hope you read this great book at least ounce.- Steven Johnson"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I think Rob Inglis has done a splendid job - the narrative keeps you engrossed and interested. He brings TOlkien's already rich writing to life. Some of the characters are particularly lucky as far as the narration is concerned - particularly i loved Smeagol, Grishnak, Tom Bombadil, and Treebeard.Although I do think that the price that is being charged is a little too steep. Its a better option to get the CDs/tapes from the public library and buy the books instead."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I had heard of LOTR quite a few times over the last ten years or so, but never really thought about reading it, until The Two Towers came out. After seeing the two movies, I was mildly interested, so I read The Hobbit. After having read The Hobbit and then all three (well... six, actually) LOTR books, I was left at a loss for words.The world that is painted in the pages of the books is fascinating - truly, the movies do not do them justice (nor will any, ever, in all likelihood). There are hundreds of pages omitted from the book in the course of the movie, and quite a few plotlines are heavily modified (not always for the better). As great as Peter Jackson's efforts are, comparing the book to the film is like comparing living a life to watching a film. As an example, consider the road from Hobbiton to Bree - largely uneventful in the film, while it comprises a good half of the book, including an encounter with Tom Bombadil (entirely missing from the film) and a brush with Barrow wights, which is where the Hobbits obtain most of their swords (one of which Merry uses to ... well... I'd rather not ruin the _real_ story).It is often said that Tolkien describes things in extreme detail, and I don't disagree with that - he often goes on for a page or two describing history, lands, objects, etc... However, this only goes to show the rigor of Tolkien's efforts - one does not read LOTR so much as experience Middle Earth. Parts of it (history, geography) often appear within the story in various places, only increasing one's curiosity in what exactly happened before the War of the Ring. As for the fact that the songs and snatches are extraneous in the story - that's just silly. They're as big a part of LOTR as pretty much everything else.The third book contains a hefty set of appendices full of history, meanings of words, information on the origins of languages of Middle Earth and its people. In short, the amount of work and effort that has been spent on LOTR is obviously staggering. There are maps that one can follow as the story develops, and illustrations also go to a great extent in providing windows into Middle Earth through the eyes of Alan Lee.Having read the books has left me with a desire to go through appendices, perhaps re-read the book, and more importantly, read The Silmarillion, which describes the Middle Earth before the War of The Ring - history parts of which are described in LOTR in various places.In short, I can't recommend this book enough. I only wish I had read The Lord of the Rings when I was a kid - though perhaps having read it later in life has made me appreciate Tolkien's work all the more."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Sensational. Rob Ingels is a real talent and makes this so entertaining. This classic is one of the true treasures in my library."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"In its favor, this Red Collector's edition has the more updated and corrected text. Despite its original publication in 1974, it is not exactly the same book that was on sale in the 1970's and it is not based on an outdated text version of that year as stated by a previous review. Doug Anderson's \\"Note on the Text\\" is dated Oct. 1986 in the Red Collector's edition that I had seen on sale last year. The 2002 boxed trilogy with Alan Lee illustrations has a more recent statement by Doug Anderson (dated April 2002), however the text itself is not the most up-to-date and doesn't even correspond with the Anderson note!Far more serious, however, is the poor quality of the Red Collector's edition as mentioned by several reviews. Houghton Mifflin should be ashamed of themselves to publish a wonderful classic in such a manner. It looks like they ran it through the office copy machine--not the nice one you always use, but the one that always seems to be jammed or out of toner.Better still is HarperCollins' British deluxe version. It has both the correct text and is nicely printed and bound. It costs considerably more money, but until Houghton Mifflin gets its act together, it may be the best alternative for die hard Tolkien fans."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This will be a short review since I am reviewing the collectors edition and not the contents therein. This is the type of book you place in your book case for show. The book is much too fragile (Clean white onion skin-like pages) and if you wish your investment to increase with age, you treat it like an investment. My copy is 20 some years old and never been read (that's what the paperback box sets are for!), and never will be as long as I own it. It's a great conversational piece and never misses getting some kind of comment when my library is viewed.Le Guepe, Martinsville, IL. U.S.A."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"In a rising tide above the rapidly aging Pottermania comes the sweep of Tolkienmania. In preparation for the three new live-action movies, the famed trilogy is rereleased in a gorgeous new all-in-one volume with movie cover art (tastefully done, it's not just a collage poster or anything)Years before, the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron was discovered in the possession of the creepy Gollum - and came into the &quot;ownership&quot; of Bilbo Baggins, a pleasant hobbit in the middle of an adventure. Now, it is given to his relative Frodo, who soon encounters creatures both mesmerizing and evil in the Shire. Wizard Gandalf has him head off to the elf city of Rivendell, but along the way he is attacked and nearly killed by the sinister Black Riders. It is determined at Rivendell that the One Ring must be destroyed, and that Frodo's the hobbit to do it. With Gandalf, he sets off with a group of companions: the hobbits Sam, Merry and Pippin, men Aragorn and Boromir, elf Legolas, and dwarf Gimli.They travel across the length of Middle Earth, from the beautiful gardenland of Lothlorien to the rotting wasteland of Mordor. Aragorn and the others will attempt to save the city of Minas Tirith from the armies of Sauron. Frodo and Sam will try to take the Ring to Mount Doom, the only place where it can be destroyed. But that will take a terrible price.When this book was first published, Tolkien had no idea that he would jump-start the fantasy genre from an odd little collection of fiction to a major part of the book market and would inspire more ripoffs than any other author in history. Lord of the Rings is a sweeping epic of good and evil. Cliche? It is a cliche now, but it's also that LOTR spawned.What sets it apart is two things: the Judeo-Christian morality and ethics that Tolkien held so dear, and the crafting of Middle-Earth. If one carefully examines the themes of temptation, redemption and punishment, as well as the innate nobility of the heroes. I also advise, to get the full effect of Tolkien's beliefs, that you read the Silmarillion.Middle Earth is perhaps the most intricate fantasy world ever created, with Patricia McKillip's Riddlemaster trilogy's world as a close second. Tolkien crafted not just geology and various species for his world; he also created a religious background, complete with a God and a pantheon of deitilike angelic creatures, individual languages, cultures, and several outlooks that are alien to the other species. Add to this his poetic, strong descriptions, pleasant dialogue, occasional song or poem, and you have a true classic. The classic status is cemented into immortality by the fact that this was the first widely-read fantasy.A recommendation: If you've already read the trilogy, then you may want to read two other intelligent trilogies, &quot;Children of the Star&quot; and &quot;Riddlemaster.&quot; Though they cannot match JRR (who can?) they are two of the best.If you are one of the few people who has never read this trilogy: Put down your Harry Potter and read the story that introduced the world to fantasy."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The cover of this book caught my eyes, and decided to purchase it since about 7 years ago, a very good friend of mine, Dan Platt from New Zealand gave me a hard time for being naive and ignorant about not reading (or at least not giving my time to read) the book. I'm a neuroscientist and if you are in science and research, most of the time you'll be reading journals and books in your field. So I guess, this was my excuse, but not anymore.To cut the long story short, I absolutely loved the book. This book contained all 3 volumes (The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King). The book contains a Prologue to introduce the reader to the nature and essence of the main characters, as well as an Appendix and Index, to guide the reader and provide further historical background and information about the story. The book has over 1000 pages and includes maps and illustrations. It's good value and well spent in my opinion.JRR Tolkien has written a Masterpiece. Words are not enough to describe how great this book is. Once you started reading it, you just can't stop it. The story is riveting, with your imagination always pushed to the limit. The book contains facets of life imaginable, from friendship to foe, adventures to misadventures, tribulations to triumphs, good and evil, and so on. The story itself also focused on diversity and showed a great deal of humanity in each of the characters involved. It is highly recommended reading not only for teens and young adults, but to grown ups like myself. I'm very much looking forward to seeing the 3-series movie by my compatriot, Peter Jackson. From what I've seen about the screen adaptation so far, this film is gonna be huge!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I don't think it's possible to say enough about &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot; I've lost track of the number of times I've read it, and yet during my latest reading I still learned new things. J. R. R. Tolkien created a world of such intricacy that there are layers of depth hinted at throughout the book. These can be read casually without detracting from the beauty of the story, but a closer understanding of the majesty behind Tolkien's First Age allusions makes for a far greater appreciation and enjoyment of the world created. Unfortunately for many, the understanding of these allusions must come from reading &quot;The Silmarillion,&quot; a task that many seem to find too daunting to attempt. The one thing that Tolkien has understood better than any other writer I've encountered, and this shines through in LOTR, is that there are no happy stories as long as time continues to flow. Even though LOTR ends in a victory for good over evil, time continues to pass and people continue to get old and old wounds continue to ache painfully. This is especially apparent if you read the end of the saga of Aragorn and Arwen in Appendix A. The sadness in this tale rends one's heart, even more so than does the final scene with Frodo and Samwise. But as Gandalf says, &quot;Not all tears are bitter,&quot; and the sorrow is a sorrow that even in passing great things were accomplished and great evils were averted. The rest of LOTR is however a story of the majesty of Aragorn and the wisdom and power of Gandalf and the sheer incorruptibility and stalwartness of Frodo and Samwise. Tolkien reveals himself as an extremely wise and merciful man with his handling of Frodo Baggins and Smeagol. It is here that Tolkien shows that although Gollum is a wretched creature, to execute him out of hand is an act of equal wretchedness. Proponents of Samwise Gamgee would do well to look at Sam's treatment of Gollum in book two in comparison to Frodo at the same time. Sam actually comes off very badly. It is only in the third book, especially after Sam eventually shows himself to be merciful towards Gollum, that Sam becomes the heroic figure that readers look back at with such fondness (although his battle with Shelob in book two is one for the ages). Anyway, this is a book that can be read over and over with new experiences every time. In fact, it was only on my latest reading that I realised just how active a role is played by the Lords of the West throughout the War of the Ring. Of course, without reading &quot;The Silmarillion,&quot; that nuance would have continued to escape me. I highly recommend that readers read &quot;the Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; and then read &quot;The Silmarillion,&quot; and then come back and read LOTR again. I also think that once you've read &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; you will be hooked, and you'll be ready for &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot; and &quot;The Book of Lost Tales&quot; (both parts) and &quot;The Lays of Beleriand.&quot; As beautiful as is LOTR, it pales besides the epic tragedies of the First Age."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Like most, I read this trilogy when I was 13 or 14. It floored me. I actaully wept when it was done because I already knew ther would be no more adventures for Frodo and Samwise. I read a lot of fantasy aftwards, but eventually I gave up because every one seemed to copy LOTR in some way or another (some were overt copies like the Sword Of Shannara series, while some were slight variations like the Thomas Convenant series by Donaldson).I am re-reading this edition because it claims to be slightly more complete than previous ones. This means that some of the 'corrections' contained in the editions from the 60's and 70's have been put back the way the author intended. So far it has lived up to its hype and I am enjoying every minute of it.If you have never read this series and you consider yourself a fan of fantasy or sci-fi (all the famous 'Space Opera' stories are loosely based on the same story arc), then you MUST read it. If you've only read it once or twice, read it again and remember what it was to enjoy an 'epic fantasy' for the first time."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"There is no question in my mind that this series of books has defined multiple generations. It was written in the 1940s and has world war connotations and re-discovered in the 1960s and was seen as a form of escapist nirvana. But it is even more than that. Tolkien was an Oxford professor and made new languages and races from mythology come alive. He also has used the idea of a religious quest real as the King Arthyr books. The current on-line role-playing games and the dungeons and dragon game owe all to Tolkien. The current great fantasy writers like R.Jordan and Tad Williams and G.R.R. Martin all are steeped in Tolkien-esque lore. Thankfully so. My first reading of it I will remember to my dying day. Re-readings have only proved to me he was our Hemingway, our literary grandfather. If you follow current SF/and F you have seen J.R.R. Tolkien's prestige rise. More and future generations will the oppotunity to see for themselves the glory in these books."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Tolkien series is destined to remain an all-time classic.

He takes a genre once associated only with acne-faced teenage boys and elevates it to literary excellence. His selection as Writer of the Century was well-deserved to say the least.Written mostly during Europe's WWII years, the symbolism of that war lies heavily in his novels (See especially &quot;The Scouring of the Shire&quot; chapter in Vol. 3 &quot;The Return of the King&quot;)His epic story has a background color and richness that rarely exists in today's literary works. He built his own languages from the syllables on up, his appendices and notes lend depth and history to his works, he is truly the only fantasy write to literally create a world. Every sentence that spills from the mouths of his characters hints at a world that we are only scratching the surface of.The poetry and lore that his characters express hint at the many volumes that Tolkien could have written if time would have allowed it. Rarely have I seen a fantasy writer who could put such a large amount of high quality verse and rhyme into their works.Almost every fantasy author of the last 30 years must tip their hat in Tolkien's direction. I have yet to find a noteable fantasy author who didn't mention Tolkien in their list of inspiring/influencing authors.I can only hope that on the eve of the long awaited Lord of the Rings movies that would-be Tolkien Cinema fans take the time to read the epic fantasy saga that made the movies possible."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Probably the most profound piece of fantasy literature written in the 20th century, J.R.R Tolkien's masterpiece is the foundation of modern fantasy writing.

I can still remember the thrill of fear and physically flinching when the Nazgul fly over Minas Tirith.

Of course, in order to understand The Lord Of The Rings, you have to read The Hobbit, which is good in its own right, but The Hobbit is just the prelude to one of the greatest triology ever written.What comes second?

I do wince when reading some of the earlier reviews that get a bit, ah, exuberant in their praise, and I suspect Tolkien would have been embarrassed and frustrated by many of them, as he was by the over-the-top fans who kept showing up at his door.That said, Tolkien did indeed write one of the great works of English literature, one that will be studied by experts and cherished by the masses for centuries to come, long after the popular names that fill the &quot;Fantasy&quot; shelves fade into forgetfulness. This is not to denigrate them; many are outstanding writers creating excellent fiction. But Tolkien pulled off the hat trick of (1) getting there first, (2) preemptively staking out vast amounts of the territory, and (3) writing one hell of an epic. Those who have come after have the unenviable task of building skyscapers next to a mountain. Were I to ever attempt fiction, I would steer clear of Tolkien's domain--but I'd go back and re-read him (for the 16th time) to see how it's done right. ..bruce.."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"That's not only a novel.If you read it you find a life which was has Frodo,Gandalf,Aragorn...Take your lifes in it.Save the Ring forever."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The work of Tolkien presuades us to take a trip with him into a time totally different yet eirely similar. A place were noblity and justice is endowed to the kings and leaders, a place were even totally different people can join together. Tolkien creates an exciting host of characters including some unlikely heros, such as the hobbits and Aragon, with many races of Elves, Hobbits, Dwarves, and Ents we can finally see were man fits in. I must admit I would indeed like a shoot at middle-earth. A book which too few have read but all that do praise, this is the book in which a large imagination is not required, for Tolkien paints a beautiful picture indeed. Remember: Not that is gold Glitters."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"But perhaps I'm missing something. Perhaps my little brain is too demanding of logic and order. If I come to a description of a waterfall, the water must fall in no other direction but down. I feel I'm missing something for a good reason. From the documentary on Tolkien, I sensed that he was an extraordinary man. Extraordinary in that he had a true grasp of that melodic beauty of England ... how it's people and landscape had co-existed for so long. This is the &quot;melody&quot; that plays in the background of his many stories. I feel that they memorialize the England that's now almost dead.It made sense when I heard that one could sense an undertone of sadness in the usually jovial and happy Tolkien. One of the reasons for his melancholy, apparently, was the slow but sure destruction of the English countryside--part of the fading away of that Melody of England.Perhaps those of us who didn't find beauty in Tolkien need to live a little longer."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have read all the bad reviews, and I must agree that the book is not your basic fantasy novel. There is far between the battles, and it is very cinematic in its writting. But even so it's exceptionally gripping and beats all other books of the genre by miles. I have read 50 or 60 fantasy novels before this one and had heard a great deal about it. An even so what I had heard could not even compare to the gripping tale which is enclosed within those pages. When people say it probably was phenomenal in its day I totally disagree with them. This book is one in a trillion.

I first read it (after reading 'The Hobbit') about 20 years ago, and have read it eight or so times since then. Every autumn I have the urge to pick it up; like in the famous Led Zeppelin song, I can hear it calling me... This is not a book that you just read. You step out your front door, and the adventure carries you away to places that become a part of you forever. But it's not a fairy tale, in which the characters all live happily ever after, or a dungeons and dragons fantasy with little depth or imagination. This a story, in the most magnificent and perfect sense of the word, that moves you in a fundamental way and changes your expectations of what a story should be. And that's unfortunate, because like the characters in The Lord of the Rings who learn that you can never really go back home, you will learn that you can never find a story like this one again. But you can read it again, and if you're like me you will dare to step out your front door many more times, and follow the roads where they may take you."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is the best fantasy book I have ever read.

The original and \\"still champeen\\" of the bunch. And while I love The Wheel of Time and The Dark Tower and many of the others that were sprouted out of this - none of them quite capture the magic and majesty that is The Lord of the Rings. From the Birthday Party - to the flight through the forest from the dark riders and Old Tom Bombadil - Bree and Strider and Weathertop... Rivendale and Moria ...Lothlorien and Minas Tirith - Fangorn and Rohan ... the march of the Ents and the journey through the paths of The Dead ... Gollum and Oliphants and Shelob's Lair ... the battles of Helm's Deep - and Gondor - and the Last Stand at the Black Gate... the journey under the Eye to The Mountain of Doom - - - In a cast of characters that included the strongest and wisest and most prophetically and magically powerful ever written into popular fiction - those who end it most praised by the mighty of Middle Earth are the \\"little folk\\". The halflings - The Hobbits - who want nothing more than to be left alone in their idealistic Shire. To live and let live - but who are never-failing in rising to every challenge that comes before them. And that - of course - is why this is the alpha and omega of \\"high fantasy\\". It's always fun to read about the wisest and strongest and most powerful triumphing over their evil counterparts... be they dragons or trolls.... or all powerful eyes of fire... but it's even more fun to see the smallest and weakest find the strength and determination to triumph against all odds. That we can relate to - because that we live - daily. Tolkien rightly did not end the books as Jackson ended the movies - things were not immediately set to rights at home when Frodo and company rode back into The Shire - and of all the wondrous scenes and chapters of this tale - the Hobbit's Homecoming is my favorite. We all have our \\"rules and laws\\" and \\"bosses\\" and \\"big men\\" and \\"Sharkey's\\" to deal with - every day. Things are never as ideal at home when we get there as we wish for. But even \\"small\\" people with experience, courage and a sense of justice can accomplish great things. That is the underlying theme of this Great High Fantasy tale.

Lot's of beautiful illustrations, and the appendices really help to provide a fuller picture of the story. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This fiftieth-anniversary edition is fully corrected and has a quite helpful, very extensive new index.Of the many Great Books which are part of the Western Cannon, like Lord of the Rings (LOTR) (as well as The Hobbit, The Silmarillion, and all the rest of Tolkien's many other magnificent works) are like unto far too many other truly profound works of Literary Art of the past: They have been quite deliberately ignored, shunned, loudly ridiculed and sadly under-rated, by the oh-so-snooty Literary and Academic institutional elites of both the USA and Europe.Lord of the Rings is only just now (over slightly more than just the last decade) is being rightly recognized -- world-wide -- as a truly awesome Magnum Opus; among the very highest (If not THE very highest) body of work of English Literature ever written. Furthermore, LOTR by itself is only now seen on par with of the world's greatest and most developed (complex) epic national mythologies. In this case, a body of English myth written by a single genius over the course of but a single lifetime. (Tolkien began writing about Middle-earth in the trenches of WWI France in 1917.) In contrast, LOTR is quite unlike the great epic mythologies of the distant past: great mythic traditions which evolved by the participation of entire peoples over millennia. However, in this one exceptional case, Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and his other mythic works, put together, are indeed the singular work of but one brilliant man's lifetime; he single handedly created something very much on par with the grand mythological (epic) tales of the ancient Western world; in this case quite deliberately for England. Yet, it should be stressed that LOTR was, sadly, rarely seen in this light during Tolkien's lifetime. (C.S. Lewis called it, \\"Lightning out of a blue sky.\\")Almost miraculously, Lord of the Rings and the rest of Tolkien's other writings, have finally become near-universally seen as well deserving quite close academic study and analysis; are among the best sources of creative inspiration across the various Fine Arts, world wide. Moreover, many of the world's top artists and artisans look to LOTR in particular, as a primary source of mythic inspiration; it has likewise spawned a mammoth, multi-billion dollar subdivision of art, literature, music and movie making: the so-called Fantasy genre.Lord of the Rings, now, is held up as worthy of the very highest Academic, Artistic/Musical, Philosophical, and Literary institutions and the brightest individuals here in the USA, Europe, and all around the world: For its awesome, majestic beauty of the texts; its stunning imagery; its brilliant depth of meaning; and the rich myriad of deeply moving, profoundly thought-provoking ideas it holds. Thus, like other Great Works of Literature and epic myth, LOTR is filled with both exhilarating triumphs and disturbingly sorrowful tragedies; its timeless concepts, and truly life-altering wisdom; with all its deeply complicated elements, theme connections, and associations which certainly do not all become apparent upon a single casual reading, nor commonly with even several careful readings thereafter.The Lord of the Rings alone has been translated into over 40 languages: these include French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Danish, Polish, Hebrew, Portuguese, Norwegian, Dutch, Flemish, Turkish, Polynesian, Mongolian, Swedish, Greek, Icelandic, Gaelic, Mandarin & Cantonese Chinese, Hindi, Japanese, Swahili, Armenian, Ukrainian, Danish, Finnish, and Korean, to name but a few. Moreover, every translation has thusfar remained a top best-seller in each of their respective language editions. (It's worth noting that LOTR, like all of Tolkien's works, are banned throughout most Mohammedan lands, just as they were too in Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia; a region which seems a very real Mordor -- a looming evil for well over the last 1,500 years. Likewise, a very orcish Iran also outright bans -- and openly hates -- Tolkien; quite a ringing endorsement.)J.R.R. Tolkien (1892-1973)Beloved throughout the world as the creator of The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, The Silmarillion, and many other works, was a professor of Anglo-Saxon (Old English) at Magdalen College, Oxford; was a fellow of Pembroke College, and a fellow of Merton College until his retirement in 1959. His chief interest was the linguistic aspects of the early English written tradition, but while he studied Great classic works of the past, he was creating a set of his own.MORE TO EXPLORE...After reading LOTR,The Silmarillion, Second Editionand thenThe Children of Hurin, are are both must-reads. Following that, theUnfinished Tales of Numenor and Middle-earth 1st (first) edition Text Onlyis also quite worth reading too ...Lastly, regarding the realm of the Fine Arts, there are a series of breathtaking downloadable MP3's, all by a National Danish classical musical ensemble, various outstanding soloists and a Danish chamber choir, whom are together combined with the amazing voice talents of Sir Christopher Lee; they create an outstanding work of classical-themed music, incorporating the Great English poetry and (previously unscored) song lyrics, from The Lord of the Rings; written of course by J.R.R.Tolkien. The best place to start, is withSelected Songs and Poems from The Lord of the Rings: Leaving RivendellBeyond this, in the realm of Fine Drawings, one need look no further than the monumental work of (now \\"Sir\\") Alan Lee:The Lord of the Rings Sketchbook-- Who's brilliant ideas were used most extensively throughout the excellent, yet slightly flawed,The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Special Extended Edition); by the multiple Academy Award-winning Director, (also now \\"Sir\\") Peter Jackson. (Sir Alan's stunning artistic contributions were also fully partnered with the outstanding artistry and artistic consulting work of Mr. John Howe; who has a truly amazing, encyclopedic knowledge of mediaeval arms, armaments and warfare.)"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is the first time I order a used book and I was very impressed.

I am in an English class that is focusing on Tolkien and his works, and our final project is to write a online review for either the books or the movies. Throughout the semester we read the Hobbit, the Lord of the Rings and watched the movies. I entered the class having only watched the movies. I already loved it from that, and finally reading all the books only made my love for the story grow. There's so much more detail and story in the books that the movie doesn't have. I'm not saying that the movies left anything really important out, but that the books give you a more in-depth look into world of Middle Earth.This is one of the greatest stories ever written. Frodo's journey is very inspiring. A gentle hobbit takes on this impossible quest, going against ruthless monsters, traitors and a terribly, evil creature, named Sauron, with the ability to control the world, all to save his the world from Sauron's evil clutches. Then there is the other story of Aragorn's own struggle from a creepy unknown ranger in a bar to a King trying to prove himself honorable. You don't just read the Lord of the Rings, you experience it. Tolkien's wonderful writing and descriptions transport you to Middle Earth and have you experience each battle and each journey. Tolkien was a genius and put some serious thought into this. He created a whole other world filled with it's own creatures, people, history and problems. The stories make you happy, sad, excited and nervous, and with every page turn you will be wondering what is going to happen next.Each character you meet along the way has their own personality and story that is just as interesting as the next. They each play their own part to the story, and the friendships created are simply amazing. It can be a little tedious to get through at certain points, and the intense descriptions can lose you, but in the end it is worth it. It's very easy to skip over certain parts or put it down for a few months, but fight that urge, and don't skip anything!After reading The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, I can honestly say that this is one of my favorite stories. It will be remembered for hundred and thousands of years to come, or at least it should be. I suggest this book to anyone who can read. It's a great story for all ages."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings trilogy by Tolkien, was an adventure into a world we all can identify with. It's a Journey for adventures sake, with delightful comedy, and danger for those characters involved. The ebb and flow of the struggle between the forces of evil, and those who oppose it, keep you turning the pages. In this review I will share my opinion on the books, as well as the movies.I'm a student at a Californian community college; I'm currently enrolled in an English course that has strictly studied Tolkien's works, and the subsequent movies. As a class assignment I'm to write a review on the books, and movies. In class we read the Hobbit, Lord of the Rings trilogy The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King. In class we also watched the three movies, as well as the Hobbit.The Hobbit was a funny story of a reluctant adventurer named Bilbo Baggins, who joins some dwarves on a journey to reclaim what was once theirs. This delightful book compels you to vividly imagine yourself as a member of their party, as Bilbo gains courage and confidence. This short book reads more like a children's story, yet the theme captures the imagination of all ages.The Fellowship of the Ring takes you on a hopeless journey, as four hobbits venture to take the one ring to safety. The journey seems doomed to fail, yet the will of the two main characters keeps them marching forward. The party grows in numbers, as they become \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\". This entire book is wrought with peril, adventure, friendship, and betrayal. Tolkien's description of the surroundings tends to be a bit tedious, yet he paints a distinct picture of the landscape. Tolkien also go's into the lineage of most of his characters, which also makes the book drag on. Over all, the entire struggle towards their destination is worth the extra time reading about who's related to whom.In the Two Towers we find the fellowship had failed, which splits the party in three. Three stories happen simultaneously, yet all work toward the same goal. Keeping track of each adventure is handled beautifully, as you are never left wondering what's happening with the other characters. More characters enter this book as they start to amass an army to converge for an epic battle. The bonds that are forged between the characters are prevalent in this book, declaring their loyalties to the destruction of evil. The action in this book builds right to the end, and continues onto the next one.The Return of the King is the last book, where we read that not enough forces have come to thwart the army of Sauron. When hope is thought to be lost, news of the Frodo Baggins bolsters their resolve. This final battle is the ultimate battle, with surprises, and devastation. This is the best book of the trilogy, ending with a tragic yet happy ending.The movies themselves don't follow the books to the letter, as with any movie they made some sacrifices. The extended versions are very long, and if they didn't edit out some of the boring parts the movies would have been a failure. The friendships, the sorrow, and the epic battles are even better in the movies. The books have better descriptions, yet that tended to bog down the stories rather than accentuate them. Purist will never embrace the movies as the greatest trilogy ever made, yet most still concede that they like the movies.I recommend that you read the book before any movie, as going backwards will change how you think the character looks. I'll watch the movies over and over again; however I will never want to read the books again. I'm happy I read the books, however they were too tedious to read again."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"All in all the book is in very good shape.

They look great and have very well detailed maps sewn into the spine in the back that fold out. They do not have any illustrations which i had hoped they did but it doesn't detract from the books at all in my opinion.This set is great for new readers of The Lord Of The Ring as well as old and i think it's definitely worth consideration of your purchase."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have been a huge fan of these books ever since my father introduced me to them back when I was 12 years old. For the first couple years since my first read-through I resolved to read them once a year and did so successfully for a while. Obviously life caught up and when I moved out of my parents house I lost access to them for quite some time. This copy of Tolkien's masterpiece book (for it is all one story) is something that will be handed down to my children for them to enjoy, hopefully as much as I still do.As for those that have not read LOTR and are considering giving it a try. If you enjoyed the movies, get ready for a lot more. They say books surpass film and this is no exception. The depth to the world of Middle Earth that Tolkien portrays in these novels is rarely matched and, in my experience, unsurpassed. These are truly works of literary art and will be read and loved by many for many years to come.And to those who have been fans of Middle Earth and are just browsing for their own copy of LOTR: The road goes ever on and on, down from the door where it began. Now far ahead the road has gone, and I will follow if I can.P.S. I apologize if this is a slight mis-quote as I'm trying to do it off of memory."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read.

If you don't recognize the name, he is like the official artist of Middle-earth. He even did the concept art for the films. This is a hardcover set so you know it is a good investment for multiple readings over time. I've read The Lord of the Rings twice and plan to read it again next year before the final film is released. If you are a true fan, upgrade to a better set. This is my set of choice.

I could have simply gone to my local Easons (pretty much *the* only bookstore, of note, in Ireland) and picked up one of the many (and I'm talking millions here) paperback editions of \\"The Hobbit\\" (or The Lord of the Rings, as I bought both leatherette editions), but instead I chose the leatherette edition, and I'm not sorry, not in the least!I'll start by describing the 'externals' (or asthestics) of the book: Let me first say, dont be fooled into believing this is some 'form' of leather that the book is bound in, it is, in fact (or at least appears to be), a form of plastic. Saying this, however, it does not cheapen the book, I'm saying merely to clarify. This 'plastic' is actually made to look 100% like real leather, if only for the feel, you would be fooled into thinking it was leather (leather is less resitant, scratches more easily and is softer under-hand). I personally dont mind, the book is most beautifully crafted with 'simulation' gold gild (more than likely its a gold ink or paint).The pages themselves are of good, rather great -quality, not cheap 'bright-white' 'mass market' pages, but rather a subtle shade of mild yellow, not to mention the pages being almost twice as thick as paperback editions (if not, in fact thicker), which makes for a much more comfortable read. I have only one 'gripe' or 'probleme' with this book, and that is that the text that is printed on the pages seems to be at an angle (rather than being 90deg to the pages edge, the text seems to be off by about 3-5 degrees). This is only a slight annoyance, and I am not totally convinced that it is either an error while printing nor that all copies have the same 'condition'; I personally dont mind too much, but for the 'perfectionistic reader' it can be quite distracting, but to be honest that is the fault of the reader rather than the book's.Finally (and perhaps most importantly?),The book comes with a 'container' wich is, also, bound with 'leatherette', they both complement each other and the cover is a perfect protector against the day to day 'wear n tear' of life.Personally, I cant put the book down. I'm three chapters through and cant find fault in the book. All of this goes for the \\"Lord of the rings - Leatherette edition\\" just as much as for \\"The Hobbit - Leatherette edition\\".This book is a must for all!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The most outstanding cast of characters in a book. I have had to read it at least 6 times. The plot and counter plots are so involved that once reading is not enough.The settings are so well described that you can actually see them in your minds eye. All in all a terrific stimulation to the brain."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I think it is worth buying. Your personal preference will affect how you like this version as opposed to the newer one done by the BBC. This is the first rendition I ever heard of the Lord of the Rings. I own both copies and I don't regret owning either one because each Version is good for different reasons.The voices are different in this version. BBC sounded more like grown men. The voices sounded more elfish in this version. I think that it reminded me of the Ralph Bashki version of the Hobbit. I did feel that this was more concise and less was edited out. Gollum seemed less psycho and scary in this version. There was less music in this version and less of a romantic sideline. I liked that it didn't edit out the part of Tom Bombadil; as BBC's version did. I felt like more was cut out on the BBC version even though it was four cds longer. It was disappointing.I know that one person found this edition hard to follow. I find all the audio I listen to has to be listened to repeatedly to understand the plot. I will admit that this is the kind of story that one has to listen to to understand all that was going on. With repeated listenings; one hears new things or notices new things. I actually found the narration and actors voices sounded clearer in this version than the later one."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"There are no words to describe how good this is. I am in no way actually a fantasy story fan. In fact, by and large, I don't care for that genre (but that's just me), but this by far is the best thing I have ever read. The movie is what inspired me to buy the book. I now own the movie and this book (which contains the trilogy), and it's unreal how good this story is, for all ages. Don't deprive yourself the experience of a lifetime, read the Lord of the Rings trilogy."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"&quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; had made a breakthrough, it was the first in a long line of Fantasy books. When you come to read this book, you can't ignore its reputation as &quot;The Best Fantasy Book&quot;. However, I disagree. The idea is great, but the book is too long and have many exhausting parts, it is not a fun and floating reading, and I often found myself forcing me to keep on reading, just because of the Reputation. It's a must in every bookshelf, but i'm affraid that it'll stay unmoved on my private bookshelf. It is the first, and for that it disorves its honor, but it is surely not the best."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"It's amazing how J. R. R. Tolkien can take a tiny little idea and make it into what is considered one of the greatest books of all time. The whole story starts out with Bilbo Baggins(character from \\"The Hobbit, also a really great book) having a birthday/farewell party. He gives his magical ring to his heir Frodo. Gandalf (also from the Hobbit), the wise wizard, suspects that in fact Bilbo's Ring is the One Ring (hence, the title). The following verse is from the book:\\"Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,One for the Dark Lord on his Dark ThroneIn the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.One Ring to Rule them All,One Ring to find them,One Ring to Bring them all and in the Darkness Bind themIn the Land of Mordor where the Shadows Lie.\\"And so the great journey begins. I hope you buy this book and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. The characters and the plot are wonderful and I hope to see the new movie soon.

I hope this review was helpful to you."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"When I bought this novel and knew I had to read old English, I was somehow dissapointed.

Those who resist...well, they would've probably called Homer's work &quot;unrealistic garbage&quot; back in the eight century B.C., so why let the small-minded bother us now? Utul&iacute;e'n Aur!

Much of the negative criticism has lifted up other fantasy writers such as Terry Brooks and Robert Jordan above the works of Tolkien. What they fail to realize is that Brooks and Jordan would be the first people to admit that their work would never have existed in the form it is in without Tolkein. He was a pioneer.I have read all of Jordan's books (so far) and some of Brooks' and they are very good and have kept me up until all hours of the night, but Tolkein's work is truly rich and will make you a better person for reading it. It enhances your worldview, your imagination, your creativity, your wit, and your appreciation for the written word. I cannot say that for other fiction books. When I was younger I read the books in a hurry, and loved them, but now I realize reading them in one week causes me to miss out on so much of their beauty.Just remember, these books were written decades ago. It is not the &quot;same old story&quot;. It is &quot;the story&quot;. Almost all other fantasy builds from Tolkein. It is a masterpiece. Enjoy it!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"In truth, almost everyone in the world has read the Lord of the Rings. It's the true classic that all science fiction is compared to again and again. I believe that Tolkien is still the master of creating true fantasy worlds, with the governments, cultures, and people (elves, dwarfs, humans, and hobbits, etc) to fill them. Although I have read other books, this still remains as my first glimps of fantasy relms, and one of my favorites."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"It's hard to write a serious review when you can't think of anything even remotely negative to say about the book or whatever it is that you're reviewing.

I adored them as an adolescent and in my twenties. Always fascinated by fairy tales, mythology, and the Arthurian stories of White and others, Tolkien's tales remained the ultimate in combining these genres with exquisite writing that surpasses the years. Both my husband and I have owned a variety of paperbacks of the books, but when the movie was made and I saw this edition, I decided to splurge and get it. I went and saw the first and second movies without prereading again, and for a deaf person, seeing a film in the theater is something we rarely do, but I did to get the majesty of the film and the story. AFter the recent release of the second part of the film, I finally opened this edition, and started reading.The story has not faded with time, if anything it still remains the ultimate fictional story of good against evil. This edition is absolutely breathtaking. The map alone is worth opening again and again to understand the major work Tolkien did in writing this epic. He created an entire world that breathes, he created languages and poetry to go with this world, and characters that feel as real as our often long distant families.Every child, every adolescent deserves to be able to read these books, and become familiar with the English language as it adorns these books. For those enamored of the trilogy and movie, this is the ultimate gift. The book is complete with drawings and runes of elves. An incredibly brilliant lifetime achievement of one man's imagination, that continually feeds our own imaginations.Karen Sadler,Science Education,University of Pittsburgh"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"it's just the greatest imagination book i've ever read... that's fantastic, fabulous &amp; amazing... just read it... offer it to your closest friends, to your kids... that's the book .. a must have ...;"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"a wonderful book. it can't get any better."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"No book on the face of this earth is even worthy of comparison to the greatist litterary work of this century, &quot;The Loard Of The Rings&quot;."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Well, the lord of the rings was FANTASTIC! However, at the beginning i wasn't sure if i would like it as it was soooo SCARY!!!!I remember a part where the dark riders where near, i was scared stiff! So when one of them snuck up, as everyone in th cinema gasped, i screamed so loudly!!! it was actually really funny!But also, aswell as being scared stiff, i also felt, two other emotions, these were, happiness, and sadness (you just had to shed a tear with the thing that happened to gandalf). I also thought Frodo, and the rest of the hobbits were so absolutely adorable!!!!However i'm not sure what happened in my movie theatre cos there where these yellow lights at the bottom of the screen, which we soon found out they were translations, of that other language they used, so i am wondering, did i miss half the plot because of this??? But with or without it, i greatl enjoyed the movie, and just can't stand waiting next year to see the next one, so i guess i'm gonna have to go out and by myself the trilogy.Congratulations to the crew of this movie, you did a fantastic job!Waiting for part 2 with highest of expectations,Dominique!!!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I just thought that this trilogy overly comsumed by words. it was a novel that could have been about three-hundred pages shorter in retrospect. I finished the book, out of determation and interest in it, but found that At times I didn't think I'd ever get through it... the movies were the big thing that made interested me enough to finally reading it. Outside of four years of three of my best friends Raving almost daily, over their love of this book. Although I do get into Fanasy, I just like more the ainti-hero Novels more.

I Recomend this book to every person."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Lord of the Rings is an awesome book. Read it this past Christmas and took it just about wherever I went. It is the story of a hobbit or halfling (Which is a being that is about half the size of a man) named Frodo. Frodo's Uncle Bilbo found a ring on one of his adventures and passed the ring down to Frodo. Then Frodo is visited by one of his close friends, Gandalf, the wizard, who warns him of the danger he is in and the evil beings that are pursuing the ring. So Gandalf sends Frodo to the magnificent city of Rivendell, which is where the council will decide who will destroy the ring, but on his way to Rivendell he is attacked by the nine dark riders, ancient men corrupted by evel. Suddenly Legolas the elf appears out of the woods atop his spectacular, white horse, one of the fastest horses in the land. He then jumps upon Legolas's horse and together they outrun the black riders and head toward Rivendell. When they get to Rivendell they feast and and then they attend the council meeting of the four races of good: Dwarves, elves, hobbits, and men. The council decides to send nine riders of good to travel to Mount Doom to destroy the ring. The party of nine, also called the fellowship of the ring consist of: Frodo and his three hobbit friends, Sam, Pippin And Merry, Legolas the elf, Gimli the dwarf, Gandalf the wizard, a man named Boromir, Prince of the watchtower, and a man named Aragorn son of Arathorn heir to the throne of Gondor. The party travels across living forests, treacherous mountains, dead marshes, barren wastelands, and even haunted mountain passes.If you are looking for an adventure, then this book is the one you want. I could not put it down for three weeks. Some parts will make you laugh and other parts will make you sad. Some parts will make you feel good or proud because the good guys start to win, and then make you mad because the evil comes back again. This is definitely an extraoridinary boook with a powerful ending. It is a book for all ages."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"It is hard to not love the material itself...i'd probably like it if it was printed on toilet paper, but just a couple of comments.1. This book is heavy. If you are a person who reads in bed, get some padding to put between the book and your chest.2. I like a lot of the Lee art, but found myself wishing for some of the Howe art as well. Might have been interesting to choose best versions from the many good artists doing Tolkien art.3. Other than the weight, this is a handy version to have. I have mowed through several paperback sets during my many, many, many readings of the material. This version seems much sturdier than any of my sets."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"As a lover of J.R.R tolkien for as long as I can remember, I need to stress to EVERYBODY who has not read the story to PLEASE read the story BEFORE you watch the movie. You need to create the pictures of the story in your head or else you won't see anything except for the movie scenes. The Lord of the Rings has so many hidden meanings in it that it is better to see it from your point of view and not Peter Jackson's.Anyway, this hardcover copy is the most well-crafted version that I have ever seen. Not only does it have all three books in one it also has an extensive array of information in the back of the book including; the correct pronouciation of Middle-Earth's language, a timeline of all the events of the third age, some of the main characters' bio that is not mentioned in the book, and a lot more.Yes, this is an extremely expensive book and to tell you the truth I do not own it, (yet). If you don't have a money tree in your backyard, or your name is not Donald Trump, by all means, buy a lesser-expensive copy. To all of you that love good craftsman ship, (or a teenager, like me, that still hasen't put &quot;save&quot; and &quot;money&quot; in the same sentence yet,) buy this copy."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"J.R.R.

Tolkien's exciting descriptive writing is wonderful. PLEASE READ THEM!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Let's see. How many times have I read this book? Enough to cause the edges to fray and the binding to bend in unnatural ways, that's for sure. And why would someone, anyone, want to read a book over and over again? It's hard to put into words, but I'll try:This is probably the ultimate fantasy novel in literary history. It is equally fun, entertaining and learned for the reader. Since Master Tolkien wrote this book over fifty years ago, it just goes to show us that some stories were meant to last forever. This is one of those.The story is the continuation of 'The Hobbit' --- the story of Mr. Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo has adopted his nephew, Frodo, and gives him all his worldly possessions...including The One Ring, The Ruling Ring. It is this Ring, in the possession of Frodo the Ring Bearer, that causes the ultimate downfall of Middle Earth. It is evil and was forged by Sauron on Mount Doom in the cracks of fire. It is the One Ring that rules all the other magical rings of Middle Earth, and if Sauron gets it, darkness will envelop all. So it must be destroyed, and Frodo is given the task of taking it to Mount Doom (where it was forged) and throwing it into the Fire, thus diminishing all the other Rings of Power, but saving Middle Earth from eternal darkness.The battles are daring and brave as are the characters: Boromir, Aragon, Samwise, Pippin, Merry, Gandalf (Mithrandeer), Treebeard, and many, many others. Of course, we also can't forget Gollum (also known as Smeagol). He is the unwitting player in the book that serves a purpose that he cannot and could not comprehend. Nor could Frodo...till the end. And how does it end? You'll have to read it. And maybe re-read it. And then maybe re-read it again. Because this is a hypnotic story with an excellent writing style.Also, if you plan to take your kids to see the new &quot;Lord of The Rings&quot; movie this December, you might want to have them read 'The Hobbit' beforehand so that they can completely comprehend where the story came from. And they'll love you for it later. I guarantee it!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Lord of the Rings trilogy changed my life. Its as simple as that. Everyone should read this book, and you will be changed by the reading of it. It is the most amazing work of fiction ever attempted by mortal man. So, what makes me rave so much about this book? To start with it is incredibly well written, (and even that is an understatement) it is so moving - I have never experienced such a wide range of emotions simply by just reading a book! Yes, you'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll come away will a whole new outlook on life. Basically the main character,Frodo, who is one of those stupid, absurb and lovable creatures called hobbits, discovers that he posseses the most powerful object in the whole of Middle Earth, a seemingly innocent gold ring. Everyone from the Dark Lord down is searching for the ring while Middle Earth is ravaged by war and evil. Frodo undertakes his quest to destroy the ring and what follows is a story of battles,the struggle for freedom, fading ages - but mostly of how one person can make a difference and change the world.

Although sometimes the letters are thicker than the other font, one can read it perfectly fine. To say this book is worthless because of the rare blot of a letter is just plain idiotic. This is the greatest book ever written, and this version seems to give more of a wholesome feeling while reading it. It is referred in the novel that the final story of the War of the Rings was written in a red book, and so this print was brought forth. It is amazing the sense of despair and feelings of character emotions that flow through anybody who reads this. The places and people have an awkward effect on anybody who reads it. Especially in this print! I think it has made me crazy."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This was sooo cool.

I read them first about twenty years ago and have returned to them three times since. Certain other epic works (Frank Herbert's Dune trilogy comes to mind) have rated revisiting, but the appeal of Tolkien's masterwork is as strong on the fourth read as it was on the first. You will be swept into a world of such richness and detail that you will literally lose yourself. The evils you will face will chill your soul to its depths and cause you to lie awake at night. The aching beauty and nobility of the words and deeds you will find in Middle Earth could bring tears from granite. When Strider announces to Frodo and Company that he is &quot;Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and if by life or death I can save you, I will&quot;, you would have to be dead and cold to not be moved.No review can do justice to what J.R.R.

There is simply no equal in all of literature."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The main story (i.e. the 3 books) is about 1000 pages long. The remainder of the book is a collection of appendices. It includes some maps, family trees, description of the language used, references to time and events of Middle Earth around the period The Lord of the Rings was written in. While I found most of them not very useful, there are some sections in the Appendices which are interesting. The most poignant part of the book I actually found in the appendix. It's the story between Aragorn and Erwyn. It talks about how they met and what their love for one another made them do. Don't miss that part.This is by far the best &quot;unabridged&quot; version of the books I've read. It also comes in one book, not a boxed set like most other versions of this book.I think the movie released by New Line Cinemas with the same title does the book justice. A little trivia about the movie: 1) The whole film was shot in a continuous 2 year period in New Zealand. 2) The Tolkien family does not support the cinematization of this book. 3) Vigo Mortenson does most of his own stunts in the film.

Anyone who hasn't read it yet should read it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I picked up The Lord of the Rings in anticipation of the films and never had any expectation of being completely swept away by them. I've never read fantasy, I've never seen the cartoon versions of the story, and I've never given much attention to all the hooplah, but now I completely understand why this trilogy has earned the title &quot;best of the 20th century.&quot;Frodo Baggins is the most unlikely of heroes. He's content to relax among the flowers and trees of the Shire and live a quiet life among friends. Luckily, for the sake of Middle-Earth, he agrees to a perilous journey to destroy the One Ring, which if not destroyed, could shatter the lives of everyone in Middle-Earth forever.Adventure, danger, madness, war, redemption, and self-sacrifice are just a few of the stages that Frodo and his Fellowship will undergo throughout their epic journey. This is more than a story...it is representative of all our lives and all our struggles. There are endless lessons in this timeless tale, and it is worth every word on every page. Most important of all, The Lord of the Rings reminds us that &quot;even the smallest person can change the course of the future.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Wow is the word! Please do not read the review by Spokane! This person obviously has no class and knows nothing of Middle-earth. Those of you who do know true magick know that Tolkien is the author of our time and apart from the bible possibly the best books ever written. To finally make a movie that really portrays the true Tolkien we salute and praise you, James!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"You are comparing the work of the father of fantasy, that most all the fantasy books, role-playing games, etc today took the essence from to become what they are today. You say that you are compelled to burn it because you think it is boring and a sad example of work, without knowing anything about it. Tolkien was a world expert on languages, and his work was not written to create a fantasy story, but to create a world that he could practice and put to use his knowledge &amp; creativity with the written word. If you read the book for its text, putting aside the story it is not a couple of misspellings, but more a technique or form, also if you had read about how he had his books published, the editors were his bane not the other way around. Not to mention that before Tolkien's work the way we see elves, dwarves, hobbits (halflings), orc and goblins did not exist, they were fairy tails that did not give nearly the depth that these have today in book or role-playing games. In fact, D&amp;D borrowed most of all the concepts directly from Tolkien in those respects. So what if his writing is slow, so what if he makes those who are not heroes to be heroes, his books should be considered the greatest of all fantasy because of the influence that it had on all contemporary works."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The definitive fantasy novel of the 20th century upon which all else will be compared. One of the most imaginative works in the english language of the 20th century. This book gets better and better with every reading.

I can't imagine wanting to read a book more than this one."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"JRR Tolkien has a great sense of imagination and a great way of giving you that mystical feeling. My Mom bought me the books and I sat down and read a few chapters and I felt like I was right there with Frodo, Bilbo, Pippen, etc. These books also have a lot of adventure. They're great books for a gift and for yourself."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I disagree with what CeP said. It's almost blasphmy.

Read it!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This book and the Hobbit were the first fantasy books that I had ever read, and sence then I've read a lot more.

Almost 22 years later,I have just about all of the Middle Earth books and absolutely love re-reading them over and over again. I always find something new each time!

Thank you Beren, we miss you!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is the best book that I have ever read. After reading it I was introduced into a whole new world of fantasy. I especially liked the freedom Tolkien grants your imagination in the novel. I have read the Trilogy over 5 times and I still can't find a fantasy book as good as this."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"If you have any taste at all for fiction than you should place this beautiful one-volume edition next to your copy of The Arden Shakespeare(one volume collection of plays, etc.)...then take it off of the shelf and read it on new year's eve. I agree with another reviewer, this is one of the great literary works of the 20th Century. From Tolkien's forward to the fascinating appendices, this book is a rich reading experience. An adventure that mystifies and excites and is very moving...a defining moment in the fantasy genre timeline. Tolkien proves that he will be forever known as one of greatest storytellers of our time. I found the the chapter The Shadow of the Past,to be incredibly moving-my personal favorite. This is because it cleverly evokes the history of middle-earth in wonderfully swift literary strokes, defining the nature of the book. It contains the classic poem which tells the epic history of the one ring. Well, you must buy this copy. I did...feels great to only have to refer to one volume, with beautiful illustrations and text."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"There can be no finer gift you could give your loved ones for the holiday: a terrific, ripping-good read that also happens to be a classic.Here's why: This is a book that proves timeless in its themes, prose, and power. Indeed, the universally recognized construct of good vs. evil has been the crown jewel of all stories since Genesis. Humanity itself is reflected in this dynamic, and the drama unfolds in Tolkien's pages with a grace and fury uncommon to the genre. His tale of the diminutive, peaceful Hobbits placed against a frightening array of evil forces and corruption is one that reaches deep, clenching your heart. It is compelling because of its verisimilitude. We all wish for our heroes to be brave but to find valor in such an unexpected place is lyrically pure beyond means. Call it 'fairy tale' or what you will-- LOTR is a literary masterpiece, easily qualified by its keen portrayal of endurance against adversity.But it has many other strengths. Consider that the civilizations, cultures, and history as devised by Tolkien are the product of decades of careful research into Anglo-Saxon and Gaelic myth. They seem real because they are drawn from a felicitous past. Painstaking effort provided the invention of real languages and alphabets for his Elves and Dwarfs. His erudition inspires awe. By great leaps of his imagination, he gave Middle-Earth an authentic backdrop of mythical deities, battles, natural wonders, and poetry. &quot;I've always preferred history to fiction,&quot; Tolkien is quoted as saying. Indeed, he has provided such a rich explication of this past that the narrative takes on a substance unmatched in modern fantasy.This masterful portrait of high romance and adventure stands apart. The Lord of the Rings has been voted &quot;Book of the Century&quot; by Britain's largest reader survey (not once but TWICE). In the 60's &amp; early 70's here in the United States it defined a generation. As C.S. Lewis once said of his friend's work: &quot;Here are beauties which pierce like swords or burn like cold iron.&quot; A more fulfulling, deeply-layered work you could not ask for."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have read this book at least 8 times. There are few books out there that are good enough to go back to time and time again. It is a true classic, designed to delight readers of all ages, sexes and backgrounds. Full of humor, terror, pathos, romance, bravery; the list goes on and on. I never read any other fantasy books, they pale in comparison. Tolkien has created a story with so much depth and intricate details that it seems more like a true tale out of our own ancient history. No one should miss reading this book!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I studied Tokien in college and am still amazed with the depth of his knowledge of philology and mythology. If you are interested in reading background mythologies on which his work was based, I suggest getting your hands on copies of Beowulf, Kalevala, the Prose or Poetic Eddas,and, of course, the Bible. No novels can begin to compare with the works of a man who spent most of his adult life creating an entire mythology for England. Although some of his posthumous works are dense and difficult to read (esp the histories of Middle Earth), I highly enjoyed the experience. If anyone is looking for more titles of his, I suggest the Book of Lost Tales 1 &amp; 2 and The Simarillion (although it begins slow - it becomes more interesting) and any biographies - such insight into character development. In my opinion, Tokien was one of the greatest writers of our time."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This book is a masterpiece! When I was only 12 years of age my Dad got The Hobbit from the library for me to read. I understood all of it (I am a very advanced reader for my age by the way) and loved it. After I finished I bought the book and read it again. Two years later (14) I had recieved the L.O.T.R. series and read it non stop for 2 weeks! This was good also. Everything about this book is enjoyable and is worth your money and time. READERS THAT HAVE READ THIS BOOK AND ENJOYED IT, THERE IS A NEW LORD OF THE RINGS MOVIE TRILOGY COMING TO MOVIE THEATERS IN 2001!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"You'll of course need to have this book. J.R.R. Tolkien has created a masterpiece of literature that, while being in the fantasy genre, encompasses so much more and stretches the boundries. Intrigue, mystery, action, adventure, drama. It's all here. So strap on your travelling cloak and prepare to join Frodo, Sam and Gandalf for a race through Middle-earth in an attempt to thwart the evil Sauron, destroy the One Ring, and return peace to the land.If you want to share a story and perhaps some pipeweed with the hobbits, sing and run through the forests with the elves, delve underneath mountains with the dwarves, and, of course, tag along with the greatest wizard of them all, Gandalf, this is the world waiting for you when you open the cover.Walk through the green grass of the Shire, stare up at a starry sky at Elrond's, climb over the Misty Mountains(don't forget to bring a coat), ride down the River Anduin and visit the lady Galadriel in Lothlorien. Marvel at the horse's ridden by the people of Rohan, visit the grand city of Minas Tirith..ah well, yes..getting a tad carried away here, but you get the idea I'm sure..so..Come on in and live the adventure of a lifetime, you won't be sorry you did....(If the wording in this review sounds familiar to one posted back in November, well it's because it is. I decided to take credit for my own review and revise it a little *grin*)"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Maybe the LOTR should be become a precoursor to the Bible, as it describes the world before men were all powerful and dominant. A story of endless detail which begs to be re-read again and again. An unworthy and almost unwilling group set out to fell the dark powers of a once pure and beautiful land. When reading this masterpiece you become more than a reader of tales, you become part of the epic journey. Take this book from the shelves and be prepared to enter a world of myth, magic and wonder. Not only do the modern fantasy writers owe a great deal to Tolkien but filmmakers and RPG game developers and of course, players!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"If you haven't read these books, you really need to. (Ok, the Bible is more important, so read that first, but then run out and read Tolkien. And as an added bonus if you dig into the Simarillion you'll actually find a lot of similarity between the two).Unlike 98.3% of contemporary fiction, reading the Lord of the Rings actually requires something of its reader: a brain. You will be expected to think. And, upon doing so, you will find yourself richly rewarded, because there is a lot here; enough to re-read over and over and over again. And it just keeps getting better (yes, just like the Bible).Now, as for these few schmucks who actually offered poor reviews on LOTR...they really ought to have their diplomas revoked (I know, assuming they have actually earned a certificate of higher education may be a stretch). The gist of their arguments runs something like this: &quot;Uh, it wuz realy slow, and uh, I dunno know why people think its great, becuz itz not like Star Trek, dude&quot;.Of course, astute readers like yourself will quickly recognize the problem: &quot;Duh...YOU are really slow (dude)&quot;. The real issue is that the LOTR is NOT like all the other garbage they are used to assimilating. To those accustomed to a steady diet of junk food and soda, a magnificent seven course meal is understandably a little hard to digest. It's called &quot;culture&quot; (dude). Fortunately, Tolkien will be around longer than anything these folks produce. No worries there!So do yourself a favor and expand your horizons. Start with a copy of scripture, and then add Tolkien. Master these two genre's, and you will do well."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"If a perspective buyer one is looking at this particular edition of the LOTR, one can assume a few things.1) He/She has already read the books.2) From that reading he/she has developed the devotion to the books that would encourage them to purchase an incredibly expensive edition.Therefore, I would ask that neophytes and Philistines keep their myopic understanding of the books themselves to reviews of the $7.99 commercial paperback edition, not the 50th Anniversary Special Edition, nor the Three Volume Illustrated Edition, nor the Original Red Leather Bound Special Edition.I don't care that you \\"thought the movies were better\\" or that you \\"got bored\\" by the exposition. Tell someone who is shopping for their 10 year old.If I am looking at an edition that retails for $100, I am not interested in moronic drivel that masquerades as criticism. I am interested in specific reviews of the specific edition (e.g. the quality of the paper and binding, the detail of the maps....etc.).If you think me a snob, you are correct. That is why I am shopping for a very expensive edition of a book I have already read.I thank you in advance for your respect."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"An mesmerising tale beautifully presented in this illustrated boxed set.

The roots of modern fantasy begin here. Yes, it's also terribly formulaic writing--but it was written to be mythology. Myths and legends are generally pretty big on formula. Beneath that stiff prose, though, is the rich and complex world of Tolkien's Middle-earth...and what an amazing place it is."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"these books have opened new worlds for so many people. The movies dont compare to the books, and the story is so entertaining that it's so easy to lose track of time when reading. I would suggest reading the Hobbit before reading this book and follow it up with the Silmarillion which explains any questions that may be left after you're done. this is a must read and will sweep you away to a more entertaining world."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Tolkien wrote the Lord of the Rings as a set of 6 books, it was released as a 3 book trilogy most of the time. This edition, however, is considered by many (and, IMHO) the best, most accurate publication of The Lord of the Rings. The forward to the book goes into much detail about the history of the publication of the story, in it's various (authorized and unauthorized) forms, and as well recounts of some of Tolkien's letters to his publishers regarding his intentions for the books, and how he tried (until his death) to bring the thousands of pages of notes he had into a coherent thing. If you are going to read The Hobbit, LOTR, or The Silmarillion, I would recommend the quality paperback editions put out by Houghton Mifflin over all others."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The case concerning opinions with LORD OF THE RINGS (the movie mind you), usually runs along the lines of \\"I love it\\" or \\"I hated every moment of it\\". That, however is not the case with the literary works. Opinions flare from \\"It is my bible!\\" to \\"I wasted a whole godamn month to read all three!\\" and with the mediocre \\"Meh, not my favorite.\\" Truth be told, Tolkien generated all the necessary requirements to create an outstanding fantasy epic: a lush, EXTREMELY detailed account of a non-existent world, races/species with distinct character traits, a \\"magical\\" presense, and an elaborate tale worth telling. To reach these requirements, an author must spend years burrowing deep into their imaginations reaching for ideas, and Tolkien did just that. It is worth the time just to take a glimpse of Middle-Earth by reading the trilogy, and the devoted often go on to read \\"the lost tales\\" and \\"silmarillion\\", because in fact, Tolkien's creation of Middle-Earth IS amazing. He created a world for our minds to dwell, and filled that world with abundant information to keep us returning. Devoted, \\"cult\\" fans of Middle-Earth, ofte know more about It'S history, than they do about the history of their own country. Not only that, but he was also one of the first authors to accomplish this feat, which makes him worthy of merit.Middle-Earth is not a place for children, nor a place for the \\"soap\\" geru. If you want access to a new world and aren't discouraged at the idea that you might be spending a lot of time digesting the environment and not as much time digesting the plot, than you're good to go. Tolkien should gain mucho \\"props\\" for created Middle-Earth, but less for the art of story-telling. While the plot is wonderful, courageous, and easily-loved, the characters and emotions are not. In my own personal opinion, I think the movie did a much better job of addressing the clear emotional turmoil, and in almost forcing you to fall in love with the characters. Tolkien did not acheive this. Charming Meriadoc, Clumsy Peregrin, Burdened Frodo, Moody Samwise, *Arwen and Aragorn*, Gimli, Legolas, Smeagol....while these character's personalities and relationships are MENTIONED and touched upon in the book, you do not feel for them, you do not mourn or cheer, or laugh, (perhaps with the exception of Smeagol, Tolkien did retain his often dark but inevitably lovable demeanor in his books). The emotion was not, however, necessary for the story to come alive, so this flaw is minor.Read the books and love them or hate them, it doesn't matter, because regardless, the story of the war of the rings is a real fantasy masterpeice."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is without a doubt THE best book in the history of Earth.I first read it when i was 6, and I have read it 13 times since.

I would highly recommend this for anyone who can afford to shell out the bucks. Very high-quality."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"With all the different editions of Lord of the Rings available, I recommend this version for a few reasons:1) Hardcover - classics should be owned in hardcover. Paperback is best for books you don't intend to re-read.2) Alan Lee - simply the best of all the Tolkien artists (and there are other great ones out there). Alan Lee has a keen sense of the look and feel of Middle Earth and its inhabitants, and has a particularly excellent ability to capture mood and emotion within a particular scene.3) Although I like the idea of publishing LOTR in a single volume, as Tolkien intended originally, I find the single volumes difficult to actually read comfortably. Keeping the books as three separate volumes makes the books physically easier to read."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Not unlike many, Peter Jackson's wonderfully well told cinematic version of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; brought upon me a desire to return to this extraordinary trilogy and read it once again as the first and last time I read it was well over twenty years before. There are many choices of releases in which to read this incomparable tale, from paperbacks to mass trade paperbacks to a few different types of hardbacks and then there is this, this wonderfully well crafted Leatherette Collector's Edition which does much to add to the experience that is reading Tolkien's masterpiece, &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot;Personally, I've read a great many novels in several different genres to include the fantasy genre in which Tolkien's first masterpiece &quot;The Hobbit&quot; kindled that love of fantasy fiction and was then further fueled by reading &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; so many years ago. In reading so many fantasy novels today, it is so clear that many of today's authors were influenced by Tolkien's style in which he wrote this novel as they almost to a number, mimic the formula for fantasy writing that he established in &quot;LOTR.&quot;For overall feel and ambience, this Leatherette Collector's Edition is the most obvious choice if one is looking to read this great fantasy tale, the only true caution is that it may be a bit cost prohibitive for some but it is well worth every penny and I might add that the best price for this novel may be found here on this site!The Premise:By now, many know the overall premise of this extraordinary tale in which Frodo, a hobbit from the Shire in Middle Earth finds himself and his companions thrust into the matters of the world as he is suddenly the ring bearer, the one chosen to bear the ring to Mordor for its ultimate destruction and the end of the dark threat that the creator of that ring, Sauron, poses to the good peoples of Middle Earth. Contained within these well crated pages is nothing less than the most extensive, well thought out, extravagant fantasy tale ever written that transcends the fantasy genre to become a story not of Hobbits, Men, Orcs and other creatures but a story of people and the choices they must make in the harshest of conditions and the care that they have for one another in those circumstances.Overall, I highly recommend this novel and this wonderful version to any and all that wish to say that they know the true version, in all it's wonderfully glory, of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; as master storyteller; J.R.R. Tolkien meant it to be. Not to take away from the accomplishments of Peter Jackson and the rest involved in making the movies as they're truly beautifully well made movies that are a pure joy to watch but they're but a mere shadow of what is written in the pages of this outstanding novel! {ssintrepid}"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"this book is awsome.when you first look at it you get a little bit scared ,because it's very big (about 1000 pages)and the first pages are really boring,but when u really start to read it,you just can'tstop,its very exciting,it makes you very curious to know what's going to happen next and it gets you inside the book,taking you to a different world.the characters complement themselves just perfectely and it's very well written (way better than ''harry potter'')and if you watched the movie and liked it,you are going to love the book"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I think it is worth buying. Your personal preference will affect how you like this version as opposed to the newer one done by the BBC. This is the first rendition I ever heard of the Lord of the Rings. I own both copies and I don't regret owning either one because each Version is good for different reasons.The voices are different in this version. BBC sounded more like grown men. The voices sounded more elfish in this version. I think that it reminded me of the Ralph Bashki version of the Hobbit. I did feel that this was more concise and less was edited out. Gollum seemed less psycho and scary in this version. There was less music in this version and less of a romantic sideline. I liked that it didn't edit out the part of Tom Bombadil; as BBC's version did. I felt like more was cut out on the BBC version even though it was four cds longer. It was disappointing.I know that one person found this edition hard to follow. I find all the audio I listen to has to be listened to repeatedly to understand the plot. I will admit that this is the kind of story that one has to listen to to understand all that was going on. With repeated listenings; one hears new things or notices new things. I actually found the narration and actors voices sounded clearer in this version than the later one."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Lord of the Rings is the best book I have ever read. I dought that I will ever read anything that will even come close to this. The collector's edition is nice because it has all three volumes in one, a fold out map, and a nice leather cover.

Yet, I am rather enthralled by LOTR. I vaguely remember reading the first part when I was 13, but by the time I decided to reread, I could remember it but vaguely.It's a very different experience now. Not only has my taste in heroes changed (it used to be Legolas, but now is Aragorn), but I remember being on the edge of my seat at 13. I am not now: I have read many books with more exciting plots. I can also see problems with this book. It would be better to have interesting women characters (Arwen and Galadriel are very firmly in the background). The epic style of narration, while beautiful, distances me from the events depicted. And because the individuals are also archetypes, I am not as attached to them as I could be.However, the book's weaknesses are also its strengths. I am overwhelmed by the beauty of the language. It truly reads like an epic worthy to be put next to Beowulf or the Illiad. I am astonished at a creation of a complete world, and my overwhelming impression is of bright colors and beautiful lines. There are images that will linger in your mind. If its literary analogy is an epic, its imagery reminds me of a pre-raphaelite painting.It takes a while to get into the book: I didn't really get into it until Strider appeared, but with a book that length, it is understandable, and even proportional.The beauty of language is not matched by its characterisation: the characters are not fascinating sharply drawn people, but somewhat distanced. But even so, it's an exciting glittering tapestry that I do recommend"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I first read LOTR years ago, when I was a teenager, it amazed me back then, and since those days I have read its pages over 6 or 7 times. It's about time I write a few words here about my all time favorite book.Tolkien died a year before I was born (73), a scholar by profession, he was specialized in Anglo-Saxon (Old English) and its relation to linguistically similar languages (Old Norse, Old German and Gothic). He became a master into the language of poetry and the poetry of language. His interest in mythology (shared by his friend C.S. Lewis) and his faith in Christianity also had a stunning effect in his stories.LOTR is above anything, a book about the struggle between good and evil, somewhere in our own world, but in an imaginary time. It all feels familiar, but &quot;glorified by the enchantment of distance in time&quot;.In Middle Earth (North-western Europe was probably what Tolkien had in mind) Bilbo, a Hobbit (a branch of the human race) finds himself in a quest to destroy the One Ring, crafted by the elven-smiths and Sauron, the Dark Lord, but lost. Sauron searches far and wide for the ring that would complete his dominion of evil, while the initially nave Bilbo and his friends (The so called Fellowship of the Ring) journey Middle-Earth, deep into the shadow of Sauron, to destroy the Ring by casting it in the Cracks of Doom.LOTR is amazing by many reasons. The languages presented are most certainly real languages, especially the Elven languages. It is unbelievable how they are not arbitrary gibberish but really possible tongues with established roots, sound laws and inflexions. Tolkien used all his knowledge and imaginative powers deriving them, in a realistic manner.LOTR is narrated by Tolkien, based on ancient manuscripts written by the main characters Frodo and Bilbo, or at least, many people think that Tolkien sought to maintain that he was only the editor and translator. This would be nothing special, as many authors tried to make their fantasies sound as true stories from some ancient times, but very few have done it so successfully as Tolkien. His love for language and his imagination and scholarship produced a work that is hard to translate, at least, without losing much of its impact. For instance, an adequate translation of Rohirric would have to be replaced with some ancient language whose relation to the language of the translation was the same as that of Anglo-Saxon to modern English. Tolkien actually used an approximation of Anglo-Saxon so we it would remain intelligible to modern readers like us. This was not accidental, but carefully devised. New land, languages, races, history, cultures, a whole new world; That is what you will find in this most remarkable work of literature.Tolkien has left us a gorgeous, eloquent and heroic romance, and after you read it you will understand why this has been named the &quot;Book of the Century&quot; many times. Some readers gave it 4 stars because it's &quot;so long&quot;. That's the only problem I can point to LOTR, its length, but for the opposite reason. I feel it should be a lot longer. :) It is true that the first 100 pages are somewhat slow for some readers, but they are still rich and interesting.The struggle of good and evil, the depth of all the characters, friendship, love, temptation, war, hate and the inner moral conflicts the characters face, all is presented marvellously thanks to Tolkien's keen abilities for both prosaic and poetic expression, based on his deep love for ancient languages, myth and nature.This is the Bible of fantasy literature, but you will probably still like it even if you're not used to its kind. No other writer of fantasy titles has ever come close. Not even the best like Tad Williams, Robert Jordan or others. Never read it? What are you waiting for? Get it. Get the hardcover illustrated version by Alan Lee. I own a few versions and will probably end up buying more. The best LOTR hardcovers are expensive, but it's fully worth it. The Lord of The Rings is simply a timeless masterpiece!After 6 or 7 reads, I still return to LOTR often, and am always fascinated by it. Every time I read it I find something new and very, very few books have come close to give me as much joy. The complexity of Tolkien's world and all its elements, the detail and richness of the descriptions, this world still makes me sit there thinking a numb &quot;Wow&quot; when I close it and it's over..."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"so that I can read them again!

These along with the Hobbit are childhood favorites that can also be read by adults with an even greater result. Tolkien is also by far the most influential writer of the 20th century, not Hemingway and CERTAINLY not Joyce. Every single book in the fantasy section at the library is a blatant ripoff of Tolkien.

I'm now 34 and, having read it about three times, I still remember vividly the images painstakingly created from the choicest language...the sparkling white towers of Minas Tirith...the darkness and filth of Shelob's lair...the terror of the Riders' shadows and their screams in the distance. I remember the knot in my chest as the despair of the defenders of Minas Tirith deepened before the onslaught of Mordor, and then just as a glimmer of hope appears that they might weather the storm, the armies of the south arriving to seal their doom. And I, too, remember fondly the final scene as the hobbit heroes return to their homes to sweep them clean of the foul, cowardly band of rouges pretending to rule the Shire. How can one find words to describe the emotions called forth upon witnessing the struggles of the small, pure, and weak against the big, corrupt, and powerful? How can one describe what it feels like to join their journeys through the foggy swamps and glistening forests with no food or plenty of food? And how could I hope to describe the catch in the throught when watching the horrific, pathetic inner struggle of the ring-bearer and his steadfast companion? Only Tolkien himself could summon the paragraphs and pages to describe the experience of reading his work.Tolkien's work is a literary classic where many other epic works of fantasy have just missed that mark (Shannara, for example) because there is, for lack of a better way to describe it, not a hair out of place. In other fantasy epics I have read, circumstances seem just a bit contrived or convenient, or of insufficient depth to fill the imagination (WHY the sword glows blue). Tolkien creates a legend with the weft of history, the dignity of tradition, the gravity of time and age and blood and tears. He invents and develops not only characters but cultures, histories, languages, and he reveals glimpses of deeper &quot;truths&quot; developed in other masterpieces.I, like many other who have read this work, can truly say it changed my life. I think differently about religion, psychology, history, literature...as a result of having internalized much of this work (and the succeeding works). I hope I can give my son the kind of experience I have had from reading this work. I hope he has that experience while reading this work himself, so I can relive it with him.If you've never read this, don't worry about the print, the binding, or anything but the story. It will carry you away and you will forget who and where you are."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have read the lord of the rings through about 4 times and I am only 15. I love the way that tolkien does the enviroment and I Love the way he immerses the reader in to a world completely different. When I read them its like I am on a vacation to the best place in the world.I even like the evil side they make me think about why wars and stuff are so bad.I also love the strong good against evil themes. I love the complete history of all of the people places and things. It is worth reading again and again."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is my all time favorite book. I've read it several times and want to read it again! Sam Gamgee is my favorite character. Tolkien ROCKS!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I am 14, soon 15. I read the Hobbit in fifth grade , and the Lord of the Rings in sixth. These books are literary masterpieces. Tolkien gives his characters great depth and you feel as if each one is an actual person. I can say the same for the detailed geography Tolkien produced for his world of Middle Earth. The story is enthralling and you will remember it for the rest of your life. I also read the Silmarillion. It is slow to take off, but when it does it blows you away with the tales of battles, sad romance, and treachery. Forgive me for my repitition, but I must say again that these books are wonderful and timeless."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Aragorn son of Arathorn is one of the greatest figures in modern literature. He is the epitomy of what a man should strive to be. The fact that he could see so far into the lives and futures of each character in the book is great. But at the same time the fact that he was merely a mortal man and did not even appear to succumb to the temptations of the One Ring is amazing! His bravery was not questioned when he decided that pursuing the ring-bearer was not in the best interest of the group. If I were going on an adventure in middle earth then I would want Strider to be the leader. &quot;All that is gold does not glitter&quot;."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Best book of the last Thousand Years!

Two years later I came across the book and read it and it is now my favorite book. Then I read The Lord of the Rings and fell in love with it. Right now I'm 15 and even though I've read other fantasy I just haven't found anything like this book. I keep telling my friends that they should read it... Anyway so I give it 5 stars because it deserves it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I myself have read many fantasy books,especially Tolkien, and someplace in those books I might find any resemblances to LOTR, and I think that is just fine ;) My Children will read this book as soon they will be able ..hm..well..read!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Lord of the rings is really the nicest book I have ever read. Mabey it's not literature like James Joyce or Shakespeare, but who cares? Its a very good book and most important it's nice. What more do you want. Tolkien used his imagination an knowledge to create his own world with its own history. And he did a great job."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"He is the Shakespeare and Homer of the 20th century. He takes a genre once associated only with acne-faced teenage boys and elevates it to literary excellence. His selection as Writer of the Century was well-deserved to say the least.Written mostly during Europe's WWII years, the symbolism of that war lies heavily in his novels (See especially &quot;The Scouring of the Shire&quot; chapter in Vol. 3 &quot;The Return of the King&quot;)His epic story has a background color and richness that rarely exists in today's literary works. He built his own languages from the syllables on up, his appendices and notes lend depth and history to his works, he is truly the only fantasy write to literally create a world. Every sentence that spills from the mouths of his characters hints at a world that we are only scratching the surface of.The poetry and lore that his characters express hint at the many volumes that Tolkien could have written if time would have allowed it. Rarely have I seen a fantasy writer who could put such a large amount of high quality verse and rhyme into their works.Almost every fantasy author of the last 30 years must tip their hat in Tolkien's direction. I have yet to find a noteable fantasy author who didn't mention Tolkien in their list of inspiring/influencing authors.I can only hope that on the eve of the long awaited Lord of the Rings movies that would-be Tolkien Cinema fans take the time to read the epic fantasy saga that made the movies possible."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This review applies to ISBN 0618517650The Lord of the Rings: 50th Anniversary, One Vol. Edition. I won't really comment on the novel itself, except to remember for a moment the intense hostility of academic English departments to this \\"trashy novel for children,\\" \\"this [...] of good and evil.\\" By now, the academy has come around, and they realize (as I did way before them) that \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is going to stay in print for a much longer time than Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\" or Pound's \\"Cantos.\\" Whether they like it or not. :-) And, of course, like it they should!I really want to review this edition of Tolkien's book, which serves him very well indeed. Finally bound in genuine leather, this book is a treat to hold and to own. And it's something to hand down to your children, which I'm afraid you can't do with digital books. As a former software engineer, let me just comment that paper is BY FAR the longest-lasting archival material, and that I have yet to see any digital format that does not eventually die out. If you put this book, this PAPER book, in your library, and don't mistreat it, it should last for centuries.Which is where I think book publishing is going: digital media for ephemera, with paper publishers forced into glorious editions of the classics.But, as Crick memorably commented, \\"How It Will All Turn Out Remains to be Seen.\\" HIWATORTBS!! :-)In the meantime, enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The writings of Professor Tolkien are absolutely Timeless. These books are the gauge by-which all Fantasy books are measured. The Hobbit and The Trilogy have been the Inspiration for decades of works by other authors, yet I have not ever seen these works surpassed by anyone. Terry Brooks is the only author I have read who even compares to J.R.R. Tolkien and his epic style. I became fascinated with The Hobbit and Trilogy when I was in the seventh grade. I borrowed them from a friend and snuck them home. I was completely enthralled with the world Tolkien created. I was not allowed to read anything that was even remotely related to Wizards, Witches, Astrology, D&amp;D, etc., so these books were like nothing I had ever seen, before. I was captivated and felt the call to become a Writer. Previously, the poetry and such that we were studying in school BORED me to tears. I found my schooling to be mind-numbingly BORING and Tolkien became my Inspiration to Learn, create Poetry, Write stories, Study, become an Anthropologist, delve into Masonic Lore and so much more.... Throughout High-School, I had pictures of Prof. Tolkien on my wall and I desired to be like him. Not-only was he the Greatest Fantasy Writer the world has known, but he was &quot;Professor of Anglo-Saxon, at Oxford University, from 1925 to 1945....and professor of English Language and Literature....and a Fellow of Merton College from '45 to his retirement in '59.&quot; Check out his translations of (book title:)&quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl, and Sir Orfeo&quot; (J.R.R. Tolkien) Also, Prof. Tolkien wrote wonderful stories like &quot;Smith of Wooten Major (&amp;) Farmer Giles of Ham&quot; for children. Pop those titles into the search box! I can honestly say that reading Tolkien changed my life...for the Better! Tolkien created the highest standards of writing for generations of authors....I am quite sure he would be deeply disappointed with the majority of books published today, with numerous spelling errors and pathetic grammar. I believe Tolkien is a god-send to English teachers. Perhaps, he can still inspire young people to elevate their Writing and English skills, from beyond. I would fight to keep his works on the shelves. I was not allowed to do my Senior Thesis about this author, despite the fact that he is such an amazing author and advocate of Literature. I lost interest in doing my thesis and threw something together at the last minute. Perhaps teachers should Recognize the potential for inspiring youth, via the works of J.R.R. Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This book was my first foray into that fertile field known as fantasy and science fiction.I found myself captivated, and I still am, even though I appreciate different things about it than I do today.The reason why I only gave it 4 stars is because it's so LONG.Three thick books, each chock full of characters and people.Even so, I was never confused about what was going on. Tolkien knows how to write so he was UNDERSTOOD.Lord of the Rings is also the reason for my lifelong fascination with elves. (As you can tell from my name.)Tolkien is a master of making his characters seem REAL, no matter what their race and general shape.Even the orcs. Let's just say I've known people similar to Tolkien's orcs.I've CARED about the characters in this story. I've cried when they cried, I've laughed with them, I've rejoiced with them...RUN to the store and buy this book, if you haven't already."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Ok, I'm not here to say I like this book, I already have. But, as I was reading another page of reviews, I found a particularly comical twosome. The first reviewer practically claims that C.S.Lewis wrote the darn thing, and ends the message by thanking him for the book! My real criticism is for the other reviewer, who says we should not mistake LOTR for a &quot;genuine&quot; epic. Who is even thinking of saying LOTR is real, or ancient? No one, as far as I can see. Also, he/she says that there is no or weak allegory in the book. After reading this, I questioned our reviewer's sanity. Tolkien created this world to represent his view of Christianity/faith. I'm an atheist, but even I know that this means basically everything in the book is allegorical. He also says Frodo was not looking for anything, but one of his own examples of a true epic is the Odyssey, in which Odysseus is just trying to get home, but gains true hero status in the process. Much the same happened to Frodo, but anyway, he WAS looking for something - peace.(duh)"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Lord of the Rings, the story of the quest of a young hobbit named Frodo and his gang to save his realm from the grasp of evil, is unarguably one of the best fantasy novels ever written.It's made up of three parts, each one composed of two books. At the end of the first part of LOTR, \`The Fellowship of the Ring', Frodo's party is split. Tolkien's true skill is seen here; the story divides into two or three parts, and each is covered for a while in the book. At just the right moment, the focus shifts to the next, revealing many mysteries.There's a 1000 word limit on reviews, which is much smaller than the thousand-some pages of the full three-part saga. The author's extraordinary writing prowess will keep you interested until the end, and leave you hungry for more."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is the best fantasy book ever written. If you have not read it, order it now!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"When I say it is the most exciting and exhilerating book imaginable, i tell no lies. It still boggles the mind how one could write with such depth and accuracy such a time ago, before television, when the mind was the great time killer. A classic book that will live forever."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I was so amazed at how magnificent the books really were! The plot was so wonderful, and the characters were so well put together and I have not in all my life have read a trilogy of books as brilliant as the Lord of the rings this is probably the greatest achievement in literature in the world. JRR Tolkien is one of the most brilliant authors of all time and I advise young adults and adults to buy this collection of books. These books are truly the greatest books ever written!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"LOTR is the first fantasy book I have read, and, I could say, the last. Any other one about the subject I tried to read was not able to reach the same level, or also something comparable. Too deep the gap between LOTR and the others, and, maybe, too difficult to reach the same thouroughness of its structure, both from philology and novellistic point of view. The author is able to branch the story into different threads, to deal properly with them, and then to join them again (people with scientific background cannot help liking this &quot;unifying&quot; effort). The end is a bit sad, leaving the memory of a world that no longer exists (or that have never existed): a metaphor of human growth."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"60 pages in and I have already found a number of obvious typos. Dissapointing to say the least.

I have loved the audiobooks.I only have 1 problem with the audiobooks and that is when I converted the discs so I could listen to them on my ipod, the names of each track varied.On some it ists the name of teh chapter and followed by a number(part of the chapter, others it names the book and the track number without the chapter title name, and on others it says the track number...They should have been consistent with the track names."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Does that mean Gandalf was more than wise? As he defended gollum \\"Not all those who are alive deserve to be alive, not all those who are dead deserve death, but can we give life to them? So do not be too quick to take it away - for not even the wise see all ends.\\" But it is my reading of the story that the nobility of Frodo would never have achieved the mission (although he would get close), the innocence of Sam would be insufficient too (although he could get even closer), something else was needed and gollum was vital to that completion. I believe the film-makers missed this, so if you have only seen the films I recommend you read Tolkein's words too - it will take a while, but what a journey of the imagination it is.It took me a long while to read through these novels as a bedside reading for my older son (I skipped the chapter on Shelob as just too scary!). I had read the novels many years earlier, not once but twice. And once again, as I read that last chapter - which isn't directly about death - the tears were hard to suppress so that I could keep the words flowing.I guess endings are always like that - especially endings to really big things in our lives.Recommended other reading:The Hobbit - JRR TolkienTitus Groan - Mervyn PeakeThe Place of the Lion - Charles WilliamsOut of the Silent Planet - CS Lewis"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I've adored LOTR's for years. I like the books better than the movies. The books are pure and the poetry in the entire book collection is amazing. It reminded me of a book I own called Echoes of Whimsy. I'm a sucker for the elven songs found throughout Tolkien's epic writing. there are others too, like when Treebeard sings and many other characters do this. To me it's all very poetic and the same as the beautiful verses found in &lt;a href=\\"http://emergingpoets.com/EOW.htm\\">Echoes of Whimsy&lt;/a>. Yes, I'm raving over this new one too, I just bought it and I adore anything that is like LOTR's with wizards, elves, magic, fantasy. It's all good. I would recomend Tolkien to anyone who wants a perfect read and to be drug into a world filled with interesting characters which come to life through the pages in this epic novel. Bravo!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"How many of the so called great authors have created such a detailed and original world? Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, The Silmarillion, and the rest of Tolkien's books based in Middle-Earth are without question the greatest story ever written. It's almost mind boggling of how a man can create a world in his mind, and then write a complete history of it. Who needs Shakespeare? What he wrote was all about finding \\"hidden meanings\\" and \\"reading between the lines\\". Tolkien was a true literary genius. Instead of writing a novel to be analyzed in a classroom, he created an imaginary universe that everyone can enjoy. No one can hope to ever write a story close to Lord of the Rings' greatness. I would recommend this book to any person in the world. If you havn't read Lord of the Rings, you are a deprived person.I don't give this book five stars. Five stars is an insult to Tolkien. I give Lord of the Rings a 20 star rating, and even that is an understatement.Other Recommendations: The Hobbit, The Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales of Middle-Earth, and the Lord of the Rings Movie Trilogy."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Oh. My. God. This has to be the greatest book ever written. My dad and my brother have always been fans and I used to tease them about it- until I read it myself. Now, I'm a person who reads a lot, and nothing I've ever read has even come close to LotR, and I don't think anything else ever will. It is so beautifully written. I cried all the way through the second half of The Return of the King, especially in the chapter &quot;the Fields of Cormallen.&quot; Just read this quote: &quot;...and they passed in thought out to regions where pain and delight flow together and tears the very wine of blessedness.&quot; Beautiful. Just beautiful. As a 16-year-old girl whose dream is to get a book published before getting out of high school, Tolkien (and Bilbo Baggins for that matter!) is a real role model. What an a amazing guy. FotR the movie was so awesome and I CAN'T WAIT for TTT. That's gonna be even better than the first one. The one I'm really looking forward to in RotK, of course (my favorite section of the book- I don't consider LotR a trilogy). See you at the movies!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I am very much greatly impressed with this book by Mr. John Ronald Reuel Tolkien Phd (1892-1973). THE LORD OF THE RINGS is a book that I consider to be a masterpiece of the twentieth century. Through it, the fantasy-adventure genre reached an unpreceden ted level. \\"This book is largely concerned with Hobbits\\" writes Tolkien, in a land of knights, wizards, elves, dwarves, kings and queens. Professor Tolkien has created an entire world. Each group has their own language, heritage, and customs which bri n g them to life. Yet, for all their strangeness, they retain very human qualities and emotions. It is a story of good vs evil influenced by his friend Mr C. S. Lewis, PhD. It is the story of young people maturing; of agrarian vs industrial. It is also a story with strong spiritu al undertones. This undercurrent of religious images within a spiritual journey interests me greatly. There are many characters which hold symbolic representations: Sauron/Satan; Galadriel/virgin Mary; Frodo/Messiah; etc. Further, Professor Tolkien adroitly offers his answers to complex spiritual issues. First, the Ring may represent wealth and its power over us all. The most powerful wizards fear its influence, and only the smallest, seemingly most impotent of the fellowship can be trusted with it. The Ring itself is ammoral. Yet, the wisest understand the danger it has to corrupt their own power. Another theme is the transition from the times of the prophets to the age of the disciples. Yet another is the life of the CHRIST, Jesus lived through the character of Frodo. Especially, as he ascends Mount Doom in its shadowing of Calvary. Finally, for me the most impressive theme that Professor Tolkien offers is in the way of good versus evil. Gollum is a devious and trecherous being with few attr active qualities. Yet, without him, the quest would have failed. \\"Even Gollum may have something yet to do\\" is the phrase which succinctly summarises his special role. This fascinating book has strengthened my spiritual commitment by offering an answer for evil. This answer has inspired in me a more patient outlook as I am reminded of the wheat and the tares described in the book of Matthew 13:24-30. Another strength of this book is that one may enjoy it without thinkin g of these weightier matters. Eve n so, for those who choose, Professor Tolkien offers a parable that highlights the differences between people and how those differences can be a strength in a fellowship. Through this I have learned a bit more about toler ance. If you are interested in t he fantasy genre, spiritual matters or enjoyed the movie, this book will interest you. Thank you Chantal.

All I will say is you will not want to put this down until you are finished so have some free time allotted just for this book if you get it.The only down side to this story, is that the second book, The Two Towers, to me and some people I know got a little boring and strayed from the path that the rest of the book follows.

Rich in detail, it is a history as well as an adventure. There is a basis given for the actions that unfold and for what will follow. We know that what we have read is just a chapter in the long history of this world. The consequences of deeds and war, both past and present, are seen is how the story develops.

I assume that, like me, you have read and liked this book, so I do not want to talk about the author's words, but the relative merits of the single-volume red \\"leatherette collector's edition\\" (ISBN 0395193958) and the version illustrated by Alan Lee. (ISBN 0618260587) Maddened by the inaccuracies of the lavish but perhaps unavoidably \\"Hollywoodish\\" film version, I wanted to get back in touch with Tolkein's much more complex, dramatic, but more leisurely paced original text. The copies I bought in junior high were long gone, so I put this on my birthday list, and two people gave me these different versions. I know they both came from Amazon.com because of the wrapping paper. Both versions have things to recommend them. The leatherette covered one is covered with a durable nubbly plastic with a Tolkeinesque star on the cover (the star of Fanor?) and drawings meant to indicate the hinges on some large, antique books. It comes in a plain red leatherette box, which I find only fills up precious book shelf real-estate, but some would like. It also has a large, clear fold-out map in the back. The paper is a nice, creamy vanilla color that is fittingly the same kind of paper \\"The New Jerusalem Bible\\" is printed on. Because it is a single volume, it has about twelve or thirteen hundred pages with the introductions and the appendices, so reading it gives one the impression that one is setting off on a quest of one's own. I am not one of these people, but some would complain that it is a bit too heavy and unwieldy, particularly for reading in bed. It is a handsome volume, and my only complaint about it is that the type, which is perhaps the result of some photographic process, is of varying darkness, and this detracts from the overall feeling of quality.The other version I was given was the set illustrated by Alan Lee. He was a consultant on the recent Peter Jackson film version, and his illustration of Orthanc on the cover of \\"The Two Towers\\" looks just like the movie poster. Lee is a very competent illustrator, and I like his pictures, but there aren't enough of them. There seems to be an average of one picture every two chapters, and Mr. Lee's choice seems to be to shy away from the vulgarly dramatic, like Gandalf confronting the Balrog in Moria, in favor of pictures that depict the incredibly overgrown nature of Middle-Earth locales like Fangorn Forest.The three volumes of this version are printed on glossy paper of such heavy duty thickness that I constantly had to glance at the page number to make sure I'd only turned over only one page. They come in an illustrated case, and because of the thickness of the paper, it gives the impression of weighing about thirty pounds. The reservations about weight that applied to the previous version apply to this one too.The typeface of this volume is excellent: dark and precise, although I think it would benefit from the occasional touch of ornamental flair.This version does not have the large fold-out map of the leatherette edition, but a map printed inside the cover. Therefore, it is not as big and clear as that map, but much more accessible. (BTW, I think Tolkien's maps badly need revision. What's needed is a reworking that follows his basic look and design, but is more detailed and more closely follows the text.)I like both of these versions, but if forced to choose, I would probably pick the Alan Lee illustrated version. Some might find his illustrations too restrained, but I thought this characteristic made them suitably elegant for a faery tale that appealed to adults. (Also Mr. Lee's style is formal and remote enough that it wouldn't get in the reader's way if his or her conception of a certain event or character was different.) It's just too bad there weren't more illustrations, and some ornamental type. This is a good edition, but it could've been great."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The problems I have with this book have nothing to do with Tolkien's work, which is brilliant, but instead deal with the physical quality of the book itself.I also have no problem with Alan Lee's illustrations, which are beautiful and inserted in the appropriate places (unlike the illustrated version of the Silmarillion). However, the page quality is average, the print face is inconsistent (dark on some pages, faint on others), and there are numerous mis-spellings, especially in the appendices. Moreover, the spine of the book that I bought is nearly worn out and I've only read it a few times.As this book is easily my favorite, I was hoping to find a high-quality edition that would last a lifetime. Unfortunately, this edition is not the one.In any case, the Alan-Lee illustrations are pretty good and worth checking out (though maybe not at this price).In contrast, I highly recommend the Alan Lee-illustrated version of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. Again, beautiful illustrations throughout, and the pages are thick and glossy with bold print. Excellent value on this one."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I'm not finding maps in the Kindle all-in-one edition.They are listed in the standalone Kindle ROTK appendices, so why not here?Update: the Kindle edition of Return of the King (individual volume)has the Middle Earth map ... one high-level view, then four pageszooming into the quadrants.

It's like having someone tell you a rousing good story without being over dramatic and loud. No musical distractions No bombast, no sound effects. Just a warm, jolly voice telling me a great tale. Although I must say I was disappointed not to hear the prologue.However, I am missing disk 16. I see someone else is missing disk 15. I wonder if the makers were in a rush to get some product out there after the success of the films, and were a bit lax in quality control.I wish to make it clear that in NO way do I blame AMAZON for this problem. They have been more than fair...and I am quite happy with their service and wouldn't hesitate to deal with them again.

There are hard-to-read words, smears, blotches, etc. The paper quality is grain and has a tint of yellow in it - not recommended for white-white paper book readers. Each book has a \\"Middle-Earth\\" foldout map at the end of the book. These maps are terribly glued on to the back flap and are stuck close to the binding. If you try to take the maps out, which is intended to be taken out to hang on the wall, the brown flap paper will stick and tear along with the folded map.J.R.R. Tolkein's trilogy of the Lord of the Rings is a true masterpiece, but keeping a set that I will read over and over needs to be well-made. I do not recommend this 1988 edition because of the quality that Houghtin Mifflin printed and bounded. The artwork covers are beautifully done and well-designed. Everything else is fair game."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I think it is worth buying. Your personal preference will affect how you like this version as opposed to the newer one done by the BBC. This is the first rendition I ever heard of the Lord of the Rings. I own both copies and I don't regret owning either one because each Version is good for different reasons.The voices are different in this version. BBC sounded more like grown men. The voices sounded more elfish in this version. I think that it reminded me of the Ralph Bashki version of the Hobbit. I did feel that this was more concise and less was edited out. Gollum seemed less psycho and scary in this version. There was less music in this version and less of a romantic sideline. I liked that it didn't edit out the part of Tom Bombadil; as BBC's version did. I felt like more was cut out on the BBC version even though it was four cds longer. It was disappointing.I know that one person found this edition hard to follow. I find all the audio I listen to has to be listened to repeatedly to understand the plot. I will admit that this is the kind of story that one has to listen to to understand all that was going on. With repeated listenings; one hears new things or notices new things. I actually found the narration and actors voices sounded clearer in this version than the later one."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy is not for everyone. If you're used to a junk food diet of contemporary easy-to-read thrillers, you'll find \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" tough going. This is no bag of high-cholesterol potato chips to be consumed in five minutes - this is a sack of solid food to be enjoyed over several evenings! Unlike the brief attractions offered by a 100-meter sprint, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" offers the scenic adventures of a 100-mile walk. Don't misunderstand this to mean that this journey is boring. Most 100-meter sprint type novels provide only momentary and fleeting pleasure, whereas the marathon journey of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" provides an enduring and challenging journey, with a multitude of memorable pleasures.Whose journey is it? At the face of it, it is a journey undertaken by the hobbit Frodo and his companions. Frodo possesses a most powerful ring, and the only way to prevent this ring from ever falling into the hands of the powers of evil is to destroy it - in the very heart of the kingdom of evil. \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" describes the epic journey of the ring-bearer Frodo and his companions as they journey into the heart of enemy territory to do battle with the powers of evil. If they successfully accomplish their quest, they will assure the conquest of evil by good.But it is not just Frodo who makes this marathon journey. Tolkien has an uncanny ability to ensnare the reader, so that you will find yourself not just a spectator, but a participant in the marathon mission undertaken by Frodo and friends. As you travel the journey with the ring-bearer Frodo and his company, they will become more than mere travelling companions. They will become your friends. You will feel you know them, and you will grow to love them - their joys will excite you, their sorrows will hurt you, their conquests will delight you, their failures will grief you. And it will pain you to say goodbye to them all at the end.Like the journey itself, however, participating in the journey by reading the trilogy can be tough going. At times the travelling through the words is slow and tough going. But at other times the pages fly by fast and furious with high paced action. And precisely this makes the epic journey through the treasured pages of Tolkien so rewarding. As a reader, you find yourself sharing in a very fantastic and yet very real journey, one which encompasses all of real life's emotions and experiences: sorrow as well as joy, inactivity as well as action, pain as well as pleasure. While reading, you partake in the emotions and experiences of fantasy characters - hobbits, dwarves, elves, and the like - because these emotions and experiences are distinctly recognizable - morally these characters are so much like ourselves, and we recognize aspects of ourselves in them.What's more, in the course of this long journey, you will be presented with breath-taking scenery. Tolkien has a remarkable ability to describe scenery with colour, character and clarity, so that you will visualize every tree, rock and road. By the time you are done, the setting of Middle-Earth will be as real as any place you've visited. As such, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is not just about a story and a journey, it is about a place. This place, you will discover, is immense and grand, because Tolkien has created cultures, histories, and languages. The vast scope of the journey and place in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" makes it a truly epic novel.In fact, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" has all the qualities of an epic - an immense scope, combined with a heroic and grand style. Tolkien constantly displays a mastery of the English language - the word usage at times gloriously grand, at times passionately poetic, at times wonderfully descriptive, but always amazing. Together, the vast scope and elevated style combine to create a truly epic masterpiece, so that the three volumes of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" read like three acts of tremendously immense play, with a global cast of characters, and a worldwide stage. And as you read, you are never quite sure whether this play is going to be a tragedy or triumph, as the powers of good seek to overcome the powers of evil.This struggle between good and evil that actually makes \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" a deeply religious book. Tolkien was a devout Catholic, and although he adamantly maintained that it was written for pure entertainment and had no deeper meaning, he could not avoid being influenced by his religious background, as is evidenced by his sharp view on morality, where good and evil are viewed as moral absolutes. The epic struggle between good and evil occurs on a wider scale than in \\"The Hobbit\\", and this gives the \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" a much more serious tone, arising out of deeply rooted religious convictions. Yet the struggle of good against evil never becomes simplistic or shallow. As in real life, Tolkien's characters have weaknesses and flaws, and are affected by their experiences - some on the side of good even being corrupted by evil. And this makes the epic struggle for truth, freedom, justice and goodness all the more stimulating as you return to real life. One cannot be unaffected by the commitment and undying devotion towards the cause of good, even when it requires unselfish sacrifices to be made in the process. In this sense, those who share Tolkien's underlying Christian values will especially enjoy the epic journey he has created.But there are more ways in which Tolkien's religious insights implicitly shine through. Biblical imagery is discernible throughout, especially the king's final victory and eternal reign of peace and joy, and banishment of evil is reminiscent of the victory of Christ over the dragon in Revelation. For readers of Scripture, the images of light and happiness, the tree of life, and an eternal kingdom, will be strikingly familiar and recognizable.But you do not have to be a Christian to enjoy \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" There is nothing overtly religious about this trilogy, since the universe Tolkien creates and describes is a universe without God, where chance and fate are acknowledged as crucial players of the game, and where the conquest of evil is accomplished by the power of one's own will. This is probably exactly what we can expect from a Catholic writer.If you have never read \\"The Lord of Rings\\", you should read it if only for the fact that it is widely acclaimed as the greatest fantasy classic, equalled by none. Few have read it and failed to be affected by. If you have not yet read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", a most distinct pleasure and experience awaits you. If you have already read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", you likely have already been touched by it, and yet the captivation of the reading experience is far from over. That's the beauty of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" - the epic scale of this book is so grand, that it begs to be read again and again. When you've read it once, you have the feeling that you have only just scratched the surface of something truly great. Like an amusement park with too many attractions to see in one day, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" leaves you in constant wonder, and when you are done, you pledge to return again soon. It is this enduring quality of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" that makes it a truly great read, a memorable and monumental marathon journey often to be repeated."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"There is nothing wrong with indulging in a little fantasy, and this beautiful book has a fun message.

For those who look upon this as a simple fantasy with elves, dwarves, goblins (a/k/a orcs)and of course hobbits, they miss the greatest part of the story. Tolkien has fashioned a timeless tale of humanity within a world of his own creation.LOTR is an epic, more telling, more indicative of human behavior than any of those epics which are considered part of serious literature. Richly detailed, the book evokes simple themes of bravery, good versus evil, love, magic, wonder and loss while treating the characters not as simple fantasy stereotypes, but as complex individuals. The struggle of good and evil, temptation, fall and redemption is presented marvelously throughout and Tolkien's keen abilities for both prosaic and poetic expression make this a story to remember.The final chapter of the book is one that will remain in thought for a long time.

My copy had 2 deformed pages where the paper wasn't cut properly and the book always opens to these deformed pages --- they appear &quot;set&quot; wrong in the bindings.3.

When I finished and was ready to put them all back into the box and display it handsomely on my bookshelf, they didn't fit! I can get any two of them in fine but when I try to squeeze the third one in, the box is bulging and I can hardly push the book into it's remaining space. If I force it in, it'll ruin the binding. I think it's because of the way the box was made. Theres no slit on the back. When I put the books in, the air gets trapped and squeezes them as I described. If the box itself had been manufactured differently, there would be no problem. But I can't fit my books in my box anymore. I would reccomend getting one of the single volume editions.

I did not want to remove this wrapping before Christmas; now I wish I had, because it is too late to return it and ask for a leather volume as advertised.

The second time through, I enjoyed it much more. At its heart, FotR is a simple tale between good and evil, with a microcosm of the world and its varied people exemplified by the denizens of Tolkein's Middle-Earth. There are the Hobits, the Elves, the Dwarves, the Orcs, the Wizards, the Humans, and whatever race Strider belongs to. The story starts in the Shire, where Biblo Baggins (a Hobit) is staging his disappearence on his (elevnty-first) 111st birthday. He leaves as a heirloom a ring to his cousin (Frodo). This is no ordinary ring, however; it is imbubed with power to control the mind of the wearer and even to make him (all of the bearers were male) invisible! Problem is that Sauron, the dark lord is looking desperately for this ring, through a team of his dreaded henchmen, the Ringwraiths. The job of Frodo is to enter Mordor, the dark land, and destroy the ring. The 'Fellowship' in the title refers to the band of (for the lack of a better term) people who leave their peaceful existence behind and start journey which will terminate in Mordor (by book 3). The book is verbose and apt to burst into a poem every now and then; the descriptions of places and denizens of Middle-Earth are very detailed.

In a way, he also assigns each character to a certain task instead of bouncing the personalities around, from the ring-bearer Frodo who proves that even the smallest people can change the world to the mischevious lad Pippin who shows that nobody's perfect.As I said before, yes, there are love stories, but even for me, someone who wants to skip all the romance in stories, this book makes it clear why these people are in love and that they're are not in it to play &quot;The Dating Game:&quot; The couples love each other in way that warms your soul with the story of Rosie and Samwise. The stories of suspence and adventure are countless, and don't always happen on the battlefield.

It is the sheer DEPTH of the work that astounds me... it is the only work I have ever read (along with all its companion books, like the Silmarillion) that creates a truly and entirely flawless and complete universe all of its own. How can I put the astoundingly complex simplicity of TLOTR in perspective? I can't say. But on the twenty-somethingth run through, I still manage to be surprised."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"To be concise and to the point the Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien is the greatest epic ever written. This is so for many reasons. The first being that the author presents so many themes in this book such as the nature of power, loyalty, and evil just to name a few and the fact that the author manages to make it that all of the characters in the story are both together and as individuals deeply and personally involved in these issues to such a degree that it is almost mind boggling to think about. This in addition to the fact that the author presents the novel in such an incredible amount of detail that you want to escape to Middle-earth and explore its every nook and cranny and the fact that this novel contains all the qualities of a classic that will generate new audiences each successive generation will make sure that this epic will be enjoyed by readers for millenia to come.

One of the greatest trendsetting books ever written!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Some of the other entries are well, rather hyperbolic. Yet I must say that few books have so enchanted me. I first encountered The Lord of the Rings when I was ten. I had read the Hobbit and wanted to read more about Mr. Baggins and his adventures, but I had never attempted anything nearly as long as the three volume set. I got TLOFR on my tenth birthday and sank into it during the long slow summer vacation of 1970. Over the next year I read the books again and again. They dominated my imagination for the next several years until girls came along and the enticements of the Dark Lord and the Fellowship dimmed before an even richer fantasy life. Over the years, I've returned to the books with delight. I find that the books still carry the same power that they did in my youth. I can see through the books more now than when I was a boy, but I love them no less. Tolkien's Christian faith, his heavy reliance on Norse and Anglo-Saxon mythology and his sometimes stilted language, are perhaps more apparent to me now than when I first encountered them, but in the end, it is the story telling that drives the books, not the intellectual undercurrents, and it is the simple power of Frodo's tale that still makes me smile and shiver and turn the next page. It's been something like ten years since I last read the books, but the fall is coming on, and the leaves will be flying past the window soon. At times like this, I have the urge to take down an old cloak and pick up my long neglected walking stick. Outside my door is a road, and we all know how dangerous they can be. Who knows what I might find, traveling down that road? Maybe an adventure."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"There is only one word to decribe Lord of the Rings...Masterpiece.

The closer I came to finishing the story the slower I read it, because I didn't want to leave Tolkein's amazing world of Middle-Earth. I encourage anyone, young and old, to read Lord of the Rings.

Never will you read a book that is more finer and enchanting than Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. It is a very exciting and suspensful story that is almost endless: and that is a good thing. 'The Fellowship of the Ring', 'The Two Towers', and 'The Return of the King' are the stories that make up this trilogy and are all equally amazing. I highly recommend you buy author J.R.R.

Anyone who is a fan of fantasy, and who has tried to read this book before, I suggest you go back and try again. It's worth it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have come late to Tolkien's works, despite (or rather because of) the fact that they were cult reading when I was at school. One of my classmates, then aged about sixteen, proudly boasted that he had read the entire work about fifty times, and ever since I have tended to associate Tolkien with obsessive fanatics. I was, however, eventually persuaded to read the books by Peter Jackson's excellent trilogy of films.The plot of \\"Lord of the Rings\\", a novel of well over 1,000 pages, is too complex to be summarised here in any depth. At its centre is a magic ring (a motif Tolkien seems to have borrowed from Wagner). This ring can give its owner immense power, but can only be used for evil purposes. At the beginning of the work the ring is owned by the elderly hobbit Bilbo Baggins, who acquired it many years before (the story of how he did so is told in \\"The Hobbit\\") and has no idea of its power. He is warned, however, by the wizard Gandalf that the evil Dark Lord Sauron, who originally forged the ring, is trying to regain it in order to enslave Middle-Earth (the imagined world in which the story is set).The story has two interlocking themes. Firstly, there is the journey of Bilbo's nephew Frodo to destroy the ring, something that can only be achieved by casting it into Mount Doom, the volcano in which it was eventually forged. (During the early part of his journey, Frodo has a number of companions- the \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\"- but only one of these, his faithful servant Sam, stays with him to the end). The second is the war that is waged by Sauron and his allies against the peoples of Middle Earth- humans, hobbits, elves, dwarves and ents (walking trees)- and of their courageous resistance.The book is much more than a fantasy adventure. Many have tried to read hidden meanings into it, both religious and political, even though Tolkien explicitly stated that it was not an allegory. Certainly, it is not an allegory in the sense of \\"The Pilgrim's Progress\\" or \\"Animal Farm\\"- a book where every detail has a symbolic meaning or can be related to an actual historical event. (Sauron, for example is not simply another name for the Devil or a disguised portrait of Hitler). This does not, however, mean that there is no symbolism in \\"Lord of the Rings\\". The main symbol is the ring itself, which represents evil and its power to corrupt the human spirit. The heroes such as Gandalf and Frodo do not dare to use the ring against Sauron because they fear that if they do they will be corrupted by its power and become as evil as he is. The various races who people Middle Earth also have symbolic functions, especially the Elves and the Orcs. The former, in Tolkien's world, are not small fairy-like creatures but an ancient race, beautiful, wise and noble who represent the higher, spiritual side of human nature. The brutal and aggressive Orcs, by contrast, represent its lower, bestial side.The theme of good versus evil is one that is capable of either a religious or a secular interpretation, but Tolkien himself was a devout Christian, and some of the themes of the book seem to be directly related to Christian ideas. There is no single Christ-figure, but three of the heroes have Christ-like attributes. Frodo, the ring-bearer, symbolically bears the sin of the world. Gandalf the wise and benevolent sage rises from the dead after dying in a struggle with an evil adversary. The final part of the book is entitled \\"The Return of the King\\"; this relates to the reappearance of Aragorn, the lost heir to the throne of the kingdom of Gondor, but can also be taken as a reference to the Second Coming.So far, I have discussed the work in largely abstract terms, but it is not principally a book about abstractions. What sets it apart from many other fantasy works is that Middle-Earth is brilliantly imagined in all its concrete reality. It is a world that is in some respects a familiar one. Its geography, climate, flora and fauna are closely based on those of Europe. The hobbits, for all their small stature, hairy feet and habit of living in holes, are also reassuringly familiar; conservative and phlegmatic by temperament, they seem like the Middle-Earth equivalent of tweedy, pipe-smoking Englishmen. In other respects, Tolkien's world is highly exotic one. He spent many years of his life developing his ideas about the races who inhabit it, working out full details of their cultures, their histories, their mythologies and (most important from his point of view as he was an academic philologist) their languages. Many of these details are set out in the Appendices which, although they do not form part of the main story, are nevertheless a fascinating part of the work.Against this background, Tolkien creates a cast of characters who, even when they have a symbolic function, also come to life as individuals. (Something else that sets him apart from many other fantasy writers). Besides those mentioned above, I should also mention Sam, Frodo's loyal and steadfast servant, Saruman, a former colleague of Gandalf who was tempted by cynicism and self-interest to throw in his lot with Sauron, and especially Gollum. Gollum is the mysterious creature from whom Bilbo originally won the ring, and whose life is dominated by the desire to recapture it. He is vicious and treacherous, and yet at the same time capable of arousing pity. He both desires the ring and fears its power; at the end he will play an ironic yet vital role in its destruction. From evil, good can sometimes spring.Having read the work, I can now understand why it has such a fascination for many people, even if I have no immediate plans to read it another forty-nine times. In some literary and academic circles there may be a prejudice against the heroic fantasy genre, which is regarded (with some justification) as tending to produce shallow, one-dimensional works. The miracle of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is that Tolkien has taken this unfashionable genre and used it to produce a rich, multi-layered work, one which has taken its rightful place among the masterpieces of twentieth-century English literature."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Published by Houghton Mifflin Company, original publishers of the American edition, this beautiful collector's edition of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is bound in red leatherette with blue, gold and green, folio decorations on front and back---(whether purposely chosen because the book Frodo leaves Sam of his memoirs is also red, or mere coincidence, I do not know. A great detail, just the same.) The pages are good quality with black ink for text and red ink for page numbers and chapter title headers. Also, there is a fold out map of middle-earth glued to the inside back flap of the book. A beautiful addition to your home library.That said, I have to address some of the problems I found in my particular copy which is why this became a four star rating rather than a five. I noticed that the printing was faulty---errors like dark and light ink on the same page, some letters half printed and some not at all, as well as small ink globs. For the price I paid, I found this disappointing and do not know if others have had this problem.Another observation: Though all three books appear as one in this edition as Tolkien originally intended, the page numbers start at \\"1\\" with the beginning of each book. I found that a little baffling, but not in a negative way. Overall it is a beautiful book and reasonably priced for a collector's edition.I will not bother with a synopsis as most looking at this book may already be familiar with the plot and/or movies, but I will say that it is a must read for all who appreciate English literature."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I thought this book was outstanding.

For without the Hobbit we wouldn't truly understand The Lord of the Rings. Some of you out there have said you don't get it. Well if you don't you must not have read and let your imagination run free."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Whether you are familiar with the most beloved fantasy story of all time or you are late in coming, you will be sure to enjoy Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. Filled with danger, excitement, love, sadness, and poetic language, this story has yet to bow down to any others of its genre. It is the cream of its author's life as well as a delight to readers in every corner of the world. The tale tells of a small hobbit, Frodo Baggins, whose brave decisions regarding one small ring determine the fate of the entire Middle Earth. If one delves deeply into the text, he will find ancient wisdom hidden as well as the answers to many of life's toughest questions.Furthermore, I would encourage you to buy Alan Lee's illustrated version of Tolkien's story. His watercolors are astounding and bring a unique vision to the story. The pages containing the illustrations are thick and smooth and scattered throughout the story. The books are a good reading size and easier to handle than the versions where all threes books are squashed together in one binding. (Which, is good for a collector's edition, but not necessarily for the easiest reading.)So if you are looking for some exhausting yet wonderful reading, pick up The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. You can't go wrong with a good story.

Finer editions surely abound. The publisher should be ashamed for reproducing such a fine tale in such a poor package."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Over the past several decades, THE LORD OF THE RINGS has sold millions of copies and is commonly regarded as one of the most influential fantasy novels ever published. Many first time readers have began their trek into Middle-earth with Frodo and the Company of the Ring in recent years. What they will encounter there has been loved by millions of readers before them, and if they allow themselves to respond to Tolkien and his Myth will doubtless become a loyal and ardent fan of Tolkien and those furry-footed hobbits. What's also notable about THE LORD OF THE RINGS is, for a book as long as it is, many of its readers reread the novel many times over. Yet despite its enduring popularity, Tolkien is often held in complete disregard by the literary establishment.The real question is why? In the literary climate that is characterized by modernism and post-modernism where the twentieth and twenty first century is a wasteland why does a \\"series\\" of fantasy novels become one of the most beloved works in modern times?It's because the power of myth over the human imagination works wonders, creating a longing and a hunger that, Tolkien argues, is met by the Christian religion. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis are the flip-sides of the same coin, with Lewis giving us accounts of the longing and Tolkien providing the books that would create that longing. And what about the longing? It's that longing for Myth, that love for those beauties which Tolkien shows us in THE LORD OF THE RINGS. It's that longing that sets man apart from all other creatures in the universe: a craving for beauty and for joy. The German word for this longing is \\"senhsucht\\". In a time characterized by fast-food, cell-phones, materialism, superficiality, the account of a Hobbit working against all odds in a mythic landscape so captures the human imagination (and this is NOT hype) that an entire genre is created. It is because of how Tolkien so masterfully handles Myth that he has been so highly treasured by such a large fan base.Still, there are a few things to consider when reading Tolkien nowadays. Looking over the reviews, it proved rather shocking to me that people have been complaining that, although it was original when it was published, much of what Tolkien has done has become cliche and that other writers are much better working with these cliches and making them more exciting than Tolkien. They complain about his \\"endless descriptions\\" of the natural world, very detailed accounts of geography and not enough \\"characterization.\\" The characters are unrealistic: the \\"human drama\\" required by the book's very nature is beyond Tolkien's scope as a writer. THE FELLOWSHIP is both uneven and very weak in pacing, with so much invested in the world and its history Tolkien forgets to make us care about the characters themselves. Another fault oft cited against Tolkien is the lack of \\"female characters,\\" and there have been accusations that Tolkien is racist; one of my favorite misconceptions is that Frodo and Sam are homosexuals.Academia has no time for Tolkien, and many of our key critics have denounced Tolkien as ill-written or escapist (Harold Bloom said that THE LORD OF THE RINGS is a period piece which will simply not die but just keeps lingering on long after its relevance. This is the stance taken by a lot of professional critics with a grudge against Tolkien, and wonderfully have been proven wrong). To this day, while not nearly as openly hostile as previous decades, academia in general harbors resentment against Tolkien and everything he's done. As far as they're concerned, he's done something that is actually popular and therefore unworthy of study. It's one of those \\"high-brow vs. low-brow\\" situations, and instead of producing \\"worthwhile\\" academic research, Tolkien instead writes a \\"series\\" of novels which become one of the most established authors of this century. In recent years, academic support has grown tremendously for Tolkien, but he is still a very hotly contested modern writer, unlike some other \\"academically undeniable\\" classics such as James Joyce. Unlike the academic favorites, Tolkien highly polarizes the professional literary establishment. Fortunately he has gained some ground here though.Much of the complaints voiced against THE LORD OF THE RINGS are both unimportant and irrelevant. Tolkien is working with literary traditions not in-tune with the modern mind, but is instead handling narrative threads of Myth. Tolkien gives us solid archetypes to work with, bringing out the very qualities of masculinity and the beauties and stark wonders of femininty, but all expressed in mythological terminology. The idea of Sam and Frodo as homosexual is both ridiculous and totally unfounded. In Myth, good is characterized and seen as \\"White,\\" and the evil is dark and perverted. Those who say Tolkien is racist approach him from the wrong standpoint.As for the modern fantasy reader, those who complain about Tolkien's originality (while acknowledging it, but that later writers do a much better job with it) is like saying Shakespeare, while a good dramatist, is not that good because other people take his principals and make them more exciting, etc. I heard a story once about a person who went to see a Shakespeare play and went away complaining there were too many quotes in the play to make it any good. Shakespeare is the source of these quotes and he did not even realise it.Most people know that Tolkien founded modern fantasy. Tolkien laid down the template for the fantasy genre in general, and anyone who reads fantasy has been touched, directly or indirectly, by Tolkien's work. Almost all of the major fantasy authors have acknowledge their debt to Tolkien, and the shadow Tolkien casts over fantasy literature is very long indeed. Because there is fifty years separating us from the original publication, it is much harder to approach THE LORD OF THE RINGS as those first reviewers, for those who have grown up reading fantasy literature are now accustomed to Dwarves and Elves and Dark Lords and Epic Quests, but when it was issued THE LORD OF THE RINGS transformed and invented an entire new genre. It is not Tolkien's fault that his vision of a mythology was so successful that everyone else decided they would try their hand at fantasy and work within Tolkien's templates. The main problem with fantasy authors in general are they are more interested in emulation than they are in true \\"myth-making.\\" Much like early rock and roll, which, because rock was not an established form of music, the early musicians relied on other forms to create a new genre, Tolkien did not have this tradition to fall back on so instead he used various literatures and epic poems to create his own vision of myth. A lot of fantasy writers do not work in the context of myth any more, but rather rely on genre stereotypes which are generally found in Tolkien. Many readers who are interested in \\"pulp\\" fantasy get bogged down in Tolkien because he takes the time to fully explain his world and its cultures, because his goal is different. There is plenty of action in LORD OF THE RINGS, but those raised on the pulp fantasy will not care for it.Ultimately, THE LORD OF THE RINGS's criticism has shown itself to be of little importance on its durability as a major text. Ever since its publication in 1954, 1955, and 1956, LOTR has become one of the most important literary works our era has produced, highly regarded and passionately loved by an enormous amount of people. Despite the very vocal minority who despise Tolkien and his work, THE LORD OF THE RINGS has consistently topped the polls for the best book of the last one hundred years. Whatever the critics say, THE LORD OF THE RINGS is here to stay because popular imagination has grabbed hold of Tolkien's vision and ran with it. Tolkien and Lewis have been wonderfully vindicated in their belief that there is an enormous adult appetite for Myth and fantasy literature.Tolkien's work is water in a dry place."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Addendum January 2008:Let me say that while there may be finer editions (the 2000 HarperCollins black leather/india paper (now over $300US) and the 2004 UK 50th Anniversary HarperCollins edition (still in print, but over $150US where available), this US 50th Anniversary edition is easily the best edition in print in the US. Despite some complaints and comments by other reviewers to the contrary, this book is in fact leather bound. Many readers will have only had experience with a style of leather binding now rare (calfskin or morocco leather) that was quite heavy and very expensive. As an amateur bookbinder, typesetter, and papermaker who has studied with John Risseuw and others, I can say with absolute confidence that the binding on this edition is a type of elegant, thin leather formerly much used, known as \\"bonded leather\\", it is infact and deed: leather.Having set that issue to rest, let me also say that the other design and manufacturing consideration of the edition are first rate. I should say it would be a bargain of it were just cloth bound, and it should occupy a place of pride in anyone's library, and become a suitable heirloom. Have no fear if you are looking for the best in-print edition of LOTR. You will get it with this one.Two fine points. If you prefer an illustrated edition, perhaps the Centenary one-volume edition illustrated by Alan Lee is more suitable. No slipcase, a cloth binding, and the text, unlike this edition, does not reflect the most recent corrections (this and the lower priced 50th Anniversary \\"Standard\\" edition are the only editions in the US which do). Also, this edition is sometimes confused with an earlier commemorative published around 2000-2001 from Houghton Mifflin that was famously defective in its production, with missing or torn pages, improperly sewn or bound pages and signatures, and all around sloppy construction. They sound and look similar, but always check the ISBN and be sure that you are looking at the correct edition (which should have a preface by Wayne G. Hammond regarding the text corrections). This edition, whatever other opinions may be, has had no such manufacturing problems, and is for the moment the definitive text of LOTR.July 2007:Beware that many of the reviews posted here for this edition do appear to actually refer to another, slightly earlier edition that was defective. While I can't provide ISBN numbers, there was another commemorative edition published shortly before this one (and which was also slipcased in a black leather binding with gilt edges) that of a limited edition of 1500 copies, 1100 were recalled by the publisher due to defects in the binding and assembly, specifically the problems listed here of bad cutting and gluing etc. This edition here is that which was brought out to replace it. It contains the Mazarbul paintings and different cover art from the earlier one, and can be distinguished from it on this basis at least. I bought my copy from Amazon last year and it is perfect. I have examined at least 3 other new copies at bookstores and each of those was also as it should be. I have also seen a used copy of the earlier defective and it is clearly not the same edition, though I imagine it will become valuable due to scarcity in time (only 400 copies extant, at the most)Having said this, and while I recommend this edition without reservation, it is not the most lavish or expensive edition ever printed. It does contain the definitive corrected text according to Christopher Tolkien and the Tolkien Estate, though the Folio Society ($175) and Easton Press ($295) both publish editions which are much more expensive, and there are and have been numerous other leather (quarter to full-bound) and full-bound cloth, slipcased (paper, cloth, leather), gilt-edged, illustrated or engraved (various), hubbed, deckled, and otherwise \\"deluxe\\" multi- and single-volume editions of LOTR over the years.Still, with the possible exception of the British HarperCollins 50th anniversary edition (which is a complete seperate book design [and unique ISBN]: covers, case, color scheme, exterior markings, type, etc.) I do think this is an elegant, beautiful book. The color, the choice of foil stamped images (and the stamping quality itself), the inclusion of Tolkien's own artwork (and the particular choices there), the paper, type, ink, and other elements each and all combine to produce an outstanding book-object. I believe Tolkien would be most pleased with it, on its own merit and compared to all the other editions currently in print."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Okay, I think we're all agreed: The Lord of the Rings is a great book, one that gets better every time you read it.If you're like me, what you really want to know is: Which is the best edition to buy?Paperback, hardback, three-volume, seven-volume, one volume, illustrated, movie tie-in, with collector bookends...there are so many choices! I looked at them all before deciding which edtion would be the most fun to read and to own.They each have their advantages: The paperbacks are cheap (the new 2003 single volume edition is a bargain at $12); Three individual volumes are easy to carry; Seven volumes neatly separate each of the the epic's six books plus appendices.But the single volume I think is the best reading experience. Completely indexed and with the appendices close at hand, you can enjoy the whole epic story as Tolkien envisioned it.The red leatherette-bound Collector's Edition is the best designed, type set and bound of all the currently available US editions. It features the corrected 1986 text. It's neat, comfortable to hold, and easy to read. By comparison, 1993 single volume edition (with illustrations by Alan Lee) is a heavy and unwieldy book. The thick glossy pages just fall out of the flimsy binding. The newest Anniversary edition offers illustrations, but is also very pricey.This \\"Collector's Edition\\" is printed in black type on attractive, easy-to-read cream paper with nice page headings in red. It has a fairly sturdy sewn-in binding which opens out evenly for comfortable reading. There is a fine fold-out map of Middle Earth as well as numerous maps along with the text.At Amazon's price this terrific edition of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" is very affordable. You're going to be spending a lot of time with this book. It might as well be in an edition that you can really enjoy."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I just received my copy of the just-released Millenium Edition of Lord of the Rings (came out October 99) -- I was extremely disappointed. It is essentially 7 little paperback-type books with hard covers on them. The print is small, of course, but worst of all is the sorry excuse for &quot;binding&quot; used by the publishers (done by just glueing a bunch of single pages together). I kid you not, upon opening the first book, a page was already in the process of falling out! If you want a decent hardcopy addition of this outstanding work of literature, go with the 3 volume set from Houghton Mifflin ."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I'm not writing a review about the story, but about the physical quality of this edition. If you're like me, the number of editions available makes it hard to choose one. I decided I wanted a hardback since I imagine this is a book I'd eventually give to my kids when they grow up. Therefore I wanted something that would last, and a 1000+ page paperback will probably fall apart like an old phone book after a couple years of use. I don't want to shell-out a lot of money for an enlightened manuscript either, so cost was an issue in my decision.I found several hardcover editions (still available) to choose from. I went to a couple of bookstores to compare them. I chose this one because it was the best 'deal'. I.e.- some of the other editions are higher quality, but they cost considerably more. This book seems to have good binding, the paper (while not archive quality) is bright and not too light-weight, and the printing is clean. Personally, I don't care for the dust jacket. While I _LOVE_ the movie, I think the use of tie-in cover art is cheesy. Thankfully, the cover beneath the dust jacket is attractive (although quite plain compared to the more expensive editions).Here are some of the others (by ISBN) and my comments:0395595118 the 1991 centenary editionProbably the best single-volume edition available with up-to-date revisions/corrections. Also has new artwork. Costs twice as much as this one though- ouch!0395193958 leatherette collector's editionLooks great, and other reviewers have said it is a really durable book. It also includes a large fold-out map attached to the back cover- pretty nifty. However, it's based on the 1974 edition so the later revisions/corrections are not included. Costs about the same as the centenary edition.0395489326 boxed set of 3 hardback volumesPublished in 1988, it is more up-to-date than the 1974 editions, but still not quite current. If you want a hardback set, rather than a single volume, this is a very attractive set. The books have a nice size- smaller than the collector's edition but easily bigger than a paperback. Each volume also includes a fold-out map. It also costs about the same as the two editions mentioned above. There are more recent hardback sets available, but they have the tacky movie tie-in cover art.0618129014 same as this one but released in June 2001As far as I could tell, it just has different cover art on the dust jacket.That's it :) If you are interested in any of these other editions, you can find all of these on Amazon (put the ISBN in the search field)."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"(I am not a native speaker, please overlook my style)I am not going to review the novel, the root and basis of modern fantasy, a novel I simply love, even if I am not entirely blind to some of its flaws.This edition was quite a disappointment to me: I bought it to have a nice collectible edition of this classic and was sadly disappointed: the box and the over bookcover are lovely, the pictures are exquisite but the binding is very poor in quality; poor as it is, it is still better than the paper used and the printing which are untolerable for an edition as expensive as this.If you are looking for an edition for your library, chose elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have to say that this edition is outstandingly the best one out there today. Houghton Mifflin has done a great job at compiling and designing the books. The set is particularly beautiful with artwork by the already famous Alan Lee. I have to agree that this edition surpass the 1988 edition (ISBN: 0395489326) by FAR! The 1988 edition was poorly done and had sloppy printing.Books are well-produced with sturdy hardcovers. The binding is bound in red cloth. All three books have dustcovers with extraordinary artwork by Alan Lee - each shows a scene from the book that it is in. All three books have a map of \\"Middle-Earth\\" on the inside of the front and back flaps. The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers show the whole map of \\"Middle-Earth\\". Whereas, The Return of the King shows the concentrated map of Rohan, Gondor, and Mordor section only. I think it is very fitting since The Return of the King takes place around Mordor. It would be even better if Houghton Mifflin made a fold-out map of \\"Middle-Earth\\" to go along with this edition.The drawback of this edition is the glossy format that can reflect glare light that may disturb some readers. The books are somewhat large and overweight, but very solid and sturdy.This edition of The Lord of the Rings is very compatable with the Houghton Mifflin's edition of \\"The Hobbit\\" (ISBN: 0395873460) and \\"The Silmarillion\\" (ISBN: 0618391118). Both editions have the same format and size as the LOTR SET. I truly recommend all!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is a beautiful looking edition. I love the appearance of it. Unfortunately, while it looks good the quality is not up to par. The spine is thin & my edition had a tiny tear at the bottom, which I have managed to repair with a small piece of black card so it is unnoticeable. However, I suspect it could have gotten worse with repeated openings of the book.The Harper Collins (UK) edition is much more substantial, but the problem I have with that one is that the slipcase is integral to the book, with a circular cut out to allow the embossed Eye of Sauron on the cover to show through. In effect, rather than the slipcase being there to protect the book it is part of it & has to be treated with the same reverence as the book itself. The prices of each reflect the quality - 100 for the HC edition as opposed to $100 for the HM. I wish HM had gone in for a little better quality of material & charged a bit more - this is a 'one-off' after all & will only appeal to true collectors, who would have stumped up for it anyway.Faults have been pointed up already with the rubber glue sticking the maps together (what for???) when the book arrives. It is impossible to open them up without leaving small tears on the surface of the paper.Now to the 50th anniversary changes.This edition has '300-400' changes to the text to produce the text Tolkien 'would have wanted'. This assertion is questionable in some cases. The actual version of the Lay of Earendel which had extra verses & is given by Christopher Tolkien in the History of Middle-earth has not been included, but a change has been made to Legolas' words regarding Elves (the 'original' text published during Tolkien's lifetime has him saying that the Elves 'do not count the running years', while this version has him saying that they 'need not count them.' This may seem trivial. The change was made because CT stated that his father originally wrote 'need not' but when CT copied that out for him he omitted the word 'need' & when his father came to check it he wrote in 'do' instead. CT assumes that this was a mistake on his father's part & has authorised the change back. However, we cannot assume that Tolkien had not thought better of his original wording & decided that 'do not' reflected the Elves state of mind better than the original 'need not'. 'Do not' implies the Elves have no choice in the matter, that the passing years do not even register on their consciousness, 'need not' implies they can if they wish. This goes goes to the heart of Elven psychology & such a change is not to be made lightly.We do not actually know what Tolkien thought. We do know that in all the editions (including his own textual revision made in the sixties) he left 'do not' to stand.Changes have been made to the text without authorial approval under the excuse of producing the edition Tolkien wanted without much proof for that being the case.Also, this edition does not include the revised Index by Hammond & Scull that has been included in the recent 3 volume edition of the work published by HC in the UK, but Tolkien's original, so there is a different 50th Anniversary version out there already. Tolkien's original index has, apparently, been superceeded by the H&S; one for the future. Whether one considers the Index a part of the text proper is a matter of opinion, but it is part of the original text that seems to have been consigned to history.With this edition you are not reading the version 'Tolkien would have wanted' - how could anyone (outside of a seance ;)) know what Tolkien would have wanted? You are reading a well intentioned attempt to put something like that together. Whether those involved should have bothered is another matter. Personally, I would like to have seen a facsimile of the First Edition put out to commemorate the Fiftieth Anniversary. That would have been interesting.Still, it does look nice."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I recieved this book a few days ago for my birthday, and I have completely fallen in love with it. I am an avid fan of Lord of the Rings, as well as Tolkien's other works, and I have to say that I really think that this edition does it justice.I was a bit worried about how the gold-edged pages would look, but they are absolutely excellent. The picture posted here does the book no justice- the pages don't have that mustardy-yellow tint. And no, it's not blue, it's black, but that's already been pointed out. As for the leather... if it's not real, then it's a very nice imitation.Having also used the red leatherette version, I have to say that I prefer this one hands-down. The \\"leather\\" on that one strikes me as very cheap-looking. Aside from the corrections made, there is also the added map, which gives you a closer look around Rohan, Gondor, and Mordor.It also has a ribbon book-mark built in, which is a very nice and beautiful addition.It's very much a collector's book. The pages are not very thin, but they do kind of stick together when you first open it (they do come apart without tear very easily, however). It's also very large- besides not wanting to risk any harm to it, it is much too bulky to read anywhere besides your own home. I would not reccomend this for children or people who have never read these books. I would reccomend it for those who have read and love the books.As far as the actual content of the books, I could personally rant for a good hour on why you should read them, but there are other places you could go to read such a review, so all I'll say is that if you haven't read it, do.I hope this was helpful!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Less weight when I move than the books I already have and read, it is much more congvenient.

THE ONLY OTHER SERIES OF BOOKS THAT COMES CLOSE IS BY ASIMOV. I AM GLAD THE FULL BOOK IS ON KINDLE FINALLY! I HAVE BEEN WAITING!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Originally posted at Bibliophilia, Please. [...]I've been struggling with the choice of what book to review first. I tried deciding by genre. Urban fantasy maybe? I LOVE The Dresden Files series (Jim Butcher). Or a space opera? I just finished A Rising Thunder (David Weber). The thought kept rattling around my empty skull, until a thought made its presence known. Since this is our first review, let's make it about the first book we ever read. You may have noticed a plural or two there. Nothing to see here. This is not the multiple personality disorder you're looking for. *waves Jedi arm thingy frantically*I have read books before The Lord of the Rings. I even remember a few titles. Sandokan, The House of the Spirits, and that's ALL I remember! And I only remember the titles at that. I do know there were some pirates in Sandokan. Maybe some jungle. Maybe a turban or three? And The House of the Spirits was about a... haunted house or something. I wasn't paying attention. Ghostbusters anyone?(Whoyougonnacall!?)So, even though I have read books before, they obviously left no impression whatsoever. The Lord of the Rings on the other hand, changed me. It gave me magic, wizards, elves, dwarves, quests, evil overlords. It's important to me. It's (dare I say?) precious. Jeje*.So, how do I review a book that's as reviewed as this one is? I'm sure there are better reviews, and better reviewers than me out there. So the only thing I can do to make this my own, is to relive my memories of it, hopefully through the eyes of a kid who didn't like to read and who found out just how wrong he was. Later on I'll re-read it and review it again from the perspective I have now, with a few more reviews under my belt. But this one will be from memory.The story is about personal growth, as I see it. Empires balance on a sword's edge, lives are lost, races face extinction, all this is true. But what got to me were the personal struggles. The fight against greed, corruption, temptation, darkness. Don't get me wrong, the battles and riding around were fantastic. I still get a bit of chills imagining Gimli, Legolas and Aragorn chasing after the Uruk Hai to rescue Pippin and Merry. The mental picture of the armies of Gondor, or when Rohan arrived just in the nick of time to save the day, still fill me up and make me want to ride with them. I'd get killed right away, but that's what's nice about books. I get to ride next to Th&eacute;oden into battle and face the Nazgl. In my head I kick so much ass, you don't even wanna know!But that's not what makes any of the characters move. It's the inner fights that leave lasting memories for me. Frodo carrying the weight of the ring, Sam looking after his master, Aragorn fighting to save his line and the world, Boromir losing his own battle. It's these struggles that allow me to connect to them. Could I have fought the insidiousness of the ring? Could I have supported Frodo from the Shire to Mount Doom like Sam did? Faced with Boromir's decision, would I have fallen like he did. Maybe. And that's what I love about this book. It gave me a new world, when the one I was living in wasn't all that good. It let me lose myself inside a grand quest to save a whole world, by riding with the fellowship and suffering and rejoicing with them.The writing is fantastic. Tolkien is my master. I want to carry his children and feed his pets. If I close my eyes now I can see the Shire. I can see the fellowship riding towards their destiny. I can see Moria. I can see the Balrog. Now, tell me. If you read the LOTR, how can you not be awed by the Balrog. And if you saw the movie, how can you not have a nerdgasm! I just got goose bumps thinking about it! You shall not pass?!? YOU AIN'T CROSSING THIS BRIDGE BALROG! TIME FOR UNCLE MAGN... GANDALF TO MAKE YOU HIS BITCH! Don't even get me started on the memes. Just. Don't.*15 minutes later* Ok *twitches* I'm back *twitch*. One does not simply stop looking at memes. *twitch*When I look back at the trilogy now, I get is this warm fuzzy feeling. Nostalgia for old friends and an old story, still new and relevant even after all these years. Like the feeling I get when I come back home. Familiar and comfortable. Full of magic and elves. Fantasy at its best. I have a few more books to read before I can read the trilogy again, but I most definitely will.I'm looking forward to going back for a visit at Bag End, have some elevensies with Frodo, Sam and the gang, and read from the red book while we wait for Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli to arrive. It's going to be grand. Why don't you join us! Plenty of room around the fireplace. Grab a cup of tea and a lembas. Let's listen to some adventures.*That's just the Chilean showing. ;-)"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Great novel.

It's without a doubt the best thing that I have ever read! That's why this review mainly focuses on this specific edition of the book. I own four different editions of The Lord of the Rings, but this one is by far my favorite. I've had it for about five years now and it's still in excellent condition. It has been read through numerous times, but it still doesn't show any wear. The appendixes in the back are excellent as well. My one complaint is that only one fold out map is included. The map that is included is a large one of Middle Earth. In some hard-bound editions of Return of the King (the last book of the trilogy) a fold out map that details Mordor is included. Other than that, this collectors edition is perfect! Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Book By: J.R.R. TolkienIn prehistoric times, the Rings of Power were prepared by the Eleven-smiths. Eleven-smiths made important tools, and in this case dominating rings. Sauron, the Dark Lord, needed the One Ring. He needed this Ring to over-power every living thing, such as a person, and especially, the hobbits. The problem that is stopping Sauron from doing so, is the One Ring that was taken from him. Even though the One Ring was sought after throughout the Middle-earth (which is a place), it remained nowhere to be found, to Sauron. After many ages, the Ring fell by chance into the hands of the hobbit, named Bilbo Baggins.From his stronghold in the Dark Tower of Morder, Sauron's power spread all over Hobbiton and throughout the world. Sauron gathered all the great kings, but always he searched for the One Ring that would make the Dark Lord dominant.On Bilbo's 111th birthday, he vanishes, bequeathing to his adopted young cousin, Frodo, his One Ring. Frodo now finds himself with many quests, such as a hazardous quest to a journey across Middle-earth, deep into the shadow of the Dark Lord (Sauron), and to destroy the Ring by putting the Ring into the Cracks Of Doom.This story tells the immense, mission undertaken by Frodo and the Fellowship of the Ring. Nothing could have been done without the help of, and distractions of Gandalf (the wizard), Merry, Pippin and Sam (the hobbits), Gimli the dwarf, Legolas the elf, Boromir (of Gondor), and a large, mystifying stranger called Strider.I enjoyed this book because it always had something happening, and that makes the reader want to never stop reading The Lord of The Rings.My favorite character is Gandalf (the Wizard), who is so knowledgeable. I also enjoyed the mystery of Strider.I would recommend this book to any reader who enjoys books that have something going on at every moment, people who like cliff-hanging chapters and action. People must like action and a little bit of mystery to enjoy The Lord of The Rings. I really loved reading this long book, and I would love to read it again!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"What is left to say about JRR Tolkien's epic Lord of the Rings without resorting to the overused, yet appropriate, hyperboles that seem always to hover round its beautiful 1000+ pages? Without question, it is the greatest fantasy work ever constructed, inspiring a horde of impersonators who always fall short of Tolkien's masterful construction. Robert Jordan can construct the believable fantasy world, but lacks the literary prowess to construct a concise, accurate work with consistent themes. George Lucas, ever the Tolkien impersonator, creates beloved characters, but his world is often saturated with uncomfortable dialogue dripping with inappropriate attempts at humor. Many have grasped desperately at the perfect world created by Tolkien, but each one has, not surprisingly, fallen short. There never shall be another Lord of the Rings.Specifically, this edition is a must have for any and all Tolkien fanatics. Alan Lee, simply the best artist of Middle-Earth, has created 50 gorgeous paintings that depict beautifully Tolkien's world. If you do not own this book, you ought not consider yourself a true Tolkien fan."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I really don't understand all the vitriol that gets splashed around regarding this radio drama. Now my judgement may be clouded as I've been listening to this version since I was a boy, but of all the radio and screen adaptations I've been exposed to, I believe this is my favorite.I have seen the new Jackson and the Bakshi film. I've seen the Rankin Bass films and heard the BBC dramatizations. Perhaps I tend to go against the flow (e.g. I enjoyed the Bakshi film more than the Jackson one). I personally find the BBC version lacking in many ways that this presentation does not. The actors in the BBC version are very accomplished, but somehow they ring less true to me in most cases. Bilbo, Gimli and Legolas are perfect here, and Gandalf cannot be beat. I will admit that Frodo and Sam are a bit weak in this presentation. However, the crown jewel in the entire performance is Gail Chugg as the Narrator (as well as Gimli and Gollum). He is aboslutely astounding and brings the work to life in ways that Tolkien's own verbalizations do not. The passion in his performance is uncanny and thrills you while you listen.Certainly the production may be lacking in places and the music may be mediocre (is it public domain material? I've heard the same \\"songs\\" in B-movies.) at times. But the feeling certainly there, and scenes are generally better painted in this version than in the BBC version. Take for example the Balrog scene. In the BBC version you really have no clue what's going on, especially if you are not familiar with the story. In this version you're passionately aware of every move. Much of this is largely due to the judicious use of the narrator. Some may argue that using a narrator is impure to the art form, but I would disagree, and note that abandoning this results in very unrealistic dialogue from the characters, something that radio dramas almost necessarily suffer from.Yes, there are some interpretations (like that of the elves in the Shire) that leave much to be desired, but overall I think this is a wonderful adaptation, and it comes highly recommended.That said, I also urge everyone to listen to the BBC version and watch all the films as well. Each is but an interpretation of Tolkien's master works, and each will embrace the tale from a different angle. Then decide which is your own favorite and enjoy it!P.S. Since writing this review I have re-listened to the series on CD and I can now understand some of the problems which people have with the production. The remastering job that TME did for release on CD is almost criminal, IMO. This version is, to me, quite beautiful, and why TME didn't spend the time (and money) to do the job right is beyond me. My tape versions (though lacking some material) from the mid 80's do not suffer from the same problems. Most of these are off speed sections where the source tape is either running too fast or too slow (witness the section where Gandalf confronts Saruman at Orthanc). While I still love the version, I wish The Mind's Eye did as much. -DNV"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I first read this in 1974. Over the years I may have re-read the entire trilogy nearly twenty times. The tale &quot;grows in the telling&quot;.This is a sprawling, epochal morality tale. The sheer amount of work that J.R.R. Tolkien poured into this belies its' status as a labor of love. What Tolkien expected from this work is unknown to me, however given that it is approaching its' THIRTIETH printing as of this writing (01/2002) speaks for itself.You have reluctant heroes, villains (overt and secret), magic, terror, small quiet lands and immense empires, love, fear, friendship and the classic struggle of good versus evil all against a backdrop of an epic struggle.The fictional world of Middle Earth constructed by Tolkien has well stood the passing of the years and even his own passing in 1973.

While I could write a review of the actual story, so many people have done it, and in these few words I could add no insight.

Now that I have grown to truly appreciate beautiful books, I decided to purchase the Collector's Edition of LOTR.It is a beautifully crafted printing - a truly flawless copy of a flawless story. I have checked through the entire book and it has no mistakes. While it is a thing of beauty, do not purchase it to sit on your shelf. It is a book, and thus deserves to be read. In this case, it also deserves to be red.A great gift and a great purchase for yourself. I hope to have the opportunity to pass it on to my children, that they may love and cherish it as I do. It is the only edition of the book that will last that long.A great edition of a great book by a great author; never a greater combination has the earth seen."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"There have been two dramatizations of The Lord of the Rings available for over 20 years now. One is the Mind's Eye which is essentially the American version and the other is a BBC production made in England. In short, the Mind's Eye production is very poor in both performance and sound quality. Listening to Gandalf and Sauruman speak to each other in one episode was like listening to two demented elderly people exchange pointless barbs in a nursing home. It was stunningly bad.In comparison, the BBC production is marvelous. With at least two Shakepearean actors who have been knighted for their acting virtuousity, Ian Holm and Michael Hordern, the BBC version is awash in fine acting. Peter Woodthorpe portrayal of Gollum is inimitable. Brian Sibley also does a superb job of writing the play. He did such a good job, he was asked to consult on the film version that Peter Jackson just directed. Did you like the film? Then buy the BBC dramatization.It took me years to find the BBC version to buy. Only the Mind's Eye version was available in the United States for years, nay, decades. In the end, I was forced to buy the BBC version in London itself. How times have changed. Now companies offer both productions -- Mind's Eye and BBC. Do yourself and your family a favor. If you are going to buy any Tolkein dramatization at all, but the BBC version written by Brian Sibley. It is marvelous."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have read this trilogy at least three times since I was a boy. It is a wonderful book for getting through rough spots, since it literally transports you to another world. I used to regard the trilogy as probably the best work of fantasy fiction ever written, but still fiction. Then I read an account where Tolkien claimed that he wrote most of this work &quot;automatically.&quot; He claimed that it just flowed to him (he had no idea from where) but that he definately had the feeling that he was recording events that had actually happened. That would explain the inspired nature of the work. Perhaps &quot;Middle Earth&quot; really exists, perhaps it is the middle ground between our dull earth and higher realms....As for this specific edition, I have wanted it for twenty years and apparently thanks to the popularity of the movie I can finally treat myself to it. This is a story that deserves to be housed between guilt leather covers."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This book is a must have for LOTR fans. It looks simple too great.

There is no finer book in my collection, from cover to leaf to print. The corrections improve the content as well, so from any angle this revised edition is a cornerstone in the world of Tolkien. I can't say enough about it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Of coarse you know by now that The Lord of the Rings trilogy is THE most magnetizing fantasy story in the history of literature. That claim is irrefutable and defendable by those of us who have substantially read fantasy literature throughout our lives. That reason alone is justification for owning this most elaborate ternion.By the way, in this edition all three books are combined in a single volume, so no more purchases after this one is necessary.This particular edition offers the reader the artistic inventiveness of illustrator Allen Lee. Mr. Lee, who won an Oscar for conceptualizing The Lord of the Rings motion pictures, adds a visual component to Tolkien's written word, and imaginatively captures the spirit of this adventuresome and perilous universe. This is a big plus for all you LOTR movie fans. When you examine these illustrations, some of them will be immediately recognizable from the scenes used in the movies.One last thing to add: To those who have watched the movies but not read the trilogy, take heed. While the movies were fantastic, the books are even better!!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"My advise to anyone who loves this book. Buy a paperback edition you can drag around with you wherever you go. This isn't a book you read in a day or two.

I confess i read this book after watching the first Lord of the Rings movie becouse i wanted to know if Orlando Bloom's character died.... But after i read the first 5 pages i was hooked! I took it wherever i went....(except the shower) Every time i could read it even for 3 min i did and when it was over i wanted more! yes, me the all time horror book fan that dosen't read anything thats not by Stephin King, Ann Rice or anyone of the sort.You start off with Frodo and his amazing strenth against evil. Theres Sam whose love for Frodo puts him in the very center of danger yet he never looks back. Theres Aragorn who is afraid of where he might end up if he makes the same decision his ancestor made. And then theres Legolas (my favorite of corse) who is amazingly strong, handsom, loyal, handsom, agile, did i mention handsom? and theres so many more characters and so much excitment that it's just amazing if your willing to put the book down so you can sleep.If this is your type of book than you'll love it. if your into history books you'll love it and even if this is your first ever fiction book (or your first non horror book) well then you'll still love it! its a winner all around....Moral of story it's the best book ever for anyone. Dont beleive me? than buy it and see for yourself!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring tells the story of the Hobbit Frodo Baggins and of how he discovers that the invisibility ring handed down to him by his uncle Bilbo is in fact the One Ring of Power, the most dangerous of artifacts, forged by the evil lord Sauron to ensnare all the peoples of Middle-Earth and bent them to his will. It has to be destroyed! Following Gandalf the old Wizard's advice, Frodo leaves his quiet Hobbit hole in the Shire and with three of his friends, makes for Rivendell to seek the Elves' counsel. There he volunteers to be the Ring-Bearer, the one who must destroy the Ring by casting into the very fire in which it was forged, in the furnaces of Mount Doom. With eight companions, he sets off on a most perilous quest, over mountains and under them, on rivers and through forests beautiful beyond words, to the heart of Mordor.The adventure goes on in The Two Towers. The Fellowship has just been broken, and as the Hobbits Merry and Pippin are captured by Orcs to be brought to the traitor wizard Saruman, now the ally of Sauron, Frodo and his friend Sam are slowly making their way through desolate plains and treacherous bogs, to Mordor. Soon they realize that Gollum, a nasty creature who once possessed the Ring, is following them. Captured, and still under the irresistible lure of the Ring, the twisted wretch agrees to become their guide to the forsaken land. Meanwhile Aragorn the Heir of Kings, Legolas the Elf and Gimli the Dwarf are running across the grassy plains of Rohan, the domain of the Rohirrim horse masters, to rescue Merry and Pippin and later help Th&eacute;oden, King of Rohan, defend his people against Saruman's army in the battle of Helm's Deep.In The Return of the King, as Frodo and Sam are ineluctably treading closer to the heart of danger, putting the goal of their quest in jeopardy every day a little bit more as Frodo's mind threatens to give in to the power of the Ring, Aragorn and his companions must defend the beautiful white city of Minas Tirith, capital of Gondor, in a hopeless struggle against Sauron's reckless army of berserkers.How does one go about writing a review of such a masterpiece, now that The Lord of the Rings is not only the second most read book of the twentieth century (after the Bible), but also a blockbuster movie trilogy? How does one do it justice? One just can't. That's it, I admit defeat. I simply lack superlatives to describe the tidal waves of emotions that overwhelm me each time I read this book. So I'll just say this: read it. And re-read it. And again.The Lord of the Rings is timeless, atemporal. Even though Tolkien himself was notoriously not fond of allegories, I can't help seeing that, in these dark and sad days of our time, it stands as a beacon, a bright message of peace, telling us that even when evil and fear threatens to drown us all, there's still hope... May it be tomorrow's Bible."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I loved these books - 15 years ago - now - and I am sure I'll still love to read them in 20 years from now. I have read LOTR in German and English but like the detail in the original English version better. Tolkiens LOTR is timeless. It is about good and evil - which we'll face in every century of our time and can relate to.

If you are tired of science fiction, you will definitely enjoy this gripping, magical and exiting trilogy. I can guarrantee, that you have never read anything similar. I was reading it at the noisiest place I'd ever been, but I didn't hear a sound, for I was so wrapped in it. My advice: before reading the book, see some photos of the main characters from the movies (e. g. on www.lordoftherings.net), and after finishing the reading, watch the movies then. In this way, you won't know the contents, but it becomes more interesting for you and, having read the trilogy, it'll be easier to understand the movies."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Way better than Harry Potter. The Lord of the Rings (leatherette edition) is the perfect book for an adult or a child. This book is good for a die-hard Lord of the Rings fan. This book is definitly worth the [money]. There are many maps and some drawings. There is a large fold out map in the back for referance. Use the map to trace the path of the fellowship. This book is a very good thing to give for birthdays and holidays...I have read the trilogy more than 10 times. What is interesting is the fact that Tolkien (the author of the book) originally wrote the so called trilogy as a 6 book, 3 volume work. The leatherette edition gives you a 3 in 1 volume book. Well, what are you waiting for. Go and buy the book...While your at it. Buy The Hobbit leatherette edition (The prequle to the Lord of the Rings series). Trust me. The book is great."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Let me start with the fact that I am a HUGE fan of the LOTR movies. I would like everyone to know however, that the books came BEFORE the movies! I am glad to see that a set of Tolkein books are offered that don't have the pictures from the movies on them.Of course, I wouldn't complain to look at Viggo Mortenson or Orlando Bloom, but I am a purist! These books are better with Tolkein-esque covers."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"How often do you come across a book that can be awarded the title of greatest book ever? Not often.This is one of those that can be awarded this title.Some people complain about the figurative language and the lengthy descriptions. So what.Tolkien spent his entire life coming up with this world. His last book was published after his death. The story is not what's important. It's the world that he created. The lengthy descriptions make the world real. The descriptions are so detailed that it almost seems that this could be a history of our world before recorded history. To create a world that's what you need to do.And yet, the story is very good as well. It's exciting and suspensful. The battles are some of the most exciting scenes in literary history. The villains (Nazgul, Shelob) are frightening.Yet, the essence of the story goes deeper then that. The story presents powerful themes of despair and courage. Tolkien created a world that was much better than ours.After his expierience in the First World War, Tolkien needed a fantasy. He needed a better world with qualities that our world is sorely lacking...A world of honor...A world of courage...A world of hope...A world of life, beauty, and song.Tokien brought these things into real life. Very few others can do this."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Kindle version of The Lord of the Rings contains the complete trilogy as well as maps and a detailed appendix.

With the Kindle reader for my iPhone I can read a little when ever I have a some down time."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Wiser reviewers than I have written better than I could hope to. Heck, this trilogy (and other Tolkien creations) are college courses on many prestigious campuses. And yet, I still have to comment because this world created by Tolkien has left such a stamp on my taste.I found Bilbo, quickly followed by Frodo, in the 5th grade and never looked back as I followed them into a world populated by Dwarves, Orcs, and Elves. In a very real sense I stepped out that door with Bilbo and found adventures and terrors that have rarely been matched and never been outdone.I have been a regular reader of the trilogy ever since, coming back time and again and never failing to come away with some new enjoyment. At first it was simply the fascination with the sheer fantasy: The characters, The settings, The battles. Then the depth of his world pulled me in. I often found myself reading the glossary and studying the various languages and histories of the races for hours before re-reading the story. And then again after because I didn't want to say good-bye so soon. Finally, well past my own innocence I began to see new complexities and allegories that have only served to deepen my appreciation for this modern myth that Tolkien created.But always and above all else, it was simply the story. Yes Tolkien was an incredibly gifted writer but he, too me, was first and foremost a fantastic story teller. And whenever I want to leave the academic exercises behind, go back to the 5th grade, and lose myself in a great tale, Frodo is always there waiting."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This review is specifically for the audiobook version of The Lord of the Rings, read by Rob Inglis. Over the course of almost a year, I've worked my way through The Hobbit and then the full LOTR trilogy on audiobook during my commute. These are the best audiobooks I've ever heard. The narrator has an excellent voice and makes this epic story come alive. My only complaint at all is that the \\"chapters\\" are a little long, which can make it hard to find the right place if I accidentally fast-forward to the next chapter. It's a small quibble in the face of a really excellent work of art, though. I'll be listening to the full audiobook series again in the future."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Before I begin I should mention this is a review f the Kindle version, not the hardcover or audio. The LotR series is an irrefutably amazing piece of literature. The Lord of the Rings thrives even three quarters of a century later for god reason, with references evverywhere from TV to my Language Arts textbook.I won't say too much more on how grea the actual book is, because you can find that anywhere. In all honesty, I bought this because I knew it would be good, but also simply because it was long. I'll zip through most good books in a weekend, and boring books in one sitting because I feel the need to finish them or a month because I can't get into them. The Lord of the Rings series is the first I can even remember that kept me interested for a whole week. It's not that after tha I lost interest,I was just finished with all three. This is a perfect choice for people like me who read books quickly and want somethinglong enough and with enough depth to really get into.Another geat thing about LotR is how it keeps you imterested for a long time. Even after finishing the series, I still have a minor obsession with it: I watch third age total war videos, I read fanfics, and I play LotR Online. It's just got such a devoted fan base, and for a reason. It seems impossible (at least for me) to get bored with it.In summary, I cannot recommend this purchase enough. On Kindle it's only ten dollars, though I'd be willing to pay twice that for each book if I had to. Anyway, I've to start rereading them now if I'm going to finish in a timely manner, so before I go I'll just say: BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Nice idea to present the trilogy in one volume for a good price. Edited well, and good layout. And, of course, it is one of the great books you will ever read. The world Tolkien creates is amazingly complete. The characters are who they are, almost all of whom are dramatically different at the end of the story than they were at the beginning. We have brave men, and a few brave women, (men meaning males of all species), who sacrifice everything to stop the ultimate evil. While Tolkien said it was not about World War II, you can take it that way and add a layer to the story, intended or not. If you haven't read it, you need to. If you haven't read it lately, you need to do it again. I re-read it every other year, and find it grows on me with the reading. ;-)"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is the only unabridged reading of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy out there.

The gilded pages and high-quality leather look, smell and feel wonderful. This is not the questionable quality leather used on previous versions, this is the real deal. More importantly, this version has, as J.R.R. recorded in letters, reproductions of the Book of Marzubul. These are the pages from the Dwarven book found in the Mines of Moria by Gandalf and the Fellowship. In the begining and ending of the book are also included maps that fold out to render Middle-earth for the reader, again as the author originally wanted.This is the book that Tolkien dreamed of having published but couldn't due to the realities of post-WWII publishing costs and questions about a 400,000 word publication.For me, there is an emtoional response to this book for two reasons. One, it is as fine or better than the book the author originally wished to have published and two, it is a beautiful piece of art all on its own, suitable for display. If you love books or love Tolkien or both, this is a must have and the centerpiece of any worthy collection.(Some are commenting that the book isn't actually leather. Be sure to check your version as there are others available, but the information provided to me stated my copy was leather and if it is fake, it fooled me.)"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is not a review of Tolkien's &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Its having been voted &quot;The Greatest Book of the Millenium&quot; here on Amazon.com says more than enough about the worth of Tolkien's work. Rather, it is a review of the several hardcover editions of this fantastic story.There are for major hardcover editions of LOTR, all published by Houghton Mifflin Co. They are essentially the same price, so I will not take that into consideration.The best of the editions (5 stars) is the blue Alan Lee illustrated version printed in Nov 1991. I have owned this book for several years, and read it three times. It is durable, beautiful, and has no flaws that I have found. The illustrations are wonderful, though most Tolkien fans will have seen these pictures before.The red edition printed in Nov 1974 is also a solid edition of the book (4 stars). It is every bit as good as the blue version, but does not have the illustrations. If you are the type of reader that prefers to leave everything to your imagination, this is the version for you.Both the blue and red versions have matching editions of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; (Houghton Mifflin, Sep 1997 or Oct 1973, respectively). I found both of these editions to be satisfactory.The other two major editions of LOTR - the white three-volume edition from Oct 1988 and the black seven-volume edition from Jan 2000 - are not recommended (2 stars). The print quality in both is poor, and the durability is less than that of the red and blue versions. The only advantage of these editions is portability, as the red and blue versions are single-volume and quite hefty.Ramble on...."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"...This item is the The Lord of the Rings Trilogy as narrated by Rob Inglis.

Well worth the cost."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is a particularly beautiful edition of The Lord of the Rings (ISBN: 0618260587 ), and is probably best suited for someone who is already a fan of the book, rather than for someone who is reading the book for the first time.The format of this edition is larger than most books tend to be making it very difficult to read in any position other than sitting upright holding the book on your lap or on a desk. Each of the three volumes features a beautiful glossy dust jacket and is filled with a dozen or so full color illustrations by the famous Alan Lee.My main problem with this edition, besides the weight and size of the books, is that the pages containing text are glossy paper. The glare caused by this type of glossy paper make it a little irritating on the eyes when reading for long stretches of time. It would have been much nicer had they published this edition with matte paper for the text and saved the glossy solely for the illustrations.If you are a fan of Alan Lee's artwork, and don't necessarily intend on READING this edition, though, this is a great piece to pick up and will most likely be the type of book you end up treasuring for years to come -- even if it isn't the one you give your kids to read."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Super fantastic! I have read the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" (LotR) trilogy eight times. I think that Peter Jackson's movies are the best to day. I think that the 13-hour BBC production is the best radio play to date. Although this 55-hour 46-CD set is the only unabridged audio book for LotR, I doubt that it could be surpassed.Inglis does an excellent job at articulation and dramatization, giving different intonation and mannerisms to different characters. It really is as if you were reading the book.The recording is very good. The CDs performed well. The packaging is excellent, in a cardboard case, with three cardboard boxes, each with three liners that can hold up to four CDs each.One thing that I liked about this is that each track is around three minutes long. This is great for when you have to stop and pick up later -- especially if your portable CD player does not remember the track!Another thing that I liked was the lack of dynamic range. Yes, the lack of it. The loudness is very even across a wine range of topics. This is especially important when listening in the car or with headphones, typically in noisy environment. With some other products, I was constantly turning the volume up and down. Not with this set. However, the performance of the reading did not suffer at all because of this. That is great!This should be in every library of LotR fans, especially those that travel a lot and want to listen while on the go. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have read The Lord of the Rings countless times and have always enjoyed it. I have listened to, and enjoyed, the BBC &quot;radio play&quot; version, but this unabridged reading by Rob Ingles was far superior. To say that Rob Ingles &quot;reads&quot; the book misses the point. He ACTS the book, and he is wonderful. Each character has his own voice, his own mannerisms of speech. The songs are sung and stories are told, not just read. By listening, you are cast into the world of Middle Earth. You are along for each moment of the journey, each excrutiating step of the bearer's quest.Listening to this story read aloud brings the full richness and complexity of this timeless tale to life. It has been a wonderful experience. I know I will listen to this time and time again.Plus. . . It's worth the whole price just to hear Gandalf's voice!!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"First off this review is about this edition only. The three volume box set 2002 illustrated by Alan Lee.If you are reading this, I am sure your questions are is this worth the money given that I probably have a set or an edition of LOTR already. For me the answer was yes.I highly recommend this. The quality is top-notch. I was concerned because some of the reviewers seem to say that it is hard to read and or blotchy ink. It has neither of these problems.It is on very nice, very clean, very white paper with a large font. The books are substantial even bordering on heavy. They have beautiful red cloth covers with the J.R.R.T. symbol in gold. The dust jackets are beautiful with a different Alan Lee print on the cover, back, and spine.The box is very nice with Bilbo's trolls and an elven ship leaving the Grey Heavens on the front and back.The prints are all watercolors and they take up a whole page. Love them. I have always been partial to Alan Lee's work. Is it worth the $50 roughly you can find the box set for? Depends. If you do not have a nice hardback version of LOTR I would say for sure get this. The prints are delightful, the printing is great and very readable and it looks awesome on the table between the no admittance bookends. I love it and say it is worth it for sure.There is a one volume book with the same illustrations by Alan Lee. I think this is vastly superior as the books here are easier to handle, the three dust jackets are each suberb, and the box is very nice. Alan Lee is a great with watercolors and they are produced very well with these books. I think the high contrast of the print makes it easier to read. Think of this as a great work of art. First Tolkien's art. Second Lee's art. Third the art of printing a good crips text. All 3 come together here for a neat package that you will treasure for years or decades."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is not a critique of Tolkien's work; rather it is a condemnation of Houghton Mifflin's hardcover boxed set. Thirty years after first reading &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; I decided to read it again. Besides the engrossing and detailed story, I had a renewed interest in the technical aspects of Tolkien's craft and his use of the English language. I am not disappointed and I am enjoying the reading immensely.I bought the Hardcover Boxed edition published October, 1988, by Houghton Mifflin Co (Trd); ISBN: 0395489326 ; because I wanted a high quality, permanent copy with good typesetting and larger print. When I received this particular edition I was shocked at the extremely poor quality of print and generally poor quality of every aspect of the presentation. In two of the volumes the maps are incorrectly bound so that they are impossible to unfold. It is not even possible to cut the map out of the book because important parts of the middle of it have been sewn up in the binding.But the damning point of this edition is the printed page. Every single page has both drop outs and extra ink everywhere. The printing weight varies from page to page, at times fading to a medium gray, at other times a dense bold face. I am not exaggerating when I proclaim that most paperbacks are printed more carefully and more clearly than this.Buy the books, read them and enjoy them.

This one had a whole signature [one group of pages] with a tear at the top edge.I returned that and got a third copy. This one seems OK, but the pages are not centered in the hard cover. Its rather dissatisfying, but I think I will keep it.The publisher should take their printer/binder to task. Three strikes in three pitches is unacceptable for what is a very expensive edition to begin with.BTW all three copies had glue that overflowed onto the inside cover pages.

Enjoy..."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I first read Tolkien's masterpiece when I was 11 years old in secondary school from the library; I was instantly hooked and have re-read it a few more times, the latest being about 5 years ago (I'm 26) and each time I read it, it appears fresh and there is always something new to be savoured and discovered. The language Tolkien uses is superb and very noble and elegant, biblical almost, and it is language unfortunately not seen very often in more modern books.The central plot of the book is a wonderful battle of Good versus Evil but the real delight is in the myriad characters and landscapes inhabited by all sorts of mythical creatures that Tolkien so evocatively describes in his amazing world. Parts of the book are deeply comic, moving, tragic, exciting, joyous...The cast of main characters is also epic: Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Gandalf, Boromir, Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas....etc. etc.! Each of these is different...Anyway, I have read quite a few other fantasy works since then as I am an avid reader and I can honestly say that, at least in my experience, no fantasy book comes near Tolkien's magnus opus in terms of scope, greatness, characterisation, grandeur; in fact, most are plane rip-offs of Tolkien! The only other fictional work I have read which is comparable is Dune by Frank Herbert but even that is not quite as good!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Add illustrations by Alan Lee, co-illustrator of Faeries with Brian Froud. Truly stunning artwork. With this first edition including Lee's artwork, one should buy the volume for the collectibility value alone. Unforgetable artwork to accompany an unforgetable story of the most unlikely heroes!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This book, in my opinion, is the Bible of fantasy. No one should ever be denied the chance to read it. The LOTR will pick you up and sweep you off your feet. Read it today and you'll discover what you've been missing all your life. You'll love it, just like I did."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"About a month back I picked up me a copy of The Lord of The Rings. I could not believe how unbelievable this book unraveled to be. From the very beginning where Bilbo announces his eleventy first birthday, to the end where Gandalf, Frodo, and Bilbo journey to the havens, I was hooked. I found myself staying away from the book with about 50 pages left because I didn't want to end it. If you have not read this, get off your computer and go buy this book now. Gandalf is the man!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Reading it again at this moment. Can't stop. Lights out at two in the morning but eager to read on when I wake up. Well, five minutes just before leaving for work. Etc. You can't deny it: it holds you by the throat. The masterly thing of course is the combination of a true quest and fantasy. It's a created world you love to crawl into. Like a hobbit in elfcloths you are a invincible participant."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This book is truly the best piece of fantasy ever written. The plot is rich, heavy and vibrant, full of subtalities and esoteric undercurrents. The characters feel as if they were flesh and blood, and not just ink and paper. They experience internal and external anguish, fear, doubt and sorrow. In esence, they appear to be actually living, not just existing for the transient amusement of the reader, only to be extinguished as the pages are closed. Every thing is placed in a living, coharant, world, which Tolkien took great pains to construct and populate. Overall, this book is required reading for anyone even remotly intrested in literature, and fantasy."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I first started reading Tolkien when I was really young, and the first book of his that I read was The Hobbit. I loved it. Then a few years later, I came upon The Lord of the Rings. Needles to say, I was not dissapointed. Now I am a big TV and videogame junky, and I'm not afraid to admit it; however, The Lord of the Rings completely blows away any fictional creation that I have come in contact with, and that's saying a lot. Now, you may have doubts, when you read or hear others' opinions, but take my word on this: if you like reading good literature, or if you like fantasy, then you can't miss this book. In fact, this book is so good that it should be mandatory reading for all human beings. Seriously. This is humanity's greatest work of art."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"These are the best books I've ever read. Hands down. Salvatore's good, the others are good, but you just can't top Tolkien. I've read the other reviews, and this racist crap and &quot;too hard to Read&quot; is just stupid. Don't even give a care of these people, if they choose not to enjoy these wonderful books because of their squabbles with so called &quot;racism&quot; by Tolkien and such, that's their problem. Literary work at its finest!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Anyone who says ..&quot;this makes no sense&quot; or &quot;Where are the women&quot;,or &quot;it\`s too long&quot; or the ognorant fool who said it was racist HAVENT BOTHERED TO READ THE ENTIRE STORY... this STORY doesnt begin and end with this series...If you read all Tolkiens other books you will understand what you read here. This book HAD to come out first even though it wasnt started first.If you don\`t read all the other Tolkien books you won\`t really understand what you\`re reading in the LoR or you &quot;...may mistake the meaning...&quot;of what you read in it.These books are about Spirituality, about Pride, Family, GOD... Most Tolkien fans who have read the others have read them all dozens of times each. A new lesson / adventure / revelation each time."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The colossal amount of reviews on this book is one thing, but the fact that most of them award The Lord of the Rings 5 stars speaks for itself. 5 stars is sadly not enough to reflect the sheer brilliance of Tolkien's epic, which is perfect in every way and readable to both fans of fantasy books and those who have never read a fantasy book in their life. I am one of those people, whose first fantasy novel was The Hobbit (forced on me by my brother) about a year ago, and I was surprised to enjoy it. I then set upon TLotR, which took me three months to read. By the end I felt: 1) &quot;Why didn't I read this sooner,&quot; and 2) &quot;I should not have read this so soon, because no book on earth (or middle-earth) could possibly surpass it.&quot;A previous reviewer talked about the underlying racism they took from TLotR when they read it. I noticed the white/black, good/evil stereotyping as well, but you have to remember that 1) this is a fantasy world we're talking about, and while parts of it are applicable to our lives as Tolkien states in his introduction, I doubt someone who created dozens of different species resembling everything from humans to trees and giant spiders, was too preoccupied with clear definitions of colour equalling good or evil... and 2) books must be judged in their context, and this was written in the 1940s/50s when JRR Tolkien would not have been concerned with racial stereotyping, which authors today go out of their way to avoid.This book has been voted Best of the Century for a reason: it IS the best. No novel before it or since has matched the level of imagination, plot complexity and background storytelling Tolkien manages here. It is as if it is not a fictional work at all, just a history book from another, much older, world.Above all, the book is an immensely enjoyable read. The characters are varied and nicely rounded, the action moves along steadily (slowly as well, but then it is a slow journey), the writing is stylish and vivid, and not only are we drawn into the land Tolkien has created but we start to believe it is real...This book is absolutely outstanding and if it takes you all your life to read it you will not be disappointed. Start immediately."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Tolkein is the epitomy of fantasy. Anybody who reads fantasy has to read this book. To say that you are a fan of fantasy is a hypocrisy if you haven't. I read it when I was 13 and then twice more later on in my teenage years and I keep finding things that I missed the first times. There are no fantasy books out there that could even be put in the same category as The Lord of the Rings!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"..the amazing part is when this was first written and published. What DID the reviewers first think of this book? I did find the book occasionally dragged, and that their where episodes that seemed to be digressions (like the Tom Bombadil episode). But all in all it was a great tale. Perhaps the best part, to me, was the geographical nature of the place, and the history. Tolkien really does bring Middle Earth to life with his descriptions and his maps and the 'historical' context of the tale (For those versed in geography and history its fun speculating if there are connections with real places and historical periods). Although Tolkien was a scholar of archaic language and myth the book has absolutly no feel of the antiquarian to it.I would recommend this book not so much as a fantasy but as something more akin to the sci-fi of Ursula Leguin in its ability to conjure a world."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"cboerens@ford.com writes:Everyone survives in it.Excuse me?For one, Boromir, one of the Fellowship, dies, as does Frodo's foil, Gollum.Tolkien's opinion was that Good will conquer Evil, but always at heavy cost to Good. Frodo may not have died, but he is left stricken and pained -- and in the end, all of the Old leaves Middle-Earth -- Frodo, Bilbo, Gandalf, the Elves, and so on -- a spiritual death."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Tolkiens' book challenges the imagination of the reader to climb to the pinnacles of the Misty Mountains, to cross the Land of Shadow, to strive from Barrad-dur to Minas Tirith, and to delve into the very hearts of its many characters. A truly epic work is one that sucessfully combines high adventure, catharsis and dynamic characterization. Tolkien sets the standard with what C.S. Lewis called visions that &quot;burn like fire or pierce like cold iron.&quot; Here are true heroes leaping from Tolkiens' mind and medieval Britain onto the page for the reader. A cunning linguist of such times, his passages flow like poetry, so that like a master's symphony, no word is out of place. The Oxford scholar has succeeded in writing the definitive fantasy novels that still stand as firm and brilliant today as when they were penned fifty years ago."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"That a gray Oxford don, a Professor of English, no less, could have such a rich inner life as to write Lord of the Rings is bewildering, befuddling. It would be no less surprising to learn than Margaret Thatcher writes funny childrens' books, or that Sly Stallone dresses like an Orthodox Jew and plays Grandmaster-level chess in Central Park now and then.There is no explanation, of course. Even Humphrey Carpenter, Tolkien's biographer, seemed adrift when he tried to penetrate past the outer veils of Tolkien's mines of the imagination.The book is too long. Whole chunks of it read like unconscious parody; other parts are altogether too priggish to please modern audiences. And yet the books still hold. Why?I like to think it's because of the fecundity of Tolkien's imagination. His prose may be purplish and precious, and his plotting may sometimes plod, but these books, to paraphrase Walt Whitman, contain multitudes -- multitudes of multitudes.Read them for that."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's &quot;Lord of Rings&quot; is the best set of books I have ever read, along with the Hobbit. Thats all thanks. Add three more stars please."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Lord of the Rings is by far the best work in fantasy literature. I have tried to read other books of the genre, and none can compare to The Lord of the Rings. Most of the others, in fact, have their basis in this book, the definitive novel of the fantasy genre, and are too childish or silly to give a second glance. This book was original when it first came out, and it is a monumental work: the author even created languages, which he uses at points within the novel. All the main characters are unforgettable: Frodo Baggins, Gandalf, Sam Gamgee, and especially the villain, the Dark Lord Sauron. It's a beautiful book; it begins in a cozy, peaceful atmosphere, which is threatened by distant trouble brewing. By the time it is finished, that trouble has blown up in your face. It is epic, and it is sad, too. I truly felt sorry that this world that Tolkien had created, of Elves and Hobbits and Dwarves, was just beginning to fade away by the end of the book. If you like fantasy, you must read this."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"There are not enough stars above, nor enough space here below to do this achingly beautiful world justice. From the comic tea party of The Hobbit to the tear invoking ending at the Havens this is truly the greatest story put on paper.Let us share this wonderful tale with our friends and family.

This book will make your heart swell, your mind expand, your eyes widen, and your every dream come true. Im saying this because before I read The Hobbit I had no desire to read, in fact I could not even keep my attention on a book for more than a minute. When my 8th grade teacher gave me a copy of The Hobbit I found that I could not put it down I read it three times. My thirst for Tolkien books had begun. I found myself reading The Lord of the Rings. I was forever changed, this book is by far the most influential book ever. It ranks up to the Bible,Romeo &amp; Juliet, Dune, and One Flew Over The Cuckoos ."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I cannot easily put into words my love for this great romance. It is a perfect creation which will never be equalled. In the past twelve years I have read it at least thirty times; it never loses its ability to enchant, and I continually find things I have missed on previous trips, albeit a simple appreciation of a subtle phrase. Tolkien was nothing short of a genius; Middle Earth is a complete creation -- a true world with real inhabitants, languages, traditions, etc. The characters are well-worn, familiar, and three-dimensional. One cannot do better than this for a good, thought-provoking read. Only one warning: do not read too much into it! Tolkien writes: &quot;As for any inner meaning or 'message', it has in the intention of the author none. It is neither allegorical nor topical.&quot; Students of literature (I am guilty of this), theorists, and critical apparatus need not &quot;apply.&quot; Good reading, friends!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Such a brilliant piece of literature, I cannot even begin to put it into words"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"One morning about 15 years ago I was lying in bed sick and decided I wasn't really up to reading anything more complicated than a simple children's story.

I enjoyed it so much that I decided to try the sequel, the Lord of the Rings, a book that I had heard about over the years but had never thought would be the sort of book I would enjoy. After all it's for children, isn't it? At 5.00am the next morning I got to &quot;the grey havens&quot;, the superbly written final chapter. I have read it once or twice a year since then.

Your review is irrelevant to the majority of this product's intended market (people who have already fallen in love with Tolkien and his world). I think it's true that some people should have the right to dislike it, if only for the reason that the book isn't their style. But those who dislike it ought not feel the obligation to criticize and attempt to convince others of their opinion. Anything that has a geek following is easy to dismiss, but I would encourage you to dismiss the geeks, not the subject of their worship. You seem eager to criticize, and I think it would be in your best interest to focus on things you like and enjoy. Think happy thoughts. If you don't like the book, that's fine. Don't rant to the crowd that does. Your opinion is obviously not shared by the 100 million readers of Tolkien's masterpiece. Why don't you sit down to the movies if your lack of concentration skills can't handle a full book? It might suit you better."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I know its popular to praise Tolkien as something like the God of Fantasy, but I have to dsagree. Although he did have a major hand in starting the fantasy genre (he really isn't the creator), and his books are good, their not flawless.Its true he has written a compelling series. the world is beautifully drawn and the epic involves you. The language is well-constructed and lyrical. The major strength of the series is its theme. Although Tolkien claims otherwise, his quest can be interpreted to have allegorical meanings. In my own reading, the Ring symblolizes technology, which all want; (but in Tolkien's view, and this view is apparent in his other writings) however it also corrupts. There is a beauty in the theme.There are however, numerous problems. The series is highly Eurocentric (hm.. Proud, strong, light Northerners like Aragorn; weak, corrupt dark Southerners and Easterners like the Easterlings). Not only this but Tolkien's literature is highly nostalgic and yearning for a better past when 'giants' (as in heroes) walked the land. Tolkien apparently detested change which is inevitable. And change is certainly not all bad. His characters are always bursting into song and telling great tales of the PAST while the great deeds being done at present are largely ignored or downplayed.Most annoying though, was the change of style. The beginning starts out like the Hobbit, in the sort of style that children's tales have (Tolkien even addresses the reader directly sometimes, a device almost exclusively confined to children's books or confessionals). Midway through the first book, the tone abruptly changes and we are left with a darker (and more suitable) tone that continues to grow darker and drearier. By the time Frodo was getting near Mordor I felt like kicking him, I was so tired of the author's continuous description him as weary, weak, tired, half-dead.The ending too was highly nostalgic which may be beautiful for a while but quickly grows tedious. Not a single ray of optimism shone as the Elves departed to leave the world for Man.Although this book is a must-read for fantasy enthusiasts, don't fall into the cult and think of Tolkien as the incomparable God of Fantasy without thinking about the book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"- quality of the printing...excellent- quality of the binding...good- usefulness for actual reading...poor.

Tolkien was born in 1892 and died at age 81 in 1973. He was an author, a teacher, a philologist, and an icon for people who love to read fantasy books. His first book was The Hobbit, which was very popular when it came out in 1937. Then he started on the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, which became legendary all over the world.The book The Fellowship of the Ring is about a young hobbit named Frodo who inherits a ring that has unusual powers. It first fell into the hands of Gollum, a creature who dwelled in the dark worshipping the ring, calling it \\"his precious\\". Then it fell into the hands of plump little Bilbo Baggins, Frodo's cousin. After many years, it was handed down to Frodo. When Frodo learned of its powers, he set off on a journey to seek fortune and adventure, as well as to destroy the ring. Through hardships and pain, Frodo and his friends travel across middle earth, encountering many un-natural things. To find out more, read the book!I thought the book was fantastic; I give it a 9.5 out of 10. I was impressed by the quality of the writing, how descriptive it was, and how different all of the concepts were from how we live. It sure got me hooked! It was a challenging read, but it was worth it. I recommend it for experienced readers, because the book is 398 pages long. This book relates to the Hobbit, which my dad read to me when I was little. If you love fantasy, the Fellowship of the Ring is the right book for you. I am now moving on to the second book in the trilogy, The Two Towers."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Tolkien has amazed me with his language and literature. The Lord of the Rings is just one of many examples of his superb ability as an author. The Silmarillion, The Hobbit, as well as The Histories of Middle Earth are all great books, but none can compare with the characterization, plot, and setting of the Lord of the Rings.In this book, the use of characters and their roles in the overall effect of the book is outstanding. Not only the protagonists, but also the antagonists, make up the foundation of Tolkien's land known as Middle Earth. I was amazed at the characterization and the depth at which Tolkien displays each and every character. The book portrays the ideal story of good versus evil, the story of an innocent character shaped and developed by the trials of reality and the unknown world.I am not one who usually gives five stars to a book, but this novel deserves more than five. I recommend this book to any reader in search for a story of adventure, action, and magic. Five stars, well earned."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I'm very pleased with this book. It's beautiful leather book (with leather box) in great quality.

It would seem nearly no detail has been ignored. One minor complaint is that the maps (of which there are two in this book) are a bit awkward to fold out but this is quickly overlooked when compared to the other thoughtful details.

Tolkien was not the first or most critically-acclaimed fantasy writer, he remains the most beloved and influential, even though \\"Lord of the Rings\\" is decades old.Now with the epic movie trilogy based on this book, new waves of readers are discovering the unique power of the \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" Tolkien's classic is a timeless tale of good and evil, written in a detailed, powerful style, set in a fictional world of staggering detail and haunting beauty.Following up on events in \\"The Hobbit,\\" \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" opens with the hobbit Bilbo Baggins departing from the Shire, after many years of living as the town eccentric. He reluctantly leaves his treasured ring of invisibility to his adventurous nephew Frodo, and vanishes into the wild with some dwarves.But Gandalf the wizard, informs Frodo that the Ring is really the Ring of Power, a powerful item that the demonic Dark Lord Sauron has poured his essence and power into. And if Sauron can regain the Ring, he will be able to conquer Middle-Earth. Aghast, Frodo joins a fellowship of Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, Men and a wizard, to go to the one place where the Ring can be destroyed: Mount Doom.\\"The Two Towers\\" begins directly after \\"Fellowship,\\" after Frodo Baggins flees with his friend Sam into Mordor, with no one to protect them. His cousins Merry and Pippin are kidnapped by orcs from the renegade wizard Saruman. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli begin a frenetic search for the hobbits, and receive unexpected help from unlikely allies. Meanwhile, the Ring weighs more heavily on Frodo, as he is forced to get help from one of the people he most despised: the Ring's slave Gollum.\\"Return of the King\\" brings the trilogy to an action-packed, slam-bang and ultimately poignant finale. Sam barely rescues Frodo from Sauron's orcs, and the two resume their journey to Mount Doom, barely escaping Sauron's forces. As Aragorn leads the desperate battle against Sauron's armies at the city of Minas Tirith, Frodo falls increasingly under the seductive spell of the Ring.\\"Lord of the Rings\\" is indeed a powerful book, and its timeless messages and quests have shaped the fantasy genre, and crossed the boundaries of literary fiction. At its core it's about the fight of good versus evil, and how \\"little people\\" can have a strength and willpower that the great and mighty can't even begin to understand.And Middle-Earth is a pretty astounding universe -- not just because Tolkien created a rich back-history for it, but because of the feeling of mystery that hangs around its corners, whether it's dead soldiers or slumbering tree-men. And of course rich cultures of Men, ancient wizards, the stately melancholy elves, and the tough dwarves -- as well as the idyllic Shire, a sort of ancient British countryside which is threatened by corruption.Tolkien's writing is evocative and descriptive, though not to extremes; an elf rider is simple described as shining like a light behind a veil. The story is wrapped in a wide range of dialogue -- from Sam's folksy chat to the Elves' ethereal, formal songs -- and the pacing is slow and gradual, but kept alive by sudden twists of the plot. The first several chapters are kind of slow-moving, but by the time our heroes get to Bree, the pace picks up.Frodo Baggins is an everyman hero, who dreams of adventure but begins to treasure the simple, boring life that he had once he is deprived of it. His deteriotation is saddening, all the more so because he is aware of it. The equally vibrant cast also includes Gandalf the crabby grandfatherly wizard, Sam Gamgee the loyal gardener, and a variety of kings, elves, dwarves, and more lovable little hobbits.Even after all the years, J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" still rules the fantasy genre and has become an integral part of modern literature. It's an epic for all ages, and few books have even come close to equalling it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"first the story, simply the greatest story ever told, aside from the bible, enough said. i bought this edition soley for the paintings and i wanted a hard cover edition. previuosly owend an ordinary paper back version that got all bent up. the only problem for me is whether to leave the sleeve on because the painting on it is awesome or take it off to show the classiness of the brownish red cover (which feels like a hard cloth cover over the ordinary hard cover cardboard) with only the gold symbol j.r.r. created for it. with the sleeve off it looks authentic and classic and historic so i dont know. good problem to have desciding which outside you want to show off. i do wish however it had a hard lether case too, like the paper back leather bound books do. but i guess you cant have it all."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I'll begin with the edition and will follow with the actual story. There's nothing to be reproached to this edition: the paper is fine quality, the printing is flawless, the illustrations are printed on glazed paper; everything is perfect. The hardcover is really good too, with Tolkien's stylised initials on the front side of the book.A review on that book may not be particularly needed, given all the attention this work has received, but I can still try. \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" reads like a marathon, but not one that bores you, though it may tire you. Having read \\"The Hobbit\\" before, I think this book will please you way more than its predecessor.Since I already gave it 5 stars and that pretty much everything has been said about \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", I'll indulge in some negative criticism, not because I dislike the book but most because I don't feel like stating the obvious, especially when it has been said countless times before. So here is my (slightly) negative criticism.Having seen the movies, my reading was necessarily influenced. For instance, had I not seen the movies, I'm not at all sure that I would have actually understood that there was something between Aragorn and Arwen; I also seem to have missed their wedding, though I can't be sure why that is. Perhaps I was dozing as I read, or perhaps Tolkien didn't spend much time on that. I honestly don't know.I read somewhere that the book was criticised for its \\"simplistic character psychology\\" which didn't seem especially relevant to me, or actually accurate, but I couldn't describe my impressions of Faramir falling in love with Eowen in any other way. This is but a trivial detail in the whole story, but when you read that bit, it does seem a but hard to swallow. From the moment they meet to the moment they marry there's not an awful lot of time (and pages) and so it seems a bit incredible. But then again, that's just a detail.Another thing I must admit I wasn't crazy about was all the singing and poetry reciting. I'm quite glad they didn't take on that in the movies because it would have easily become a musical. Again, it won't spoil the book's pleasure for you or anything, but I can't say that I read those bits with much delight.I'll stop here for the negative criticism because it's really not much.A word about the illustrations: they're gorgeous. There are many, and they're wonderfully executed."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is a masterpiece, as it can only be written by an Englishman, who lived in a culture marked by the British Empire and its preceding history. J.R.R. Tolkien's gift for languages and his imagination played a vital role in conceiving this piece of fantasy literature.My interest in a version as close to the original as possible is satisfied by this 50th anniversary edtion. Also the beautiful leather binding and gold leaf gilded edge pages convey the spritit of the tale in an extremely pleasing way."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Lord of the Rings is one of the greatest literary contributions to mankind. I have yet to see a book, or set of books, written as well with the amount of depth that Tolkien has put into this work.I'm first going to go through address each aspect of The Lord of the Rings, critiquing each of them as I go.The story is can both be described as very complex, or very simple. On this alone, I would give the book five stars. The entire story is summed up in one sentence: How Frodo Baggins rid Middle-earth of the Ring of Power. Then again, there is far more depth to it than that. There are literally hundreds of subplots, both implied and obvious. There are subplots involving main characters like Aragorn and Gandalf, and others including stories that go only mentioned briefly, like that of the balrog, or Treebeard, dwarves, and elves. Stories are alluded to and told that only hint at the depth of the world, Middle-earth, that Tolkien has created. The plot proceeds following a few storylines, the ultimate goal being to destroy the Ring of Power in Mount Doom. Along the way we meet a myriad of other characters, from half-main characters, like Eomer, to ones that are only touched on, like a few orcs. The story here is just so big, that it can't even be contained in the pages that J.R.R. Tolkien has used to write it.The interesting fact is that despite the complexity of the story, Tolkien presents it in such a way that all of the different aspects of the story flow together fluidly. So much so that it seems like the story is relatively simple. And that only continues to prove that Tolkien really knows how to write a good story.That brings me to my second point. The characters. Because there are so many stories involved in this one big story, and so many characters involved, you'd think that there wouldn't be much time for characterization, but it's just the opposite. Tolkien takes the time to develop each and every character involved, and the hinted stories and subplots only go to enhance this. With all of the back stories, we get to know more about the characters, and what they do later on in the book causes them to stay true to who they are, based on what they've already done. Suffice to say, Tolkien is a master of characterization.Moving onto Tolkien's writing style. It is absolutely flawless. His descriptions are masterful, and he doesn't fall into any of the usual faults that many authors fall into. Tolkien doesn't stop the action to use descriptions; he uses the action to channel the descriptions. His writing flows extremely well, and he moves the story steadily along while keeping consistent pacing, which is a very important aspect of any story. I really like how Tolkien allows the story to enhance his writing style. The grand landscapes, the epic battles. He captures the very essence of Middle-earth.That's not to say he only writes on a grand scale. His writing is nearly perfect down to the simple scenes that involve interaction between characters. I especially like the relationship between Sam and Frodo. Tolkien goes from long passages of beautiful descriptions, to quick sentences of action. He is just as adept at writing lengthy scenes where little action occurs as he is at bringing dramatic battle scenes to life.That brings me to how Tolkien handles dialogue. There are many passages where Tolkien uses long passages in dialogue to convey information while using only simple dialogue tags to portray the action. Some may say that the long passages are boring and detract from the story, but I say it only goes to enhance the story and create even better character development. Each character has his or her own voice, and each talk differently. This added with the action taking place in the short sentences between dialogue allows the scene to flow easily with the action never stopping while we still get to know whatever information needs to be conveyed.Tolkien writes with a certain depth that I haven't seen in many other authors. Very few people can capture the essence of a story like he could. Tolkien had a gift, and he utilized it well. He wrote from his heart, and when authors write from their true feelings, it comes out more real than someone who, say, writes simply for money. The book as a whole is simply an almost flawless example of how books should be written. Not only does Lord of the Rings have just a good story and characters, Tolkien created numerous biblical parallels. This makes a work of fiction really come alive and feel much more relevant.Lord of the Rings is the type of book that can be read numerous times. Whoever has not read Lord of the Rings should begin right now. It's worth the time put into it. I see no way for this to disappoint, if you are someone who knows a good story when you see one.There's a reason this is a classic and has gained worldwide fame and approval."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"J.R.R.

Tolkien's great novels, The Lord of the Rings. If there's any criticism it's that the volume does not have The Hobbit, but that's a minor quibble.But why get this book?Unlike the little paperbacks, this thick volume not only has all three books into one volume, it has large type and holds easily in the hands. After you have visited the Two Towers and have scoured the Shire, it's time to dive into the Appendices.Wow, this a great! Tolkien clearly put a lot of work into creating this world of fantasy. We have the legends and history and lore of Middle Earth, starting with the Annals of the Kings and Rulers, the Numenorean Kings, the Heirs of Isildur and the Kings of the Mark (and so on, and so on).Drooling yet?There is a chronology of events in the later appendices which makes a reread of the stories make more sense (at least for me). A brief mention of The First Age, the dark years of the Second Age, and a thorough working of the Third Age -- it's as if this world actually existed, complete with its own history and events.Turn the page and observe the genealogy of the Baggins of Hobbiton, Brandybuck of Buckland, what a Shire Calendar looks like and how to work out the dates, the pronunciation of words and names, writings and spelling. Heck, learn the \\"Feanorian\\" alphabet!A complete index of all three novels, including the songs and verses, the first lines of the songs and verses, references for all persons, beasts and monsters and so on.You get the idea.

As others have written, he is not merely reading the book, he is acting out all the parts and bringing them all to life in a vivid and compelling manner.I have read the LOTR many times like other convinced Tolkien fans. In listening to Mr. Inglis' presentation, I was moved more deeply and profoundly than by my own readings. It goes almost without saying that the pure and unabridged, unchanged Tokien text as read by a great actor is also far superior to any dramatization of Tolkien, audio drama or film.

The Lord of the Rings is a great story, but the author (despite his credentials) is a mediocre writer. His sentences run on and on, and often times become jumbled. The narrative reaches five stars during the action scenes, but then comes the laborious descriptive narrative. You know, where the writer actual has to tell the story. Yikes! It is like reading a Henry James novel without the benefit of Henry James. Nonetheless, it is a great story with superb irony. To destroy the evil, one must also destroy the good. That's a brilliant story line. Also, the Elvin language is very interesting and colorful. If you want great fantasy, this is the book. If you want to read great writing try Hemmingway, Faulkner or Fitzgerald. These are writers that knew their craft, not just their imagination.

Well we hopped on the tractor and drove down to his house,farm country if you must know.We saw him from a distance shooting hoops on his makeshift gravel court we drove up and he of course had a puzzled look on his face since we had never visited him before, we just rode the same school bus. Well as an ice breaker we played a game of horse, he won. Then he challenged us to a game, which hardly seemed fair since he was a little person like the Dwarf in \\"Lord of The Rings\\" , we took him up on it and were soundly trounced, he had an amazing hook shot. Well my brother Charles Chadwick decided to broach the subject of firecrackers and Smedley didn't know what he was talking about, we followed him around abit and he showed us a 5 gallon bucket of grease for the tractors, we had never seen such a quantity of grease in our lives, pretty cool. As we were looking at the grease my brother Charles Chadwick told Smedley that he had dropped a quarter in the grease and he could have it if he dug it out, without hesitation Smedley reached elbow deep into the grease and then my brother Charles Chadwick laughed and said he didn't really, we all laughed, some more than others and thats about all I remember about that visit.

So of course I wanted to read the book to see what I was missing and while I will say I was missing alot I must also say I was dissapointed.I personally think that Tolken was too wordy when he wrote this book, there are certainly some interesting details in the book that were not part of the movie and that is a plus but there is also a lot that to me seems like needless fluff that tolken just put in there to drag the story out. Having said that I must confess Tolken does a marvolous job of dragging things out and putting in stuff that just seemed unnessicary to me.It also did not seem very well written when compared to some other books I have read. However I must give Tolken credit for the fantastic amount of thought and detail that he put into this book, he was truly gifted with creativity but not at putting that creativity into words. That is not to say that I could have done better, goodness no, I am very bad at putting ideas to words but I have read books by people who are and it makes a real diffrence.In conclusion I would recommend this book only if you are dying to know the whole original story and you don't mind spending alot of time reading and wondering what the heck was the point of that?

The first 200 pages or so could easily be trimmed to 75.The characters rely on constant deus ex machinas to help them along with their quest. An example of this is when the small hobbit Merry faces off against the evil undead lord of the Nazgul, truly a terrifying character.

The movie disappointed me so much that I was moved to go back and read all three books again, and I found the work to be profoundly richer, deeper, and more troubling than I remembered.It goes beyond being an engrossing fantasy or work of adventure. This is an incisive character study, with keen and harrowing examinations of the nature of good and evil.The heros are flawed - they can be weak and cowardly, and at times show stupendous bad judgement. The most evil characters (outside THE source of evil, Sauron) have a failed nobility; one senses they became evil out of the best of intentions. The ultimate triumph of good brings about much sadness and loss in its wake, and the central hero does not return from his trials to live happily ever after.I think what the book teaches us is that great acts of heroism and decency can come from the least likely of sources, that acts of great courage entail great risk, that evil is more insidious and close at hand that we might want to think.So, although it is probably the greatest 20th century work of imagination and adventure, what will make it endure in other centuries is its examination of the nature of good and evil, and of how the most ordinary of characters (and hence, readers) struggle with them both in daily life."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Great book!!

After reading THE HOBBIT, I wanted to know more and had to go and read TLOTR. I have to say that TLOTR was much better than THE HOBBIT! THE HOBBIT is an easier, more fun, and lighter story to read, so THE HOBBIT would be better for younger readers to enjoy. But THE LORD OF THE RINGS is more dark and there is a lot more adventure and action. Plus, it is longer. MUCH longer. Over 1,000 pages total.THE LORD OF THE RINGS is the story of Frodo Baggins, the hobbit who leaves the quiet, peaceful hobbit-life of the Shire and goes off on an incredible journey to destroy the One Ring that his cousin, Bilbo Baggins, had left behind when he disappeared. Frodo must take the Ring across Middle-earth and throw it into the Cracks of Doom. Along for the adventure are Frodo's hobbit friends, Merry, Pippin, and Sam. Gandalf the old, wise wizard guides the way, and the hobbits receive help from Gimli the Dwarf, Legolas the Elf, Boromir of Gondor, and a tall, mysterious stranger named Strider. If Frodo does not destroy the Ring, then the Dark Lord who created the eleven Rings, could get it back and have the power to rule all others.There are three parts to this trilogy: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, THE TWO TOWERS, and THE RETURN OF THE KING. There are six books in the three-part novel. The edition to this novel is pretty good. It contains all three LORD OF THE RINGS novels, and a whole lot more. On the covers, there are pictures from the film trilogy (THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is in theaters now). Inside the book, you will find notes on the text from the publisher, a foreword to the second edition, and a prologue which has information about Hobbits, Middle-earth, etc. Also included in this edition are the complete appendices and an index. This one volume edition is a must have for all fans of THE LORD OF THE RINGS. It is a great travelling companion, too because instead of dragging along all three books, you can just take this one big one with you.J.R.R. Tolkien has written a fantasy masterpiece. It is a classic and one of the best written novels ever. THE LORD OF THE RINGS tops my list along with the HARRY POTTER series (by J.K. Rowling), as the greatest fantasy stories ever.

It is truley amazing how detailed and wonderfully scripted his novels are. For me, reading Lord of The Rings immersed me in Tolkien's Middle Earth. I only wish I discovered his books sooner."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I went and saw the movie first. That was a bad thing but reading the book helps alot. I really liked to book. It gives much more descriptions and details then the movie. I know that if they put everything in the movie then it would be almost eight hours long and no one would see it then. Now concerning the book. In the begining it went a little slow. But towards the middle it gets more fast paced. I enjoyed it more then. I can't wait to read the Two Towers."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Tolkein is awesome. There are no words save his own that could do justice to this work. I have read these books 5 times in the last 5 years. I can't get enough of it. Read the trilogy, and then read the Silmarilion, and then read The Book of lost tales, and then re-read them all again. These are never a waste of time, even for those who do not like Fantasy. Read It!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is a fine version of the trilogy. High quality hardcover, fifty quality illustrations.

Tolkien. This was his shining moment. With one story he forever defined the fantasy world. Who can mention wizards without having an old man with a long beard and pointy hat come to mind? The same could be said for Dwarves, Elves, and Orcs--when you mention the name, you picture them in your head the way Tolkien defined them. This is why he was revolutionary; his creatures, races, and ideas have been used over and over again since these books first made their appearance.Every genre has it's pioneer, the one who established the boundaries to be used for generations after. In the fantasy genre, this pioneer was J.R.R. Tolkien.As for the books, they are set in middle-earth, a world so elaborate and intriguing that you would never be able to explore it all, though you have a great desire to. The characters are many, and they are all masterfully developed.The story is a classic one of good versus evil, but there is much more to it than that. The real struggle lies in the power of the ring, and the temptation it provides. The true challenge lies in denying the power of the ring, in mastering one's self. Herein lies the brilliance of Tolkien's work.While some aspects of the reading (poems, extensive detail, etc) are a little heavy for children, this is a timeless story, infinitely intriguing. The one flaw of the book is that you will not be able to put it down, and it will quite possibly disrupt every other aspect of your life until you finish it.No library should be without this volume, the immortal tale of the One Ring."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"When you think fantasy, one man comes to mind and stands above all others: J.R.R.

It will change the way you view life."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"think about it... It has sparked an entire genre and has been used as a benchmark for any writer trying the Fantasy genre, it has also created a tremendous following in the game industry (Dungeons and Dragons) plus countless books, biographies, companions, movies and drawings...It simply cannot be that bad even if you're allergic to everything that remotely involves fantastic.The book is simply beautiful, rich and well built, peppered with poetry and action.You, like many, will be sad when you turn the last page."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I think that this book is one of the best that exists. I personally enjoy reading it everytime I have a chance of doing so. I've seen the motion picture and I enjoyed it but I still recommend the book to everyone since it has more details. To me this book is something that should go to generations after generations. It is very captivating and it's one of my favorite books. Well enjoy reading it if you have it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"What can I say? This book is a adventurous, complex, and highly detailed and believable fantasy masterpiece! Tolkien has done so much to make his characters familiar, that I almost cried when Mithrandir, Cirdan, Elrond, and others went sailed of west (to Valinor). Frodo and Bilbo also sailed off, and so did Legolas and Gimli together, one of the greatest friendships in the book, and one of the best in all literature! This book was as joyous in its victory as it was bittersweet...the end was a roller coaster ride of emotions I have yet to experience--and I doubt will experience--again. You read the book and get lost for hours reading the flowing speech and breathtaking descriptions of Middle Earth...and I highly recommend you read the appendixes at the end of Return of the King. It gives you more background on the Second Age and Third Age, a run through of the events that took place in the book, and 120 years into the fourth age, where Elessar (Aragorn) died and Peregrin and Meriadoc died with him also, and Sam sailed out to sea... Other appendixes note about family trees, languages, and histories of the races.All in all, the Lord of the Rings was a thought-provoking fantasy book that will keep you occupied years after you first read it!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Don't let the hype turn you off! Let it turn you onto the greatest story you will ever know. I have read every edition, I have read some of them several times, and I insist that this is the greatest series ever written. The characters are deep, the story is deeper then you can imagine. i mean, I have read it many times and I still find things that I missed in previous readings. When you get to know the characters and read it a second time, it makes an even deeper impact on you. You have to read it! Even if you don't like fantasy books, you will love this. I read this book called Nighted Colours, man it is intense, too. Check it out!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Lord of the Rings has been capturing the imagination of people for over fifty years. The reason for this is simple...it's an excellent book series. It's an adventure like no other, filled with heroes battling orcs, goblins, trolls, and other monsters. Among my other favorites are Abacar the Wizard and the Dark Elf Trilogy. All three book series are excellent."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Wonderful plot! Never a dull moment ^_^ .. Very fascinating."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"First of all, I am NOT writing this review over what \\"edition\\" is best and what is the worst. Frankly, I don't even know what edition I own! However, I am glad that people are making recommendations...for the Tolkien lover, it probably is a good idea to get an edition that you'll treasure.What I am writing about in this review is the story that's beneath the cover. I read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" when I was eleven (almost twelve) and loved it. I am thirteen (almost fourteen) now and I have read it at least five times!! If you are thinking of buying the books, then you must get ALL OF THEM. People say that the LotR was written to be three separate volumes; I believe they are wrong--the LotR was PUBLISHED in three different volumes but it is all one story--and the books IN NO SHAPE OR FORM stand alone. They are all one.If you have not yet seen the movies (which is probably unlikely), read the books first. That's what I did and I have never regretted it; 1)It makes more sense 2)You get much more out of the story 3)You understand the characters better. I won't waste my time going over the story line and the characters and all that--I'm sure you've heard that a million times. But, altogether, it is a BEAUTIFUL story that far surpasses any movie...though they did a better job than I expected on those."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I think I speak for many when I say that after many years of enjoying Tolkien's book, I wanted to have a nice copy for my library. The books I read as a boy show their age and as Lord of the Rings is one of my \\"must have\\" books, I wanted an particularly special edition. Sound familiar? For like-minded individuals, there are essentially two choices: the single volume with Alan Lee's gorgeous illustrations (he later became artistic advisor for the movies) or the 50th Anniversary Edition. I got the best of both worlds -- bought the illustrated version for myself and this one for my finacee! As nice as the Lee watercolors are, the 50th Anniversary really is the better book. The binding, paper, cover, and feel are amazing... THIS is what a great book should feel like. Also, this is the final revised text, so it is marginally better. Don't let the price discourage you, it is definitely worth it, and this is a book to treasure."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"what is &quot;leatherette&quot; anyway? In this case it is cardboard, covered with a shiny red paper with a few stars embossed. I'm ashamed that the publisher could not do a better job with this edition. At a retail of $75 it should have had better paper, an even quality to its printing instead of the overly light or dark pages. Now lets talk about the &quot;extras&quot;. Yes it does have ONE map. (The editorial review says &quot;maps&quot; plural.) The map was glued on to one of the last pages. The cut was irregular. In fact the whole effect of the book is that is is an irregular or reject. (Did the publisher decide that the U.S. should get the inferior printing?)Here is what a true collector' edition should have: Quality end papers with maps or illustrations of places, scripts of languages such as elvish, dwarvish or common. A few black and white illustrations throughout the text such as the Doors of Durin, Rivendell, etc. More maps in the appendices. You get the idea."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This unabridged version is the way to go. I have heard the dramitization versions and they are OK if that is your thing. I prefer this simpler version. The entire story is there and Rob Inglis does a great job changing his voice and reading generally very dramatically. I really love this audio book!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This classic boxed set of the Lord of the Rings is great. The illustrations are breathtaking and bring Tolkien's world to life. If you love Tolkien... and the Lord of the Rings, this is a must have for your library. The construction is great, the maps add a lot of detail. I am very pleased with this edition."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have wanted a complete hardcover box set of LOTR, illustrated by Alan Lee, all my life. Now at last I have it. These are beautiful books; as has too rarely been done, Tolkien's work has been given a binding and pictures worthy of the greatness of the story. I heartily recommend this edition; the only better one in existence is Houghton-Mifflin's old hardcover box set, in which Alan Lee's paintings were first featured (unfortunately I only have the second two volumes of that one). Buy this before it goes out of print; it's nice enough to be an heirloom."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is a must have for any Tolkien fan. Rob Inglis does a brilliant reading of the entire book, with songs and everything. Every single voice is done with perfection. It is incredible how one man can make his voice to so many different things. I only wish I had more time in my life when I have nothing to do so I could listen to these CDs. It is worth ten times the amount of money that you're paying for it. This recording is the best."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"As there are so many other reviews, I will try a different view of this magnificently crafted novel.This is the book that created the Fantasy genre, and all Fantasy books that followed it are copies of this masterpiece. This is the original and the best Fantasy novel, and Alan Lee's watercolors compliment the story beautifully.As you get more and more involved in the story, you begin to appreciate Tolkien's magnificent use of the English language, and his craftsmanship with words. Only Shakespeare wrote English more magnificently than Tolkien. As you read this book, you realise what a beautiful language we have in English, and you begin to yearn for other books written with such skill of language.For anyone wanting to escape the real world, this is the perfect way of doing it. Middle Earth is so believable, you can almost feel the icy winds of the mountains and smell the fires burning in the hearths.My only complaint is this - after reading this book for the first time 20 years ago, I have never been satisfied with any other novel, viewing all novels I've read since then to be inferior. It's just too good!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I have never been an avid reader. I'm still not one. Sadly, most fiction cannot hold my attention, unlike my wife who reads like someone's going to burn her books tomorrow. :) My father MADE me read this and The Hobbit when I was nine, and I hated both. Later, in college, I re-read them. By the time I got to The Two Towers, I was skipping classes and staying up all night (I'm also not a very fast reader). I read the series in four days, and nearly cried. If this is not the perfectly written fantasy, then I believe Tolkien himself took the one that is to his grave. I admit that the first book takes a little work, but building a palace begins with a foundation."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Many have questioned its viability as literature, without having read it. Many critics have noted its use of the standard fantasy adventure formula, without realizing that it *invented* the formula, that without this book writers such as Terry Brooks, David Eddings, Robert Jordan, Tad Williams, and countless hordes of others would be pursuing alternative careers. Many academics have cried anathema over its marginal acceptance into their canon, without realizing that Professor Tolkien of Oxford was One of Them, and worthy indeed of any praise he may have received for the scholarly depth which characterizes his work. Many children have enjoyed it over and over again, thus leading to the common misperception that it is a children's book. Many have dismissed it as fantasy, or allegory, or satire, or novelty, or social commentary, without realizing that it is *Myth*.It is as myth that the novel succeeds where so many of the clones have failed. In it: a world more thoroughly crafted and more fully-realized than any offered by various cultures of the past; events with world-shaking consequences; characters with real lives playing as pieces in a grand game. But what distinguishes this book from its many imitators is its mythic grandeur, the epic caliber of *story*, and its underlying vision of story as myth, and that myth is truth.All this, and still amongst the most engrossing reads of the century."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is unquestionably THE best version of Lord of the Rings for serious fans. It's beautifully bound with golden elvish script embossed on the red leather, and the whole thing creates the feeling that you're reading the actual compilation of Bilbo, Frodo, and Sam. One of the book's most valuable features is it's lack of pictures -- other than diagrams of runes and symbols used upon the door of Moria and such -- allowing the readers to formulate their own imagery. Moreover, this edition is published as the story was meant to be read: with all three &quot;books&quot; in one (many uneducated folk scorned the 2001 movie's unsatisfying ending, which was meant to be merely a cliff-hanger leading into the immediately ensuing chapter). True, the size may render it unwieldy for younger fans (PLEASE take great care), but part of the treasure of this edition is its textile feel and weight, its &quot;sprawl out in front of the fireplace&quot; nature, for this is not a magazine to skim but a treasure trove to ponder and study. It contains a huge fold-out map with comprehensive place-names, as well as family trees and guides for translating the various runic languages. Another great feature is the archive of appendices proffering tidbits on everything from the fall of Numenor to the future of Aragorn and Arwen together, allowing immediate references for every occasion that an item piques your interest. Don't underestimate the value of the index, either, for help in looking up individual songs and riddles or creatures and people. As much as I love reading, this particular book has remained my most cherished posession since its introduction to our family 20 years ago. Together with the Collector's Edition of The Hobbit and BBC's radio broadcast performace on CD, I'm content to share with my family for generations to come the wealth of pleasure to be derived from this greatest of classics."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"When I first heard about this book I heard great things about it, butI thought to myself what was the big deal? I mean, c'mon how good could one book be. Well as time went on the rave reviews of The Lord of the Rings continued. And so finally I decided I had to read the book to see what the big fuss was about. Well I went down to my local library but couldn't find Lord of the Rings, instead I picked up Tolkien's first book The Hobbit. The 1st of Tolkien's books was a great novel indeed. Despite its more fantastical and somewhat childish approach, The Hobbit proved to be a very good read. I was completely drawn into the fantasically detailed world of Middle-earth. I soon ordered a copy of the Lord of the Rings and found it was well worth the money. It spends an amazing amount of time intricately detailing everything in Hobbiton, The Shire, Bree, Weathertop, Rivendell and all of the other locations in Middle-earth. By doing this it completely draws the reader into its world and refuses to let you go until the book is finished, which by the way is the only bad part about it. I found myself so excited in the events of the book such as when Frodo and his company were being followed the Black Riders in the dead of night, I could hardly wait to the read the next line and turn the page to see what became of them. I could simply go on for pages about just how good this book is and how brilliant the J. R. R. Tolkien is but my limit is a mere 1000 words. This book is absolutely, uncomparably better than anything anyone could have written. Before reading The Hobbit, I was never a big fan of fantasy type stories, but I assure this book will change your view of fantasy novels. Especially since it was the novel that started the fantasy fiction genre which created such unforgettable titles as Dungeons &amp; Dragons, The Chronicles of Narnia, and even Harry Potter. Believe me when I say it, if you can read than it would be an absolute shame if you deprived yourself of the joy that is Lord of the Rings. Go to your local library, book stores, friends, online shopping networks, or beg on the steets if you have to, whatever it takes. Just make sure that you can experience the absolute blissfulness of Middle-earth like so many of the millions around the world, myself included. This is the single greatest achievement in literature of the 20th century, so please read the book if you haven't already. And if have, go ahead and read it again because it's one of those few titles that you can read again and again throughout your lifetime every few years and it will only get better."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I can't really explain the immense enjoyment that i got from reading the Lord of the Rings. I was reading during a very rough time, and it was a great help for me to get my mind off things. Tolkein's stories are fascinating, and i can't use any big words like most people here, but all i can say is that this novel is held close to my heart, and i imagine showing my children and grandchildren the wonders held in this book, when i have them. The only thing i have to say about the 7 set black books is that for me, a school student, it was very easy to travel with. But, the box that they come in broke after a month. I would not buy this set unless you planned on leaving the box at home in it's own place. The books are lovely only for the use of traveling with them and the book doesn't seem so overwhelmingly long with it broken up smaller, so it all depends on you really. If you don't buy this set, at least buy some kind of set, I'd rather live with this set then nothing, for this is the greatest book i have and probably will ever read. I was so sad for days after i finished the last page, and i couldn't figure out why. I thought and thought, and it was because i had finished it, it was that good. I had made a routine of reading it during class, after tests, even during PE. I couldn't keep my eyes off of it. You really get attached to Gandalf, and Frodo, even little Pippin grew on me. Please consider buying some kind of set of this book, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"At this time I don't think I need to go on about &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; being the best fantasy epic ever written. Anyone who enjoys reading about a different world will enjoy these tales of brave deeds done in Middle-Earth. Instead I'm going to say that if you're going to purchase this book, I recommend the one I did. I bought the Hardcover version with Illustrations done by Alan Lee. I think everyone should consider this one. I know we're not babies anymore who need pictures but I found that the pictures greatly increased my ability to imagine this facinating land. Sometimes you can't get the full image of Minas Tirith in your head by just words and Alan Lee always kept my mind more amazed.Overall, buy the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; if you haven't yet. Then consider the Hardcover Illustrated Version when you do."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"When I say &quot;definitve,&quot; I am referring to the authoritative nature of this work. It brought the genre of fantasy into the mainstream and because of its depth, clarity, and Tolkien's keen sense of language and detail it remains the standard bearer for fantasy today.The plot of the Lord of the Rings is too large to allow much comment here. In short, the Lord of the Rings is the story of a hobbit named Frodo who undertakes a seemingly impossible mission to destroy a ring of unspeakable power and evil. If you are not a fan of the fantasy genre, this may seem too &quot;fairy-tale-ish&quot; to be taken seriously. However, while the setting and characters are in many ways fantastical (it is fantasy after all!), the themes found in the book are universal and timeless. Good versus evil. Fear versus courage. This story is trully &quot;epic.&quot;I would suggest this book to any newcomer not only as a introduction to the fantasy genre but as work of literature as well. Tolkien's style is lucid. The characters are intriguing, not neccessarily because of their strengths but often because of their flaws. One of the only criticisms of Tolkien is that the characters and story are often aloof. While this is true, it was most likely the intention of the author to infuse an epic quality to the work.Now, for some notes on editions. For those who want to keep expenses to a minimum, the 1999 paperback edition ... is a good choice. For those Tolkien enthusiasts looking for a more durable edition, the millineum edition leaves a lot to be desired because of the binding and type face. I have come to treasure my red leather bound collector's edition. The binding has held up superbly though the fold out map is a bit cumbersome."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The Lord of the Rings is a magnificent novel that lures you in with a wealth of descriptions and characters that only an author like J.R.R. Tolkien could imagine. This book is one of the best I have ever read and I recommend that you read this at least once in your lifetime. The characters have personalities uniquely their own and the conficts are well defined and easy to comprehend. Even though a few of teh characters switch names in the course of the reading, (which was a little confusing, but not to the extent of turning the story sour), The Lord of the Rings' characters still uphold thier sense of qualities throughout the entire narrative. I was esspecially satified with the cornucopia of descriptions. The vivacity o fhte imagery the author created was overwhelming; I could almost smell what the characters smelled; almost feel what the characters felt. This passage illistrates that point to the utmost extremes of human imagination and perception. Let yourself envision the gardens of Lothlorien, the place where the &quot;company&quot; rests and replenishes their packs: &quot;When thier were in turn uncovered, Frodo looked up and cought his breath. They were standing in an open space. To the left stood a great mound, covered with a sward of grass as green as Springtime in the Elder Days. Upon it, as a double crown, grew two circles of trees: the outer had bark of snowy white, and were leafless but beautiful in thier sharply nakedness... 'Behold! You are come to Cerin Amroth,' Said Haldir&quot; From the heart of the Shire, to the midst of the Nazgul, The Lord of the Rings is a book that no one shoulod go without."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I first read these books when I was 12, I am now 21 and have read them at least once a year since then. I truly believe Tolkien to be a genuis and this to be the best work of fiction I have ever read. To those who find it long: Tolkien is telling his tale from the perspective of the hobbits, and the reader is meant to experience what they experience. Tolkien does an incredible job of making you feel the long journeys and the vast space which his world occupies. The characters have a depth unseen in any other fantasy novel I have ever read (don't get me wrong, I love fantasy, this is just the best). To those who found the battle scenes not &quot;real war&quot; I ask you this, were you ever in a war? Tolkien was, WWI, perhaps he knows what it is really like, not what a fantastic image of it would look like. While I can't change your opinions, I have here given my own. Even if you still don't think of this book as genius, at least look into the genius of the man. Tolkien was unique and an incredible storyteller. I love his work and all that he has done."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"First - Ofcourse the story is superb, story gets full rating.Second - Some people complain about the cheap manufacturing of this set. I really do question the reading methods used by these people. There is no reason for this set to split or break at any point, if read properly. I do not mean you can not enjoy these books, I am not the most careful reader, but I must draw the line somewhere, I treat all my books with respect, and they last a long time.Third - The size of these volumes is excellant. They are perfect size for sticking in a coat pocket, or in a back-pack, or a travel bag. They are sturdy enough to hold up, and small enough to carry with ease.Fourth - J.R.R. Tolkien wrote this series as six books, with appendices. Not as three volumes, not as one large book. Six books telling one big story. This style is hard to find, most are three volume, the remaining are one book. This part of this particular set I really enjoy."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This book's advertisement described that \\"Deluxe leather binding with two-color foil stamping\\". Yes, deluxe leather is not real leather. It is imitation leather. If you would like to real leather binding, this is not your book.But this book has smith sawn binding. And imitation leather will endure from rough handling."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The bargain hardcover ($29.99) has the identical cover as the illustrated hardcover ($44.10). It also has the same illustrations, but it is nothing more than a paperback wrapped in a hardcover binding. Worst of all are the maps, which are not foldout maps and are the same as the maps in the trade paperback! I have returned the copy I ordered. This is extremely deceptive on the part of both the publisher and Amazon."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This was my third reading of LOTR (the first was when I was in college in the 1960s). I'm glad to see that the trilogy is now in a single volume the way that Tolkien intended it to be published.LOTR is a classic story of high adventure and the triumph of good over evil, all set in the mythical fantasy world of Middle Earth. The saga is filled with some of the most memorable characters in literature, including hobbits, humans, dwarves, elves, orcs, ents, wizards, and witches. Epic battles are fought throughout the story, from Weathertop, where Frodo is seriously injured, to the final clash outside the Black Gate of Mordor.Those who have only seen the film versions of the three LOTR books owe it to themselves to read the trilogy. There was so much more in the books that could not be shown in the films due to time constraints. For example, in The Return of the King, the third book of the trilogy, there is a whole mini-story of what happens to the hobbits in the Shire after Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin return home. Even after defeating the Dark Lord Sauron, there was more evil to be confronted in the Shire, and from a most unexpected source.My test for a great book is... if I had to be stranded on a remote island for years without contact with the outside world, would it be one of only ten books I could take with me? In the case of LOTR, the answer is a resounding \\"yes.\\""},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Besides The Bible, this trilogy is my favorite reading of all time! You can tell Tolkein put a lot into this. What a captivating quest and a great theme of how the smallest person can save the world. Captivating, imaginative - are there enough adjetives to describe how awesome this trilogy is? Probably not. When it comes to fantasy, this trilogy is the original. Definitely a must read for all fantasy lovers."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This was the best thing I could get.

I'm super excited to say the least!I won't try to discuss the actual books themselves as I don't feel qualified at this point and that discussion is probably better suited for a different venue. But this audiobook version is wonderful. Rob Inglis does a great job narrating and really makes the characters come alive. His voice is perfectly suited to match the mood of the book (in my opinion at least) and he does a great job of not droning on. He even does a darn good job of slightly changing voices for different characters. A tough chore I would think. His accent matches the feel of the story and its nice to hear him pronounce some of the harder names in the book (both character and location names).What else can I say? If your a Tolkien/LoTR fan and are in the market for an audiobook version...this is it. 100% perfect! You will not be disappointed.EDIT (4/5/2012): I've now completed the first book (yes, it took me a long time but I only listen to small sections of the book at a time while at work) and I am more impressed now than ever with this recorded version! Rob Inglis truly brings this book to life and I cannot rave enough about how enjoyable it is to hear him read this story. His character voices and moods are consistent throughout the book which really adds to the feel of the story. Rob's voice combined with his wonderful characterization pulls me into the story and I have caught myself more than once actually moving in sync with the actions of the book. For instance, Rob will describe how Frodo turned his head quickly to catch the stare of Boromir and because I have been so drawn into his reading, I have caught myself moving my head to the side as if I was looking to meet Boromir's stare. This may sound stupid or corny...in fact it sounds kinda corny to me...but I can honestly say I have never been this engrossed in a story before and it's really cool stuff.Another stand-out point in my opinion is that Rob sings the songs throughout the book as they come up and he does a fairly good job of staying in character. I'm not particularly impressed by or excited about the singing but since the songs are part of the story, it's nice that he sings the songs as opposed to just speaking the lyrics.Again, I give the Rob Inglis, unabridged audiobook version of the LOtR trilogy 5+ stars! It's rare for me to say this (just ask my wife) but this audiobook is everything I wanted it to be and more. I paid my money and I feel I got much more than what I expected to get. In my opinion, the LoTR story is one of the most epic good vs. evil story lines of all time...possibly the best ever! And Rob Inglis does an epic job of bringing this story to life. I would definitely recommend this audiobook to anyone...especially LoTR fans. It is well worth the price and I don't think any LoTR, fantasy or fiction fan would be disappointed.EDIT (11/15/2012): I just completed the second book, \\"The Two Towers\\", and have started the third book. And WOW!! The second book was better than the first! Didn't think that my enjoyment with this set would grow over time but it has. Looking back, I got this set circa 10/2011 and since then I have only gained more and more appreciation for the set. My enjoyment has only grown over time and I feel it's even a better deal now than it was back then. The entertainment value is through the roof. My advice...don't hesitate...save money if you have to and buy this set. It will be one of your best purchases ever!!!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I read these books as a child and many times since.

After over 65 years, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is still the ultimate fantasy epic. I won't go on and on gushing in praise. I will just note one of the brilliant literary devices that Tolkien uses that sets this book apart from so much other fantasy work. Tolkien weaves a complex narrative with many characters and plot twists, but also manages to set up brilliant parallels between them. For example we see two leaders (Theoden and Denethor) who face strikingly similar challenges, but Tolkien shows them responding differently. The former leads his men against evil, while the latter is cold and despairs. This use of paralleling gives the book so many layers and adds lasting value. Indeed, it's no wonder people can read this book many times over and not get bored. While the Peter Jackson movies are great, it doesn't - and can't - capture all of the nuance in the book.

I have yet to find a fantsy book or series that approahces Tolkien in style, intelligence, form and story. Perhaps it is becuase he was not, per se, just a writer - he let this come from within out of his work as a linguist and other experiences in life. To all the book reviewers out there: stop comparing anything to Tolkien until someone can REALLY write something that is as good as this series. It gives unnecessary praise to only passable literature and brings down the true esprit that abounds in LOTR."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is without a doubt the most beautiful, moving and powerful novel I have ever read. Nothing more need to be said."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Harold Bloom, Sterling Professor of Humanities at Yale and our ablest canonizer of the great books, has omitted Mr. Tolkien's &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; from his (exhaustive) canon/list of the great books. The omission is a mistake from an almost-unfailingly perceptive reader. &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; belongs in the canon. One need only read the comments on this page to see that it is in the canon already. It is a great book for many reasons, but canonical and lasting for an emotion evoked almost on every page: a rare and plaintive sadness.It is an uncanny sadness that Mr. Tolkien has expressed among a monumental adventure story, touching the limits of lament for things past, lost beauty, and grandeur that has failed. Why we should feel sadness for the passing of an imaginary world is odd. At the passing, the author dwells lovingly on lengthy goodbyes to his beloved characters, as they themselves are saddened at their many partings. The author is not subtle. He builds up sadness upon sadness even amid the greatest celebrations, and has his characters pine for glories that were. We finally reach a zenith of this strange sadness when Mr. Tolkien has his drowsy Bilbo the Hobbit (who started it all) utter the reprise of a poem given earlier in the book, but now slightly changed, that is so simple and moving that it can bring tears.&quot;The Road goes ever on and on ----- Out from the door where it began. ----- Now far ahead the Road has gone, ----- Let others follow it who can! ----- Let them a journey new begin, ----- But I at last with weary feet ----- Will turn towards the lighted inn, ----- My evening-rest and sleep to meet.&quot;The book's sadness is not limited to the ending; many characters are sad at heart from the very beginning. The hero is unusually stoic throughout, carrying a great and growing melancholy; the Elven lords never cease mourning their Eden that is passing away; the Ents are bereft of the wives they have lost and have been so for ages past; the list goes on. Perhaps the saddest character of all (who also reaches the highest joy of any) is the King who has returned. His lost years in the wilderness, away from the love of his life, is akin to the sadness in Jane Austen's &quot;Persuasion&quot;. It is a love lost and thwarted through the years and then refound. But upon refinding each other, hero and heroine are painfully aware of the Time they have lost. They remember a shining moment only as a longing. This is not to say that there is not also great joy and excitement. The book gives the reader much satisfaction. Perhaps that is a clue to the nature of its canonical greatness: satisfying sadness.Mr. Tolkien went to heroic lengths to show us characters aware of what they were losing and had already lost. Why this fixation on the destructiveness of Time? One is left at the last page with a shattering loss -- a bereftness. We are inconsolable that these characters could leave nothing of themselves to us; they depart from us forever. Mr. Tolkien's wonderful characters lacked the Art to preserve their world from Time. But yet they live; we are fortunate that Mr. Tolkien had that Art. &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is beyond Time's reach (and beyond misunderstanding critics' neglect) and cannot be destroyed, which is the essence of the canonical."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is amazing. I've been after a 'special' copy of this book for years now, but I've never been able to afford it. There are similar copies on sale in the UK but they've been exchanging hands for in between 100 and 400 pounds - the exchange rate on this one worked out as somewhere around 40 quid including postage and packaging, I call that a bargain! This is a truely beautiful edition of an enchanting story. I wouldn't reccomend you buy it to read and re-read, I've destroyed several paperback copies already with my avid thumbing, but if you're a real nutcase fan and you want a copy of the book which will last you forever, I'd suggest you buy this.

I knew for the type of money I was shelling out it would be a good copy, but it even surpassed my high expectations.The thing I enjoy most is the feel. The outside is a soft smooth leather that is a pleasure to hold. The pages are a super fine paper that feels perfectly smooth yet doesn't allow the ink to smear one tiny bit. If you read as much as I do you know the pleasure of holding and leafing through an expensive book as opposed to one that used cheap, rough, highly acidic paper.The other great thing is the look. The gold leaf is very thick and vibrant and doesn't flake off in your hand. On some books the gold leaf can have a washed out look. Not the case here. The gold lettering on the spine and on the cover are also well done.Last but definitely not least is the text. The print is the perfect size, not too small and not too big. The fold out maps are also beautifully done in red and black ink, be extra careful when unfolding them the first time to not rip it.If you love LOTR you owe yourself the joy of having a book of a physical quality that matches the quality of the words J.

I ordered it from Switzerland, shipping it back costs 30$. Too much for a 50$ book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"Two points to clarify about the most popular single-volume LOTR editions:1) The 1991 single-volume Alan Lee-illustrated edition is the \\"centenary\\" edition, commemorating Tolkien's 100th birthday (cf. \\"centenarian\\") . The \\"centennial\\" edition won't be published until 2054, which will be the 100th anniversary of the original publication of Lord of the Rings. This is a very well designed and well printed/bound edition, built to last and beatufil. Its only fault is the absence of fold-out maps (it has the black and white maps printed in sections, often seen in paperback editions).2) The reason for the broken type in the 1974 red leatherette \\"Collector's Edition\\" (and the occurrences of this number on the order of 1 or 2 characters on every 50th page or so) is more likely that the source text from which the negatives/plates were made and this edition printed was itself flawed and originally was some form of letterpress metal type, probably Monotype [a more 'modern' version of the old LinoType system], though depending on the date of that setting [up to mid-'60s, or even later] it may have been hand-composed. All metal type gets re-used, and becomes worn and some of it cracked/chipped over time. There were many books reprinted in this way through the early '80s (and a few publishers, such as Lindsay Books, of long out-of-print, mostly public-domain or 'gray rights' titles, still do this).The problem is unlikely to have been caused by faults in photo-typesetting strips or process-camera negs in 1973 or so (when this LOTR Collector's Edition was first printed) since that process was a fully mature, climax technology by then, and quality control was simply outstanding (this was due to that extinct beast, the unionized master-printer, especially at Houghton Mifflin, a publisher with a very large academic textbook list, and an industry reputation for quality production; just look at any ten trade hardbacks circa 1973 and earlier, and compare any element of quality to any ten current titles and it's clear the the technology and practice of printing and book binding peaked long ago, and nothing of newer technology, especially computer technology has served the interest of producing better made books, quite the opposite. 2007 tech only makes it faster and cheaper, nothing else.Remember also that it was the Allen & Unwin type-compositors who introduced virtually all the spelling and diction errors in both the 1st and 2nd editions, some of which have only finally been fixed in the 2004-05 50th Anniversary edition; and these were errors mostly such as 'dwarves' being \\"corrected\\" to 'dwarfs', 'elven' to 'elfin', and many others, primarily linguistic, along those lines; these would have been proper corrections with any author other than Tolkien, of course.)As for the notion that photo-reproduction is at all like printing a Word document on a laser printer, then scanning it back into a computer as a JPEG or GIF image file, and finally printing it again, that is a facile and plainly inaccurate comparison. In short, unless one starts with a bitmap or similar low quality computer 'font', prints on low-brightness (&lt;70) recycled paper via a cheap ink-jet printer, scans using a 75-by-75 dpi setting via low-end scanning hardware and software, and repeats printing as above, the result will certainly be nothing so poor as Jeff Sun describes in his review. Photo-reproduction via PC and peripherals or via process-camera, strips, and offset printing, can easily and does commonly achieve excellent results, provided the equipment is of first quality and the operator is skilled.If anyone is obsessed enough to try this (as I clearly am), one fairly reliable way to tell whether a book is printed (at some stage) from some form of metal type is to use at least a 20x loupe and examine the vertical straight edges (particularly of upper N's, T's, L's, and E's) for irregularity. Metal type degrades in miniscule degrees after the first few hundred impressions, and will show this by cracking/splitting/chipping/warbling/bending and otherwise appearing NOT straight, sharp, and crisp (especially machine-set monotype/linotype which was all lead/tin, since it was melted down repeatedly; hand-set type has antimony and sometimes manganese in it, which makes it much harder to start and also casts more sharply; parts of letters break off but usually don't deform). It's a challenge to tell these apart, since photo-reproduction of letterpress can be hard to distinguish from original letterpress printing, if the latter is done by a highly skilled compositor and press operator. Some letterpress books show the impression of the type on the page, like a light embossing, from the force of the type striking the stock. Really good printing avoids this. So, if you have a book without this feature that does show feathering, breaks, waviness, etc. it may be either letterpress or photo-repro of LP, but if these traits are present it is almost certain metal type was used at some point in the life of the typesetting.Two caveats to even to this: feathering alone does not definitely mean deformed metal type. Feathering,, or little veins and stream-like projects away from the character is often caused by excessive inking and watery ink, and also by cheap papers that are unsized (meaning a starch like substance is added during the paper's manufacture to prevent feathering and bleedthrough; newsprint is unsized and you can see how feathering works buy lightly touching a fountain pen to a piece of it for a minute or so). The other caveat is that some computer fonts, especially some high end ones for MAC typesetting systems, have been photographically captured/reproduced from books printed mostly before 1800, and their designers often deliberately retain some of the source type's imperfections (which are due mostly to the more primitive metallurgy of that era) to achieve a particular design effect. You might be surprised how much theory and psychology underlies type-design and typography; there is a lot. Need a dissertation topic?This has become, I see now, a rant, and a really long one. First as a reader, then as a writer, then as apprentice in a letterpress print shop and bindery, I've always held the book as art-object or craft-work in very nearly as high esteem as the words contained within. I do think these issues are worth some ink, and I expect (or hope) that those interested in fine editions such as this so-called \\"Collector's \\" (Ugh! I so hate that term, it's like \\"deluxe\\" or \\"premier\\" and is mildly patronizing to the reader/buyer) edition of LOTR might also find at least some of the above ramble of interest and use. I do regard this red leatherette slipcased edition (ISBN 0-39-519395-8) as my favorite. It was this edition in which I first read LOTR, and though the Centenary hardcover and the HC 50th Anniversary editions (slipcased US and UK, different designs, both excellent) are on the whole and in most particulars better printed and bound, this edition is a nostalgia item for me. I also very much like the red binding, evocative as it is of the \\"Red Book of Westmarch,\\" the foil-stamping on the spine, of the White Tree of Gondor, (which must be by either Pauline Baynes or by Tolkien himself) is a delight, and the two color printing, in spite of the ocassional bad character and slightly inconsistent inking, makes me feel like I'm reading an incunabulum. All of these speak across from the old world, though perhaps very long after the Third Age had concluded. I recommend it, highly and without reservation, even to a casual collector, especially now since it has recently gone out of print(ca. 2003-2005, around the time the slipcased, black bonded-leather, US 50th Anniversary edition [ISBN 0-618-51765-0] was published), and is very unlikely to be reissued. It (the Red) listed for $75, and Amazon last sold new copies for $47.50 last January. Now however, fine, used copies are nearing the original list price for the new, and new copies are nearing $100, and very hard to find. Buy one now, as soon as you find one available fine or better."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This is one of my top five books that I have read all-time.

As C.S. Lewis said, \\"here are beauties which pierce like swords or burn like cold iron. Here is a book which will break your heart.\\"Just the thought of it is enough to scare anyone off the job. Yet, reading over the other customer reviews, I felt I needed to step up to the challenge and write a long review, one that contained an honest opinion and a factual analysis.This review is long, but is logical, informational, and spoiler-free, I encourage you to read it all, thoroughly.This is that review:LOTR [abbreviation: Lord of the Rings] is the magnum opus of John Ronald Reuel Tolkien: an Oxford professor and author. It is actually a trilogy of three books:--The Fellowship of the Ring--The Two Towers--and The Return of the KingJRRT spent over 12 yrs writing the LOTR trilogy, which was released in 1954. It has since gone on to become one of the most loved, respected, and greatest novels ever written.After a wildly successful and brilliant film adaptation from New Zealander Peter Jackson, the LOTR now has an immense fan base, a slew of parodies, paintings, and music left in its wake, and a legacy greater than any single work of fantasy in the history of writing....The first thing I must write about is the land LOTR takes place in: Arda, also known as Middle Earth.Middle Earth is the greatest fictional world ever created. Period.I DEFY anyone to prove otherwise. Take it up with me in the comments.The main works of Tolkien, from the Silmarillion to the Lord of the Rings take place in Middle Earth, and cover everything from its creation at the hands of Illuvatar, to the beginning of the Fourth Age.Tolkien meticulously planned, invented, and imagined EVERY detail of Middle Earth. Middle Earth is so full, so rich and detailed, that many say that Tolkien was more interested in the land his characters were in than the characters themselves.I beg to differ!--Tolkien was certainly interested in his maps and landscapes but his characters are the real stars....There are not enough adjectives in my vocabulary to describe how mind-bogglingly detailed Middle Earth is.Tolkien named and placed over a thousand mountains, rivers, towns, cities, fortresses, islands, and forests, so many, in fact, that encyclopedias and dictionaries have been filled with them.In addition, Tolkien invented over a dozen languages, the most complete of them is Quenya--the Elven language. Tolkien wrote over 1,000 names, words, and phrases for the Elven languages. Tolkien is not the only author to make up a fantasy language, but he is the best. Young Christopher Paolini's attempts at constructing a language are downright laughable.If you have time, check out the following link, which includes an Elvish Dictionary:[...]...I am in no way detracting from other great fantasy worlds such as Westeros, Narnia, Randland, and Gormenghast, but here Middle Earth far surpasses all other fantasy worlds.The detail adds to the LOTR by adding a sense of realism and a distinct Middle Earth-type feel. For the most part, the more detailed your world is, the more your audiences will relate to the characters.Enough about the real world, I'll turn to the book.--Lord of the Rings is long, over 1,000 pages. But this is not long at all compared to Eragon, Game of Thrones, Eye of the World, and the Way of Kings.-- Plot: Thanks, to Peter Jackson, you probably already know the plot. But the movies are not the book, and here is the plot again.It is the third age of the world, and darkness is looming over Middle Earth.The Dark Lord Sauron has gathered to him the 20 Rings of Power, the means by which he will enslave Elves, Dwarves, and Men. Only one thing is missing - the One Ring, which has fallen into the hands of...a hobbit.Deep in the peaceful Shire, young Frodo Baggins is entrusted with an immense task - to take the Ring and destroy it in the fires of Mount Doom, deep within the Enemy's territory. So, with a Fellowship of 9 valiant members - 4 hobbits, 1 wizard, 2 men, and elf, and a dwarf, Frodo must embark on an impossible journey. One from which he may not return...--The Fellowship: These are the members of the Fellowship of the Ring, and their races:Frodo Baggins: Hobbit.Frodo Baggins was the Ringbearer. He was fifty when he set out from Hobbiton. Notably he never killed anything on the quest, the most he did was stab the foot of a Cave Troll. He has been likened to a Christ figure.He wore a coat of mithril and carried Bilbo's sword Sting. Galadriel gave him the light of Earendil.Samwise Gamgee: Hobbit.Samwise was Frodo's gardener, servant, and closest companion. He bore the ring in Mordor for a time. Galadriel gave him a box of earth from Lothlorien, and elven rope.Gandalf the Grey: Wizard.One of the five Istari sent to Middle Earth. Gandalf, a.k.a. Olorin, Mithrandir, Greyhame, was instrumental in forming the Fellowship, and played a large role in the downfall of Sauron. He also appeared in The Hobbit.He carried a sword called Glamdring. He wore grey robes, and later white.Aragorn son of Arathorn: Man.Aragorn was descended from the Kings of Numenor, and was a member of the Dunedain. He was blessed with long life. He went by the name Strider in Bree. He carried the sword that was broken - Anduril.Boromir son of Denethor: Man.Boromir was the son of Denethor, Steward of Gondor. He was the older brother of Faramir. He carried a great horn.He saved the Fellowship's lives at Carvahall, where he instructed each of them to carry a bundle of firewood. He was tempted by the Ring.Legolas son of Thranduril: Elf.Legolas was the only Elf in the company. He was light on his feet, quiet, and was good with horses. He carried a bow, which he used prodigiously.He did NOT shoot an oliphaunt.Gimli son of Gloin: Dwarf.Gimli was a dwarf. He conflicted with Legolas at the beginning, but became friends. He wielded an axe.Meriadoc Brandybuck: Hobbit.Meriadoc, also called Merry, was a hobbit from Hobbiton. His knowledge of the Old Forest was crucial to the hobbits.Peregrin Took: Hobbit.The youngest of the group, Peregrin, known as Pippin, was Merry's best friend, and a good singer....My favorite member of the Fellowship is Samwise. Yeah, laugh all you want and post your little comments about \\"Fat old Sam\\". But until you've read The Choices of Master Samwise, or the Tower of Cirith Ungol, or Mount Doom...you haven't seen ANYTHING yet.Samwise Gamgee is easily the greatest, most courageous character in the Fellowship.Next would be Gandalf.Read this passage from The White Rider, and tell me...\\"And this also I say: you are our captain and our banner. The Dark Lord has Nine. But we have One, mightier than they: the White Rider. He has passed through fire and the abyss, and they shall fear him. We will go where he leads.\\"...that doesn't give you shivers!...Many people like to say Tolkien's characters are \\"black-and-white\\". This means that all his characters are easily divided into Good and Evil. That's not true.Today, fantasy authors like to paint their characters Grey. Look at G.R.R.M.'s writings:Characters like Tyrion, Jaime, Theon, the Hound, and Daenerys. Are they good or evil...Whose side are they on...What are their true intentions...?Whereas in Tolkien's writings:Aragorn - Good, Sauron - Bad, Gandalf - Good, Saruman - Bad, Elves - Good, Orcs - Bad. It's simple, Right?Wrong.Look at Boromir - he's fought against Sauron, yet he tried to take the Ring from Frodo. He wanted to defeat Sauron, but he opposed destroying the Ring.And Sm&eacute;agol - he was Frodo and Sam's guide, yet he wanted the Ring for himself. He led them into Mordor, yet he ------------------- (Spoiler).Those are grey characters....The legacy of Tolkien's works, especially LOTR, CANNOT be overstated.LOTR has been voted \\"The Greatest Book of the Millennium\\", by Amazon.com and appears on almost EVERY list of greatest books ever written.It is the 3rd bestselling book of all time, selling over 150,000,000 copies.The Peter Jackson Trilogy alone has grossed over $2,947,978,376, and has been voted the greatest Motion Picture Trilogy of all time by Empire Magazine.The three films are some of the most famous, iconic, and greatest adaptations of a fantasy novels ever made, appearing on Wikipedia's List of Highest Grossing Films, Empire Magazine's 500 Greatest Movies List, AFI's 100 Greatest Films List, IMDb's 250 Best Films list, and Metacritc's Best Movies of This Decade.LOTR's impact on high, epic, heroic, and quest fantasy, is enormous. It revitalized the genre. No, it REWROTE the genre.LOTR is the father of modern fantasy. Believe it or not, even today's fantasy (A Song of Ice and Fire, The Inheritance Cycle, etc) is influenced by Tolkien.Tolkien's character's Frodo, Gandalf, Gollum and others have entered popular culture.While Tolkien may not have invented Elves, Dragons, Dwarves, or Orcs, his vision of those creatures shaped the characters into what we recognize them as today.Science Fiction authors such as Arthur C. Clarke (2001: A Space Odyssey) and Frank Herbert (Dune) and George Lucas (Star Wars) have been influenced by Tolkien.It is easy to see how fantasy authors are influenced by Tolkien. Terry Brooks, Stephen R. Donaldson, David Eddings, and, yes, Christopher Paolini all ripped LOTR off.George R.R. Martin has been called \\"The American Tolkien\\", and claims JRRT as a huge influence.J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, is truly, a Masterpiece!...Conclusion:As the Sunday Times famously said:\\"The English speaking world is divided into those who have read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings and those who are going to read them.\\"Which camp are you? If you have not read the Lord of the Rings - The Greatest Book of the Millennium, The Most Influential Work of Fantasy - do so immediately.I'm not joking. If I haven't given you enough incentive already, how about some more:Do you like fantasy? Do you like good, no, great books? Are you a fan of books that contain Action, Adventure, High, Epic, Heroic Fantasy, Horror, Mystery, Romance, Large, Epic, Thrilling Battles, Journeys, Strong, Heroic, Likeable Characters, Evil, Hate-able, Scary, and Disgusting Villains, Thrills, Chills, Laughs, and Cheers?Then you'll love the Lord of the Rings.Do you like Hobbits, Elves, Men, Dwarves, Orcs, Barrow-wights, Dragons, Giant Spiders, and Wizards?Then The Lord of the Rings is for you.Read it!...And until then, I hope you've enjoyed this review.

The only reason this gets 4 stars is because the graphics are very hard to view on my Kindle Keyboard."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"This edition is a great addition to any library.

This is a great addition to any library, it is in my opinion one of the greatest literary works of our time. If you are a fan of the Peter Jackson films then you definitively must read Tolkien's pages upon pages that burst alive with so much more detail and vibrancy than any film could possibly portray. And I say that as a rather big fan of the films. The complete volumes in short is a masterpiece.Seller was very gracious as well and I am a satisfied customer. Keep it up =)"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"The voice acting was unappealing and often contrary to what one expected from several of the characters in this masterpiece. It should have been recorded in a professional recording studio; whereas, it seemed to be a recording from an on stage play. I would not recommend it for anyone expecting any entertainment value out of it."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","review":"I've sent this \\"The Lord of the Rings: Trilogy\\" back twice now because both time what I received was a full cast dramatization, which typically means that it's abridged. I listened to quite a few audio books by now, all unabridged, and I don't think one of them was under ten hours. This trilogy is 10.5 hours for all three books. So unless they have changed the advertisement, and you want a full unabridged reading of The Lord of the Rings, this particular product is NOT unabridged, it is very much abridged."},{"Title":"In Search of the Christ-Sophia: An Inclusive Christology for Liberating Christians","review":"Jann Aldredge-Clanton delivers in this encompassing book. She is scholarly and inspiring at once and reawakened a spirituality based in the Christ figure that I'd lost in patriarchal christianity. Worth every cent and any wait in receiving!"},{"Title":"In Search of the Christ-Sophia: An Inclusive Christology for Liberating Christians","review":"The search for Christ has continued for the last 2000 years. It started on that famed Easter Sunday when Mary Magdalene, Salome and Mary (mother of James) went to the empty tomb. Since that day the search for the risen Christ has never stopped. Some say they have found Christ, but their announcement is often greeted with the same skepticism that these three women encountered: \\"The apostles did not believe the women for their words seem like nonsense.\\" (Luke 24:11) Jann Aldredge-Clanton writes that she has found Christ in Sophia. Sophia is the term for the feminine, incarnate, personified Wisdom of God.Jann's Sophia Christology seeks to \\"save Christianity from an exclusively masculine divine image\\" and she desires to resurrect an image that can hold divine masculinity and divine femininity in equal balance. Her metaphorical use of \\"Sophia-Christ\\" represents a feminine symbol for God's presence and the saving actions of Jesus. Recovering this metaphor means developing a Christology less restricted by gender. This is a Christology that replaces the exclusive masculine gender concept of God. This is liberating approach for understanding Jesus Christ, especially for women, who, with this Christology, can equally represent and reflect Jesus.The resurrection of Christ is critical to Jann's \\"Sophia Christology.\\" For Jann there is no Christian faith without the resurrection, and the resurrection is more than an event, the resurrection \\"proclaims the presence of God alive in the world today.\\"Her Christology is not new, for \\"Wisdom Christology\\" predates the more traditional Son of God and Logos Christologies. What is refreshingly interesting is how she weaves \\"Wisdom Christology\\" into a strong feminist Christology. However interesting this maybe it is still sexist. A feministic \\"Christology\\" places gender at the forefront of understanding God, thus, it too distorts our ability to move beyond seeing God through the eyes of gender.From chapter three onward, Jann diverts from Wisdom Christology, and, for the remainder of the book, she propagates a feminist theology. Her sections are titled: Jesus' Feminist Actions, Jesus' Feminist Words, Jesus' Feminist Inclusiveness, Feminist Biblical Interpretation, A Feminist Vision of Ministry etc. Though the remaining chapters are informative and engaging those who buy the book to learn more about Wisdom Christology will find themselves shortchanged (Aidan O'Boyle's, \\"Towards a Contemporary Wisdom Christology\\" is a thorough treatment on this subject). The book lacks an index of names and index of subjects. Still, Jann Aldredge-Clanton has given us a fresh interesting Christology. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Healthy Digestion the Natural Way: Preventing and Healing Heartburn, Constipation, Gas, Diarrhea, Inflammatory Bowel and Gallbladder Diseases, Ulcers, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and More","review":"This book was the answer to all of my stomach problems. Dr. Berkson's book addressed my problem and then offered solutions. I tried the recommendations and within 3 weeks, I was feeling so much better. My particular problem has been ongoing for about 3 or 4 years. After trying over the counter products for years, I did as Dr. Berkson suggested...started drinking a lot more water, eating yogurt, taking glutamine, fiber pills, and Vitamin B1. I added this to my regimen of exercise, multi-vitamins, vitamin E, vitamin C, Folic Acid, and Calcium. The results are that I feel and look so much better. I have gained some of my weight back, I have more energy to deal with everyday life stresses, and as an added bonus, my skin looks much better. I just cannot express how much reading Dr. Berkson's book has changed my life and health for the better. I have also started drinking a caffeine free substitute for regular coffee called 'soyffee' which I came across on the net at www.S oy c off e e.c om.

Take your pick of ailments and treatments. The author offers all you could wish for. If you suffer from IBS, go right to chapter 14.

This is the first book that helps me understand why all my other attempts to heal myself have failed. I now get how to take vitamins, home tests for my digestion, and perform home cleansing and rebuilding programs that will make the rest of my healing attempts work.

It is packed absolutely chock full with great, easy to understand information about digestion, the mind-gut connection, and various digestive diseases. I know \\"natural medicine\\" seems crunchy granola and therefore easy to dismiss, but logic (and many well-designed studies) make many of the recommendations in this book hard to refute, and definitely worth trying. As someone who has been to dozens of traditional doctors and has still not found relief for my gut, being given more information and options for treating these distressing problems is a godsend and not to be sneezed at. However, after reading it cover-to-cover, I still have questions.My main issue: I have symptoms of several of the problems talked about in the book, and unfortunately the treatments for these problems are often contradictory. I really should eat more yogurt and other cultured products for the beneficial flora--unless I have candidiasis or a food allergy. I should eat whole grains for the fiber--unless I'm allergic or have candidiasis. I should drink water right before I go to bed--unless I have reflux. The list goes on and on. I have NO IDEA which of my stomach problems I should tackle first and which things I can try for one problem that won't significantly worsen another problem. I find I'm so confused that I really want to visit the clinic that Ms. Berkson talks about working at, but she gives no contact info in the book and I was unable to find anything online. Barring that, I would have really appreciated some information for how to FIND a clinic like that one, or a doctor who will work with me to find holistic and natural remedies.Having said that, I still think this book is an excellent resource that is well-written, well-organized, and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Healthy Digestion the Natural Way: Preventing and Healing Heartburn, Constipation, Gas, Diarrhea, Inflammatory Bowel and Gallbladder Diseases, Ulcers, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and More","review":"Finally a helpful book anyone can understand.

Baker. The main characters are Princess Emma, her mother, Grassina (Emma's aunt), Prince Eadric, and Emma's grandmother. There are also many settings, just to name a few; Emma's castle, the swamp, a sea inside a little fish bowl, a town inside a picture, and the dragon Olympics.In The Frog Princess, the clumsy Princess Emeralda (Emma for short) runs to the swamp so she won't have to meet her spouse- to- be, Prince Jorge. In the swamp she meets Eadric, a prince turned into a frog. She kisses Eadric so he will turn into a prince again, or so he says, but instead of him turning back into a prince Emma turns into a frog! In the end both Emma and Eadric returned back to their normal selves with a little help from their animal friends.Dragon's Breath picks up after they have been turned back to their normal selves. Emma and Eadric's second adventure starts when her aunt Grassina asks them to look for four things for a spell, \\"a gossamer hair from mother-of-pearl, the breath of a dragon green, a feather from an aged horse, and the husk of a magic bean\\". She wants these things because she fell in love with a man her mother did not approve of, who than turned him into an otter. Incidentally, Grassina, her mother, and Emma are all witches. Grassina must have all those things before time runs out, and her boyfriend forgets he's a human. So Eadric and Emma go to some pretty strange places to look for them. To top it all off, Emma's country is having a war with their neighboring country over the fact that Emma won't marry Prince Jorge and therefore not giving him half of her lands.I think anyone who loves animals will love this book! It has a great adventure and lots of animals to help Emma and Eadric. Also, Emma's spells contain some interesting language. Here's an example: \\"You don't want us in your belly. We'll taste bad like stinging jelly. Turn around and head straight back. We would make a lousy snack.\\" In some of her other spells there are more similes. I liked this book so much I read it in about two to three days. One thing that I like about the book is that the main character is named Emma just like me! I really hope I have convinced you to read Dragon's Breath but here is one idea, you might want to read The Frog Princess first. Happy Reading!!!"},{"Title":"Dragon's Breath (Tales of the Frog Princess)","review":"The novel is a sequel to the &quot;Frog Princess,&quot; and that novel should be read first to understand the characters. Princess Emeralda, her friend Prince Eadric, and her aunt Grassina (the Green Witch) discover the ingredients needed to reverse the spell that turned the man Grassina loved into an otter. The problem is the fact that the spell requires a hair from mother-of-pearl, the husk of a magic bean, a horse feather, and the breath of a green dragon. Most of the novel deals with the adventures of Emeralda and Eadric as they go on a quest seeking the items. Along the way they acquire some dragon friends. And they need to hurry, as the army of an adjoining kingdom is preparing to invade the country.The events come out a little different than planned. Grassina is not entirely sure she still wants Haywood whom she has not seen in human form for 20 years. Emeralda's grandmother is interferring, as she has never thought Haywood was good enough for Grassina - the reason she turned him into an otter. Things become complicated because some spells have hidden features that are unknown until activated. Also, you do have to be careful what you wish for, or you may get unwanted results.As usual with fairy tales, the hero or heroine (in this case) prevail in the end."},{"Title":"Dragon's Breath (Tales of the Frog Princess)","review":"One of the best fantasy books I've ever read, Dragons Breath has adventure with dragons, singing swords, ghosts and curses, which sets it apart from your average fairy tale with the fairy godmother, the price always saving the princess and slaying the dragon.

And even worse her grandmother sent Haywood to some hidden place and within at least four days if Grassina doesn't find him he will forget he was ever human! Well at least they try to fix it anyway. Unless you wouldn't call jumping in a fish bowl, going to a magic market, meeting a retired horse short of hearing that lives in a cave at the top of a mountain, and going to the Dragon Olympics not trying. Emma also takes the time to get a better hold on her magic. And Eadric takes his time to get a better hold on Emma!They do their job, but does Grassina? As her job as the Green Witch, she is always supposed to save the kingdom when it's in danger, but she thinks finding Haywood is more important. Will she be putting the kingdom in jeopardy? Emma starts to worry, because if her aunt doesn't come soon Greater Greenwald's army, led by her father, will have to fight, or she'll have to marry Prince Jorge! (Which does NOT please Eadric!)So can they get all the ingredients? Will Grassina find Haywood in time? Well you'll have to read the book to find out, 'casue I'm not telling! But I can guarantee you'll have a blast reading it!P.S. It's easier to understand if you've read the first book \\"The Frog Pincess\\".

This is a Penguin Classic, reprinted in 2008 from the original in 1927. It presents seven inspiring Negro sermons in verse.A thought-provoking statement comes from the Forward: \\"African Americans are the only people in the whole world and history who really practice Christianity.\\" No one else has ever found in their hearts the gift of forgiveness, the Forward claims. African Americans forgave the slave owners who worked them without payment for 240 years. This ability to forgive made many former slave owners uneasy, so incomprehensible was their forgiveness.These transplanted Africans accepted Jesus as their savior and laid all their worries on him. God's trombones--the old time Negro preachers--were powerful, eloquent figures in their community. A community surviving on hope. When the lyricists wrote, \\"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot, coming for to carry me home,\\" neither the singer nor the audience had to tax their imagination to consider death a sweet chariot or to doubt that heaven was their destination. When the folk-sermon was in full swing, a rhythmic dance to the beat of powerful voice, an electric current passed through the congregation.You don't want to miss these seven poetic sermons."},{"Title":"God's trombones: Seven Negro sermons in verse","review":"Whether you are a Christian or not, black or not, spiritual or not, this book will enter your soul and shake you sideways."},{"Title":"God's trombones: Seven Negro sermons in verse","review":"Johnson uses the quality of poetry to make the sermons come alive and to share his religious views."},{"Title":"God's trombones: Seven Negro sermons in verse","review":"I appreciate the opportunity to make this book a part of my collection of books.

I have directed student perfomances of this deeply moving African American text. \\"The Crucifixion,\\" for example, tells the story of how Jesus Christ, my Lord, my Savior,my Friend, suffered death on an old cross so that I might have an opportunity to be more sensitive to the hurting. The \\"Prodigal Son\\" urges me to experience and, thus understand, that I must live with a redemptive consiousness. And, of course, I am compelled to understand, through the poem \\"Go Down Death\\" this reality: God does call His children home. Those who have suffered \\"long in the vineyard\\" are deserving of rest. For sure, God's Trombones is a poetic tribute to an experience that is Christian and African American.

I did so because I had read not long before, thanks to the Amazon.com VINE program, a much more recent collection of scholarly essays. That collection is called THE HARLEM RENAISSANCE REVISITED. {SeeThe Harlem Renaissance Revisited: Politics, Arts, and Letters} It is edited by Professor Jeffrey O. G. Ogbar of the University of Connecticut.Over and over I read Essay (Chapter) Number Eight by McKinley Melton, a doctoral candidate at the University of Massachusetts. Its title: \\"Speak It Into Existence: James Weldon Johnson's GOD'S TROMBONES and the Power of Self-Definition in the New Negro Harlem Renaissance\\" (pp. 109 - 126). That essay persuaded me to read Johnson for myself. I am glad I did.According to Melton, a key goal of the very self-conscious New Negro Harlem Renaissance (NNHR) was to \\"let the Negro speak for himself\\" (p.109). But New Negro writers could not just parrot Henry Ford's dictum that \\"history is bunk.\\" Black writers could not, that is, turn their backs on black history and start \\"writing black\\" from scratch. But how do this without repeating the stereotype of black folks as either figures of fun or profoundly to be pitied for their sufferings?In 1927 James Weldon Johnson found a key example of Negro creative, assimilative culture for himself to investigate and to glorify: the old-time negro American Protestant preacher and his \\"song sermons.\\"Imagine a West African \\"griot\\" (teller of folk tales and folk histories). He is captured, shipped to America, sold into slavery. His master exposes him to Christian teaching and history. The Americanized griot is converted to Protestant Christianity and then retells the ancient stories of Israel as he heard them in the King James English translation.The result is the Negro American song sermon -- \\"a new art form\\" drawing on West African \\"rhythm, melody, chant, mime, and dramatic impersonation\\" (p. 110). The black Protestant song sermon is a high Negro cultural contribution to America and the world.In the seven sermons and a prayer of GOD'S TROMBONES James Weldon Johnson, using standard English rather than dialect,\\" tries, successfully in my opinion, to capture elements of Negro preaching rhetoric and theater. All done meditatively, prayerfully, and briefly.Take, for instance, the final sermon, \\"The Judgment Day.\\" Time is finally up for the people of earth. Earth will be destroyed by fire. God summons Gabriel and tells him to trumpet the end time into existence.\\"And the wicked like lumps of lead will start to fall,Headlong for seven days and nights they'll fall,Plumb into the big, black, red-hot mouth of hell,Belching out fire and brimstone.And their cries like howling, yelping dogs,Will go up with the fire and smoke from hell,But God will stop his ears.Too late, sinner! Too late!Good-bye, sinner! In hell!Beyond the reach of the love of God.\\"Take this little book and eat it up.

A novelist, poet, songwriter, diplomat, educator, and activist, he left behind a towering legacy when he died in 1938. An essential part of that legacy is &quot;God's Trombones,&quot; a book in which Johnson pays poetic tribute to the &quot;old-time Negro preacher.&quot;&quot;God's Trombones&quot; contains seven poems, each of which is inspired by the art of the classic African-American sermon. Most of Johnson's poems retell Bible stories. &quot;The Creation,&quot; &quot;Noah Built the Ark,&quot; &quot;Let My People Go,&quot; and more--each one carries the reader to the traditional Black churches of Johnson's era. In his preface Johnson discusses the cultural significance of the traditional African-American religious orator and also reflects on his own literary strategies in the construction of these poems.Johnson's poems beg to be read aloud. Whatever your own ethnic heritage or religious inclination, try giving voice to these masterworks: you'll be amazed at the effect. If you are a lover of Christian inspirational writing, a scholar of African-American culture, or a person who appreciates great poetry, &quot;God's Trombones&quot; would make a fine addition to your library."},{"Title":"God's trombones: Seven Negro sermons in verse","review":"Many times I have used the poems from this book as dramatic readings and audiences have always responded in positive ways.

It never goes out of date."},{"Title":"God's trombones: Seven Negro sermons in verse","review":"James Weldon Johnson (1871 -- 1938) is best-known as the author of \\"Lift Every Voice and Sing,\\" the \\"Negro National Anthem\\" written in 1900 for Lincoln's birthday. Johnson had extraordinary gifts as a poet. His celebration of the African-American preacher in God's Trombones, published in 1927, is a masterpiece of American poetry.Johnson was inspired to write \\"God's Trombones: Seven Negro Sermons in Verse \\" after hearing a stirring African-American preacher in Kansas City in 1918. Johnson wrote seven free-verse poems on biblical themes to capture the rhythm, content, language and religious commitment of the African-American preacher. Johnson also wrote a celebrated prose introduction to the book in which he described the place of the preacher in African-American life and explained his decision not to use dialect in writing the poems. Johnson also explained why he used the trombone as the guiding figure of his poem. Johnson wrote of his experience with the Kansas City preacher:\\"He strode the pulpit up and down in what was actually a very rhythmic voice, a voice -- what shall I say? -- not of an organ or a trumpet, but rather of a trombone, the instrument possessing above all others the power to express the wide and varied range of emotions encompassed by the human voice -- and with greater amplitude. He intoned, he moaned, he pleaded, -- he blared, he crashed, he thundered. ... [T]he emotional effect upon me was irresistable.\\"The poetry opens with a short preliminary call to prayer, \\"Listen, Lord\\" followed by the seven sermons. The sermons open with the preacher's account of \\"The Creation\\"; and they conclude with a sermon on the end of days, \\"The Judgment Day\\". Four of the remaining poems deal with Biblical subjects, \\"The Prodigal Son\\", \\"Noah Built the Ark\\", \\"The Crucifixion\\", and \\"Let my People Go\\", the story of the Exodus from Egypt. The remaining sermon \\"Go down death -- a Funeral Sermon\\" is a meditation on the death of an elderly woman in Georgia who, in the preacher's language, is carried by Death to the throne of Jesus. The poems are in free verse, move in an elevated and lively style, include vivid imagery, and a sense of rhythmic speech and propulsion. It is useful to read them aloud. The poems make use effective use of repetition. Look at \\"The Crucifixion\\", for example, and see the many different adjectives Johnson applies to the figure of Jesus. The opening lines of the first three stanzas alone refer to \\"my gentle Jesus\\", \\"my burdened Jesus\\" and \\"my sorrowing Jesus\\". Each of the poems conclude with a short and effective exhortation to the listener. Thus, in the final words of the final poem, \\"The Judgment Day\\":\\"Sinner, oh sinner,Where will you stand,In that great day when God's a-going to rain down fire?\\"These poems are short and the book can be read quickly. But they will have a long-lived impact on the reader. This book would make an excellent introduction to poetry for young people. And Johnson has given a lasting and eloquent treatment to the art and spirit of the African-American preacher."},{"Title":"God's trombones: Seven Negro sermons in verse","review":"I read this book two years ago as a freshman in college. The poems touched me so much that I still continue to read them. Through this book James Weldon Johnson has retold familar Bible stories in a new light.

I would highly reccomend this book to people of all ages and all backgrounds!"},{"Title":"God's trombones: Seven Negro sermons in verse","review":"God's Trombones is a beautiful expression of the themes of the Southern black experience and God's constant, personal presence in their lives. The themes he chose were expressed in sermons and in Gospel music. For the black person, God was aware of their struggles, would bring them out of \\"Egypt\\" (slavery) and would eventually take them to their home \\"over Jordan\\". Death would be a gentle freedom for those who were weary (as in \\"Go down Death\\").Johnson's introduction explains that he was trying to express the fervant Southern black preacher with his pauses and emphases. He has done both well.This is a book to be read for its beauty and inspiration, but more important, it shows (theological inaccuracies aside) how an oppressed people trusted in God's gentle hand, and God's constant love for even the \\"least\\" of his Creation.I recommend this for historians, teachers, lovers of poetry, and for its spiritual content, anyone seeking inspiration."},{"Title":"God's trombones: Seven Negro sermons in verse","review":"My dad teaches Sunday School and was looking for this book to incorporate into his lesson plans. I found it here at Amazon and fell in love with this book. Absolutely wonderful to read and very profound. Exceptional!"},{"Title":"God's trombones: Seven Negro sermons in verse","review":"When I was a youngster, we all knew of these poems. \\"The Creation\\" was, in fact, a standard part of the 10th-grade English curriculum and was one of the most often selected pieces for what was then called \\"dramatic recitation.\\" (This was in Oklahoma, Alabama and South Carolina in the late 1950's and early 1960's.)Now I cannot find anyone much under the age of 50 who has ever heard of them. This is but one of a great many tragic cultural losses of our time.The poems evoke those trombone-like voices of Black preachers ringing with their simple themes, imaginative colorations, and powerful deliveries contrasting the pain of mortal life with the glory and joy of the eternal one. With their plaints and affirmations, their truths and contradictions, they embody a crucial aspect of the American heritage.Moving? \\"Powerful\\" hardly expresses it. When I first acquired the book, I read to my wife the poem, \\"Go Down Death -- A Funeral Sermon.\\" We were in the car on the way home from the bookstore.

I honestly feel that these poems/sermons are a must read for everyone, REGARDLESS of there heritage."},{"Title":"God's trombones: Seven Negro sermons in verse","review":"James Weldon Johnson's \\"God's Trombones\\" is a tour de force of literature. Unfortunately this EDITION gets only one star - it does great disservice to Johnson's great work.This book has undergone great violence in this Penguin Classics edition (2008). It suffers from several defects:1. The book has been published as part of Penguin's \\"African American Classics\\" series, and the Foreward (Penguin's spelling) by Henry Louis Gates, Jr. (General Editor) takes away from the power of Johnson's own Preface. This Foreward drifts far away from Johnson's work. Johnson was a great pioneer in race relations in the USA, but \\"God's Trombones\\" is not a book about race - it's a book about the Black preachers Johnson heard in his youth and his homage to them. By narrowing the book into the genre of \\"Black literature\\" it takes away its significance as simply a great piece of American literature.2. Maya Angelou's additional Foreward is simplistic and attempts to frame Johnson's poems in the context of slavery and the Black experience that resulted from slavery. The problem with this is that Johnson himself - in his excellent Preface that fortunately is still in this edition - doesn't frame his poems that way. Johnson mentions slavery in one sentence of his Preface; Angelou wants us to think the poems are about a subject - slavery - rather than people - the great black preachers of Johnson's time.3. The wonderful illustrations - which were tipped into the original publication in 1927 - are poorly reproduced, appearing to be low-quality scans of previous paperback editions. The pixilating of the images is unfortunate.4. Penguin has laid out the poems anew, taking away Johnson's original layout. Presumably this was necessary because of the addition of the Forewards by Gates and Angelou as well as several pages of Penguin advertisements in the back of the book made the book too long. Alas.What to do:1. Buy a copy of the original 1927 hard bound edition, published by The Viking Press. Copies are available on used book websites such as abebooks.com, and on amazon.com from time to time. A bonus is that the lettering in the book by C. B. Falls is in color - yellow - in this early edition - color gives a new dimension to reading the poems. The tipped in illustrations by Aaron Douglas are superb. This and the other editions below contain only Johnson's words - no contemporary contextualization\\" by Gates or Angelou.2. Buy a copy of the 1969 paperback edition, also published by The Viking Press (Viking Compass Edition). It is in most respects faithful to the 1927 edition except the drawings are no longer tipped in (although they are nicely reproduced), and the poem names are in black rather than yellow. The layout is the same as the original 1927 edition.3. Buy a copy of the 1976 or 1999 Penguin paperback edition. These editions preserve Johnson's layout and font for the poems, although the text is in a smaller type size and the drawings are also smaller. It also includes a short introductory paragraph, typical of modern Penguin Classics editions; this introduction contains some biographical information about JohnsonIn short, Penguin has done readers a disservice with this 2008 edition. Johnson's poems - and his Preface - are masterpieces. Fortunately, older editions are still widely available. Most of the reviews of \\"God's Trombones\\" were written before this new Penguin edition. I have given the book 1 star to bring the flaws in the new edition to the attention of potential buyers. But Johnson's book deserves 1000 stars. If only Penguin had left it to speak for itself."},{"Title":"God's trombones: Seven Negro sermons in verse","review":"This is a wonderful work of poetry written by a man who has been forgotten so much over the years.
